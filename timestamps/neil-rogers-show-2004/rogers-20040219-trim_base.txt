[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]
Stop, get me fired up when I hear someone say that.

[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.180]
Welcome back to the Willie Williams Show on 560 WL on Y.

[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.900]
Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie.

[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.320]
Will you be Willie of the State?

[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.340]
No, I thought it was Willie.

[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.340]
It is Willie of Oran.

[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.560]
Now let's go.

[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.540]
Willie Williams.

[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.840]
Willie Williams.

[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.120]
Willie Williams.

[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.700]
Willie Williams.

[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.640]
Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie.

[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.300]
Willie of Oran.

[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.540]
Hey, how are you?

[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.040]
What are you doing?

[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.100]
What are you doing?

[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.320]

[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.540]
The middle of the tree is turning the eye.

[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.860]
Yeah, there is something to do with it.

[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.800]
Oh, Willie, Willie.

[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.320]
Yeah, the Christmas is with those big black shoes.

[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.060]
And with black shoes?

[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.240]
I don't understand.

[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.860]
Yeah, like in those Mike Mazzaki movies.

[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.640]
Oh, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie.

[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.500]
Oh, Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie.

[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.040]
Willie, Willie, Willie, Willie.

[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.240]
10-0-1 at 560 WQM.

[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.200]
Happy Thursday to you.

[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.400]
Boy, do we have a lot of votes on that poll yesterday or what?

[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.000]
Yes.

[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.160]
19.

[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.700]
Look at this.

[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.740]
There's a third page coming.

[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.020]
Uh-oh.

[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.620]
1924 vote.

[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.260]
Who is or was the hottest female celebrity of all time we asked?

[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.000]
Before we get to that, we've got some bad news.

[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.520]
Because you won't be hearing too much about it.

[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.500]
Because it's not news anymore.

[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.600]
They just put it on her for about two seconds and that's it.

[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.400]
Another statistic.

[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.200]
Roadside bomb kills two more American soldiers and one Iraqi.

[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.540]
I thought we'd care about them Iraqi.

[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.900]
It's only crawl worthy now.

[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.140]
A roadside bomb today, this morning killed two US soldiers and one Iraqi near Caldia.

[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.260]
West Baghdad, a coalition military spokesman said, attack happened about 10-30 Baghdad time,

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.340]
which means 2-30 in the morning our time.

[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.200]
Two more dead American soldiers.

[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.520]
Just mention that because like I said, they're not getting too much airplay because they got bigger fish to fry.

[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.020]
Like that little dwarf show on Fox.

[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.720]
What did the wolf?

[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.100]
Yeah, what a horse.

[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.820]
Things like that.

[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.540]
Important stuff.

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.240]
Another bad story.

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.800]
Rams leading to the four-letter-day Al-Hollywood International Airport were closed for several hours after woman jumped to her death from the I-595 this morning.

[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.520]
The Eastbound I-595 ramp and the Southbound Federal Highway ramps were closed around 6-30 this morning when a woman threatened to jump from the interstate to the Federal Highway.

[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.520]
15 minutes later, guess what she did?

[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.040]
Jump.

[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.660]
Yes.

[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.260]
The BS is investigating the ramps since it's been reopened.

[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.460]
So the ramps are reopened, but she's still dead. That's the bad news. She jumped.

[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.660]
Now let's get to the results of that poll because we got a lot of fish to fry here today.

[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.680]
I'll tell you that in line 9 is ringing right off the bat.

[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.920]
QAM, line 9.

[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.380]
Hello.

[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.800]
Like I said, even more than yesterday's first call, wasn't it?

[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.820]
Well, how was that hard to beat?

[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.480]
Well, I caught them off balance. They weren't expecting somebody to answer. It was just a test run. It was like a dry run.

[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.780]
That's the way they were ringing the line.

[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.260]
Or maybe they were calling for the Joe Roe show, you think?

[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.680]
That's probably right.

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.740]
Certainly a possibility.

[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.500]
When they heard my voice, they just scattered, man. Holy cowards him. It's that thing.

[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.140]
WQAM, hello.

[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.360]
Hello, Neil.

[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.860]
I've got one more for you, Liz. If you want to take it.

[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.600]
One more for you. Yes, today's list. No, I don't have anything.

[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.460]
I have one more, two and a coal-eggard. I don't understand what's wrong with you.

[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.780]
You had sexual people out there in a coal-eggard. Beats the pants off.

[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.620]
And most of the people on this list, she's the hot.

[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.620]
The hot.

[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.280]
The hot.

[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.620]

[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.140]
The hot.

[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.140]
The hot.

[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.700]
The hot.

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.920]

[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.120]
The hot.

[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.200]

[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.440]

[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.580]
The hot.

[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.580]

[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.640]
The hot.

[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.820]

[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.120]
The hot.

[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.120]

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.200]

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.200]

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.200]

[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.560]
The hot.

[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.460]
The hot.

[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.040]
The hot.

[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.640]
The hot.

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.640]
The hot.

[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.320]
The hot.

[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.320]

[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.500]
The hot.

[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.580]
The hot.

[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.280]
The hot.

[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.420]
The hot.

[00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:10.620]
I think they found something happy about this.

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.620]

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.580]
different on there we'll put the other picture of Nicole of Sharon Stone. Nicole Ston.

[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.740]
Nicole Ston. No, I like the other one. It is a good picture. I mean this one's fine but the

[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.160]
other one doesn't have the little veil. Hillary Duff who just turned five years old got 52 votes.

[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.160]
Charlize Theron 56. Some of high act 55. Now that shocked the pants off of me. Why is that? I don't

[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.760]
know. She started out from nowhere and came running like a banshee. She's very popular and active,

[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.920]
currently active and a lot of it. Is she active? Well, don't say too much about that though because

[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.560]
when I get to that infinity thing you see how antiseptic radio is going to be pretty soon. In fact,

[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.320]
pretty soon you can put your list of rain right inside the radio. And you can gargle and listen

[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.860]
to the radio at the same time. It'll be like an air sanitizer. Some of high act 55. Catherine

[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.160]
Zita Jones 52. Barbara Eden 46. We're delighted for Barbara. She done that because we love Barbara.

[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.420]
Kim Basin you're 45. Vod Derek and Grace Kelly and Pam Anderson 40 apiece. Well that's bad. The Pam

[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.740]
Anderson is lumped in there with Vod Derek and Grace Kelly. That's almost an American.

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.780]
Carmen Electra 36 Jennifer. Carmen 35 Rita. Hey, we're 34. Should I have 20 to Sofia?

[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.640]
Vagara 29. Alyssa Milano 28. Heather Locklear 27. Beyonce had 26. As did Liz Taylor. I received

[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.040]
the two of them together. No. Same person. El McPherson and Elizabeth Hurley 25 apiece. Ferris

[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.980]
faucet 24. Jane Fonda and a Cornelhoid you 23. Same person. Vanessa Williams and Natalie Wood 21.

[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.560]
Bridget Bardot 20. Demi Moore 18. Tyra Bank 17. Oh, this list goes on forever 15. Each

[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.900]
French leader Jolie and Audrey Hepburn and Jane Seymour. Oh, Jane Seymour 14. For England

[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.640]
Bergman Christie Brinkley and 13. Each for J. Low. Citi Crawford a dozen for Nicole Kidman,

[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.420]
Levin for Jane Mansfield 10. Each for Catherine Nive and Jessica Simpson. A nine apiece for

[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.380]
Diane Lane Goldie-Hahn and Jane Kennedy and Sharon Stone and Drew Barrymore 8 for a Gina Gertian

[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.440]
and Hendela Mar 7 for Phoebe Kato. I love the way we spelled Phoebe. I sure objected

[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.940]
to do that. I'm sure he did. I'm sure he did. Do you see the way spelled Phoebe? No,

[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.800]
I don't know. Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe as in like Phoebe Geebies. Anyway, Phoebe Kato

[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.000]
of her spelled 7 also Beverly Dancelo and Vanity 7. 6 for Julian Neumar, Julia Rubert's,

[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.260]
Uma Thurman and Linda Evans. Cheryl Teigs had five so to end Nicole. Four for Elizabeth Montgomery

[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.880]
Kim Novak-Sherley-Buth-Donna-Reed and Savannah Simpson. Three for Christie McNick. How come Savannah Simpson

[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.200]
got on there? Three for Christie McNick, a Barbara Carrera Janet Jackson, two for Diane Keaton-George,

[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.600]
a Nana Brewster, Kathleen Turner, Gina Lula Brigida Citi, Price and Vanessa Paradis,

[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.280]
Dice, Paradise, Ivanka Borra 1 and out of almost 2,000 votes, Sherri Tade had the big.

[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.720]
Oh, she don't mind. She said she don't really care. You can change her life.

[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.320]
Here's today's poll before we get into this heavy duty stuff. WQA and Hello.

[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.660]
Not there. Good. I like the way this is going so far. Don't you?

[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.040]
That's perfect. So far. Well, I don't have time for a lot of this stuff. WQA and Hello.

[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.520]
Yeah, can I see you can help please? Speaking, yes.

[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.380]
Hey, Neil. How are you doing today? Pretty good. So far.

[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.060]
I have a question about this 9-11 thing that's going on. Well, went on.

[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.960]
I heard that on the morning of September 11th, George Bush's brother was having breakfast with

[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.660]
Osama bin Laden's brother. Is that true, do you? That is correct. Yes.

[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.860]
New boys. What's that? Yeah, that is correct. Okay. Now, how come like none of this stuff is ever

[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.460]
on the news? Because we're too busy showing a little dwarf, so we're going to be on Fox on the

[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:46.560]
little stating show. That's right. Like, I don't I don't understand how none of these things are ever

[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.360]
discussed or like how come it took almost four years for us to really start hearing about Bush

[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.520]
being a wall during his so-called guard duty? How come that took so long? Because everyone's just

[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.880]
stupid and no one talks about anything. Now you got it, man. Now you're starting to catch on.

[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.160]
Welcome to America. All right, man. Good to know you're often pallyed two, three times at least.

[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.840]
Oh, for anybody before I go for ABB, man, anybody by bus you got it. Okay. Good call. Okay.

[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.840]
Here's the poll today. And this I was inspired by this whole Mel Gibson thing. Boy, I got a great

[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.440]
story about Mel Gibson and about his daddy and all kinds of good stuff. He makes me want to puke.

[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.320]
Can I put that for a long time, but you're just I don't know. You know what? I never know. Gibson

[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.320]
personally love Mel Gibson. You go watch Braveheart over it over it. Yeah, I would. I don't care if he

[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.840]
made any good movies. I wouldn't watch it if he gave me by the second. He makes my skin crawl,

[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.600]
Mel Gibson. He's an anxious piece of turd. But anyway, no argue but there's still a bit here's

[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.440]
the question. What's your take on the religious right? And I realize again, just like when we did a

[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.160]
few days ago, there's a lot of slop over here, but maybe it's mostly just to let some of us vent,

[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.900]
including me. I'm so sick and tired of this whole goddamn thing. Oh, there he goes again.

[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.220]
We better find out if I can say that. You know what? And when we get to the infinity thing,

[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:01.060]
you'll find out one thing. John and Mike. Wow. Well, we already knew that. But boy, it's getting

[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:06.980]
really scary. And you want to know why? And of course, all this clamping down allegedly because of

[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:13.160]
one booby on TV, the Super Bowl booby. What's you take on a religious right? You got two, four, six,

[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.060]
seven choices. There's nothing but hate mongering morons. I don't mind them if they leave me alone.

[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.260]
They're the biggest perverts of all. I'm one of them praise God. The whole religion thing is a

[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.620]
big racket. They're full of Shiite or they gave their brains away to fakers. And for some reason,

[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.140]
they wrote Nicole Egard on the bottom here. Well, just because I don't want anybody to miss out.

[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.640]
She should have been on the podium yesterday. Yeah, I apologize personally. Though you people in

[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.580]
the audience should apologize personally for not putting around there. Because I just came across

[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.200]
that movie last night. What was it with the Corey Hayme and Corey Feldman and the colegate?

[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.360]
Don't be knocking Corey Hayme. Okay, he's cute. He just turned 55, but he still looks cute. He's got

[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.840]
Robbie Benson syndrome. Whatever. But anyway, there's a scene in there where they're actually doing it,

[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.400]
stark naked. I mean, they're just banging their brains out. What the hell's the name of that movie?

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.160]
Blow up. Blow up. That's it. Blow something up. Don't say that. Now, watch yourself.

[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.820]
Antonio, if you like anybody in the audience, if you ever cut yourself, we're going to make

[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.460]
everything on radio so antiseptic that instead of only getting some of that shmur on stuff,

[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.240]
all you got to do is put your arm up against your knee or whatever against the radio. And it'll

[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.880]
heal immediately. That's how antiseptic we're going to be. Put that iodine to shame. WJFK,

[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.620]
Washington afternoon drivers, done in Mike, we turned to the National Syndicate Airwaves on Tuesday.

[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.220]
After two week, no pay suspension for saying bullshit on a year without the M reading from it

[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.180]
apparently prewritten heartfelt apology letter followed by the sound of crumpled paper.

[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.780]
Geronimo revealed that he and Mike came perilously close to being fired by infinity. And

[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:46.600]
infinity, according to the New York Post, is just psychotic. They're just foaming at the mouth after

[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:52.060]
big flap with Justin and Janet. So after we do the break, then we'll talk about that a little bit

[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.240]
about Mel Carmeson said this and they've got actually got the copy of the memo. Don't you love that

[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.020]
when people intercept memos? And either put them in a paper, read them on the air, love that's bad.

[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.680]
That's a bad thing. Well, that's right. I forgot that's bad. You might get your ass fired.

[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:09.540]
So don't do it again. Look for the QM van Noonditute today at Senior Astero located in Pember Pine,

facts from he got all boy i'm getting that

[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.620]
he and of course speaking of those right wingers there to be very dismayed

[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.040]
i think it's probably coming propaganda

[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.020]
because the polls change all the time

[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.460]
but this latest u.s.a. today see in gala poll shows now

[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.520]
that if the election were right now

[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.940]
carry beats bush fifty five to forty three by twelve points

[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.200]
and even john edwards the year relatively unknown john edwards is making a move

[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.700]
very fast

[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.620]
even he would be bush today fifty four to forty four by ten points

[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.260]

[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.100]
and

[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.300]
i call this press conference

[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.000]
to allow me the opportunity to speak out

[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.240]
not with regard to legal issues that face michael jackson presently

[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.400]
but to lash out at my sister janits terrible behavior at last sunday super

[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:41.780]
bold

[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.420]
i am as offended as the rest of you regarding her book showing activity during

[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.040]
half time

[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.280]
i am even more upset

[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.480]
that a network

[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.580]
that such a sickening display

[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.900]
get on the air

[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.980]
women are disgusting

[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.180]
specially naked women

[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.480]
people believe that she was actually wearing a pasty

[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.860]
when just in timbre like tore off her clothing

[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.900]
but this is simply not true

[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.160]
i am here to say

[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:14.240]
the very first time on the public airways that my sister janits actually has

[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.060]
a metallic right nipple

[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:21.240]
the fact remains that all of us in the jackson clan are actually space aliens

[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.960]
we came here to earth to study your species

[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.800]

[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.200]

[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.900]

it's just uh... one of those deals you can you cannot be an adult in america

[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.280]
no more you just can

[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.200]
everything has to be reduced to the level of like five-year-old children so

[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.500]
adults have to you know their brain has to be reduced to that level and of course

[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.080]
they figure if they knew that real fast and bush can get in again easy

[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.180]
because that's about the level he operates on

[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.020]
now speaking of the people wait to hear this facts

[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.880]

well start out my morning with the fact that uh... i couldn't hear George

[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.400]
because of the fact that

there's another one of your best bothers okay

[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.800]
maybe that's why that uh... thing about hypocrites is going to move up on our list

[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.040]
right

[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.540]
and anyway

[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.900]
getting back to the oldest thing i already saw about the risk of car crashes

[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.820]
rises with age

[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.560]
see this may come and this is from tampa the story may come as great news to

[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.180]
people around the rest of the country but the soft Florida we don't need no

[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.120]
primer on that

[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.780]
that's right we know all about that again back to this fax about pita please

[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.200]
from david and sentia won't use their last name out of respect although i don't

[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:37.920]
have any for them

[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.060]
it says yesterday i heard you say disparaging remarks about

[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.620]
pita people for the ethical treatment of animals

[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.480]
an organization which my husband and i supported for over two decades how said

[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.480]
and this coming from me being a great animal over that i am so don't give me a

[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.800]
song and it's about how i'm insensitive and i'm hard to ask any idea about

[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.640]
whatever you want it says hard as it says pita simply believe now wait a minute if i

[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.000]
bounce like that is not like excretory activity you're excreting

[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.080]
and disputing gas right but this one from the throat and not feeling

[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.280]
and yeah well that's a sex organ oh that's what does it

[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.980]
you know definitely this morning that you couldn't even get your little

[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.260]
finger

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:19.840]
anyway pita simply believes as we do it as josh shall tell you he heard it he was

[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.980]
a fall on a floor and laughing because he knows it's not true

[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.180]
pita simply believes as we do that no animal should be abused or killed for

[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.660]
any reason like us they're living beings with

[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:32.400]
varying levels of intelligence and sensitivities well i guess i should feel bad

[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.300]
because i had both of my dogs put to sleep they were on the verge of death and i

[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.120]
put them out of the misery had to put to sleep and believe you me there was no

[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.560]
chance that they were going to survive okay so call me a bad guy you're a bad guy

[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.020]
okay i accept that says nila i'm certain you have no idea is to be

[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.000]
tear and torment in which millions of animals exist and then it includes all

[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.640]
species yes i do i have a very good idea right what we blindly do to animals

[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.780]
would not be permitted to tolerate in fact this he's sending this to me we just

[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:02.100]
raised tens of thousands of dollars for abandoned pet rescue for dogs and cats and other

[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.860]
animals that have been turned left on their own in the lurch

[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:11.700]
a no and they're giving me a lecture about the animals anyway what we blindly do to animals

[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.840]
would not be permitted to tolerate it on the most evil of humans Hitler, Dhammer, and that coward

[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.700]
Charlie Manson there'd be a protest by many of our inhumane treatment yet our cruelty to non-humans

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.840]
is excused after all they're only animals so let them lose their souls i wonder if they said

[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.020]
that at Hiroshima and Nagasaki they say that about all the people who we fried no yes there are

[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.480]
literally hundreds of animal rights organizations yet when asked to name one or two most would answer

[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.720]
peda no i wouldn't if that was asked to name a lunatic fringe animal group i would say

[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.320]
peda while some of their actions appear outrageous peda draws attention to the rights of animals

[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.420]
granted sometimes it's over the top oh now since the end of we're starting it close to the truth

[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.580]
however when a volunteer from peda throws the carcass of a dead fox in the face of someone

[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.580]
wearing fur and shouts here's the rest of your coat or protest against the practice of

[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:03.420]
iivisexion on dogs and other animals without benefit vanisthesia or the beaten to death of an

[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.220]
orangutan who started eastwards every which way but lose by its trainer or chickens in fact

[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.000]
reforms having the beaks and faces sliced off while standing in their own extramid and countless

[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.040]
other atrocities were with them well guess what were with them too on some of those

[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.080]
although i'm not too crazy about having somebody throw red fox or a dead fox in my poise right

[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:27.140]
my droid business when peda convinces burger kingdom McDonald's to do more humane methods

[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.820]
regarding farm animals were with them when they work to change the laws regarding circus animal

[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.360]
views were with them when they pointed they proven direct correlation of kids abusing frog

[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:39.140]
steaks cats dogs etc and adult violence were with them when they seek the strongest penalty for

[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:43.220]
someone who steals a family pet to use as a bait animal for their fighting dogs were with them

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:49.020]
we choose compassion over cruelty someone has to stand and speak for the animals peda does not

[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.200]
back down either way sincerely david and sentia well there's some of good points in here but the

[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.880]
fact is the one sentence there branded sometimes it's over the top which it kind of glossed over

[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.840]
that let me circle that even i'm gonna write shmit can this momentarily uh yeah you're right

[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.300]
like that it's very often over the top like when they wanted that town to change its name right

[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:13.000]
what was the name of that town slaughterville slaughterville oh we don't like that slaughterville yeah

[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.100]
and the other happy you probably if the old baseball player for the cardinals in Yankees if he

[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.820]
was still alive enus slaughter they probably would have wanted him to change his last name

[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.400]
although he was known as enus the penis now i'm saying that for the very last time because

[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.300]
oh hey uh hey enus you call that a penis and she said that for the last time too i'll

[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:36.620]
guarantee you that right now so anybody that enjoyed like the Howard Stern show or for

[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.220]
all on a rate any of that stuff forget about it because that's all past say you're not going to

[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.820]
hear it no more because you have a bunch of dictators up there in washman who sit around now and

[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.340]
making everybody crap in their pants they're just oh i said crap against it

[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.640]
sorry making everybody a doodoo to your in their pants no you can't see you're you're

[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.660]
refining you can't even well even a boy scout say i promise to do my duty to do my best

[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.140]
to drive the whole evening across the street whether she wants to go or not just make sure you

[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:09.980]
couch it correctly i see doodoo on the couch right wqam hello hey no yes sir so the website yesterday

[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:17.720]
i'm looking at that picture of uh no more bush read my lips yeah doesn't doesn't turn you straight

[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:23.180]
i don't know what could didn't work for me yet i'm gonna have to you i'll go for you George

[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.500]
let me ask you this what about Nicole Egard i have no idea you don't know who that is

[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.280]
no well we'll put her picture on there one of these days naked and then you'll know and then

[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.540]
then they will fear you man when you know who that is okay all right okay great day pal okay see

[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.640]
they like the naked pictures now that's on the internet of course it's a damn good thing we can't

[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:47.040]
show the naked pictures on around the radio if we look at hold those up and you can actually see

[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.640]
those images on the radio then we'd be in deep trouble not only by you but doodoo i'm showing it

[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.440]
in hd digital are you really and that's right cuz qam work in the digital baby soot and see

[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.040]
that like every little detail on the nipple not forget about the booby right on the old nipple 4.0

[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.300]
megapixels sure and so on and she didn't she didn't do all that great yesterday on our pool i

[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.320]
guess she's old news but then again there were a lot of people on there there were old news and

[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.700]
did very very well but you know there's just something they don't like her for whatever reasons

[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:18.180]
she's a pain in the air yeah exactly so what's wrong with that nothing in fact i think a lot of

[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.600]
people do like a bitch you know like to slap her around a little bit now i'm not suggesting that

[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:27.140]
or advocating that see i have to be right here pull back up you know i'm really glad to see that

[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.660]
that nice young lady the play skicker for Colorado University that got raped at it and then

[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.720]
abused by that coach and rather see that they're interviewing her and they're making a big story

[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.000]
about that because this is one of the real things that's wrong with america i don't hear michael

ten forty five guess what you know that spot we just played a minute ago that is oozing spot

[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:13.000]
Were you paying attention? No, no, of course not. Well, you should have been because there's a very familiar voice in there. Okay, Jerry Howzer. Sorry.

[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:23.140]
Well, it's not that I really knew that, but I looked it up. He played Asky in the summer 42. He does commercials now. He was a chubby, ugly kid that was Asky's, that was Hermes Buddy.

[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.240]
Okay, I don't think I saw that since 42. You didn't see the summer 42? No.

[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:34.820]
You never saw that movie? Like a hundred years ago when I was a child. You got to remember Jennifer O'Neal?

[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:49.320]
I know who she is. And who played Hermi? What was his name? Gary Grimes. Anyway, here's the fact that Mr. Beesults from yesterday's pool. Could you please repeat the top five? Oh, where Charlize Theron finished. I don't have it. Do you? No. I Schmidt can't add a long time.

[00:37:49.320 --> 00:38:06.140]
Oh, my God. Marilyn Manson. Charles Manson. Yeah. Shirley Manson. Shirley. And Hermi and Asky, I think. Sorry about that. I'll look at the waste basket and see if I can piece it together. And if not, maybe I don't want to bother Eric with that. He's under a lot of stress and duress. He's a foaming at the mouth.

[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:17.200]
Jerry Howzer who played Asky in the summer of 42. I'm pretty amazed. I'm pretty impressed with myself. Although the internet, you see that the Google just added four billion more pages? No. You didn't see that?

[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:24.800]
Boy, I tell you, you're just out of the loop, man. You better get back with it. You better stop worrying about things like religious nuts and politics and things like that and about getting late.

[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:39.580]
Where about important things like Google? Ayahu. I don't Google you don't Google Ayahu. I'm a Yahoo. Oh, Jesus. Shame on you. Well, I think that if you use that Alexa bar, I believe that's Google. I'm going to start. I think it is. No, Google's good search engine. I just live my life on Yahoo.

[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:52.740]
I think though if you use that nice Alexa, see I got George to install that this morning. It takes about what 20 seconds. See and there it is. Alexa, you got a nice bar and even has a link. Well, I don't want to say there's a wound on there. Nice Tiki bar.

[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:59.980]
And you could like do emails real fast. So now I can send Eric like 70 80 news stories every day because my email.

[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:11.060]
Because the emailing process is so much easier now. Thanks to Alexa. Anyway, let's get to the I can't put this off no longer. Okay, although I might take one quick call. QA and hello.

[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:19.280]
John, but I get a job by impersonator up yours, man. I probably had a lot of company.

[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:28.940]
Fear or just before Gibson's the passion opens and this is from the work Daily News. I beg your part. The fear of your home at the 45 degree angle.

[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:39.260]
And you have to say just like that with a heavy treminox and then you'll be okay. Maybe maybe we will check your ancestry first.

[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:52.740]
Fear or just before Gibson's the passion opens a week before Mel Gibson's movie about Jesus hits theaters. His father has gone on an explosive rant against Jews claiming they fabricated the Holocaust and are conspiring to take over the world. Jesus Christ.

[00:39:53.360 --> 00:40:05.220]
There after one world religion and one world government, Hutton gives an 85. This is Mel Gibson's daddy. Sit in a radio interview that'll air Monday night. That's why they've attacked the Catholic Church. So strong we do ultimately take control over it by their doctrine.

[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:15.680]
We'll all be eating cheeseblinks is by the end of the year. In the bizarre interview Gibson also said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan should be lynched and called for the government to be overthrown.

[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:28.860]
The movie stars fathers made outrageous statements about the Holocaust and Jewish conspiracies before. But the timing of his latest comments is certain to fuel the upper over his son's movie. The passion of the Christ which opens on As Wednesday next Wednesday.

[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:46.340]
Some critics say the movie blames Jews with the death of Christ and will provoke anti-Semitism and they question why Mel Gibson hasn't denounced his father's views. Hutton gives and spoke Monday to Steve Furesd, the enough speaker piece on WSNR 620 AM in New York, a show syndicated by talkline, the largest syndicator of Jewish programming.

[00:40:46.340 --> 00:41:07.800]
Some of his most outrageous rants focused on the millions of Jews exterminated by Hitler. They claimed there were 6.2 million Jews in Poland before the war and they claimed after the war there were only 200,000. Therefore he must have killed 6 million of them. He said they simply got up and left. They were all over the Bronx and Brooklyn and Sydney, Australia and Los Angeles. He said the Germans didn't have enough gas to cremate 6 million people.

[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:16.320]
I'll check what the people at Bayer I think he's wrong and that the concentration camps were just work camps. It's all maybe not all-fishing but most of it is he said.

[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:24.480]
Gibson repeatedly smeared prominent Jews as money-grubbing power-mongers. Green Span tells us what to do is someone should take him out and hang him, he said.

[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.700]
He even belittled the Pope's reported endorsement of the passion recounting how Mel referred to the pontiff as an ass.

[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:40.840]
Well, I was starting to get a little bit warm. Gibson reserved most of his vitriol for Judaism, no asking is the Jews to actively anti-Christian. He is for by being a Jew, his anti-everyone else.

[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:52.740]
Mel Gibson's spokesman, Alan Nehrab, had no comment of the elder Gibson's tirade but Abraham Foxman of the anti-diffamation league said they were the words of a classical anti-Semite. If it wasn't so sad it would be funny, he said.

[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:59.860]
He's troubled by Mel Gibson's fate or the condemns father's beliefs and pointed out to a recent interview where Mel Gibson said his daddy never lied to him.

[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:06.340]
Well, he's been lying to the world but it sounds like truth to the sun. That strange Foxman said isn't duh, huh?

[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.800]
Isn't duh passion of duh Christ? What is this thing here?

[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:22.320]
If you missed any coverage of this, please excuse my end up this. The nation, Matt Pivens exposed little mistrees and encoder. It was on our website yesterday, Mr. Outraged.

[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:36.100]
I don't understand. It was, they keep fencing us stuff that on our website. If you go to neo-arages.com you'll discover that I mean we can't have everything on here. We can't be on top of everything. We appreciate the fact that it's the letters no and if we already have it, that's fine. We can shirk can it.

[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:44.680]
But Jesus Christ, we don't know about that article a little mistriezened by Matt Pivens. It was on it. It was the nation yesterday. We had it on our website. Thank you.

[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:57.020]
And he ripped her a big fat. I can't say yes. I think we can still say. I think you have to say bottom. He ripped her a big bottom. There you go. A foggy bottom.

[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:10.580]
So anyway, there's Hutton Gibson whose Mel Gibson's daddy. Now we get to the real meat of the matter on the platter. Don't splatter. Christian pushed behind the passion. This is a great article. It was in the Toronto Sonia. The Toronto star yesterday.

[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.380]
WDQM. Hello.

[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:26.060]
Hello, Neil. Yes sir. Thanks for taking my call. I'm glad you talked about Mel Gibson today. I read an interview yesterday by a member of the clergy. He's seen a private screening. The movie where Mel was there.

[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:39.440]
They asked him why he had all the people in the movie speaking aramaic or Latin. And Gibson said that he thought that those languages would be more threatening for the villains that they was just making them more menacing.

[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:53.000]
You know, this type of movie. It doesn't have anything to do with him trying to faithfully adapt the story from the Bible. It's just just the end of it. He's just trying to make it as salacious and as provocative as possible to stir up the emotions of everybody.

[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.740]
That's a lot of good religious hate, which is what religion does best anyway.

[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:03.500]
Absolutely right. Well, thanks for trying to get this article from the Toronto star man. It'll flip your lid.

[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:10.160]
He's just a figure of a whack at you. It's bad. Amen. Have a great day, pal. You took. I'll see you in church.

[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:16.920]
Gibson read in the Mel Gibson recently embraced a fringe form of Catholicism known even George didn't know this as traditionalism.

[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:27.460]
That I never heard of till I read this article in the star yesterday of faction that refuses to acknowledge the reforms of the second Vatican Council in 65, which absolved the Jews for the killing of Christ.

[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.960]
He don't accept that traditionalism, which means all throughout fanatical Catholic is Mel Gibson.

[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:41.260]
Right. Even the Pope is an ass, he said, which I would agree with. We can find one area of agreement. It doesn't just growly enough for a bottom is what he said.

[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:48.660]
Mel is the top. The Pope is the bottom. He just can't wait for a date. He said it'll be great. And then you won't have to well.

[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:54.380]
Christian push behind the passion. Don't start. Listen, I'm telling you right now. Don't don't play fast and loose with this.

[00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:02.060]
I'm better get that I say than you are posting. Unlike the other stuff I smit can. I think I did about me. I heard it.

[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:09.340]
In fact, maybe I'll to read you that one sentence again from Mel Carmes in the infinity. Any station in the course. This is not an infinity station.

[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:16.080]
Thank you. God. They got held a lot more balls than the beesleys ever will dream of having just that the beesleys are like that.

[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.140]
So they have no idea what we're doing. Any station airing programming that is any sexual or extrovertory content.

[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:30.580]
Needs to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that the programming is not even arguably indecent to them all from Mel Carmes and said to all new community.

[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:41.280]
These are I was managed. Nip it. Nip it. Nip it in the bud. Don't say nips either. All we can see. Sure and stones nips on our website. I think they're exempt. Are they?

[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:49.200]
No, they're not not no more. They used to be. See that's what Janet Jackson that the sports guys used to be exempt. They could say whatever they want. But no.

[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:58.760]
Can they so rape the female players in the locker room? Yeah, so far that's okay. All right. We haven't had a ruling from here. Heinrich Michael Paul yet.

[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:07.660]
This is going to take me. What is the long article? But I don't care. Very very important. Christian push behind the passion. This is by Christopher Hutzel.

[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:14.540]
Entertainment writer for the Toronto star. Jesus fell to be used to convert non Christians. Canadian Jewish leaders cautious expect no troubles.

[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:21.200]
The time the timeline leading up to the release of Mel Gibson's the passion of the Christ might be compared to the fuse of a firecracker.

[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:29.580]
Spitting and sparking chasing its own fire retail in a maelstrom of hype. And the world can only plug its ears and wait for this religious cherry bomb to explode.

[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:40.320]
With Gibson's retelling of the last 12 gory hours of Jesus Christ, life lead Christians weeping, nonbelievers believing and Jews ready to combat a new wave of dissent. Or will it be a dud?

[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:49.040]
Destiny reincarnate as a dusty DVD in the church AV room. If this much liberated film does physical, it won't be for lack of effort from Canadian Christian lobby groups.

[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:58.920]
For months now several influential inter-nonminational Christian assemblies working under campus crusade for Christ have been pursuing a surely calculated strategy for the marketing of this epic film.

[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:06.180]
After all this project wasn't going to be hyped up by conventional means we surely weren't going to see flawed Christ figures on Burger King cups.

[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.880]
That's through my logway. Do I have another spot coming?

[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.360]
What word did he say?

[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.920]
Oh, with a V. I thought you said something with a D.

[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.080]
Don't say it. Don't even think it. Then if you don't think it, you won't say it.

[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:30.700]
Okay. After all this project wasn't going to be hyped up by conventional means we surely weren't going to see flawed Christ figures on Burger King cups.

[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.360]
That surely wouldn't be very appetizing. Would it?

[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.940]
In fact, if you've seen some of these clips they've shown for so far ain't very appetizing.

[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.440]
In fact, forget about Atkins. They've got a new diet now. The Jesus crucifixion diet.

[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.340]
And look at all this out. Did you see that on CNN right now?

[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:53.720]
CNN presents special event Sunday in the industry of Jesus. Holy moly man. They're in it. We're just good drowning in Jesus now.

[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:04.560]

My religion's better than yours.

My religion's better than yours.

[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:32.560]
Absolutely.

[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.420]
We don't want to use our brains for pointless living,

[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:38.600]
so we're afraid my religion's better than yours.

[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.180]
310 of votes, Dominus de Biscos.

[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.440]
What's your take on a religious right?

[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.100]
There are nothing but a bunch of hate-bondering morons, 106.

[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.500]
The whole religion thing is a big racket, 93.

[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.180]
Absolutely.

[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.520]
I don't mind if they just leave me alone, 35, but they won't.

[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.960]
They're full of Shiite, 29.

[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.840]
I'm one of them praise God, 17, 5.4% of the people listening to me right now

[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.680]
are religious rights. There's hallelujah. Praise the Lord.

[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.120]
Send us some money, please.

[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.400]
They're the biggest perverts of all, 16,

[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.400]
and they gave their brains away to fakres 14 out of over 300 votes,

[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.060]
speaking of votes.

[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.600]
7,566 votes on a hot couples contest.

[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.460]
I've forgotten the first hour we had such a heavy plate.

[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:17.760]
75,666.

[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.840]
I'm just going to read the one so far that I've got over 200 votes.

[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:20.180]
Okay?

[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:20.480]
Okay.

[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.980]
We don't have time for with all the respect.

[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.760]
And those of you who are down in the voting don't get down in the dumps

[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.000]
because Jesse and Jeffrey came from the middle of the pack to a gigantic lead,

[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.020]
which means some people must have been very busy,

[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.540]
but, or a lot of people saw them and said, hey, they look pretty good.

[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.020]
What's they do?

[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.840]
Jesse and Jeffrey, 17, 136, they're first right now.

[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.700]
Monica and Brian doing well, 14,79.

[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.660]
Carmen and Carlos, 1218.

[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.400]
Sarah and Sean, 844.

[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.480]
Jazzella and Mick, 302.

[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.300]
Karen and Rick Friend.

[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.980]
Karen and Joe, 279.

[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.400]
Aaron and Brandon, they've got 261 and Laura and Lena and Andy, 201.

[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:53.560]
I can't read my own script like.

[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.600]
Well, that's 75,666.

[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.720]
You realize that by tomorrow we could have 10,000 votes already by the end of the day?

[00:52:58.920 --> 00:52:59.040]
Yes.

[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:00.060]
Wow.

[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.140]
And the deadline is tomorrow at 155.

[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.400]
What a week is going by fast.

[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.980]
What am I thinking about?

[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.120]
Tomorrow is the deadline, 155.

[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.440]
Whoever leads gets the first trip and whatever.

[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.080]
You know how it goes.

[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.720]
Anyway, getting back this article.

[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.380]
Christian pushed behind the passion.

[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.580]
Jesus filmed to be used to convert non-Christians.

[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.060]
The push began in mid-June, and before I continue.

[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.620]
Last night, Deborah Norfolk on MSNBC, which nobody watches any of those shows on that network.

[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.420]
But yeah, I'd like to see what they're doing.

[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.800]
She had a debate between one of these right-wing preacher guys

[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:36.220]
and some left-wing broad from some psychologist lady about this movie.

[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:41.380]
And the preacher guy came out in the middle of it, but the preacher guy was insisting that children are going to be allowed to see this.

[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.300]
Now, the movie's got an R rating because of the violence and the bloodshed.

[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:44.560]
Right.

[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:46.820]
But children are going to be led in.

[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.840]
He says, well, we're going to have pastors to minister them in the lobbies after the movie if they have any questions.

[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.740]
She said, you ought to be ashamed yourself.

[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.160]
She must have said that many times.

[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.020]
But third man.

[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:55.900]
You have to be ashamed yourself.

[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.940]
Children can be traumatized by anything this violent.

[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.160]
I've seen the previews and absolutely no way the children should be exposed to this insanity.

[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.080]
And it has nothing to do with anything biblical.

[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.800]
It's just Mel Gibson's Yadi-yadi.

[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.440]
And the preacher just kept repeating the same crap interrupting.

[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.420]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, you know.

[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.440]
Anyway, I just thought I'd mention that.

[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:11.740]
Okay.

[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:17.080]
The push began in mid-January with a series of 12 screenings and 9 Canadian cities over six days in the end.

[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:23.040]
9,000 Christian pastors and church leaders, including 2000 in the GTA, the greater Toronto area saw the film.

[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.760]
The same group subsequently received a DVD featuring previews and in-depth interviews with Mel Gibson,

[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.020]
who fronted $25 million to produce the film, and Jim Cavizel, the actor who plays Jesus.

[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:40.060]
In the DVD, Gibson and Cavizel, both Christians, talk about their motivations behind making the film, and their goodwill toward Jews.

[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:40.580]
Oy!

[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:46.760]
Also being distributed by the Concertion of Christian Groups' instructional material, both online and hard copy,

[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:54.660]
designed to help pastors build sermons around the film, and to guide parishioners in their mission to share the Christian gospel with non-believers.

[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.700]
That's what this is all about, converting the world.

[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:06.540]
You'll see, coming at a time especially when we realize the insanity and the danger of fundamentalist religionists, only if they're Muslims,

[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.880]
only if they're schmattes and others if they have their own hair ears at it, I see.

[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:16.420]
You would think that people would have a little bit more respect for others at this time, but of course, present-huffins decisions.

[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:22.660]
Well, while I do not agree with it, I will deal with it like I would expect one of my players to handle this concept.

[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:29.860]
Oh, come, his comments were misinterpreted about one. Fire his ass, okay, I'm not going to let them happen there, Colorado, I hope they fire his red neck ass.

[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:40.160]
Anyway, an example of this material is an excerpt from a document on searchermoncentral.com, which proposes that Christian use the film as an excuse to do a prayer walk.

[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.300]
Now, did you hear the language there?

[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.160]
Use the film as an excuse to do a prayer walk. Listen to this.

[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.440]
Carefully choose a neighborhood you believe God wants you to reach.

[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:57.520]
With multiple prayer teams walk every street in pray for every house, asking that God will reach each person with a message of the cross,

[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:07.060]
their exposure to passion of the Christ, leave a door hanger and or evangelistic book of the e-chome, encouraging them to see the movie and inviting them to attend a passionate, related event at your church.

[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:12.740]
What, no Chinese menu? Wow. Maybe that's on her too. Now, the chinks are in this crap.

[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:13.880]
Oh, my God.

[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:21.860]
It is opening on a whopping 2,000 screens in North America next Wednesday, including Toyota and Canada, which is a big number of an independent film.

[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:32.420]
They highly acclaimed Monster, for example, which is also distributed by New Market Films in the U.S. has just expanded to 1,093 screens in North America, but this one is opening on a whopping 2,000 screens.

[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:42.180]
The consortium's aim is to ensure that I'm only Christians see this film, but their friends and friends see it too, while making an earnest attempt to stuffle fears the film of Nader-Rashimanti Semitism.

[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:54.280]
Owen Black, executive pastor of the Mrs. Saga Gospel Temple, won a three-location of the film was shown at the GTA, makes no bones about the fact that Christian groups will be in full recruitment mode during films tenure in the limelight.

[00:56:54.920 --> 00:57:03.280]
People are being encouraged to take a non-Christian friend to say, look, consider this. What do you think about this, he said? This is a good thing to see. It's a wonderful way to dialogue about the Christian faith.

[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:09.240]
And this whole sick concept that this man was crucified so that if you believe these fairy tales, you can go to heaven and live forever.

[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:20.340]
Bob Kramer, the director of special projects for campus crusade for Christ, coordinated the advanced screenings. His organization has also developed a website to help guide Christians who want to share their gospel by means of the film.

[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:29.660]
We believe that Christians will be deeply touched by this film and we're equipping people so that they'll be ready to answer questions for the non-Christian devotion to this film because people will be blown away.

[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.520]
You know that if you go to see this movie, you'll be blown away. I think I might fall asleep.

[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.380]
Maybe father or tool will be there to help make sure that you're blown.

[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:43.520]
Yes, so that you're told in November Kramer. I can still say it and I will say it. Okay.

[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.500]
They'll have to drag me out kicking and screaming. I have to find me first in November Kramer and 20 other Christian leaders visited icon productions.

[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:55.940]
They gifts an old outfit that created the film for the viewing of the then unfinished film having been profoundly affected.

[00:57:56.380 --> 00:58:02.320]
The group decided needed a strategy for want to create maximum impact. The January screenings and tutorial material are resulted in that decision.

[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:08.460]
Though the plan is born of a world of spread the Christian gospel, it will inevitably translate the financial gain for Gibson and his affiliates.

[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:14.300]
A source at Equinox films the films Canadian distributor admitted that the previous series was an example of grassroots marketing.

[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.740]
The Kramer says it isn't about money. I think about it in terms of people and secrets of truth being put in touch with the gospel of truth.

[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:25.020]
He said I think of it as a marketing but not of dollars and cents, but in terms of a movement.

[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:29.120]
If Mel Gibson makes money on this, he'll have turned around what most people thought was going to be his biggest mistake.

[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:36.420]
It appears it could be successful. He said Canada's Jewish community perhaps not surprisingly wasn't asked to help with the film's promotion.

[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.040]
Can't imagine why most of them were saying.

[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:50.040]
Oh, hustle hoist as per director orders from icon productions members of that faith were not invited to private sweetings and rabbi shmubul Spiro has a pretty idea why ever here rabbi shmubul Spiro.

[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:54.660]
He's not good. I love that name. That's even better than what's the Michael Jackson's rabbi there?

[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:05.020]
You want to use this buddy? Whatever his name is. He's almost as good as shmubul. If the viewing was for missionizing purposes, I understand why they didn't call me. He said from Anshai mince congregation in Kensington Market.

[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:11.100]
I guess they didn't consider me to be a good promoter for them. Some Jewish leaders filled a film will damage Jewish Christian relations.

[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:22.140]
The passion interpreted literally from Christian scriptures implicates Jews with Jesus's brutal death. According to Abraham Foxman, US director of the anti-defamation league, the film portrays Jews as vengeful and bloodthirsty.

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:36.040]
Fuelling those arguments, here we go again. I want to repeat this is the fact that Gibson recently embraced a fringe form of Catholicism known as traditionalism, a faction that refuses to acknowledge the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in 65, which absolved the Jews for the killing of Christ.

[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:45.780]
Rabbi Michael Skobak of Jews for Jews is a matriot of groups that focuses specifically on countering Christian attempts to convert Jews. Said Canadian Jews shouldn't expect the film to cause a major disruption.

[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:55.800]
For North Americans, my sense is one that the film is not going to undo decades of interfaith relations. My sense is that a lot of concerns will be more real in Europe and South America where you get more overt acts of anti-Semitism.

[00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:07.500]
What we're monitoring is the fact that Christians will be using this film as a tool to convert people to their faith. Some Jews will be invited by friends or given free tickets or cajol into going or like a neus crusades. They'll be a maiden offer they can't refuse.

[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:19.000]
The Inquisition, oh, I'm sorry, but Skobak city be surprised to see demonstrations in Toronto. Our philosophy here is not to be reactive. He said this is nothing new. It's not as if Christians have been trying to convert Jews for a long time.

[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:30.700]
We didn't create this organization last night to deal with this film. It's an ongoing struggle to help educate the Jewish community, help them understand the teachings of their own faith, the audio, audio. It's all a bunch of crap. Leave everybody alone. DNA, too, no harm. That's the bottom line. Okay.

[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:46.700]
It's all a bunch of crap, but I think the most interesting part of this whole deal beside the stuff about Mel Gibson's father, his anti-Semite virulent lunatic father is this stuff about Melisea recently embraced traditionalism, a fringe, right wing fanatical form of Catholicism.

[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:59.420]
Who even satisfied with the Pope because he's not extreme enough. He's a bottom. Yeah. So he said the Pope is a bottom. He's weak. Well, he says that so they will think that Mel might be a top. But you never can be sure.

[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:29.400]
Okay. How many votes we got in this poll so far? What's your take on a religious right? 362. Somebody said it. Help them endure it. I know what that means. There's nothing but hate, mongri morons. 129 said that. And keep in mind, this isn't just a Catholic thing. It's the fundamentalist. Anything you name it, the Muslims, the Orthodox Jews. It's the born again Baptist, oh, man. The Jehovah's Witnesses. The religious nuts who just won't leave you alone. Right. Just like they want to go to I think if they come to your house with one of those things, they want to stick on your

[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:58.500]
door. I think that maybe I'm like, you know, put out to them. It's for your own good. 371 votes. There's nothing but a bunch of hate, mongri morons. 129. The whole religion thing is a big racket. 108. Absolutely. Correct. I don't mind if they would leave me alone. 43. They won't leave you alone. They're full of Shiite. 34. They gave their brains away to fakers. 21. I'm one of them praise God. 19 5.1% of this crowd. A religious writer. And they're the biggest perverts of all. 17.

[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:25.540]
Out of 371. 4 1-1 1-1-1-1% say they're much of preverts. 12 and its past 11 at your perverted station. 560 Q.A.M. Holy Makanah. This is Jehovah on the Voice of the Toronto May beliefs. And you're listening to the Hockey Authority. Neil God. Hold, hold, hold. He takes it in the mask.

[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:29.520]
The Pope's Pope's road, he's riding at an ass.

[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.880]
The Pope's Pope's road, he likes to twist the boner.

[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.640]
The Pope's Pope's road, the Pope's Pope's road.

[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.860]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.300]
You can talk in if you want and the Pope will join you.

[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.180]
If you let him touch you, he will surely bless you.

[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.200]
It's been tried to pull your rope, let him have a heel.

[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:02.220]
If he looks like a good girl, let's call a pumpo wheel.

[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.340]
The Pope's Pope's road, he takes it in a mask.

[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.360]
The Pope's Pope's road, he's riding at an ass.

[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.620]
The Pope's Pope's road, he likes to twist the boner.

[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.400]
The Pope's Pope's road, the Pope's Pope's road.

[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.640]
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.540]
Oh yeah.

[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.900]
That's a beautiful, hot girl.

[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.780]
Now let me ask you this, would you ride on the Pope's ass?

[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.880]
Oh, big of it.

[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.280]
1118 gigantic, 1118 at 560 WQM, a skilling indictment for fraud.

[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.200]
You'll be pleased with this, you probably just saw it.

[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.780]
Next in Ron's CE, Jeffrey Skilling was charged with fraud inside her trading today,

[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.800]
making him the highest ranking former executive charge in the collapse of the once mighty energy company.

[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.780]
Those fakers, those grave robbers at Enron, to which we say,

[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:57.780]
is defensive journey was just on there just articulating any moding and he never stole a freight trade, you know, too bad.

[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.700]
The indictment in seal in Houston laid out 36 charges against Skilling,

[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.040]
as well as new charges against Richard Cause, Enron's former CEO,

[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.920]
who put it not guilty to six charges last month.

[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:11.220]
The charges against Skilling and Cause alleged that from 1999 to 2001,

[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.560]
the two men used various devices and schemes to manipulate Enron's financial results.

[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.760]
The indictment comes just five weeks after former Enron CE, CFO, Andrew Fasdow,

[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.760]
pleaded guilty to wire insecurities fraud and agreed with Co-opper with investigators

[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.080]
probing the accounting scandal.

[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.840]
And like they say in Amsterdam, hubbim and dreared.

[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.140]
Now we got these faxes, why did the little research of my own will, this gets all complicated.

[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.340]
Yeah, Eric even said what?

[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.100]
We're talking about Alexa.

[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.180]
Right, okay.

[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.100]
He said what?

[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.320]
That it's spyware.

[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.420]
Well, here's the fact that they say the spyware, in other words,

[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.360]
attracts your internet usage, although it's one of the more benign spyware programs

[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.680]
that's infringing on your privacy.

[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.020]
I'd recommend using the Google toolbar instead, but it's also a block pop-up.

[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:52.680]
No, it doesn't.

[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.920]
And as the bonus allows you to highlight a word in any web page,

[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.500]
you might click to do a Google search on the word.

[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.320]
I've used the Google toolbar.

[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.720]
It does not block pop-up, pop marks.

[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.420]
Here's another one.

[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.060]
My big mic in St. Pete's is be careful.

[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.000]
Alexa is spyware.

[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.740]
Do a Google on Alexa they're watching since Bigmight in St. Pete.

[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.140]
So I did a little on Google.

[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:09.780]
Yeah.

[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.260]
And here's an ad for spy ferret.

[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:16.040]
We'll scan your computer for more than 400 of the most notorious spyware adware programs

[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.620]
that are available on the net today, which includes Alexa, by the way,

[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.380]
a whole list of many.

[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.640]
It'll expose all spyware adware components on your PC.

[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.080]
Give your proof description about each component, the audio, the audio.

[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.640]
They want to put a list for $39.

[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.120]
I got a copy of spybot for free from Eric.

[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.640]
Do I need that?

[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.780]
You can use it for what?

[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:36.740]
What do I need that for?

[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.840]
To clean up your spyware.

[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.880]
I have adware.

[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:40.520]
Doesn't that do that?

[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.380]
I don't know.

[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.360]
Well, let me try.

[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:43.420]
Okay.

[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.660]
I'm not, see, I'm not all paranoid because number one, I'm not looking at kitty poor.

[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.940]
And number two, there's nothing on there.

[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.700]
I have nothing financial on this computer.

[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.680]
Number three, who cares?

[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.640]
You know, you know what I'm saying?

[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.220]
What genre of escroph would say when they come knocking on your door three o'clock in the morning?

[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:58.840]
If you have nothing to hide, then what are you hiding?

[01:05:59.080 --> 01:05:59.720]
It's not about that.

[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:02.720]
It's about all the other insidious things that it's doing like slowing your computer down.

[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.400]
No, it's not.

[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:03.860]
Okay.

[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.140]
My computer is as fast as lightning, Mr. is the type of a lightning.

[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:08.720]
Are you kidding me?

[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.440]
It all adds up.

[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.280]
Like if you have a hundred or more pieces of spyware, they're all doing their little thing.

[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:12.900]
It's slowing you down.

[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.260]
Well, maybe I don't have any more spyware.

[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.300]
That could be.

[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.040]
First doozy.

[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.760]
Maybe because I remove it every day with that other thing.

[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:20.340]
Adware.

[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:22.200]
What is it?

[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.660]
And any rate, I don't care.

[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:25.500]
Out of way.

[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.200]
Five, six, seven.

[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.560]
Now we'll probably get some calls on us.

[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.840]
Oh, you better get that thing off there.

[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.760]
Then Alexa, I like it.

[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:31.640]
Okay, I like it.

[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.660]
I'm very happy with it.

[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.200]
Three days.

[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.660]
I like the fact that Eric does mommy to have it because he knows that I can email him 400

[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.500]
stories every day.

[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.960]
Like in the time I used to take me to email 15 or 20.

[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.560]
Because man, it's got that little icon in there.

[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.000]
Do your email no matter what page you're on.

[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.000]
But I'm being an aircoast.

[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.840]
And you don't have to keep filling in all the names on area.

[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.180]
Just whoever you're sending it to.

[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:49.520]
That's it.

[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.320]
There it goes.

[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.160]
Just like that.

[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.540]
WDQ and spyware line.

[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:54.800]
Hello.

[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.280]
Neil, how you doing today?

[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:56.900]
Pretty good.

[01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:02.420]
I want to know where do these priests get off thinking that they can go out.

[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.540]
They're all molesting these children.

[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.720]
And they think that they're above the law.

[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.660]
And that nothing can happen to them.

[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.620]
Oh, well that goes back to that whole thing about the, what do they call that law, George?

[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:14.320]
Which one?

[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.340]
Cannon law.

[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:15.980]
Cannon law.

[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:16.840]
And civil law.

[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.080]
That was the thing they were bringing up with this whole first law a couple of years ago.

[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:20.360]
Right.

[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:27.120]
As if they're above the law of any country that they're living in, they can make up their own laws and don't confuse us with the facts.

[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:27.960]
They answered a guide.

[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:28.660]
Right.

[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:34.040]
You know, if these politicians got off of their brain that they're sitting on, right?

[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:46.200]
And started protecting children and people from, from these people that were in positions that are able to hurt people and have nothing done about it.

[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:54.460]
See, people like Michael Powell were nearly as concerned about all of children that are being molested as they are concerned about seeing Janet Jackson's booby for a half a second on the Super Bowl.

[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.760]
Then maybe we'd get somewhere.

[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:58.920]
It's just a bunch of posturing and pandering because it's an election year.

[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:05.500]
They want to show us how much more pies and holy and better they are than anybody else, even though the administration is slaughtering and getting our people slaughtered every day.

[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.320]
You're right.

[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.960]
They're worried about the wrong things.

[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:19.720]
If these priests, there should be double or triple the penalty for a regular person because those are put in the position where they're supposed to be higher.

[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.800]
There are laws about that.

[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.800]
You're supposed to be able to leave your children with a priest and not worry about what's going to happen.

[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.160]
Correct.

[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:32.900]
It is absolutely correct because they play on the trust they build up the trust of the child and the family and then they exploit it and the abuse.

[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.440]
And we've still only seen the tip of the iceberg.

[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.100]
This business is about 4,400 whatever it is.

[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.040]
That's the tip of the iceberg.

[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:39.520]
Believe me.

[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.060]
But one religion you don't really hear this happening is the Jewish religion.

[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:45.780]
That's not true.

[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.360]
How about the rabbi in Boko?

[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:51.360]
A few months ago that most molesting the kid that was setting up dates on the internet.

[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.460]
Sir, let me tell you, they're all a bunch of a fakers.

[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:59.840]
Not every one of the ministers and priests and rabbis, but I'm just saying as far as the religions are concerned, it's a fakery.

[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.820]
The reason you see more of it in the Catholic Church is because of their unnatural attitude about sex.

[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.560]
Sex is only for procreation in the audio.

[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.800]
Well, I mean, what a bunch of crap.

[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.100]
I remember that story years ago about the handicapped guy.

[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:11.420]
Right.

[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.620]
I wanted to get married in Chicago and the Catholic Church wouldn't marry them.

[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.880]
These were devout Catholics, but they couldn't consummate the religion.

[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:18.640]
They couldn't have sex.

[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:24.180]
Now, on one hand, sex is so evil, but if you're doing it to make more Catholic babies, then it's a wonderful, blessed thing.

[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:25.680]
That's right.

[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.360]
I mean, just stop and use your noodle a little bit, boys and girls.

[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.800]
Use your brain, okay?

[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:34.720]
That's the whole reason that they're sitting there on the other side rubbing themselves raw while the kids are telling them,

[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:37.620]
oh, I touched myself last night, father, I did three times.

[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:38.240]
Yeah.

[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.540]
And they're sitting in there just rubbing themselves raw.

[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:46.080]
That's the excuse they give because you have to forgive your, be forgiven for your sins because sex is a sin.

[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:46.840]
Right.

[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.920]
For them, it's okay, but sex is a sin.

[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.760]
Just like that one priest that Mike Wallace was tracking down on 60 minutes a few years ago when they did that story.

[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.460]
The priest that was doing the girl, right?

[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.580]
Is that what it was?

[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.320]
He said it wasn't a sin because there was no passion.

[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.120]
Remember that line?

[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:01.920]
Yeah, what about the past?

[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:02.400]
The past.

[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:05.380]
Are you starting up again?

[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:06.940]
Jesus Christ.

[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the A T and T.

[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:17.280]
I'm telling you, like I said, I believe that you can believe whatever you want until you get to the point where you start hurting other people with it.

[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.280]
At that point, that's where any sensible rational person draws the line.

[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.880]
And when you use it to, as an excuse, well, the Bible says, yeah, the Bible says a lot of crap because it was written by primitive people.

[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:33.700]
I said in Georgia before the show this morning, just stop and think if you took the people over over hundreds of years who wrote all of that nonsense,

[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:47.700]
all of that superstitious mumbo jumbo, if you took them through the time tunnel and you brought them here today and you sat them down and hear all these cars and TV sets and they heard me talking on the radio or anybody else and all these CDs and all these sexual TV.

[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:48.280]
Right.

[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:58.080]
And they would say, like that, they would probably, they could, they could be like an amendment institution immediately because they couldn't stand it because they were so ignorant and so primitive.

[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.640]
And much of superstitious geckys, right, every time it funded, every time it rained, it was an act of God.

[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.600]
God was crying. God was angry.

[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:17.360]
And to use this garbage to justify treatment of women and blacks and gays and anybody else, this doesn't fly with anybody whose ration, anybody who's got a brain, which leaves out malgipsin, by the way.

[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.620]
They didn't even know what a rainbow was for Christ's sakes.

[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:23.340]
Oh, it's a message from God. Don't you understand?

[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:24.400]
I thought it was a gay symbol.

[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:26.920]
It is. It's a rainbow fag.

[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.040]
26 past 11 at 560, your fag ship station for the, whatever those teams are.

[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:32.760]
Right.

[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:33.920]
And local.

[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.220]
Here's sports radio 560.

[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.940]
She went, she went, yeah.

[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:52.460]
They didn't watch the TV with the finger up their foot.

[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:57.160]
Well, white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white, Christian super fun.

[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.520]
Five million in quarters.

[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.420]
While finally they're nuts.

[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.980]
Well, white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white, Christian super fun.

[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:06.600]
I don't know.

[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.720]
Posted white and tasty from the faculty.

[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:15.440]
It's hailing back to faculty, Roni and cheese.

[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.320]
Gun holes in the ditch.

[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.280]
Just the case they reproduce.

[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:23.960]
That's just a doubt all there allows is you.

[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:38.440]
White lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh

[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.840]
You could serve Michael Powell of the website.

[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.080]
Do they get a swollen putt while peening out their gun?

[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:49.760]
Whoa, white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white, Christian super fun.

[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:52.020]
Do they hollage of the fish?

[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:54.020]
I'm tailgain of their truck.

[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:58.920]
Whoa, white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white lookin' oh white, Christian super fun.

[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.280]
See that standing eatin' sit back down again and chew.

[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.760]
And watch it all down with a 12 pack of fruit.

[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.440]
Live a life of order, come to heaven you go.

[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.200]
Got only smiles and fun for a natural.

[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.020]
Let's do this.

[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.780]
I love to know what love to know, what love to know.

[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.340]
Hey, I love to know what love to know, what love to know.

[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.000]
But third man.

[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.740]
Now what did you say during the middle of that?

[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.580]
There's a new picture of Michael Powell on our website.

[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.620]
On our website.

[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.860]
Well, it's a little close to lunch but I'll take a chance.

[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:50.660]
FCC's begin' to that target's man, Kyle and Chicago and Indecency crack down.

[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.400]
Thanks to who is it?

[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.980]
Our listener Fred and Chicago, who facts this to us.

[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.760]
And you know it was a bad copy.

[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.220]
Fred so I just printed it right out from the old Chicago Sunsines.

[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.280]
Went it out, I printed it right out.

[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.300]
Where the hell would what would life be without the internet these days?

[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:05.700]
You know what?

[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.200]
That's a hard thing.

[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.740]
Because pretty soon your radio and TV are going to be virtually useless too,

[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.100]
as far as getting any real information.

[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.160]
I think they already are.

[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:15.080]
As far as seeing any titillating pictures or things like that.

[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.100]
Or reading about what's really happening in the rest of the world.

[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:17.740]
Forget about it.

[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.080]
Okay, let's take a peek at Google Michael Powell, let's see.

[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.380]
There's a sure and stone.

[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:53.360]
Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah

[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:00.480]
Oh, magic. Oh, magic. I bet you're a rich shop probably sent it over.

[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:09.680]
Anybody that haven't seen that baby, take a look. I mean first take a look at your own stone and then you can compare your own stone. She ain't got nothing compared to Michael Powell.

[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:16.020]
I think that both of you have had new hand me work. Has he got a pair or what? Oh, here's our death notes. We'll get to that.

[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:23.080]
Gary says, if you want a web browser that blocks pop-ups, try FireBrewd at Mozilla.org. It's lightning quick and I get no pop-ups.

[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:30.100]
I don't get any pop-ups either with Alexa or their spying on me. Also, it says I know the Bush A-Wall thing has been beaten to death.

[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.100]
But after reading this week's Newsweek article, I think the most important point is being missed.

[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.200]
Carrying his classmates volunteer to go to Vietnam because they initially supported the war and fell over with their duty.

[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:44.460]
Bush also supported the war and despised all the anti-war protesters. But instead of enlisting to help fight a war, he supported and used his connections to avoid getting drafted.

[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:47.980]
Then he can't even bother to follow through with that. What does that say about his character?

[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:54.680]
Also, does he still think that Vietnam War was anything but a huge costly and deadly mistake? If so, it goes a long way to explain the mess we're in now, Mrs. Gary.

[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.980]
Good points all over Gary, but he's too stupid to understand that. He was a party boy. He was just a busy-getting laden, drinking a lot, maybe take a little up the nose.

[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:09.520]
Mark Avery, oh no, that's bad news. I actually know who this is.

[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.720]
In fact, I know who's several of these people. Look at this.

[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:24.660]
Mark Avery, Detroit Radio Personality who during the top 40 air and AM in the 1960s, Spun Tunes, the WJB K&W XYZ, was a long time familiar voice at various radio stations in Detroit over the years.

[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:32.220]
And who hosted an annual televised charity auction in Pleads Drive for Channel 56, died February 15th in Evansville in the NF for Long Unless he was 74.

[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:42.820]
Mark Avery, good guy. He had that sound. There were guys, the Lee Allen and Paul Winter and Mark Avery. They had a Dave Prince and Don Z.

[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.720]
What a memory. They all had that same kind of throaty sound at WSYZ. It was a great station.

[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:56.220]
And then some genius came in there, turned it into a talk station and changed the colliders to WSYT. What an asshole, man. What an idiot.

[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.980]
WABC and WSYZ, the greatest colliders in the history of radio and they co-entend changing.

[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:13.840]
Reverend John Minkler died. Albany New York Priest of Allegedly wrote a 1995 letter which recently surfaced to Cardinal O'Connor that accused Bishop Howard Hubbub of being part of a ring of homosexual priest who was asked by Hubbub.

[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:22.900]
Oh, we knew he died, right? Right. He wrote the letter and then all of a sudden he was found dead at February 15th at Waterfleet, New York, an apparent suicide. He was 57, an apparent suicide.

[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:35.000]
He wrote that it was kind of like Dr. David Blake in England, same kind of a story. Also, Stuttering John Melendez is leaving the Howard Stern radio show to become the new announcer on the night show with Jay Leno, who were placed at Hall who left the show to pursue acting.

[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:44.640]
I'm leaving because the money is a lot better. And I always wanted to be in LA Melendez City yesterday. I'd eventually like to get a sitcom to be in a sitcom and acting has been really important to me since Stuttering John.

[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:52.440]
Ozzy Osborne's wife Sharon has engraved some Ozfest bands by demanding they pay upwards of 100 grand in performance, the traveling heavy metal show.

[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.340]
It's a prohibitive for a small or bands that are sourcing or a chairman is focusing on trying to get Metallica's slipknot and Judas Priestess on on Hitler and the tour.

[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:09.040]
A rep said the Osborne's traditionally charged the lesser known bands for marketing fee, but the Osborne's paid the larger bands and it will not be as slew of doctors in the road.

[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:22.000]
WPLG channel 10's Peter O'Dench, Peter Densch, 53 long time Howard, your reporter got taken off the air station brass told him he can rain on staff as he behind the scenes problem solvers producer.

[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:26.540]
Densch's contract is up March 31. He's been taken off the air Peter Densch channel of 10.

[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:26.720]

[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:27.640]
You know who that is?

[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:28.420]
Yeah, I see.

[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.580]
Okay, he's been taken off the air kind of like Dave Gain, but after the same reason.

[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.500]
Dave Gain was taken off the air because even after we got our 62 in sets, we still couldn't see all of them.

[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:42.220]
Now, we got just a lot of fish to fry here, man.

[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.320]
WDQA, hello.

[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:47.740]
Good morning.

[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.840]
Talking about pop-up walkers and spyware.

[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.280]
There are really two different things, of course.

[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.760]
A pop-up walkers walk ads that come up as a result of going to the website.

[01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.060]
Right.

[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:07.520]
The spyware can be very malicious because what it does is it hides files that either can gather information about where you've gone on the internet.

[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:16.220]
You can go to 10 different sites and then the company that wants to see where you've been to can then go and look at that cookie,

[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.960]
unbeknownst to you while you're doing something else.

[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.940]
I can then grab the information and say, oh, this user has been to this site, that site, that site, that site, etc.

[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:29.620]
The program that George recommended, spybot search and destroy.

[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.960]
It's absolutely free. There's no charge.

[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:36.800]
And it actually not only will scan and remove all of the spyware that's already there,

[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:40.280]
it will actually protect from future spyware coming on.

[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.280]
Okay, what is it again?

[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.340]
Spybot, S-P-Y-B-O-T, search and destroy.

[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.220]
Eric is emailing you the link for it.

[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:47.680]
Oh, right.

[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.980]
It's a great program and the price is right.

[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:53.220]
In other words, I can keep my Alexa, but I can install that.

[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:58.060]
Spybot isn't going to like Alexa according to you.

[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.580]
Oh, all right. Yeah, it'll give you your test.

[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:03.340]
I don't want to get personal about it, you know?

[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:04.440]
Exactly.

[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.320]
No, I highly recommend this to me, please.

[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.120]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.520]
Okay, now what do you tell me it's not going to like Alexa? What does that mean?

[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.540]
In other words, it'll come up on the list.

[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.900]
It'll get into a fist fight right there on my screen. That might be interesting.

[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.360]
Yeah, you see.

[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.800]
It'll come up on the list of spyware.

[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:21.860]
The spybot reports the spyware that's on your computer and it will report Alexa as spyware,

[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:24.280]
but that doesn't mean that you have to get rid of it.

[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.280]
You just uncheck the box and delete all the other ones.

[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.300]
I see presumably.

[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:30.600]
I see.

[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.760]
Well, I'm not as nervous about it as some of you are, I mean, some of you people are.

[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.580]
I'm not that concerned.

[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.320]
Hey, I've never seen the reality pictures and I'm proud.

[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:42.900]
I see spy bots spy bot bot bot bot.

[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:43.240]
Okay.

[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.760]
By the way, I got to get to this FCC and ankle thing in Chicago.

[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.560]
We will get to that.

[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.660]
And of course, that was the show that Farrell was on briefly, but I think it was probably

[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.280]
a good decision on his part to go to Atlanta.

[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.960]
Although, I don't know, Atlanta is a pretty right wingman, pretty Yahoo,

[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.400]
even though there's a lot of shfarts who's there.

[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.500]
It's pretty, uh, it makes Tampa seem very liberal by comparison.

[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:06.320]
It doesn't matter how filthy you are because nobody's going to be clean enough to suit anyone.

[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:07.660]
That's right.

[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:15.260]
Nobody can be quite pure enough like Ivory soap, 99 and 44, 100% pure to satisfy Michael Powell.

[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:17.780]
And of course, no wonder he's got that big pals to drag around.

[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:23.620]
My life and look all this is for 205, 60, way to go.

[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.500]
You're nicking a whorehouse.

[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:34.580]
Hey guys, you want a cheer-all?

[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.120]
Have Britney sit on your face.

[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760]
Make that all back to clear-all.

[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.120]
When Britney sits on your face.

[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:45.740]
Oh, forget about your wife, a girl for now.

[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.660]
On the only safe grades.

[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.920]
Better shave off that beard and smash their eggs.

[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.580]
Pick up the pace.

[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.520]
You're really gonna love it.

[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.900]
When Britney sits on your face.

[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.860]
Imagine the view of my man.

[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.760]
When Britney sits on your face.

[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:05.820]
Man, it's over.

[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.240]
It looks like a crowd.

[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.240]
When Britney starts sitting down.

[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.840]
Britney sits on your face.

[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.240]
Yeah, Britney sits on your face.

[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.280]
Imagine Britney Spears leaving her clothes all over your floor.

[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.280]
Knowing it just a minute or two, you're gonna score.

[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.500]
Wipe off that dim big beast too.

[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.720]
Live all Britney sits on your face.

[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.080]
Careful not to bite on chew when Britney sits on your face.

[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:50.360]
Stop dreaming and clean up your place.

[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.200]
Cause she wants a brand new family.

[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:58.960]
You know, I hit the right conclusion in your creations.

[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.600]
But this spy car, which is what you get with a spy bot, yeah.

[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.560]
It looks exactly the same as Adderware.

[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.140]
Okay, well, I don't know from Adderware.

[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.660]
It's the same thing.

[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.020]
Okay, but I'll do it.

[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.020]
I'll scan right now.

[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:10.400]
Okay.

[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.680]
I just installed it and I'll make you happy.

[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.100]
And Eric, don't have to set it to me.

[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:15.820]
Eric, I already got it.

[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.460]
I'm way ahead of you.

[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:19.940]
I'm becoming so computer-litter-bit now for an old fart that is really scary to me.

[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:24.440]
I can't imagine anybody that's got more than 10 bucks since they're so much cheaper now.

[01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:27.860]
I can't imagine any old fart just because they're a fuddy-dirty.

[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:29.700]
Oh, that's just too new thing for me.

[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:31.320]
And I mean, cut the crap.

[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:34.260]
People are leaving them out on the swale for the garbage.

[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:34.480]
Right.

[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:35.380]
That's right.

[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.380]
Cause you know, the out of date ones.

[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:39.580]
How is Swale doing, by the way?

[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:40.160]
Is he still running?

[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:41.460]
I think he's in the fourth of the Gulfstream.

[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:42.240]
Who?

[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:43.840]
It's called Swale.

[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.500]
Oh, look at this.

[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:48.260]
This thing is just...

[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:49.320]
It works exactly.

[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.060]
I just ran Adderware a little while ago.

[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.280]
But just to him where you, I ran spy bot,

[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.740]
and it comes up with spy killer.

[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.860]
And it's a...

[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:58.920]
Even the menu is exactly the same.

[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.760]
So I think Adderware and this thing are the same thing.

[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:05.340]
And it's scanning, and it's looking, and it's searching, and it's destroying,

[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:06.920]
and it's seeking, and it's sniffing out.

[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:07.840]
And it's...

[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:08.820]
So it's going through there.

[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:10.600]
Anyway, SEC's speaking of sniffing it out.

[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.080]
It targets Manco in a decency crackdown.

[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.880]
It says Robert Feeder, sometimes columnist in Chicago.

[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.000]
Washington's renewed crusade against broadcast in decency.

[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.860]
He had back to Chicago yesterday to bite Manco,

[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.060]
and now Muller in the back side again.

[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.140]
And the old back dome.

[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.020]
Bottom.

[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:28.540]
The FCC said, at the forebroadcast of Manco,

[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.520]
you're the one that suggested that I think that's fine.

[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:31.820]
You have to stay to a toddler.

[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.440]
The FCC said, at the forebroadcast of Manco's Morning Madhouse

[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.880]
from 2001 and Slapping Fines of $28,000 against

[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.220]
the mother of Chicago outlet, WKQXFM.

[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.120]
In two severed actions, the FCC upheld $21,000 in fines.

[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.200]
For three previously cited broadcast in March and May of 2001,

[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:57.020]
imposed an initial $7,000 fine for a fourth broadcast in March 2001.

[01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:00.120]
The latest fine was for airing of a song,

[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.920]
a parody called Smell My Finger.

[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.460]
You ready for that?

[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.700]
I'm thinking.

[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:09.340]
Smell My Finger.

[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:10.080]
Yeah.

[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.500]
Yeah.

[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.520]
The FCC's actions were based on complaints filed by David.

[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.260]
Would you listen to me?

[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:17.640]
I'm listening.

[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.320]
Filed by David Edward Smith on behalf of his Chicago based

[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.440]
citizens for community values.

[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.100]
Since Smith began monitoring Mueller show in 1990s filed at least

[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:31.020]
37 complaints against Q101, resulting in six fines for

[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.780]
indecency, totaling $42,000.

[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.040]
Chuck Dakota, Vice President and General Manager of Q101,

[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.340]
said, notice, it's been made whether it will appeal to fines.

[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:41.760]
Like every other broadcast,

[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.620]
we take this stuff really seriously, said Chuck Dakota,

[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.060]
the Vice President and General Manager of Q101.

[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:50.440]
We monitor what we do.

[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:52.260]
We're working with our talent on a daily basis.

[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:54.320]
I know the town is responsive, which is probably

[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.300]
why we're early in there no more.

[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.600]
We don't want to be in these positions.

[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.740]
I'm working hard to make sure that we operate within the guidelines.

[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.400]
We want to be good corporate citizens.

[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:05.360]
The $21,000 fine covered broadcast on March 6th and 7th,

[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:11.740]
and May 17th, 2000, won an involved discussion of sexual and

[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:14.380]
sexual abuse of a sexual stimulant by a female cast member,

[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:17.100]
and the third involved vivid descriptions of genitalia,

[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.240]
masturbation, semen, and sexual activities according to the FCC.

[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.500]
Keep in mind, by the way, that mankind was the right wing,

[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:23.440]
lunatic.

[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.940]
Keep sucking that right wing ass, man.

[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:25.180]
Right.

[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:25.640]
Right.

[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.000]
Bottom.

[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:31.780]
The $7,000 fine was for the earring of the Smell My Finger song,

[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:35.680]
on March 12th, 2000, which is filed to contain graphic and explicit

[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.400]
references to sexual activity according to the FCC.

[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.920]
Malor Express frustration yesterday over the whole ordeal,

[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.920]
imagine being fined by the government for something it did in 2000,

[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.920]
money said the fact that the show has changed a lot,

[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.580]
and I'm looking forward at this point so much for free speech,

[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.640]
you said, and you know what he is?

[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:51.400]
Absolutely correct.

[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.240]
That's your people, man.

[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:54.660]
Cowdats, the people that you support.

[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.120]
That's what they're doing to you.

[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.780]
Michael Powell and all these other right wing lunatics, bottoms.

[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.220]
Typical of the industry's fearful response of this whole deal was

[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:06.680]
a warning memo sent to staffers by an ex-medie group that

[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.800]
had ever based owner of a dozen suburban outlets this afternoon,

[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:09.920]
Michael Powell's warnings.

[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:13.600]
The rules are very vague, but the FCC is starting to enforce them anyway,

[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.440]
and they're coming down on radio stations with fines that could put a station

[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:17.480]
out of business they said.

[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:20.640]
You need to understand there's not a list of words you can't say at this point,

[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.600]
but that anything that might even be on the edge could cause problems,

[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:27.140]
just don't use any word that you wouldn't say in front of your 70-year-old child,

[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.080]
do not even come close to the line if you listen to this.

[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:30.360]
Yeah.

[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.080]
This is the dictum that they're putting out at this next media.

[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.200]
Do not even come close to the line if you do, you will lose your job,

[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:41.180]
you'll be held accountable for any fines that result.

[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.780]
Such major owners is infinity, which we read before in Disney ABC Radio

[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:49.500]
also issued zero tolerance directives that in DC to all programmers

[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.260]
and honor employees in recent days.

[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.480]
Wow, wow, wow.

[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.060]
The indecency issue was built up some serious momentum in Washington

[01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:00.020]
during what Cinnix will notice in election years said Tom Taylor editor of Inside Radio.

[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.120]
Not Cinnix, honest people, Tom.

[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.620]
People who tell it like it is.

[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.700]
Much of baby crap got to talk like everybody is a seven-year-old.

[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:10.900]
God forbid a seven-year-old should hear like, I'm not even going to say it.

[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:11.380]
Right.

[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.860]
This thing about a way is how long does this scan take?

[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.340]
Not long.

[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:16.720]
Maybe long?

[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:17.360]
Who knows?

[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.200]
How many is it finding so far?

[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:20.220]
Seven.

[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.080]
Seven spyware registry keys.

[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.480]
And it is scan, well said it would take a little while,

[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.780]
could it's the first time I'm running it?

[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:26.980]
Okay.

[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.560]
It is just scanning and smoking in the sniffing.

[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:34.960]
So if that's going to be the guideline is what you can say in front of your seven-year-old.

[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:35.740]
Right.

[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:36.840]
Have a nice day.

[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:37.980]
I'm going to do it well.

[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.000]
I mean there's what I can say in front of my seven-year-old.

[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.520]
Now it's not your seven-year-old.

[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:42.900]
Everything.

[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:47.740]
Now in front of your average repressed right wing seven-year-old.

[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.320]
Have a nice day, Tommy.

[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.080]
By the way, do look, or do look.

[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.320]
Well, it's got to be it.

[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:53.320]
So don't look if you don't want to.

[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.240]
Look for the QM van today, noondatoo.

[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:58.620]
It's senior stereo in Pemberpines, 19, Pines Boulevard.

[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.100]
That's on Pines in Douglas.

[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.160]
You can win T-shirts and Panther tickets too.

[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:02.680]
Any interest?

[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:02.920]
No.

[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.880]
Great game out of the longer one again last night.

[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.000]
Buffalo at eight million shots.

[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:06.980]
It's 41, I think.

[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.560]
And the Panthers got a point.

[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.060]
He stole a point from one one tie.

[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:13.680]
Joanne Joanne marked tonight, 1030 to 1230 at the Sandbar grill.

[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:14.320]
And the Grove stuff.

[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.440]
I'd win tickets and T-shirts.

[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.940]
Enjoy $3.00, Beckston Bex lights.

[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:20.080]
Then I had a 1030 with Joanne Mark at the Sandbar in the Grove.

[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:21.440]
How long does this thing keep scanning?

[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.060]
How many hours?

[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:23.060]
Five or third, man.

[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:25.360]
Man, just goes on and on and on.

[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.820]
56670560, £560 on the AT&T in Verizon, Marles Line.

[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.080]
You'll like this story.

[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.480]
Bush prefers our pretty boy to his pretty boy.

[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:39.060]
This is the tale of two scots, one American, the other Canadian.

[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.760]
One is dark hair, the other blonde.

[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.620]
Both are 35 and work for the most powerful men in the respective countries.

[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.360]
Scott McClellum is the press secretary of the U.S. President George W. Bush.

[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:50.320]
Scott Reed is the senior strategist of Prime Minister Paul Martin.

[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.120]
But according to Mr. Bush, Mr. Martin has the prettier Scott.

[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.060]
Indeed, welcome to a new era of pretty face Canada-US relations.

[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:57.940]
This is what happened.

[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:01.620]
Mr. Bush met Mr. Reed earlier this week at the Summit in Monterey, Mexico,

[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:03.900]
just after the President's breakfast with Mr. Martin.

[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.080]
Mr. Reed was not initially in the hotel room where the two leaders and their closest advisors met,

[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.080]
but was called into brief the Prime Minister at the end as the group waited for the media.

[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.980]
Mr. Bush wandered over during Mr. Reed's chat with the Prime Minister,

[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:16.560]
Mr. Reed introduced himself and shook hands with Mr. Bush.

[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:18.080]
Well, what do you do for this guy?

[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:19.840]
The President asked as he pointed to the Prime Minister?

[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.200]
Well, you know, sir, I can't really say Mr. Reed said it's not that I don't want to.

[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.100]
It's just that you know, I don't really know from day to day.

[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.800]
This is true. Mr. Reed handles the number of files and performs the number of different duties,

[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.220]
depending on the issue in the day.

[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.360]
The President chuckled, well, you got a pretty face.

[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.400]
He told the surprise, Mr. Reed. He wasn't done.

[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.140]
You got a pretty face. He said again, you're a good looking guy.

[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.480]
Better looking than my Scott anyway.

[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:43.180]
This is true. His Scott, it has a receding hairline, is on the chubby side.

[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.580]
While Mr. Martin Scott has a full head air and is quite fit.

[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:48.180]
For the first time in his life, Mr. Reed had no reply.

[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.720]
I didn't know what to say, said Mr. Reed.

[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.560]
Noting later that he wished Mr. Bush would be for him as a rugged looking young man or something.

[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.580]
But I'll take what I can, I guess he joke.

[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:59.460]
When a Texas Republican says you've got a pretty face, then I guess there's just no way around it.

[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:01.740]
It's a good thing he didn't say you got a real pretty mouth.

[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:04.540]
Because then he'd have been in deep, right?

[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:05.160]
Then run like a...

[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.160]
Bottom, like a...

[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:07.960]
Deep dude.

[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:10.040]
Don't say it. Whatever you're going to say, don't say it.

[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:10.920]
Think about it several times.

[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:14.040]
Think about it if a seven-year-old child would be offended by it.

[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:15.040]
Run like a cheetah.

[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:16.420]
WQM, hello.

[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:18.980]
WQM, hello.

[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.320]
Welcome to you.

[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:20.700]
Yes, sir.

[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.420]
Hey, Sean Matthews from Ocamparrac.

[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:27.420]
Did you see any interviews of the guy that plays Jesus in that movie?

[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:28.020]
No.

[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:31.020]
He was going on in two different interviews I saw.

[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:36.020]
He was going on about how he was struck by lightning while he was filming.

[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:36.720]
Yeah.

[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:37.320]
And...

[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:40.220]
The first day, a light and they said he was struck by lightning three or four times.

[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:43.280]
They enveloped a little bit, then it turned out he had like a brush at one time deal.

[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.400]
And the people said there was a glow behind him and stuff.

[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:49.500]
And then he was talking to God, getting a program.

[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:49.940]
Oh my God.

[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:50.560]
Yeah.

[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.840]
Also, maybe God was sending him a message he was pissed off about this movie.

[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.040]
Maybe, but...

[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.760]
You got not too crazy about these goyms.

[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.580]
Did you see the dinosaur interview?

[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.200]
No.

[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:04.580]
Okay.

[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:12.280]
I guess the white, right wing republic in Zonk and I liked so much because he was going on about how...

[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:19.680]
I guess he was talking about when he was thinking about killing himself or something.

[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:20.860]
You know, Mel Gibson.

[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:21.400]
Yeah.

[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:28.220]
Or I can't remember when exactly an interview it was, but he was saying something like he was going to go someplace and hide.

[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:33.620]
And he said he was going to go off and hide maybe with the weapons of mass destruction.

[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:34.940]
Then nobody will ever find me.

[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.840]
He actually said that.

[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:37.400]
Thank you.

[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.500]
And I couldn't believe it.

[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:47.660]
I was like, God, wait till the republicans think that Bush is completely infallible and he can do no wrong and he's never wrong.

[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:48.840]
Wait till they hear this.

[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:53.620]
I mean, I doubt they ever heard it because all they watch is a TVN and Christian, listen to Christian radio.

[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.900]
And thank the Lord for that.

[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.520]
And don't forget the 700-hundred-hundred club and I'll pray for it.

[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:57.740]
Thank you.

[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:02.860]
I wish they could hear this and wish they'd seen it because maybe they'll have a little more doubt about it.

[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.320]
Where there's no sense, there's no feeling.

[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.180]
Yeah, that's true.

[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:05.660]
Have a great day.

[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:06.240]
Thank you.

[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.820]
Barney Frank opposes gay marriage effort.

[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:12.140]
Remember I told you this a long time ago and then we got sidetracked.

[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.480]
I like peace and quiet.

[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.960]
Man, I don't need to listen to Barney Frank.

[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:20.820]
Barney Frank is in my ear because I've made a few bucks off a book I worked on.

[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.440]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:33.640]
Representative Barney Frank said San Francisco's decision to challenge state law and grant marriage lessons is the same such couples could damage efforts by gay rights activists to defend the Massachusetts court decision legalizing gay marriage.

[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:43.660]
I was sorry to see the San Francisco thing go forward said Frank and openly gay congressman from Massachusetts who shared his concerns with fellow Democrats in San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom before the city began marrying gay couples last week.

[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:52.560]
In the interview with the A&P Frank expressed concern that the image of lawlessness and civil disobedience in San Francisco would lead some in Congress to support a federal constitutional men in banning gay marriage.

[01:33:52.880 --> 01:34:00.300]
He said he hoped Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision of putting the right of same sex couples to marry would serve as a national model for orderly legal protection of gay marriage.

[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:09.920]
If we go forward Massachusetts and get same sex on a book that's going to be binding an incontestably said today instead San Francisco's move promotes the notion that unpopular laws can be broken or ignored.

[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.760]
When you're in a real struggle San Francisco making a symbolic point becomes a diversion he said.

[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.420]
So there you go.

[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.020]
He's again it.

[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:24.560]
But in the meantime he got over 23 I think privately by now 25 26 hundred couples are married and why they keep showing all the mencing fruits.

[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.320]
Why don't we see some real macho guys on there you know guys who look like Chuck Heston.

[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.580]
My life and look all the other sports radio by 60.

[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:34.460]
Way to a.

[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:40.960]
This is Mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.200]
Wouldn't you really rather have a few that.

[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.400]
Okay, but 50 on you.

[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:52.140]
Now the days of 50 on you.

[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.800]
A private couple says the bar.

[01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:03.360]
Yes, I really would rather have a Cuban duet with all new Cuban engineering that converts a boat of a car into a boat.

[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:12.020]
Arrived on shorelauguriously in a real duet canoe with tail fins high enough to sell you across the lanes and into the sea as if it loads.

[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:14.680]
Wouldn't you really rather have a few that.

[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:15.340]
Hey, great.

[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.140]
A few that have 59 few.

[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:19.160]
Absolutely.

[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.420]
Now the game of 59.

[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:25.840]
A car that always was a five.

[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.040]
Probably one at five sixty WQM happy a Thursday to a mad dog at two the Humphord four.

[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:33.520]
So that my spy killer.

[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.940]
Yes, that was that one calls five on.

[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.660]
No, but it wasn't five bottom with spy killer.

[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:39.040]
Okay.

[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:42.580]
I don't know why, but anyway, it finally finished and it came up and said you have 24.

[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.040]
We've identified 24 spyware files.

[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:51.100]
Now if you want a movement will cost you 3995 see that's what you got to use the one that Eric emailed you.

[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.220]
He didn't email it.

[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:52.780]
Well, maybe you did.

[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.300]
I haven't checked.

[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.140]
I haven't checked because I was too busy.

[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.060]
It's all free.

[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.040]
We're investigating.

[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.040]
We, we, we, we.

[01:35:59.000 --> 01:35:59.360]
Everything is free.

[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.060]
That's all.

[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:00.800]
Go roll by Alexa.

[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.400]
Whatever you do.

[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:02.980]
I'm going to have a talking to with my computer.

[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:03.540]
Whatever you do.

[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:04.280]
Don't remove my Alexa.

[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.280]
I don't care what anybody says.

[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:05.800]
I like it.

[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:06.240]
Okay.

[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.520]
I mean, I like business.

[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:08.940]
Huh?

[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.560]
I like it.

[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.340]
I mean, I needless to say I'm not all that trusting in the government, but is the government connected with Amazon.com?

[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:16.440]
No.

[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:17.480]
His Amazon.com.

[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:21.060]
I'm going to let call up a Michael Powell and say, oh, guess what?

[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.480]
That disgusting proverb in the erogers is a look at it.

[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:24.060]
No.

[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:26.220]
Naked pictures of Michael Powell with his big boobies.

[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:26.800]
I don't think so.

[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.140]
They could be in league with the devil.

[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:30.320]
Well, we already know that.

[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.900]
In fact, if they're in league with the devil, I'd like to have mine on my computer.

[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:34.660]
I'm proud of that.

[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.640]
Maybe hello me is pitch folk.

[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.500]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8.

[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.420]
Now, how is the pool coming?

[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:41.700]
Okay.

[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:42.280]
I haven't looked at that.

[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:44.720]
I'm looking at something else on here, which I just I can't get over it.

[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:44.940]
Okay.

[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:47.440]
No, I'm not talking about Michael Powell.

[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:48.400]
Oh, I'm not talking about the response.

[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.300]
All we got to do is put a few nudie pictures on it.

[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:52.080]
See this idea just in Chicago.

[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:53.500]
The same thing is every other market.

[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:55.460]
We got one organization or one guy.

[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:57.360]
And he's offended and missing that.

[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.360]
And so the FCC uses that and excuse the whole concept of community standards is a joke.

[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:03.100]
Okay.

[01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:04.680]
The big fan joke.

[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.360]
How can you have community standards?

[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:15.780]
And that would be like saying, well, you can read whatever book we decide is up to community standards for Miami or for Chicago or for New York or even for Geneva, New York.

[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:18.820]
And the standards are being set by the most church lady of the month.

[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:19.360]
Right.

[01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:19.900]

[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:28.820]
There is no such thing as community standards, except those things that are universally like for example, you don't have to horse out in a corner of a 441 and I was very rude there.

[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:29.880]
You have to do it in private.

[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:32.400]
I mean, there are some things that are pretty much universal.

[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:32.880]
Right.

[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:40.080]
Like the idea of what you choose to read, what you choose to look at on the internet, what you choose to say on a radio, what you choose to watch on your cable.

[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:47.080]
This I read that the other day a couple of times and people, you know, they don't they don't understand on your cable like we turned to the blue lagoon on on core right now.

[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:47.820]
Can't see that.

[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:48.900]
I'm watching it.

[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:49.720]
Nudily man.

[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.260]
Even though it's a stunt nude.

[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:52.560]
Not this one.

[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.020]
I'll return to the blue lagoon.

[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.800]
I'm sure a Jovovich.

[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.300]
Yes. And whatever his name was.

[01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:57.940]
Whatever he had.

[01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:58.440]
Right.

[01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:58.940]
I know.

[01:37:59.060 --> 01:37:59.540]
Small potatoes.

[01:37:59.540 --> 01:37:59.720]
Yes.

[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.720]
He had very tiny teasers.

[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:01.920]
Whatever.

[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:02.500]
At any rate.

[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:07.480]
We're just warning you, okay, because you think that it's a usual overreaction.

[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:07.980]
It's not.

[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:12.260]
When they start telling me what I can say on the cable, I'm going to have to like move the Canada or something.

[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:16.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.540]
0, 5, 60 on the amp.

[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.060]
I'm touching it.

[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.960]
0, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.060]
And Verizon Wireless Lone.

[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:25.080]
They're all busy looking at those Michael Powell's boobies, man.

[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.480]
That is just a beautiful thing.

[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.820]
If you never went to neo-roger.com, trust me what I tell you.

[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:31.720]
Today is the day.

[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:35.500]
Not only will you see Sharon Stone, but a lovely, tasteful photo.

[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:36.080]
That's right.

[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:36.960]
Nips in all art.

[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.260]
But right underneath Sharon Stone, right between Sharon Stone and Ms. Fudge.

[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.440]
Is Michael Powell holding his gigantic heaving Powell's, man?

[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.600]
Each one of them must weigh about several pounds.

[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:48.700]
He's the continent's only five.

[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:49.160]

[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:49.720]

[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.060]
Each one of those babies got to weigh about 30 pounds.

[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:54.320]
WQAM, hello.

[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:56.020]
Hello.

[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:57.000]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.300]
How are you?

[01:38:58.660 --> 01:38:59.060]
I'm good.

[01:38:59.240 --> 01:38:59.460]
How are you?

[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.060]
Good.

[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:04.000]
I believe I dialed 954-972-2200.

[01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:05.600]
No.

[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:06.960]
Maybe.

[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:07.640]
Not even close.

[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:08.840]
That could be one of our extensions.

[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:09.600]
Oh, it could be.

[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:10.420]
Who are you calling?

[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:11.860]
What company is this?

[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:12.480]
Well company are you?

[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:13.840]
WQAM Radio.

[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:14.500]
I'm sorry.

[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:15.540]
Wrong number.

[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.160]
Sorry, too.

[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:16.740]
Have a nice day.

[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:17.220]
Oh, click.

[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:17.500]
See?

[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:19.140]
I was going to say have a nice day.

[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:21.320]
I did say that, but he already clicked me on the head of time.

[01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:23.560]
He sounded too boring to be on our show anyway.

[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.160]
WQAM, hello.

[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.560]
Yeah, I'd like to comment.

[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:28.280]
Do you take calls?

[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.960]
Well, that's probably where you have the numbers out as we take calls.

[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:32.260]
Yeah.

[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.080]
Or I just killed some good time.

[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:35.000]
Go right ahead.

[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:35.820]
You're on right now, sir.

[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:36.900]
I'm traveling.

[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.260]
First of all, I've listened to your show.

[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.640]
I'll be down here.

[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.080]
Where are you from?

[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:43.600]
I'm from the Midwest.

[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.080]
Don't come back to Florida again, man.

[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:46.700]
Okay, the state.

[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:48.420]
Go ahead.

[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.840]
My question is, I was just flipping channels and just listening.

[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:57.720]
And the, I'm not a Republican, but I am a Christian.

[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:58.120]

[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:01.940]
And I was trying to connect the dots between your caller a few minutes ago.

[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:10.400]
It's somehow right-wing Republicans are also Christians who support the Mel Gibson movie.

[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.640]
And I'm trying to connect all of them.

[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.940]
What do we need to connect those dots?

[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:19.840]
Well, you were supporting that conversation.

[01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:28.370]
conversation and and as if as if that's reality. Yeah. Do you think it is? I'm not saying

[01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:31.970]
that they're all supporting. Well, first of all, right when Republicans are at all Catholics

[01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:35.950]
and as you well know, many born again Christians hate Catholics and vice versa like Poison,

[01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:40.030]
that's that little time religion. That's what it'll do for the world. I don't I don't

[01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:44.030]
know that. You don't know that? That many have many born again Christians hate Catholics.

[01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:48.430]
You don't know that? No, I don't know that. Well, have you been living under a rock somewhere?

[01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:53.470]
You're not insulting me. I don't know that. I don't know that. How could you not know that?

[01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:58.890]
I don't believe that's true statement, but I guess if you know, I don't know. You don't believe

[01:40:58.890 --> 01:41:03.590]
that there's a tremendous long historical rip between most Protestant denominations and the

[01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:08.210]
wrong Catholic church. That's not what you said a moment ago. That's that was too. You're drawn. You're

[01:41:08.210 --> 01:41:14.070]
drawn. You're drawn a connection of centuries and centuries ago and somehow you're saying that

[01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:19.630]
is happening today. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Having you while you find that revolutionary,

[01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:24.130]
haven't you heard the jury fall wells and the other born again back this to decry the

[01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:28.550]
Catholic church? There's a difference between them, but that they hate each other.

[01:41:28.890 --> 01:41:33.510]
Oh, many of them do. Yes. In fact, you take all the wrongs. You're not saying you're using

[01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:38.830]
your words very uniquely. No, I'm not. I'm using very I'm using very very straightforward and

[01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:41.950]
honestly, sir. And you're not listening to anything that I'm saying to you. Oh, I'm listening.

[01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:44.710]
I'm just trying to understand what exactly it is you're saying because you keep

[01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:50.270]
going. Yes, sir. Don't you understand? I don't understand your misuse of your own words.

[01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:55.330]
And if you simply be if you'd simply be consistent. So, sir, I think anyone anyone could either just

[01:41:55.330 --> 01:41:58.730]
forget. What? Why don't you tell me what you're talking about instead doing this little dance?

[01:41:58.730 --> 01:42:01.770]
They always do tell me what you're doing. You're doing the dance, but if you'll stop the

[01:42:01.770 --> 01:42:05.010]
interrogatory, we can have a certain relationship. I'm sure I'm going to have any conversation

[01:42:05.010 --> 01:42:08.450]
unless you answer the question. Okay. If you want to have a two-aid day. I'll ask the question.

[01:42:08.850 --> 01:42:12.810]
Here's the point. Yes. You're going to make the statement. What's that statement?

[01:42:13.130 --> 01:42:21.370]
That Christians hate Catholics. I didn't say that. I didn't say that. I don't have to because I know

[01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:26.150]
what I said, asshole. I said that a lot of born-again Christians hate Catholics like Poison and

[01:42:26.150 --> 01:42:29.710]
Vice versa. Just like a lot of Orthodox Jews hate the other Jews who aren't Orthodox and through

[01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:34.230]
a bridge at their homes in Brooklyn. It's the fact it's not my opinion. Wake up and sift the

[01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:40.130]
Davidils man. What do you say it was from? The Midwest. Oh, well, the Midwest. Go back. Maybe it's

[01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:47.790]
from Evansville, Indiana or Colorado. Oh, and that's not the Midwest. Well, Ed Henry. Welcome to

[01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:52.110]
the real world, sir. He was just astonished and shocked because he hadn't heard this thing that

[01:42:52.110 --> 01:43:04.150]
there are born-again Christians and Catholics who despise and hate each other like Poison. Don't

[01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:12.810]
need some help. 560. 560 on a 18-line QA Am hello. Who was it that went to Bob Jones University?

[01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:20.010]
What was that all about? I forget that controversial. Right. And why was that Bush that went to

[01:43:20.010 --> 01:43:27.510]
John? That was George W. And what exactly did W say at Bob Jones University? He said God bless

[01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:32.730]
America and the Catholics who got problems. And this guy from the Midwest calls in and he doesn't

[01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:37.350]
understand that. What's his problem? But why are you trying to rationalize this? Sir, you did

[01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:41.070]
understand what you're dealing with. The man has a closed mind. His brain has been stolen. There's

[01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:45.490]
a search party looking for it. When they find JFK's brain, maybe they'll find his two. The whole

[01:43:45.490 --> 01:43:53.730]
Midwesters like that. We need to drop a bomb on them. The brain bomb. Let's drop a brain bomb.

[01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:57.630]
Well, there's a little one. We dropped the little one. Okay. Michael Polligan upset about that.

[01:43:57.970 --> 01:44:02.490]
Sir, you know, welcome to the real world. That previous caller. I just, it's always amazing to

[01:44:02.490 --> 01:44:06.010]
me when you ask a question, what they're doing is they're doing the little dance while they try

[01:44:06.010 --> 01:44:09.370]
to figure out what the response is going to be. Just like the origin. When you start asking about

[01:44:09.370 --> 01:44:13.690]
the nonsense in the Bible, oh, you can't say that. Well, of course, I can say it because it's true.

[01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:19.190]
I've read it after the first page you put it in the, or you burn it. You destroy that thing before

[01:44:19.190 --> 01:44:24.710]
anybody else gets their brain infected by it by that garbage written by primitive idiotic people.

[01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:29.610]
And try to have a conversation with any of those religions. And so I try to talk to the brick wall.

[01:44:29.610 --> 01:44:33.970]
Can't do it. Even a brick wall might give you a better response. Certainly the yellow brick road.

[01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:40.050]
5 6 7 0 and I didn't even mention this yet. They'd eighth grader charged with murdering classmate in

[01:44:40.050 --> 01:44:44.370]
school. Remember that horrendous story? Yes, of course. Yes, today, a date county grand jury,

[01:44:44.370 --> 01:44:47.650]
and ended up a 14 year old middle school student on the first of your murder charge in the sling of

[01:44:47.650 --> 01:44:52.930]
a classmate in the school bathroom to which I say, all right, Brian. The indictment guarantees that

[01:44:52.930 --> 01:44:57.250]
Michael Hernandez and eighth grader at Southwood middle school, we tried as an adult for the February

[01:44:57.250 --> 01:45:02.010]
3rd murder a 14 year old Jamie Rodrigo Gao. Goff. I don't know how you know how you pronounce that name.

[01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:07.690]
Now to see the murder him. That's not amusing. That's not even if Michael Powell's going to get your

[01:45:07.690 --> 01:45:11.870]
ass. We're your bottom. Hernandez has been named by the South Dakota Sun Central because he's

[01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:14.870]
been tried as an adult would spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted of the first

[01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:19.350]
degree charge. Understay law, he'd have no possibility of parole. Good. They police arrested the

[01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:23.170]
board today, just lying after he allegedly confessed to stabbing his best friend in the throat with a

[01:45:23.170 --> 01:45:27.710]
serrated knife. Although Hernandez told he tech as he had planned to kill Goff. He didn't explain why

[01:45:27.710 --> 01:45:32.570]
later that day police detect his found tonight and bloody late-text glove and Hernandez is back.

[01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:39.370]
And it just goes on but that good old time religion man, it ain't to have a much effect, much impact

[01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:43.210]
just like those kids in Columbine, you know, the ones whose parents kept taking them to church every Sunday

[01:45:43.210 --> 01:45:49.210]
didn't do too much good. Religion for that caller before and anybody else who hasn't read their

[01:45:49.210 --> 01:45:55.790]
history or is living in a vacuum right now, religion breeds hate, division and hate. Not love,

[01:45:56.270 --> 01:46:00.650]
not compassion, not all of those wonderful flowery things that we hear the jury fall while

[01:46:00.650 --> 01:46:05.890]
in Pat Robertson's always preaching about. So it breeds hate and contempt, not to mention lies,

[01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:13.950]

National Brotherhood Week New Yorkers love the ques or weekends cause it's very

[01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:25.470]
chic. Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand. You can tolerate him if you try.

[01:48:28.730 --> 01:48:34.330]
All the Protestants hate the Catholics and the Catholics hate the Protestants and the Hindus

[01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:38.210]
hate the Muslims and everybody hates the Jews but you're

[01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:46.310]
National Brotherhood Week National Brotherhood Week gets national every one's smile at one and

[01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:54.730]
that they heard week feet. Nice two people who are inferior to you. It's only four a week so have no fear.

[01:48:55.650 --> 01:48:59.090]
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year.

[01:49:02.630 --> 01:49:10.410]
Okay, it comes. 17 I just installed a sky spot from the email. Yeah. Okay. And Eric says whatever

[01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:14.270]
you installed before that's a popular thing. He says you probably installed more problems. That's okay.

[01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:18.730]
By the end of the day, if everybody would have just left me alone, I had no problems at all. Everything was just fine.

[01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:24.230]
You know what I'm saying? Oh, we're fine. Exactly. But now, God only knows who with creepy crawlers are

[01:49:24.230 --> 01:49:29.130]
crawling around inside my computer. Much less those gigantic things that Michael Powell is hanging down. Man,

[01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:34.750]
most things must weigh 100 pounds of peace. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. We do take calls by the way,

[01:49:34.810 --> 01:49:38.310]
occasionally on the near-larger show, we insert them here and there. That's why I give the phone

[01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:41.310]
numbers out. I should have known right off the bat. He was a rocket scientist when he said,

[01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:45.450]
do you take calls? No, we give the numbers out because it kills a lot of good time. It makes the audience

[01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:51.770]
feel like they're a part of the show. That's right. WQM. Hello. Yeah, I'm the warrior. Okay, sir.

[01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:57.630]
I think that car a couple of bad deserves what Christians do for fun. I think that'd be a nice

[01:49:57.630 --> 01:50:03.290]
channel for them. Yeah. Okay. I just got through playing it. Yeah, no, you played something else,

[01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:07.330]
but the song I'm talking about. I just got through playing it 10 minutes ago and have it I stay.

[01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:11.970]
I love the people I like to program the show. Don't you love those people a bit? I just got through

[01:50:11.970 --> 01:50:18.750]
playing that a few minutes ago, pal, like at the 12 noon. So do you take calls? Yeah, because I never

[01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:22.530]
learned my lesson. I take calls. We're here to take all your calls and hear from all of America.

[01:50:22.670 --> 01:50:28.010]
All their wonderful stuff. They're good to bat and especially ugly. WQM. Hello.

[01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:35.470]
Hey, sir. Pretty good. Good. Any change? I got my good buddy. I was the one that gave you the

[01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:40.830]
Capacitic thing the other day. Listen, is there any way you can play the letter of my penis?

[01:50:43.210 --> 01:50:47.850]
I see you're doing what his last guy did. Why do you want to hear that? I want to write it.

[01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:55.850]
I'll be easy. Why do you want to hear it? Because I have a body here. It's never heard.

[01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:59.150]
It's going to be a fall off the seat laughing. Does he have a penis?

[01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:03.850]
Better try first. I'll play it for you, pal. He's coming up in a few minutes.

[01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:06.410]
That's about what? Have a great day. See you on that bridge.

[01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:10.190]
I'll get it. Wow. This is something special in it.

[01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:15.250]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, let's take 40, 50,000 calls between now and two. What do you say?

[01:51:15.330 --> 01:51:18.890]
Oh, right. Let's pack them in, man. We're going to be packing it like crazy.

[01:51:19.730 --> 01:51:23.690]
I never did give the results of the pull up today. This will get that Midwestern guy very, very upset.

[01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:31.490]
That very pious guy who's a whatever he said he was. He was so shocked that there are Christians

[01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:34.890]
who hate Catholics saying that you're making that up. You're making that up. He doesn't believe you.

[01:51:34.890 --> 01:51:41.170]
I just made that up. Lutherans wait the whatever. There is just incredible religious hate all throughout history.

[01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:45.450]
Not just a thousand years ago, not two thousand years ago, not 50 minutes ago.

[01:51:45.570 --> 01:51:50.090]
But right now is we sit here on our fat bottoms. Okay. See you forget what the count on our foggy bottoms

[01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:53.270]
during the inquisition. We're burning you at the stake because we love you.

[01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:55.990]
That is right. We want to know you know for you. You can't refuse. That's correct.

[01:51:56.210 --> 01:52:01.570]
That's correct. Is the torture of love. 617 votes. What's your take on the religious right?

[01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:08.390]
There are nothing but hate mongering morons 203. The whole religion thing is a big racket. 171.

[01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:12.750]
I don't mind if they would just leave me alone 80. They're full of Shiite 61.

[01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:17.530]
They gave their brains away to fakers 37. They're the biggest perverts of all 33.

[01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:20.150]
I wonder if they had the priest in mind and I probably part of it.

[01:52:20.670 --> 01:52:23.790]
And of course James Swagger and Timmy, Jim Baker and others.

[01:52:24.610 --> 01:52:29.510]
And I'm one of them praise God 32 5.1%. So you see we don't have all heathen's listening to this show.

[01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:33.690]
We've got 5.1% of this audience so far who are one of those religious right.

[01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:35.070]
The only problem is they're wrong.

[01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:41.530]
And I love those bumper stickers back in the Anita Bryant days and the early days of fall.

[01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:43.850]
Well, the religious right is neither neither.

[01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:48.590]
For the moral majority is neither too. Both of those were both good.

[01:52:49.150 --> 01:52:52.810]
David says once in a while about Channel 7 news at 10 p.m. I'm so sorry David.

[01:52:53.150 --> 01:52:56.650]
They no longer call themselves the news. The 10 clock show is called The Big Show.

[01:52:56.650 --> 01:52:58.770]
Oh, it sounds like Howard B. Lollover again.

[01:52:58.870 --> 01:53:03.030]
Really big show. The big show was on to talk about murder, rape, robbery, death and destruction.

[01:53:03.450 --> 01:53:06.710]
What a great show they have over there on Channel 7.

[01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:10.690]
Rape, robbery, death and destruction. And Michael Powell is worried about Janet Jackson's booby.

[01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:14.630]
There you go, America. I can't imagine why 14 year old kids are killing each other in high school.

[01:53:14.730 --> 01:53:17.650]
Can you? No. WQA Am Hello.

[01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:19.690]
Hey, how are you? Want to talk to Neil?

[01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:24.990]
Speaking. Hey, Neil. Is anyone called you about Larry Flint's story coming out?

[01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:26.990]
I talked about that two days ago.

[01:53:27.610 --> 01:53:31.910]
Oh, sorry. He's not only is it coming out. He's writing a book about it that will be released this summer.

[01:53:32.230 --> 01:53:39.810]
Right. Can't wait. And the Leanne Rhymes, when she sang the song at the Daytona 500, her nipples were popping out of her mouth.

[01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:43.590]
Oh, no. Don't tell Michael Powell's man. Is there a video of that?

[01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:46.650]
Wish was smiling. Long time first time. Have a good one.

[01:53:46.650 --> 01:53:49.110]
All right. Thanks a lot, pal. Leanne Rhymes.

[01:53:52.210 --> 01:53:56.270]
Maybe we can find a newbie of her. I'm going to use my Alexa toolbar to search for it.

[01:53:56.470 --> 01:54:00.790]
All right. But don't get that spy. We're all locked up in here. I'm using spy underwear.

[01:54:01.570 --> 01:54:06.530]
See, I don't I just I don't know. It seems to me that some of the computer nerds get a little bit too carried away.

[01:54:06.630 --> 01:54:09.050]
I don't have any problem. First of all, I don't have that much stuff in here. Okay.

[01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:15.310]
This is my home computer. This is I use this only for this show. See what I'm saying? Yes.

[01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:19.470]
So what is it that I got in there that I'm concerned about? It's not about the information you're giving them.

[01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:25.170]
It's about there installing software and it's all running all those 20 odd, whatever numbers, 70, whatever,

[01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:29.610]
pieces of registries are all doing things actively on your computer. What are they doing?

[01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:34.610]
What are they doing? They're transferring information back and forth, causing your system to slow down.

[01:54:34.770 --> 01:54:38.570]
Maybe my system hasn't slowed down. My system is like just like that.

[01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:43.950]
Like lightning won't make it noticeable, but those people have hundreds of people spy were on there.

[01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:48.510]
Well, I only got 24 and I don't want so far. They installed my spy bot.

[01:54:49.610 --> 01:54:54.230]
Minutely, they're installing themselves every time I still got my Alexa line on there. Okay. My toolbars. Okay.

[01:54:54.650 --> 01:55:00.810]
Okay. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound. Oh, look at this. We got a great. I want to have a lot of great articles on our website today.

[01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:06.510]
I'm going to try to cut down on a Vitamiric. I know it's really depressing and distressing because until we get Josh to read now that I tried a

[01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:09.470]
Stratford, I'll give you the information. I just want to wait here one minute before the show.

[01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:13.470]
So I spoke to him really quickly and said, yeah, I do this thing post haste now like today.

[01:55:14.190 --> 01:55:18.090]
Get it done because then once Josh gets that job, we get him that computer.

[01:55:18.230 --> 01:55:21.890]
Then we can send him like 50 60 articles every day because he's got nothing but time.

[01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:26.590]
It'll keep him on. It'll. Where you going, Josh? It'll keep him out of trouble.

[01:55:26.730 --> 01:55:32.970]
It'll keep me won't be getting a girlfriend of his pregnant. I mean, he'll have no time to be dealing around and doing the dirty, dirty work of the devil.

[01:55:32.970 --> 01:55:42.150]
He doesn't have a girlfriend. Well, he has several girlfriends. Like I said, that's even more reason why we need to be assessing his time more wisely.

[01:55:42.450 --> 01:55:48.830]
Okay, because you know what the three wise ladies, I mean the three wise men said what they said, cut the crap.

[01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:54.190]
Oh, cut the something like that. And of course, you see what happened to them. You don't see them no more.

[01:55:54.250 --> 01:55:57.490]
Do you know that's because they said crap one time too many. WQA him. Hello.

[01:55:59.050 --> 01:56:04.770]
Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, I am.

[01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:12.630]
I'm sure if you read that the other phone in the details on page 3a, why house to choose the suppressing signs? Did you read that yet?

[01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:16.830]
Oh, I saw on our website. Oh, didn't he? Okay, I was assured. It is.

[01:56:17.090 --> 01:56:23.030]
Oh, I'm a little. Isn't that critical? I'm glad you mentioned that. I think I might actually print that one out and read some of it. Thanks a lot.

[01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:28.230]
It's difficult, but it's on our website. All right. Thank you.

[01:56:28.450 --> 01:56:34.410]
Also, the white house, speaking of lies, you know that all those millions of new jobs, 2.6 million new jobs they were going to have.

[01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:38.850]
And they put up a report in the president's sign that they sent it to Congress and they paused it and I shiny book.

[01:56:39.130 --> 01:56:46.250]
Well, yes, why not so fast? Our bad. We screwed up. See, like I told you this morning, they had one number was right.

[01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:50.550]
The two was right, but the point six million was wrong. They're going to create two new jobs this year.

[01:56:51.530 --> 01:56:54.890]
You know what they're going to be? What president and vice president?

[01:56:57.150 --> 01:57:02.150]
That's correct. They're going to create two new jobs in November, one for Carrie and one for John Edwards, president and vice president.

[01:57:02.370 --> 01:57:10.310]
And those are the only new jobs they're going to have. The worst record, the only administration in history to lose jobs during their term in office.

[01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:12.010]
The worst since hebert Hoover.

[01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:19.050]
5.670560, 0.560 other than hebert Hoover, of course. He lost a couple of jobs, including his own.

[01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:30.190]
WQA, hello. QAM. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Listen, I'm not religious and I hate everybody from the Midwest.

[01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:37.990]
Okay. Listen, I'm with the couple contest. I actually had a question for you. Yes, sir.

[01:57:38.490 --> 01:57:46.250]
Would you allow me to try and sway the public opinion? No, because then I have to have 35 other people call and do the same. Good luck, you sir.

[01:57:46.930 --> 01:57:53.150]
And thanks for entering the contest. No, I can't do that. Basically, if you want to cheat on the outside, there's nothing we can do about that.

[01:57:53.250 --> 01:57:57.930]
People that are like filtering, getting all their friends and voting over and over. And that's just the way it is. That's what happens on the Internet.

[01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:04.750]
But as far as coming on, you're in making a plea. I can't, which is why I'm not making any commentary about anybody on there, because I don't want to swing it or sway it.

[01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:11.810]
You know what I'm saying? Swinging sway with Sammy. His gay. Can we still say that? No. 27 past noon. It can't say gay. No, mole man.

[01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:17.250]
Unless, of course, you're married. Hey, if you're starving, you want to break from the kitchen. You want a really great feast.

Re-sautful locations in sunrise, high down to 44th Street. They're on Collins Avenue just north of 163rd in North Miami Beach.

[01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:24.390]
So take the whole family, book your next business lunch and whatever the case, let them do the cooking for you at the Emile Coast takeout and deliver you available too.

[01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:35.750]
Call 954-572-3822. 954-572-3822. Lots and lots of imitators out there but take it from me. There's nothing like the Emile Coast Chinese buffet.

[02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:09.330]
If there's a butt, I smell it.

[02:00:31.210 --> 02:00:32.850]
You know what, I almost forgot to play.

[02:02:02.850 --> 02:02:05.030]
I got a few after all.

[02:02:06.690 --> 02:02:11.490]
Oh and Rodney, wow, you're shaving the shave, my...

[02:02:15.250 --> 02:02:24.610]
27-1 at 560 WDQM. So anyway, Jerry and Buddy, this brings whenever regular facts who says the confusion between Spy Killer or Spy Hunter and Spy Bot is...

[02:02:24.610 --> 02:02:33.150]
There's an odyssey on their website that he faxed to me. And they say if you were misled, the Spy Hunter or Spy Killer through Google AdWords, which I was, please contact Google.

[02:02:33.590 --> 02:02:39.350]
And then I'm going to have to go through after the show of removing Spy Killer, don't you think? Yeah, that'd be a good idea, I guess.

[02:02:40.450 --> 02:02:42.050]
I guess I'm going to have to get that off of there.

[02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:45.310]
Get it off. Or maybe, uh-huh. We still say get it off.

[02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:49.170]
No, don't say get it off and surely don't say shave my ball. Remove it.

[02:02:49.330 --> 02:02:59.770]
27-1 at 560-56705-60. 560-560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. The hot couple's contest is just smoking me at like over 7000 votes on their Reservus morning.

[02:03:00.010 --> 02:03:04.250]
I don't even, I just don't even look at it right now. WDQAM, hello.

[02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:07.890]
Yeah, I, uh, when I speak with Nielplein. Speaking.

[02:03:08.730 --> 02:03:10.990]
Yeah, I want you, Sally. Pretty damn good, Pally.

[02:03:11.630 --> 02:03:17.790]
Hey, listen, uh, I, I, I, I have to make a comment. I'd like to hear your reaction. Go right ahead, make a comment, please.

[02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:27.250]
I was watching, uh, just like your regular cable superstation. Yeah. It was one of these bad, even seagull movies with a karate chop.

[02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:31.190]
Oh, God. I saw a little violence in blood. Right.

[02:03:31.190 --> 02:03:39.110]
I had to turn it off. I, I'm not one of these, uh, you know, right wing freaks, but I'm thinking this is, uh, it's a very violent movie.

[02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:49.710]
And I stopped and I thought, you know what? This is what's wrong with the country is that it's okay to have blood and multiple compound fracture bone breaks.

[02:03:49.930 --> 02:03:55.750]
There's a community. But you can't see an area. Right. Oh, I don't think you need even say a real in no mode. Don't be saying that.

[02:03:56.110 --> 02:04:00.390]
I'm sorry. Did I just go bleep? I know you didn't get bleep, but I think starting tomorrow, you might.

[02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:10.850]
I tell you, I mean, this is what we have. We have a warm, monguing, sexually repressed people with a finger on the button and the finger somewhere else.

[02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:14.770]
And, uh, hey, I'm getting my passport. That's it. I'm out.

[02:04:15.070 --> 02:04:20.170]
Okay. I'll see you in the falls, man. He's going to be a swimmer right across Niagara Falls. He'll be coming over floating in a barrel.

[02:04:20.610 --> 02:04:27.030]
Jane and four Lauderdale says I was raised in Catholic when I was a child. Some neighbor kids whose father was a Protestant preacher of some denomination.

[02:04:27.130 --> 02:04:34.090]
I forget used to physically attack me for being a st. worshiper. I guess this guy that called before. I mean, I'm a little bit slow today because it is Thursday already.

[02:04:34.630 --> 02:04:42.710]
Uh, Northern Ireland to be a great place to look at right now. So your little kids can't even walk to school because the Protestants and the Catholics throw bricks at each other. Okay.

[02:04:42.710 --> 02:04:51.050]
And at the kids, that's those Irish Protestant. That's not a Christian for the right. Anyway, she says now I wonder where they ever got that idea. Could have been their father. Right.

[02:04:51.610 --> 02:05:05.070]
The devil, a st. worshiper. Don't stop since Jane and four Lauderdale, I'm a sweetheart. I'm plotting right ahead. Northern Ireland is a classic example, man, where they continue dropping when a bomba grandeur, whatever it's convenient because.

[02:05:05.070 --> 02:05:12.330]
And then of course they have the Protestant marching days when they all put on their orange outfits and they marched through the Catholic neighborhoods as if they were going to show you.

[02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:17.770]
Yeah, we're going to show you a thing or two and as a matter of fact, they do they bend over part right in front of each home.

[02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:27.830]
I mean, come on, sir, when you grow up already, the world could be a beautiful place. I know it sounds ridiculous because it's ludicrous because it's the biggest taxes and business going anywhere.

[02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:39.530]
The biggest racket any place is religion and the biggest reader of hate. Look back at 9.11 look at all this crap that's going on the world. And this is why this media that we've got there's so scared crapless.

[02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:55.770]
So he said it again, but I put the less on it. See less crap more filling. I put their so scared crapless of organized religion. They don't dare. I mean only once in a great while, when you see somebody on there who even like Bill Maher, whom I can't stand by the way, but nonetheless, I will give him credit for talking about religion being a pile of crap when he was on king that night.

[02:05:55.770 --> 02:06:10.450]
And Larry kept saying, uh huh. Yeah. It's all you had to say because he wasn't going to touch that with the 10 foot, Mazaza. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. The only religion man is dietary duty as a man. Go get some good, Deli. Eat yourself.

[02:06:10.450 --> 02:06:36.530]
You're not going to get a certain public don't go your clog your arteries too much and it'll be a fine life. Okay. And leave all the rest of us alone with a gobbledygook and the passion of Jesus and Abraham and holy Moses and all of these things. You know, enough of that bull crap too many important things going desperate things going on in the world today and almost nobody's got the balls to talk about him openly and honestly I get this interloper call which is fine. He's entitled calling in from somewhere in the Midwest. He hasn't figured out where he's from yet. Maybe from hunger.

[02:06:37.150 --> 02:06:47.510]
Give me a lecture about all over how can you say that like it like it's true. How can you say these things. Very simple. I open my mouth and watch my lips move. Okay, sir. Watch my lips.

[02:06:47.690 --> 02:07:03.390]
Back them. Meet me. Meet me. That amazing. Just look at the speaker on your radio and watch the move. WQ. I am. Hello. Thank you. Yes, sir. How's it going? It's going great. Hey, I don't think everyone is a good choice for carry to be a body mate. The odd. What do you say that?

[02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:15.310]
Well, because first of all, carry is not going to want to go better looking and speak better than me. Yeah, second of all, I think you want to take a runny mate who can attack you at a party and never just a nice guy. He needs to get popped.

[02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:28.430]
Graham. That's what he needs. He wants to in Florida. Never happened. Why do you think I agree with him? All four Bob Graham. I like Bobby Graham. I think he would be fine and I would guarantee a floor to win. But see, John Edwards, you're looking at the wrong way because the fact Edwards looks living and breathing.

[02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:43.550]
He would distract attention when they're on the stage together. People would look at carry and see how scary he looks. So it would be good. You don't think the people would say that he's been running instead? I think it could cause. Well, I don't think so because the polls are not saying that yet. And in addition, which you'll see a week from next Tuesday.

[02:07:44.250 --> 02:07:50.650]
I think he's going to wipe the floor with them because they don't have those those interlopers. The Republicans independence voting. The other primers like to do in Wisconsin.

[02:07:51.310 --> 02:08:10.630]
Right. I don't keep Bobby Graham. I know he's a little seen how he could do a job. I'm all for Bobby, baby. And those BDIs, man, he's the man. He's a man. Take it easy. Thank you. He's I agree with him. I don't have to do a selling job with me. I love Bobby Graham. He was the first one talking about the whole phony war and about this whole connection between al-Qaeda and the Sodom, which there wasn't any in the first place.

[02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:17.330]
And about all these terrorist cells that we have here. We're doing a pretty crappy job of it and all this other garbage. He's the he was the first one long before Howard Dean.

[02:08:17.770 --> 02:08:26.930]
I feel sad about the whole Howard Dean thing because he he degenerated from really having balls in the first place to just I guess bad advisors or bad. I don't know.

[02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:35.210]
Or maybe he woke up one day and looked at his wife and said just hell with it. Now seriously, I don't know what happened in because he became more and more feeble.

[02:08:35.210 --> 02:08:39.910]
Well, I kept telling you during the debates, boy, I was really disappointed in the beginning. He was like a house on fire.

[02:08:40.810 --> 02:08:45.570]
And he had all this momentum. He had the young people all whipped up into a frenzy. There was the big internet movement. He was raising all of that money.

[02:08:45.890 --> 02:08:54.110]
And then he just became a more funbling and bubbly. And I think one of the point that really started making me wonder was that that the brown and black debate in Iowa, remember that?

[02:08:54.910 --> 02:09:01.110]
Yes. And sharp and asked him how many black members there were in his cabinet. And when he was governor of Vermont and but a bit better.

[02:09:01.110 --> 02:09:06.990]
And he he totally fumbled it and then the next day said he wasn't prepared for the question. This was a question about race.

[02:09:07.170 --> 02:09:18.110]
It was the black and brown debate. About minorities and he wasn't prepared for the question. He wasn't prepared to run. That was the problem. He did a lot of ballsy things of great, but he just tore.

[02:09:18.890 --> 02:09:28.710]
And you know, people are just going to say, well, you know, the media was unfair. That's true. But then this is the point when you're running your presidential campaign, you can't be unpresidential because they need you to the cross.

[02:09:28.710 --> 02:09:34.910]
I'm sorry. That was a bad question. Okay. I'm so sorry. I apologize.

[02:09:35.470 --> 02:10:04.890]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I

[02:10:22.890 --> 02:10:34.870]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I

[02:10:38.090 --> 02:10:45.570]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:51.830]
Yes, they do, but there's all the people think it's so odd.

[02:10:52.190 --> 02:10:56.050]
Now he's the reason that we have any today's saying.

[02:10:56.390 --> 02:11:04.070]
And two are dead, and he's the reason that all the Christians praise him.

[02:11:04.270 --> 02:11:12.270]
Two are dead, and they praise him, praise him, kneel down, kneel down, praise him,

[02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:19.150]
kneel down the leaning war of 40 crown, two are dead, and dead, and dead, and do.

[02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:26.130]
Two are dead, and they praise him, ye BMW, two are dead, and dead, and done.

[02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:31.450]
He's the chicken, One Jedi, two jeden, two peoples, and two Muslims.

[02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:40.130]
Two are dead, and they praise Jones Law and상 Law andang Law, two who have creed,

[02:11:40.130 --> 02:11:42.870]
I said 560 WQ, I'm on a thank the guy to call before.

[02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:46.150]
I had forgotten, I didn't forget, but like put away in the back of my mind.

[02:11:46.450 --> 02:11:49.750]
In behind Harold and Sandy Fisher and Walter Ross and Red Ross, I have more important

[02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:50.410]
things to think about.

[02:11:50.890 --> 02:11:52.290]
About the Bob Jones University flat.

[02:11:52.610 --> 02:11:54.150]
I thought I would ever forget about Bob Jones.

[02:11:54.850 --> 02:11:56.750]
Pat Buchanan, you'll recall, spoke there.

[02:11:57.510 --> 02:11:58.470]
Yeah, before W.

[02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:59.090]
Right.

[02:11:59.170 --> 02:11:59.590]
But at any rate.

[02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:03.970]
Here's an article I found on the internet just now, did a little search on Bob Jones University

[02:12:03.970 --> 02:12:05.930]
to come up with something really quick to give you an idea.

[02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:09.050]
And again, for that guy who's looking for an education from the midwest who can't find

[02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:09.370]
one there.

[02:12:10.190 --> 02:12:12.090]
Vina Thomas writes, Bob Jones, true colors.

[02:12:12.930 --> 02:12:16.810]
George W. Bush was heavily criticized for appearing in Bob Jones University in unacquitted

[02:12:16.810 --> 02:12:18.970]
college known for being racist and anti-catholic.

[02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:22.670]
He's made no attempt to distance himself from any of the philosophers of the university,

[02:12:23.130 --> 02:12:25.630]
perhaps leading some people to think he's reported the college's beliefs.

[02:12:26.130 --> 02:12:30.330]
Though Bush denied the allegations and subsequently apologized, the image remained in the public

[02:12:30.330 --> 02:12:30.670]
side.

[02:12:31.170 --> 02:12:34.470]
Not sure how a university could be both racist and anti-catholic and get away with it.

[02:12:34.710 --> 02:12:35.990]
I decided to do some research.

[02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:38.670]
I located the college's website and began to browse.

[02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:42.830]
Not surprisingly, the site had an entire section devoted to recent press coverage and in

[02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:43.970]
defense of the institution.

[02:12:44.590 --> 02:12:48.490]
Bob Jones, the tour president of Bob Jones University, wrote a formal press release in

[02:12:48.490 --> 02:12:49.270]
support of his college.

[02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:50.990]
It reads like a used car salesman's pitch.

[02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:55.330]
Bob Jones manages to alienate half the people in his speech whom he so desperately needs

[02:12:55.330 --> 02:12:56.670]
to convince to support his college.

[02:12:57.070 --> 02:13:01.450]
While championing religious freedom in the U.S., he mocks Islam, Judaism, and Roman Catholicism,

[02:13:01.610 --> 02:13:04.430]
as he wonders why some of their fundamental beliefs haven't been attacked sooner.

[02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:08.830]
Wait, isn't he supposed to be trying to convince us that he and his university are not anti-catholic?

[02:13:09.650 --> 02:13:13.090]
Religious freedom and allowing others to believe and practice what they want is one of the ideas

[02:13:13.090 --> 02:13:17.110]
upon which this country was founded, yet if Bob Jones kept insisting that he was not

[02:13:17.110 --> 02:13:19.270]
anti-catholic, what would cause others to think so?

[02:13:19.550 --> 02:13:20.810]
There must be a complication here.

[02:13:21.390 --> 02:13:24.970]
Sure enough, upon reading a transcript of Larry King interviewing Bob Jones, I found a clue.

[02:13:25.450 --> 02:13:28.810]
Stated Larry King, but if you call the Pope the Antichrist, you'll offend Catholics.

[02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:33.290]
Instead of refuming this statement or denying he'd ever done such a thing, he instead supported

[02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:33.710]
himself.

[02:13:34.130 --> 02:13:38.270]
Yes, but you know, article six of the Westminster Confession calls the Pope an anti-Christie

[02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:42.990]
toward a Jones, not anti-catholic, his repeated denials of anti-catholic beliefs were fast-waring

[02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:46.530]
thin, especially when he could hardly make it through a denial without bashing Catholics.

[02:13:47.150 --> 02:13:50.870]
Undoubtedly, his case wasn't helpful when Larry King asked, did you call George's W. Bush's

[02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:53.110]
father a devil and Jones replied, you know I did.

[02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:57.550]
Bob Jones seemed very confused by King and managed to trip up often and look like an idiot,

[02:13:57.910 --> 02:14:01.130]
as Jones later ranted and raved about all the liberals at Harvard and Yale King had

[02:14:01.130 --> 02:14:03.390]
to remind him that George W. Bush graduated from Yale.

[02:14:04.050 --> 02:14:07.390]
Jones had nothing to counter with except, well it's possible for a man to come through the

[02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:08.490]
system and not buy into it.

[02:14:09.150 --> 02:14:10.610]
What about the allegations of racism?

[02:14:12.090 --> 02:14:15.510]
In the course of defending himself from such allegations, Jones managed to insinuate that

[02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:18.350]
blacks and other races come from broken homes and abusive families.

[02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:22.050]
Is he close and how to support himself or does he just have opinions too strong to hide

[02:14:22.050 --> 02:14:22.670]
for very long?

[02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:24.230]
What exactly were the allegations?

[02:14:24.970 --> 02:14:28.510]
Apparently, Bob Jones University has had an official ban on interracial dating for many,

[02:14:28.530 --> 02:14:29.030]
many years.

[02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:30.310]
It's justification.

[02:14:30.710 --> 02:14:34.250]
We stand against the one world government against the coming world of Antichrist, which

[02:14:34.250 --> 02:14:38.090]
is a one world system of blending all differences, of blending of national differences, economic

[02:14:38.090 --> 02:14:41.130]
differences, church differences, into one big ecumenical world.

[02:14:42.230 --> 02:14:44.370]
BJU says it would prefer to keep the races separate.

[02:14:44.490 --> 02:14:47.950]
As a student put it, my own personal belief is that God has made races perfect.

[02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:51.930]
God has made whites perfect in blacks or in orientals and he hasn't given us any reason

[02:14:51.930 --> 02:14:52.830]
to win him against those races.

[02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:54.850]
But he has made them perfect.

[02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:57.870]
It's not a policy that discriminates against the whites or the blacks or the orientals,

[02:14:57.870 --> 02:15:00.210]
but it's a policy that's equal of two or three of the races.

[02:15:00.670 --> 02:15:02.170]
Excuse me, all three of the races?

[02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:05.930]
Don't they teach students at BJU that not everyone falls so neatly in a one of these three

[02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:06.350]
categories?

[02:15:07.230 --> 02:15:11.170]
After the media spotlight hit BJU, suddenly the ban on interracial dating was dropped.

[02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:14.950]
Their sudden decision to eliminate the ban troubled me almost as much as they're having

[02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:15.110]
it.

[02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:19.450]
Said Jones, we have a broader testimony, and if all anybody can see is this rule which

[02:15:19.450 --> 02:15:22.530]
we never talk about or preach, which most of our students could even tell you what it

[02:15:22.530 --> 02:15:24.410]
is, why should we have this here as an obstacle?

[02:15:25.190 --> 02:15:28.650]
If Jones claims this rule is so insignificant, then why was it implemented for so many

[02:15:28.650 --> 02:15:31.150]
years and why the students have such strong views favoring the ban?

[02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:35.170]
On the reverse side, if the rule was so important to the university as it seemingly implied

[02:15:35.170 --> 02:15:38.070]
by its existence, why did they instantly eliminate it when it was attacked?

[02:15:38.670 --> 02:15:39.950]
What about standing up for your beliefs?

[02:15:40.230 --> 02:15:42.050]
What are Bob Jones' universities' true beliefs?

[02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:44.330]
What does Bob Jones' deterred really stand for?

[02:15:44.650 --> 02:15:46.110]
Does he have the strength to stand for anything?

[02:15:47.070 --> 02:15:51.050]
What bothers me most is that someone like Bob Jones can preach what he likes, including

[02:15:51.050 --> 02:15:54.790]
prejudice and animosity toward other religions, and can shape the minds of impressionable college

[02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:57.250]
students under the guise of freedom of religion.

[02:15:57.410 --> 02:15:58.290]
Where do we draw the line?

[02:15:58.770 --> 02:16:02.650]
Sadly, Bob Jones can stand on the soapbox and preach what he likes and no one can stop

[02:16:02.650 --> 02:16:02.850]
him.

[02:16:03.110 --> 02:16:05.090]
What a beautiful column by Vena Thomas on the Internet.

[02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.850]
Isn't that nice?

[02:16:06.630 --> 02:16:07.730]
Christians don't hate.

[02:16:09.810 --> 02:16:13.030]
I mean, just a shock in this Mayan at Colorado's Voice.

[02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:16.130]
I can't believe you're saying these things like you really believe them.

[02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:19.150]
My bad.

[02:16:19.650 --> 02:16:20.250]
My bad.

[02:16:20.250 --> 02:16:21.130]
You are bad.

[02:16:21.490 --> 02:16:22.170]
Bad man.

[02:16:22.210 --> 02:16:23.650]
I'm a bad guy because I tell the truth.

[02:16:24.630 --> 02:16:27.170]
Let's see, Boston, the music's the humidious facts this in.

[02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:31.110]
Libraries to get 124,000 CDs this spring is part of a settlement.

[02:16:31.670 --> 02:16:35.530]
The music selection libraries across the state of Massachusetts is about to get much better

[02:16:35.530 --> 02:16:41.150]
as part of a $143 million national settlement of a lawsuit over CD prices, the 488 public

[02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:46.590]
libraries in Massachusetts will be receiving 124,000 music discs, more than 1900 different

[02:16:46.590 --> 02:16:47.370]
titles this spring.

[02:16:48.210 --> 02:16:52.690]
In addition, 68,000 consumers who submitted claims for refund should be seeing checks for

[02:16:52.690 --> 02:16:56.450]
almost 14 bucks a piece in the mailbox in the coming week of 30 General Tom Raleigh

[02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:56.730]
said.

[02:16:57.730 --> 02:17:01.090]
Massachusetts was one of 40 states that agreed to settle a lawsuit which accused major

[02:17:01.090 --> 02:17:05.150]
record companies and large music retailers of conspiring to set minimum prices on music

[02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:06.190]
under that settlement.

[02:17:06.190 --> 02:17:09.050]
It totaled a total of three and a half million people are to get checks in schools across

[02:17:09.050 --> 02:17:12.550]
the country will get $75.7 million worth of CDs.

[02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.910]
So there you go.

[02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:18.030]
It says so there are your refunds and buy a Schmidt load of blank CDs and burn baby

[02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:22.450]
burn says the facts are like that shame on you sir shame on you they're going to be

[02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:26.890]
and of course if you don't get that spyware and software and upware and inware and out

[02:17:26.890 --> 02:17:29.290]
ware underwear.

[02:17:29.290 --> 02:17:30.330]
I'm so nervous.

[02:17:30.510 --> 02:17:34.330]
Oh, no, that I installed that the spy killer thing Eric on me really nervous.

[02:17:34.330 --> 02:17:36.910]
Where did you get that and you better uninstall it?

[02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:37.950]
I all this just calm down.

[02:17:37.950 --> 02:17:41.370]
Eric, okay, I'm going to I'm going to make any stories for tomorrow just to keep you

[02:17:41.370 --> 02:17:42.350]
on your on your toes.

[02:17:44.210 --> 02:17:45.010]
All right.

[02:17:45.430 --> 02:17:50.570]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Lime.

[02:17:50.670 --> 02:17:52.150]
I just got a big line out there.

[02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:58.330]
QA fan from now to is that the senior stereo and Pembroke Pines 9 0 1 9 Pines of Boulevard

[02:17:58.330 --> 02:17:59.310]
that's on Pines in Vegas.

[02:17:59.730 --> 02:18:02.990]
Stop by to win T-shirts, Panthers tickets and take a look at Scott and see exactly what

[02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:04.310]
we were talking about all that time.

[02:18:04.470 --> 02:18:05.890]
Believe me one look and you'll know.

[02:18:05.890 --> 02:18:06.490]
Won't they know?

[02:18:07.970 --> 02:18:09.350]
Tell what they'll know.

[02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:10.450]
Tell me to QA him.

[02:18:10.550 --> 02:18:10.650]
Hello.

[02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:13.070]
Yes, I'll be sure good.

[02:18:13.550 --> 02:18:17.990]
I think maybe since his national brother, we should have a barbecue for something home

[02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.330]
is real.

[02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:18.990]
Yeah.

[02:18:20.410 --> 02:18:20.850]
Yeah.

[02:18:22.130 --> 02:18:22.910]
How about you?

[02:18:23.510 --> 02:18:24.350]
How about you?

[02:18:24.370 --> 02:18:25.210]
How about your ass?

[02:18:26.170 --> 02:18:27.290]
That's the crazy guy.

[02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:29.170]
Yeah, but have a nice day.

[02:18:29.350 --> 02:18:31.890]
We've got a few crazy people and of course that's what it's all about.

[02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:33.850]
WQM.

[02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:34.070]
Hello.

[02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:35.190]
Not there.

[02:18:35.410 --> 02:18:35.790]
QA him.

[02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:36.010]
Hello.

[02:18:38.630 --> 02:18:39.070]
QAM.

[02:18:39.490 --> 02:18:39.870]
Neil.

[02:18:40.170 --> 02:18:41.690]
Beasley Broadcasting at its finest.

[02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:42.170]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:45.910]
Are there any countries in the world that allowed gay marriages?

[02:18:46.570 --> 02:18:46.790]
Yes.

[02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:48.210]
Which ones?

[02:18:49.170 --> 02:18:49.510]
Netherlands.

[02:18:50.590 --> 02:18:50.910]
Canada.

[02:18:52.690 --> 02:18:54.930]
It's about to say if we thought we were going to do it here first.

[02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:56.030]
I don't think that's going to happen.

[02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:58.950]
We're about as cutting edge as a wooden spoon.

[02:18:59.550 --> 02:18:59.990]
Yeah.

[02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:04.030]
I don't think it has much hope, but I hope it goes through.

[02:19:05.810 --> 02:19:06.950]
Well, good luck to us, pal.

[02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:07.990]
Laura, you'll be pleased.

[02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.890]
You'll be pleased no more.

[02:19:09.010 --> 02:19:09.410]
Bush, don't like it.

[02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:12.070]
Will you have gotten married if you had that opportunity?

[02:19:12.590 --> 02:19:12.730]
No.

[02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:16.490]
Anybody gets married of any orientation has got to be a lunatic.

[02:19:16.630 --> 02:19:17.150]
Good luck, you sir.

[02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:19.250]
I'm all against marriage.

[02:19:19.430 --> 02:19:20.230]
Headless sexual, homosexual.

[02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:22.550]
I mean, it doesn't require making babies.

[02:19:22.770 --> 02:19:24.910]
That went out with the bathwater.

[02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:26.590]
Everybody in their brother.

[02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:28.250]
Even Letterman, for example, let it all conquer.

[02:19:28.390 --> 02:19:29.010]
He's making babies.

[02:19:29.010 --> 02:19:29.490]
He's married.

[02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:30.950]
He ain't got to get married, you said.

[02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:33.810]
So what's that got to do with anything?

[02:19:34.350 --> 02:19:35.950]
Oh, there goes all our more days out the window.

[02:19:35.970 --> 02:19:36.950]
Well, that's all you straight people.

[02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:40.330]
I don't see any gay people overpopulating the world making too many babies.

[02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:41.670]
That's what I'm thinking.

[02:19:41.770 --> 02:19:42.590]
I could be wrong about that.

[02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:45.530]
Although two of those dicks out there in Frisco that they were interviewing that got married

[02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:45.970]
last week.

[02:19:46.770 --> 02:19:51.050]
And they said, oh, well, we're planning on having a family and having some babies.

[02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:52.990]
And I thought to myself, oh, OK.

[02:19:53.610 --> 02:19:54.390]
Now, how does that work?

[02:19:54.990 --> 02:19:56.070]
Oh, there's a variety of ways.

[02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:57.250]
If you're talking about it.

[02:19:57.250 --> 02:20:01.850]
If they were talking about adopting, right, maybe they were talking about having like those

[02:20:01.850 --> 02:20:05.130]
Michael Jackson type babies, you know, you got really nice, wonderful guy.

[02:20:05.370 --> 02:20:09.050]
He wrote and Josh will be happy to inseminate, oh, practically anybody.

[02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:10.650]
Yeah, but they want to be art.

[02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:12.570]
I'm sure they don't want to like, oh, see your thing.

[02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:15.590]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, we got the sheet that we borrowed from the.

[02:20:15.810 --> 02:20:17.870]
No, no, no, no, no, only from a test tube.

[02:20:18.170 --> 02:20:18.410]
OK.

[02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:21.730]
So get out your test tube and fill that baby up and the.

[02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.830]
I'll bring the baby there.

[02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:25.190]
As long as I get to watch the turkey baser.

[02:20:25.330 --> 02:20:25.590]
Sure.

[02:20:26.790 --> 02:20:30.770]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 0, the AFL CIO endorsing a John Kerry's bid.

[02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:33.310]
I love that music.

[02:20:33.490 --> 02:20:35.770]
It's about the only good thing on CNN is that music at the end of the hour.

[02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:37.330]
I give goosebumps.

[02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:40.450]
The worst music they play is the theme to crossfire.

[02:20:40.650 --> 02:20:43.310]
They probably do that intentionally because they want that show off the year badly.

[02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:45.610]
It's a horrible show.

[02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:49.370]
And the thing with all of these shows is they'll get into some really intense, like the

[02:20:49.370 --> 02:20:50.250]
future of the world is in.

[02:20:50.350 --> 02:20:50.550]
You got it.

[02:20:50.830 --> 02:20:51.870]
And then you hear the music in the back.

[02:20:51.970 --> 02:20:52.810]
Well, we got a break.

[02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:53.110]
Sorry.

[02:20:53.250 --> 02:20:54.230]
Thank you very much for being with us.

[02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:56.290]
And you're like Chris Matthew says, oh, you're great.

[02:20:56.410 --> 02:20:56.970]
You're a great guest.

[02:20:57.250 --> 02:20:58.030]
Everybody's great with him.

[02:20:58.050 --> 02:20:58.930]
He gets on my nerves.

[02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:00.750]
I mean, he's bossy.

[02:21:00.750 --> 02:21:03.750]
I'll say that before he just he just he'll ask somebody here.

[02:21:03.810 --> 02:21:05.390]
He's always got to be the center of attraction.

[02:21:05.390 --> 02:21:07.030]
In other words, I don't know why he has the guest on.

[02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.750]
They're like a prop.

[02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:08.770]
He'll ask the question.

[02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:09.730]
They'll start to answer it.

[02:21:09.810 --> 02:21:13.070]
And then he just continue jumping in to make it look like he's a hard-ass interviewer.

[02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:14.410]
But he doesn't let him say anything.

[02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:15.590]
Does he ever reach?

[02:21:15.870 --> 02:21:16.950]
Can he talk like a normal person?

[02:21:17.170 --> 02:21:17.330]
No.

[02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:18.850]
He's not capable of doing that.

[02:21:19.630 --> 02:21:21.470]
So he's one of how many reasons?

[02:21:22.050 --> 02:21:25.810]
No, I nobody watches MSNBC except you and me once in a great while.

[02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:27.470]
Like in the morning for I'mus for a few chuckles.

[02:21:28.130 --> 02:21:30.150]
And of course for our good friend, Bo Diedel.

[02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:34.170]
1256 at 560 WQAM.

[02:21:34.410 --> 02:21:36.790]
If you're thinking to buy in a new car or truck, don't buy a beetle.

[02:21:37.390 --> 02:21:41.310]
If you want to save really big and invite you to save a hell of a lot of cash at Armstrong's

[02:21:41.310 --> 02:21:42.430]
Toyota of Homestead.

[02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:45.890]
You'll fund him on US 1 just 20 easy minutes out of the 836.

[02:21:46.690 --> 02:21:49.810]
Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead is worth the drive no matter where you are because you're

[02:21:49.810 --> 02:21:53.550]
going to save yourself thousands and thousands of great new unbeatable Toyota's.

I'm sorry.

[02:22:58.730 --> 02:22:59.890]
I'm at great new Toyota.

Live live and local.

[02:23:02.610 --> 02:23:04.510]
We're sports radio five 60s.

[02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:06.130]
You ain't got to do a M.

[02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:09.090]
This is Jimmy Feibiker.

[02:23:09.430 --> 02:23:10.450]
You need to know I'm Jimmy.

[02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:13.270]
I still listen to the one to two hour.

[02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:14.750]
You price a lord.

[02:23:15.470 --> 02:23:18.230]
On the stake of blade, this is television that it's best.

[02:23:18.310 --> 02:23:21.110]
Diana, looks like you're going to be going to jail for DUI.

[02:23:21.370 --> 02:23:23.130]
What are the cops say to you when he stopped you?

[02:23:27.090 --> 02:23:28.930]
Your blood alcohol was pretty high.

[02:23:29.170 --> 02:23:30.410]
How did you feel the day after?

[02:23:30.730 --> 02:23:33.530]
I got the sweetest pain all over.

[02:23:33.650 --> 02:23:36.490]
You're probably going to have a cellmate that thinks you're kind of cute.

[02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:38.110]
What do you think's going to happen?

[02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:40.870]
Diana, be strong.

[02:23:41.310 --> 02:23:42.170]
You can do it.

[02:23:42.170 --> 02:23:44.210]
It's a key to me, hey.

[02:23:45.250 --> 02:23:47.750]
What are you going to say the moment you get out of jail?

[02:23:47.890 --> 02:23:52.150]
I want the luck to know.

[02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:55.170]
This has been a presentation of ABC News.

[02:23:56.390 --> 02:23:57.650]
101 and 560.

[02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:58.590]
It's our big one to two hour.

[02:23:58.670 --> 02:24:01.330]
Mad Dog at two, Hopper at four, Hurricane Island at seven.

[02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:02.550]
The big O.

[02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:04.350]
At the NFL Combine, whatever the hell it is.

[02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:05.190]
Don't tell me again, Josh.

[02:24:05.290 --> 02:24:05.690]
I don't want to know.

[02:24:05.810 --> 02:24:06.410]
8 to 10 tonight.

[02:24:07.170 --> 02:24:10.110]
And then 8K at 10, Joe and Mark overnight, 2 to 5 and a morning.

[02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:12.290]
Don't forget, Joe and Mark tonight, 10, 30 to 12, 30.

[02:24:12.390 --> 02:24:15.910]
If the sand bar grill in a grove, stop out of wind tickets and t-shirts.

[02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:18.310]
Our usual very low budget crappy QM prizes.

[02:24:18.470 --> 02:24:23.690]
And enjoy $3,000, back in back lights tonight, 10, 30 with Joe and Mark at the sand bar in a grove.

[02:24:23.730 --> 02:24:26.010]
They'll be in the best imitation of Diana Ross.

[02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:29.150]
743 votes on a pool not too bad.

[02:24:30.390 --> 02:24:31.930]
What's your take on a religious right?

[02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:35.090]
There's nothing about hate mongering morons, 237.

[02:24:36.030 --> 02:24:38.710]
The whole religion thing is a big racket, 213.

[02:24:39.450 --> 02:24:41.930]
I don't mind if they just leave me alone, 94.

[02:24:42.270 --> 02:24:43.230]
In other words, let them do what they want.

[02:24:43.330 --> 02:24:44.270]
But leave me alone, would you please?

[02:24:44.410 --> 02:24:44.550]
No.

[02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:47.090]
They're full of Shiite, 66.

[02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:49.870]
They gave their brains away to fakers, 48.

[02:24:50.170 --> 02:24:50.770]
I'm one of them.

[02:24:50.850 --> 02:24:53.170]
Praise God, 44, 5.9%.

[02:24:53.170 --> 02:24:54.970]
And they're the biggest perverts of all, 41.

[02:24:55.970 --> 02:24:57.010]
How dare you say that?

[02:24:58.690 --> 02:25:00.170]
Everything you need to know about religion says,

[02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:03.670]
Joe, the factur is this, basic message, please be tolerant of religion.

[02:25:03.970 --> 02:25:04.910]
My religion, not yours.

[02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:06.630]
Sounds like that Boka Bryant fit.

[02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:09.330]
Or else, or else, or else, or else, well,

[02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:13.990]
well, you'll meet your maker at Mount of Son of Shuchu with a bullet of love.

[02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.590]
56705.

[02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:16.750]
So you speak of the Antichrist.

[02:25:16.750 --> 02:25:18.190]
They got that great article about Walmart.

[02:25:18.430 --> 02:25:19.690]
But it's going too long.

[02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:20.370]
It's on our website.

[02:25:21.350 --> 02:25:22.690]
Walmart nation, the race to the bottom.

[02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:29.730]
Los Angeles is not my kind of town, but the Angelenos are about to take a stand that ought to be applauded across the country since Floyd McKay.

[02:25:30.310 --> 02:25:34.490]
That stand is to say no to Walmart Supercenter that retailing giant hopes to open in the city.

[02:25:34.490 --> 02:25:36.870]
These superstars are not your father's Walmart.

[02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:41.150]
They're monstrous sprawling over some 25 acres and employing up to 600 workers.

[02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:42.930]
Their lure, of course, is lower prices.

[02:25:43.430 --> 02:25:49.110]
Walmart, it seems to me, he says, it minimizes the race to the bottom that has the US by the throat as the 21st century opens.

[02:25:49.950 --> 02:25:53.470]
Why do people shop at these behemoths when they know full well that they're driving out of existence?

[02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:56.390]
Small businesses owned and operated by their neighbors, employing other neighbors?

[02:25:56.930 --> 02:26:02.270]
They shop because of price and they're forced to do so by the declining standard of living we've offered working people for more than a generation.

[02:26:02.270 --> 02:26:09.470]
People who work for minimum wage would little or no benefits who can't afford to fix their car or their kids' teeth have no choice but to search out the lowest prices.

[02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:16.050]
Walmart buys offshore without apology and for the cheapest possible prices from companies paying the lowest possible wages.

[02:26:16.810 --> 02:26:23.950]
As jobs in America are lost to foreign sweatshops, the Feed the Walmart engine, American workers are forced to accept jobs in lower pay with bad working conditions.

[02:26:24.430 --> 02:26:29.410]
They're funneled to Walmart's promise of cheap goods and affect patronizing the very companies that cause their economic misery.

[02:26:29.410 --> 02:26:32.410]
This is a cruel travesty on working people in these countries.

[02:26:32.970 --> 02:26:41.530]
All of their practice is alleged abuses of labor laws, hiring illegals and the low rate of pay and benefits at Walmart served to depress the labor market in communities in which the giant is located.

[02:26:41.930 --> 02:26:44.490]
This is a major factor in LA's opposition to the Super Center.

[02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:48.110]
They're going to have the balls to say to Walmart. You can be the whole thing on our website, please.

[02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:50.470]
Just say no to Walmart.

[02:26:52.390 --> 02:26:54.330]
And what was I saying this the other day pretty soon?

[02:26:54.330 --> 02:27:04.330]
In a matter just a few years, they're going to be like five, six companies own everything, all the retail outlets, all the restaurants, all the newspapers, all the radio stations, all the TV stations.

[02:27:04.330 --> 02:27:10.150]
You name it, it'll be them and either do business with them or work for them or buff on Google, baby. That's it. That's your choice.

[02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.830]
WQAM, hello.

[02:27:13.290 --> 02:27:13.550]
Male.

[02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:14.470]
Yes, sir.

[02:27:14.730 --> 02:27:20.250]
I played golf for the good friend of yours and a great guy. I had no idea this guy was a thief because you made him out to be a monster.

[02:27:21.570 --> 02:27:22.230]
Then listen.

[02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:23.290]
You know who he is?

[02:27:23.650 --> 02:27:24.190]
No, I don't.

[02:27:24.210 --> 02:27:25.270]
I'm a mom. I'm a mom. I'm a mom.

[02:27:25.330 --> 02:27:26.850]
Yeah, I made about to be a monster.

[02:27:27.290 --> 02:27:29.530]
His initials are JT. It's not James Taylor.

[02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:31.230]
JT?

[02:27:31.490 --> 02:27:34.590]
I played golf for them today. I'm being honest with you. He was a really nice guy.

[02:27:34.690 --> 02:27:36.350]
I have no idea who to. Why don't you give me a name?

[02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:37.970]
How about Jack? Something.

[02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:39.930]
How about dumping it?

[02:27:41.450 --> 02:27:46.630]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound, five, 60 on a GAT and T in Verizon Wireless Live. Is that sad or what?

[02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:48.110]
I'm beside myself.

[02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:49.070]
Yeah, me too.

[02:27:50.690 --> 02:27:53.930]
Anyway, the beat goes on. WQAM, hello.

[02:27:54.830 --> 02:27:55.630]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:56.270]
Pretty good.

[02:27:56.810 --> 02:27:58.810]
Is it a Scream single? I like a rest.

[02:28:00.670 --> 02:28:03.190]
Hey, listen. Single or not, man. You can have all you want.

[02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.510]
Reckos.

[02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:04.490]
Plenty there for everybody.

[02:28:04.750 --> 02:28:05.250]
No, she's a double.

[02:28:06.330 --> 02:28:06.970]
Double wide.

[02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:13.510]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound, five, 60 on a GAT and T in Verizon Wireless Live.

[02:28:14.270 --> 02:28:14.870]
WQAM, hello.

[02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:18.130]
That you has killed Jesus. You're bastards.

[02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:21.510]
You're bastard. That was Mel Gibson's daddy.

[02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:25.650]
Have a nice life, Danny. Okay. Give yourself some help before it's too late.

[02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:26.750]
I think it's too late anyway.

[02:28:26.890 --> 02:28:28.170]
That's anybody's 80 or what?

[02:28:28.350 --> 02:28:29.530]
89 or something?

[02:28:29.970 --> 02:28:31.070]
He's 122.

[02:28:32.450 --> 02:28:33.070]
WQAM, hello.

[02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:35.650]
He's just misunderstood. Hello.

[02:28:37.530 --> 02:28:40.250]
WQAM listening with me in a car with a radio wheel out.

[02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:42.290]
You're squeezing it. No time to wait, man.

[02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:44.570]
They're didlin' it. WQAM, hello.

[02:28:45.330 --> 02:28:46.230]
Hi. Can we have?

[02:28:46.690 --> 02:28:47.390]
Yes it is.

[02:28:47.790 --> 02:28:49.750]
Oh, hi, Neil. I don't know if you've written a paper.

[02:28:50.270 --> 02:28:57.690]
There was a company that got a contract to supply canteens and all these things like that.

[02:28:58.050 --> 02:29:03.030]
They lobed all to everyone else. It was an American company owned partly by this Chalabi guy.

[02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:04.350]
All of these things.

[02:29:04.530 --> 02:29:07.250]
Right. They are the criminal from Syria that we put in charge during Iraq.

[02:29:07.690 --> 02:29:08.550]
Right. Right. Right. Right.

[02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:10.470]
And the company has never been in existence before.

[02:29:10.470 --> 02:29:15.270]
And I was reading that all this Spanish and the Polish companies that I've been doing it didn't get it now.

[02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:16.330]
They're all pissed off.

[02:29:16.510 --> 02:29:22.530]
And to me, it's unbelievable that the corruption now is extending even to the people that they've hand picked.

[02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:23.510]
It's just unbelievable.

[02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:27.330]
What about Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan? He was on the Aborda Chevron.

[02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:29.450]
I didn't know that. Unbelievable.

[02:29:29.890 --> 02:29:33.470]
Well, birds of feather, man. I mean, these people don't whine up in these positions just by accident.

[02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:36.650]
Yeah. Yeah. Unbelievable. We'll keep it up, Neil.

[02:29:36.750 --> 02:29:36.950]
Thank you.

[02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:40.790]
I'll see you at the border, man. Okay. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60.

[02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:43.650]
Of course, we got our own problems here. Paul Martin, the new pure prime minister.

[02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:47.990]
There's $165 million there in graph that went to advertising agencies.

[02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:55.510]
There were buddies of the Kretchen government and Paul Martin was the secretary of finance before we became prime minister.

[02:29:55.770 --> 02:29:57.030]
And he says he don't know nothing about it.

[02:29:58.370 --> 02:30:00.910]
And nobody knows nothing about it. And John Kretchen, he just keeps saying.

[02:30:02.530 --> 02:30:03.450]
Bush is a moron.

[02:30:04.170 --> 02:30:07.110]
That's why I like John Kretchen. He had balls. He had balls to say no on Iraq.

[02:30:07.330 --> 02:30:11.150]
He had balls to say that Bush was a moron. So there's a little graph going 165 million.

[02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:14.610]
My God. They pee that away in Washington like about two minutes.

[02:30:15.530 --> 02:30:16.610]
And just a few seconds.

[02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:21.550]
5 6 7 0 5 60. We're going to get 45,000 calls on you.

[02:30:21.610 --> 02:30:24.730]
You'll see, you know, we have almost 8,000 votes on the contest.

[02:30:25.250 --> 02:30:27.130]
I didn't know that on a hot couples contest.

[02:30:27.330 --> 02:30:33.330]
Last time I checked at the top of the hour was 7,754, which means by the time we finished tomorrow at the 155.

[02:30:33.330 --> 02:30:36.850]
There could be like 10,000 votes for the hottest couple.

[02:30:37.470 --> 02:30:39.650]
So govern yourselves accordingly. That's all I can tell you.

[02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:42.150]
Hop on it. WQAM. Hello.

[02:30:44.430 --> 02:30:44.870]
QAM.

[02:30:45.330 --> 02:30:45.390]
QAM.

[02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:46.470]
7,000.

[02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:46.850]

[02:30:47.070 --> 02:30:47.370]

[02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:48.030]

[02:30:48.050 --> 02:30:48.070]
2.

[02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.150]

[02:30:48.490 --> 02:30:48.490]

[02:30:48.490 --> 02:30:48.510]
2.

[02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:48.650]
2.

[02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.710]

[02:30:48.850 --> 02:30:48.850]

[02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.870]

[02:30:48.990 --> 02:30:48.990]

[02:30:48.990 --> 02:30:48.990]

[02:30:49.090 --> 02:30:49.290]
2.

[02:30:50.130 --> 02:30:50.570]
2.

[02:30:58.690 --> 02:30:59.250]
3.

[02:30:59.250 --> 02:30:59.310]
3.

[02:30:59.310 --> 02:30:59.650]
4.

[02:30:59.650 --> 02:30:59.690]
4.

[02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.690]

[02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.690]

[02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.690]

[02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.750]
4.

[02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.750]

[02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:00.190]
6.

[02:31:00.190 --> 02:31:00.410]
4.

[02:31:00.570 --> 02:31:01.130]

[02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.250]
4.

[02:31:02.250 --> 02:31:02.250]

[02:31:02.250 --> 02:31:02.250]

[02:31:02.250 --> 02:31:02.250]

[02:31:02.370 --> 02:31:02.870]
5.

[02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.670]
4.

[02:31:04.210 --> 02:31:04.270]
5.

[02:31:04.270 --> 02:31:04.410]
4.

[02:31:08.050 --> 02:31:08.610]
5.

[02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.810]
6.

[02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.550]
4.

[02:31:15.630 --> 02:31:16.190]
5.

[02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.250]
5.

[02:31:16.250 --> 02:31:16.310]
5.

[02:31:19.930 --> 02:31:19.950]
5.

[02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:20.870]
Yeah, I realize that.

[02:31:21.730 --> 02:31:23.230]
And I wasn't too sure.

[02:31:23.330 --> 02:31:25.610]
Anyhow, are you coming to the Toronto game?

[02:31:27.010 --> 02:31:28.310]
The Toronto hockey game?

[02:31:28.390 --> 02:31:29.050]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:31:29.090 --> 02:31:29.790]
You got to the Panthers?

[02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:31.130]
No chance, I won't be there.

[02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:32.190]
Are you still in Canada?

[02:31:33.010 --> 02:31:33.530]
Yes, sir.

[02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:34.330]
Oh, how was that?

[02:31:34.330 --> 02:31:36.830]
I'm coming to the Toronto Florida Panther game March

[02:31:36.830 --> 02:31:38.090]
to the ninth, I believe it is here.

[02:31:38.410 --> 02:31:40.150]
On March 9th.

[02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:40.370]
OK.

[02:31:40.810 --> 02:31:42.770]
Can I sure hope Trevor can't play the net game, man?

[02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:44.670]
You can have Trevor kid back by the way for the Panthers

[02:31:44.670 --> 02:31:45.470]
for not your free.

[02:31:45.470 --> 02:31:45.910]
I heard that.

[02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:47.250]
Just take a salary you can have.

[02:31:47.370 --> 02:31:48.610]
He couldn't stop a bowling ball.

[02:31:48.610 --> 02:31:49.330]
I heard that.

[02:31:49.450 --> 02:31:50.350]
I heard that at all.

[02:31:50.410 --> 02:31:51.050]
Oh, that's the shame.

[02:31:51.350 --> 02:31:52.090]
Have you been to Vegas at all?

[02:31:53.310 --> 02:31:54.130]
I'm not going back.

[02:31:54.390 --> 02:31:55.170]
They got all my money.

[02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:56.550]
In fact, they're going to build a whole new casino

[02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:57.570]
now just for the money I left.

[02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:58.330]
Have a great day, Palli.

[02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:00.930]
Fine, I'm going to the convenience store

[02:32:00.930 --> 02:32:01.610]
left of the show.

[02:32:02.810 --> 02:32:05.550]
567.0560, 0560, on a AT&T.

[02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:07.890]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:32:08.650 --> 02:32:09.850]
You've been to Vegas lately, George?

[02:32:10.290 --> 02:32:10.830]
Not lately, though.

[02:32:10.990 --> 02:32:11.250]
Why not?

[02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:11.930]
What about you, Josh?

[02:32:12.570 --> 02:32:12.790]
Soon.

[02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.930]
Are you going?

[02:32:14.350 --> 02:32:14.970]
Yeah, ma'am.

[02:32:16.390 --> 02:32:17.790]
You may go or you're going in May.

[02:32:18.470 --> 02:32:19.450]
I'm going in May.

[02:32:19.850 --> 02:32:20.470]
And where are you going to stay?

[02:32:20.570 --> 02:32:21.590]
Do you have your reservations already?

[02:32:21.790 --> 02:32:22.570]
New York, New York.

[02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:25.170]
Well, that's not bad right across from the really good place,

[02:32:25.330 --> 02:32:26.270]
the NGL brand.

[02:32:26.890 --> 02:32:27.670]
Yeah, you can visit.

[02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:28.510]
New York, New York, New York.

[02:32:28.670 --> 02:32:30.290]
It's a little too many New Yorkers in there.

[02:32:30.430 --> 02:32:30.930]
No, it's not really.

[02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:32.210]
It's just fine.

[02:32:32.430 --> 02:32:34.110]
It's a little on a cheesy side.

[02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:35.130]
It's all right.

[02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:35.530]
It's fair.

[02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:36.070]
Cheesy.

[02:32:36.090 --> 02:32:37.510]
I don't believe you.

[02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.850]
Huh?

[02:32:39.470 --> 02:32:40.350]
Well, you know what I mean.

[02:32:40.470 --> 02:32:41.210]
I say cheesy.

[02:32:41.210 --> 02:32:41.350]
Cheesy.

[02:32:41.730 --> 02:32:43.190]
I don't know.

[02:32:43.370 --> 02:32:44.110]
You'll see what I mean.

[02:32:44.410 --> 02:32:46.390]
It's not as cheesy as the Luxor.

[02:32:46.390 --> 02:32:49.070]
And what's the other one on a corner I can ever think the Excel

[02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:50.330]
did not the ex caliber.

[02:32:50.590 --> 02:32:51.110]
Yeah, that's all right.

[02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:51.550]
It's caliber.

[02:32:51.790 --> 02:32:52.650]
That's really cheesy.

[02:32:52.650 --> 02:32:53.870]
That's a pretty real palace.

[02:32:54.210 --> 02:32:55.590]
Can I give you a, would you stop?

[02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:58.690]
We finally put that guy to sleep already out there with his

[02:32:59.510 --> 02:33:01.250]
Nazi mobiles and you're starting up with them again.

[02:33:01.490 --> 02:33:02.510]
Has nothing to do with the cars.

[02:33:02.610 --> 02:33:02.750]
Good.

[02:33:03.210 --> 02:33:06.270]
At any rate, ex caliber don't go in there.

[02:33:06.270 --> 02:33:08.190]
Number one, and it's right across the street as you know

[02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.830]
from New York, New York.

[02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:10.770]
And number two, the food and they're just horrible.

[02:33:11.530 --> 02:33:13.890]
Pretty hard to find bad food in Vegas, you know, even

[02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:15.830]
in the casino is but ex caliber.

[02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:21.690]
Even the glamority there, five six seven, oh five 60 pound five

[02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:25.130]
60 audience, TNT and Verizon wireless line WQA and hello.

[02:33:25.630 --> 02:33:27.630]
Yes, I tuned in late to Neil.

[02:33:27.790 --> 02:33:29.750]
I don't know whether or not he saw an article in the New York

[02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:33.810]
times about new law in Paris where you can carry your dead

[02:33:34.450 --> 02:33:34.930]
fiance.

[02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:37.910]
I talked about that the other day two days ago.

[02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:39.330]
OK, Smith that one.

[02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:39.990]
Thanks.

[02:33:40.090 --> 02:33:40.390]
Thanks.

[02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:40.790]
Five.

[02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:42.370]
Remember that your dead fiance.

[02:33:42.370 --> 02:33:43.830]
She married her dead fiance.

[02:33:44.050 --> 02:33:44.690]
Oh, fiance.

[02:33:45.550 --> 02:33:46.250]
Oh, yeah.

[02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:49.190]
Now he's having a little difficulty, you know,

[02:33:49.610 --> 02:33:51.710]
consummating the marriage but nevertheless she'll work it out.

[02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:52.990]
I goes on all the time down here.

[02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:57.250]
Five six seven, oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T

[02:33:57.250 --> 02:33:58.170]
and Verizon wireless line.

[02:33:58.210 --> 02:33:59.230]
Be sure and tell Neil about that.

[02:33:59.850 --> 02:34:00.490]
I think you weigh him.

[02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:01.350]
Hello, hey, Neil.

[02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:02.230]
How you doing, Neil?

[02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:02.850]
Pretty good.

[02:34:03.570 --> 02:34:03.890]
Good.

[02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:05.050]
I just want to change the subject.

[02:34:05.070 --> 02:34:06.810]
I know that's a lot on the ship.

[02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:09.550]
Have you ever seen the movie Strange Pro?

[02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:13.730]
Oh, no, I played the song a lot on the year but I never saw the movie.

[02:34:13.730 --> 02:34:16.750]
No, it was like a 80s movie with.

[02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:19.930]
Yeah, and it was a song by who the hell did that scream?

[02:34:20.250 --> 02:34:21.030]
The art birds, right?

[02:34:21.250 --> 02:34:21.430]
No, no.

[02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:21.590]
Cream.

[02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.210]
Cream.

[02:34:23.350 --> 02:34:23.710]
Cream.

[02:34:23.970 --> 02:34:25.410]
Cream, C-R-E-A-M, cream.

[02:34:25.530 --> 02:34:25.970]
Lock him.

[02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:26.910]
Lock him.

[02:34:27.090 --> 02:34:27.650]
But we still say that.

[02:34:28.050 --> 02:34:29.170]
Oh, we can't say cream no more.

[02:34:29.450 --> 02:34:29.890]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:30.370 --> 02:34:32.210]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:34:33.250 --> 02:34:36.670]
Five six seven, oh five 60 pound five 60.

[02:34:37.370 --> 02:34:40.330]
I think he's been of that strange rule is what he's been.

[02:34:40.390 --> 02:34:42.910]
In fact, maybe he got the device that the other guy was looking for.

[02:34:42.910 --> 02:34:43.570]
I don't want to say BONG.

[02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:44.110]
That would be better.

[02:34:44.890 --> 02:34:45.490]
Water pipe.

[02:34:46.030 --> 02:34:46.550]
There you go.

[02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:48.410]
Yeah, that's so much more antiseptic.

[02:34:48.510 --> 02:34:51.530]
In fact, aren't you surprised that a guy like for real, you know, who's always dropping

[02:34:51.530 --> 02:34:52.290]
wild thought?

[02:34:52.530 --> 02:34:53.370]
I'll take your children.

[02:34:53.890 --> 02:34:55.470]
I'll sell them to some Haitians.

[02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:57.770]
Oh, by the way, in case you're watching it, the Haitians are still revolving.

[02:34:58.030 --> 02:34:59.170]
Case you're keeping their tabs on it.

[02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:04.510]
One 13 at five 60 WQM, the mad dog will be along at two o'clock to regalia with all sorts

of stuff about sports.

[02:35:06.350 --> 02:35:07.110]
Just love those sports.

[02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:10.150]
Speaking of sports, if you're looking for something exciting to do, something breathtaking

[02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:13.690]
that can get you to jump up and yell and cheer or bitch about as the case may be, come

[02:35:13.690 --> 02:35:15.350]
on out to Pompadopark Racing and Poker.

[02:35:15.430 --> 02:35:16.710]
Do not bet on Wallahennas' please.

[02:35:17.390 --> 02:35:20.390]
Cheer for your horse from the rail or enjoy a fine dining at the top of the park restaurant

[02:35:20.390 --> 02:35:24.210]
as you watch the only nighttime horse racing in Florida, playing poker as your game and

[02:35:24.210 --> 02:35:28.090]
match your skills at Pompadopark's fabulous card room with those other eight Ks.

[02:35:28.390 --> 02:35:32.110]

[02:35:51.410 --> 02:35:54.910]
Even if you don't know the difference between Bob Bo-Mar and Buddy Bo-Mar, I guarantee you'll

[02:35:54.910 --> 02:35:58.750]
still have a great time and even Marty Perrano, you'll still have a great time at Pompadopark.

[02:35:58.950 --> 02:36:01.510]
Easy to get there, just to have a mile from both I-95 and the turnpike.

[02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.670]
Absolutely.

[02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:32.050]
I'm crying.

[02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:36.910]
I'm crying.

[02:36:36.910 --> 02:36:42.050]
Oh, right.

[02:36:44.250 --> 02:36:47.530]
Oh, right.

[02:36:47.770 --> 02:36:50.390]
Okay.

[02:36:52.030 --> 02:36:54.570]
Okay.

[02:36:54.850 --> 02:36:54.850]

[02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:56.950]
Yeah.

[02:36:58.350 --> 02:36:59.690]
Thanks.

[02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:19.310]
How are you?

[02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:20.030]

[02:37:20.190 --> 02:37:26.510]
You know, kids say-

[02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.930]
And, uh, these shoulders should be rest, you know, you're nearly at the top.

[02:37:26.930 --> 02:37:26.930]

[02:37:26.930 --> 02:37:26.930]

[02:37:26.930 --> 02:37:26.930]

[02:37:26.930 --> 02:37:26.930]

[02:37:26.950 --> 02:37:28.970]
Come on!

[02:37:40.390 --> 02:37:44.110]
Everybody's So long ist

[02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:26.890]
Well, they're supposed to be some words here, but I forgot them because I spoke too much

[02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:28.010]
to the

[02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:42.190]
All right, 18 at 560 WQM happy turds day to you. This is the greatest facts I've had in a long time this hour anyway.

[02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:48.050]
The Passion of Christ, a weapon of mass indoctrination. See, isn't that beautiful?

[02:38:49.430 --> 02:38:54.750]
Thank you very much whoever sent that. That's a beautiful thing, a weapon of mass indoctrination. Well said.

[02:38:55.290 --> 02:38:58.970]
Well, speaking of that, I didn't get a chance for this one yesterday, but here it is today.

[02:38:59.650 --> 02:39:03.710]
From the New York Daily News, a Queen's priest who's list of alleged crimes includes

[02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:06.190]
crank calling her Catholic high school and packing a pistol.

[02:39:06.690 --> 02:39:10.570]
We have confessed yesterday to another sin, stealing from a long Ireland church.

[02:39:11.950 --> 02:39:17.230]
The Reverend John Johnson, 64, pleaded guilty to one kind of grand larceny, a felony punishable by a pro-year in jail.

[02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:20.630]
And that saw a assistant district attorney Steve Stephanie Meister said,

[02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:26.650]
John said admitted stealing 50 grand from St. Martin of Tour Church in Bethpage from 1998 to 2003.

[02:39:26.810 --> 02:39:27.590]
50 Gs.

[02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:38.710]
Gs. Johnston had worked part time at a church for at the church for 25 years actually was suspected as taking as much as 100 grand from its weekly collection plates, stealing 60 to 100 bucks after each Sunday mass.

[02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:40.890]
Well, he probably had some odds and ends the pick here, you know.

[02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:50.610]
And when cops searched his bottoms, when cops searched his Jackson Heights Queens apartment last fall, Johnston led him to a backstuff for more than 80 years.

[02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:56.370]
He grand, some of the money still sealed in green envelopes, bearing parishioners names, oh my God, audio suckers out there.

[02:39:56.690 --> 02:39:59.590]
He panted over these grave robbers, all your cash, all your hard earned money.

[02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:05.670]
It's like blackmail, if you want to go to heaven, then hand it over like you're being held up at gunpoint.

[02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:14.250]
But Meister said, what was his name again? Meister or her name? Stephanie Meister. The Stephanie Meister.

[02:40:15.330 --> 02:40:20.730]
Meister said that after reviewing the priest's bank accounts, prosecutors came up with a $50,000 figure because it was the amount we could prove.

[02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:32.070]
It's unlikely Johnston will serve any jail time when since April 16 by National County Judge Donald Delphi is attorney Joe Stella said this time was offered probation by prosecutors because he's agreed to pay church back to 50 grand.

[02:40:32.390 --> 02:40:34.430]
They will be made more than a whole still said.

[02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:38.970]
Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh man! They'll be made more than a whole.

[02:40:38.970 --> 02:40:47.870]
I was told that with a W or an H. Stella said he couldn't comment on why the priest took the money or what he did with it until the charges he faces in Brooklyn and Queens are resolved.

[02:40:48.250 --> 02:40:55.610]
He has no habits, no problems, the guy was without vices other than this, no gambling, no women he's running with, no little boys, no nothing, he just likes stealing money.

[02:40:56.730 --> 02:41:06.850]
And at all, listen to this, Johnston's stuff was exposed when cops went to his Queens of Parvada October 7 to arrest him for allegedly making profanity lace calls to the principal of Bishop Glockland High School in Brooklyn.

[02:41:06.850 --> 02:41:20.650]
He has no other problems. In addition to the cash police also found gay porn and on license gun in the stash of Nazi memorabilia a virtual shrine to the third right in his closet included German flags helmets, daggers swastikers and pictures of Adolf Hitler.

[02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:23.650]
He has no problems, he has no issues. What a pit.

[02:41:24.090 --> 02:41:30.950]
Johnston was a respected English and religion teacher for 23 years at Oratory Prep School in Summit New Jersey where he was finally referred to as father JJ.

[02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:35.850]
A source that Johnston referred to as stealing from Long Island Churches is 401k plan.

[02:41:36.810 --> 02:41:46.870]
Wow. The motive behind the vulgar messages left for brother Dennis Cronin at Bishop Lockham was less clear but prosecutor said he brought a grudge against the deal of South Christian brothers who run a Brooklyn High School.

[02:41:47.250 --> 02:41:54.350]
Some investigators speculated that Johnston was angry with the former principal of the Brooklyn School who became the headmaster at Oratory Prep and whom he blamed for forcing him to retire.

[02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:59.330]
Well, there you go. So make some crank calls and by the way enjoy your gay porn and your swastikers.

[02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:03.410]
Very good. No issues. He's going to pay it back, make them whole.

[02:42:04.810 --> 02:42:08.690]
I say we'd like to go home and the ground and stick his ass in his bottom in there.

[02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:16.670]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless. We do take calls by the way on the near Roger show on QAM.

[02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:21.030]
As long as they're not about sports WQAM. Hello.

[02:42:21.690 --> 02:42:25.290]
Yes, we don't discuss them. I'll get married.

[02:42:25.290 --> 02:42:29.770]
I just want to question across my mind. And what was that my Julio friend?

[02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:36.350]
Did you get in the bottom Valentine? What's going to be a very short call? Same old stuff, you know?

[02:42:36.370 --> 02:42:40.390]
Recko bottom by the way to use it. Recko bottom not but not that either bottom.

[02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:48.690]
How do you say bottom in this panel? Fondle. Fondle bottom? Don't be saying fondle to your bottom. That's even worse.

[02:42:49.010 --> 02:42:52.290]
Of course you could say the antiseptic word for it. And what is that? Cool.

[02:42:52.290 --> 02:43:02.750]
Oh no. Oh I'm leaving. Best to make cool. No. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. Recko on the AT&T and Verizon wireless.

[02:43:02.770 --> 02:43:08.070]
It smells like Lallax. WQAM. Hello. I got a little rox. Yes sir.

[02:43:08.830 --> 02:43:15.210]
Hey it's fun. You're talking about violence and nudity and stuff. What was going on last week.

[02:43:15.410 --> 02:43:19.890]
But my I'm going to give friend of ours. There are these Mason people and they're good.

[02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:25.430]
How do they shake hands? They give you the secret hand shake and you can come in. He's never showed it and I never asked.

[02:43:26.210 --> 02:43:30.970]
It was a no at the hand. But their kids aren't allowed to watch the Simpson.

[02:43:31.850 --> 02:43:39.070]
Oh no. They're Jesus Creek too. So you know they're not allowed to watch Simpson. They're going to watch all those violence on TV, which drives me and my wife not.

[02:43:39.770 --> 02:43:44.490]
I want to go to about the I think I know the guy we're talking about. He's the first company of men.

[02:43:47.330 --> 02:43:54.810]
So we go to the movies and when they're like a love scene comes up, they got to make their kids close their eyes and put their heads down.

[02:43:54.850 --> 02:43:59.970]
Oh absolutely. It's crazy. Oh another thing if I may add anything.

[02:43:59.970 --> 02:44:07.370]
Yes sir. When George W. was talking about two weeks ago about when he was on me depressed.

[02:44:07.370 --> 02:44:17.950]
And I mean did that just die down or was the media just trying to distract us with Ruby gate and try not to even talk about what a bad job he did there.

[02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:22.510]
Oh and don't forget about Kerry gate too. Kerry intern gate.

[02:44:22.970 --> 02:44:27.010]
Yeah. I've heard the part of report. How many minutes say I've got 30 men?

[02:44:27.210 --> 02:44:29.910]
Yeah. Anything to distract the public and distract the public.

[02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:37.970]
You've got on way and long floor the dog. You've got it. The first of these the business people in their in the media.

[02:44:53.210 --> 02:44:59.210]
Yes quick. Copy off. Hey I have in front of me one of those wonderful arbitrarian diaries.

[02:44:59.670 --> 02:45:07.570]
Oh right. Here's the guy that we love dearly man. And guess what the only question they really need to ask me was before we disconnected on our phone call.

[02:45:07.870 --> 02:45:12.930]
Right. What my descent was. Did I have any Hispanic descent in my family?

[02:45:13.330 --> 02:45:17.950]
Oh but wait. So in other words they did the follow up with the phone call. Right. Oh they actually fought twice.

[02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:24.730]
Good. Oh thank goodness for us because you know the fall book was all screwed up because they weren't following up with the diaries with phone calls.

[02:45:25.110 --> 02:45:29.230]
So as a result the ethnic minority people who get five bucks instead of what do you get two bucks.

[02:45:29.730 --> 02:45:32.590]
Exactly. Yeah. So they were saying all the day. Right.

[02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:40.510]
I just get to my neighbor got twice as much as we did. His last name is for us. I was cracking up. I said I think that's the way to buy your way in.

[02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:46.670]
Tell me your name is Rodriguez man. 50 bucks. Neil one thing. Yes sir. I miss Nick Tahoe.

[02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:49.130]

[02:45:49.710 --> 02:45:52.910]
Well what can I tell you. Victor Anderson for Lauderdale. Take care.

[02:45:53.230 --> 02:45:54.950]

Okay we love that guy a lot don't we? A lot. We need everybody's help all we can. Okay.

[02:46:00.210 --> 02:46:04.850]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 out of AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:09.010]
Should I just check that contesting one real quick time? No I don't want to.

[02:46:09.090 --> 02:46:12.850]
I'm not going to check the individual votes because that thing is just too complicated.

[02:46:12.850 --> 02:46:15.690]
But at the bottom 7 820.

[02:46:17.530 --> 02:46:25.590]
Heavy duty. So wouldn't surprise me we got 8000 by the time we leave today to a clock and certainly by the time I sit my fat ass down here tomorrow there'll be over 10000 votes.

[02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:28.910]
And by the end of the show since they're going to be so frantic God only knows.

[02:46:29.090 --> 02:46:31.650]
What kind of a wild crap is going to be on there right?

[02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:37.690]
Speaking of wild crap on our website don't miss the lovely what's in a Sharon stone.

[02:46:38.430 --> 02:46:43.870]
Right very tasteful and Michael Powell and then of course right under Sharon stone is Michael Powell.

[02:46:43.890 --> 02:46:50.490]
Very tasteless not quite so very tasteless and even more tasteless than either one of them underneath Michael's big pals is misfudge.

[02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:53.250]
And she's looking for it she's looking for the latest stain.

[02:46:54.890 --> 02:46:56.710]
Looks like she's kind of sniffing at it too.

[02:46:56.870 --> 02:47:00.970]
5 9 and you'll call 6 6 4 20 5 60.

[02:47:04.570 --> 02:47:25.970]

[02:48:51.970 --> 02:48:55.190]
okay because it's a sports show and once in a while you can say those on the sports

[02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.710]
shows right?

[02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:56.230]
Absolutely.

[02:48:56.410 --> 02:48:57.570]
It's okay, it's a different category.

[02:48:57.790 --> 02:49:01.210]
It's for real men, not for children, not for overgrown children.

[02:49:02.430 --> 02:49:05.310]
800 8 votes, what's your take on the religious right?

[02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:08.410]
There's nothing but hate mongering morons, 257.

[02:49:08.970 --> 02:49:11.610]
The whole religion thing is a big racket, 229.

[02:49:12.250 --> 02:49:14.270]
I don't mind if they leave me alone, 106.

[02:49:14.470 --> 02:49:16.610]
In other words, believe whatever you want, but just leave us alone, but yeah.

[02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:19.010]
They're full of Shiite, 75.

[02:49:19.850 --> 02:49:22.270]
They gave their brains away to fakers, 52.

[02:49:22.610 --> 02:49:25.810]
I'm one of them, praise God, 45, 5.5% religious right.

[02:49:26.830 --> 02:49:29.730]
And they're the biggest perverts of all, 44.

[02:49:30.470 --> 02:49:34.490]
That's true about that priest in New York, that was a beautiful thing.

[02:49:34.850 --> 02:49:36.530]
He's a huge fan of other issues.

[02:49:38.050 --> 02:49:38.750]
WQM, hello.

[02:49:40.430 --> 02:49:41.710]
And I was talking to you too.

[02:49:42.330 --> 02:49:43.030]
WQM, hola.

[02:49:43.730 --> 02:49:43.990]
All right.

[02:49:44.450 --> 02:49:44.770]
Yes sir.

[02:49:45.210 --> 02:49:45.850]
Perverts of all.

[02:49:46.090 --> 02:49:47.050]
Yeah, I talked to you.

[02:49:47.050 --> 02:49:47.750]
Speaking.

[02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:51.430]
Hey Neil, I just had a question for you.

[02:49:51.730 --> 02:49:55.550]
I'm on a fan and I agree with a lot of your views, right?

[02:49:55.790 --> 02:49:57.430]
You're political and religious and I.

[02:49:57.510 --> 02:49:57.950]
You're a fan?

[02:49:58.610 --> 02:50:00.670]
No, I'm not a fan, not a fact.

[02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.850]
Oh, a foul, okay.

[02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:08.250]
And my question is, why didn't you see you and Wami used to wear you little Jewish hats

[02:50:08.250 --> 02:50:09.050]
a little yamma go?

[02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:10.230]
Yeah, that was a joke.

[02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:11.630]
Oh, it was a joke.

[02:50:12.050 --> 02:50:13.970]
Wami, get it, sucks.

[02:50:14.310 --> 02:50:14.450]
Yeah.

[02:50:14.990 --> 02:50:15.890]
Oh, okay, okay.

[02:50:15.950 --> 02:50:16.290]
Hey, hey, hey.

[02:50:16.290 --> 02:50:17.310]
Well, the whole share is a joke.

[02:50:17.470 --> 02:50:18.630]
In fact, Wami was a joke.

[02:50:19.310 --> 02:50:20.690]
Oh, that was all a joke.

[02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:21.050]
Okay.

[02:50:21.450 --> 02:50:22.270]
I know I never saw it.

[02:50:22.590 --> 02:50:24.130]
Every time I saw you, Wami was boring.

[02:50:24.230 --> 02:50:24.690]
I don't know why.

[02:50:25.090 --> 02:50:26.230]
But when I hear you in the raid, it's very interesting.

[02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:29.010]
Because you were ready to put the show together, it blew it was horrendous.

[02:50:29.530 --> 02:50:29.810]
Yeah.

[02:50:30.930 --> 02:50:33.330]
And, hey, do you like like Howard Stern?

[02:50:33.730 --> 02:50:34.890]
I mean, no.

[02:50:35.370 --> 02:50:35.890]
No, all right.

[02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:38.530]
I mean, he does the same crap, you know.

[02:50:38.770 --> 02:50:39.270]
No chance.

[02:50:39.470 --> 02:50:39.890]
He doesn't do anything.

[02:50:40.050 --> 02:50:41.410]
He does dikes and boobs, man.

[02:50:41.530 --> 02:50:41.950]
That's his show.

[02:50:42.090 --> 02:50:42.430]
Dikes and boobs.

[02:50:42.430 --> 02:50:44.270]
So, I mean, if you like Howard Stern more power to you.

[02:50:44.370 --> 02:50:46.790]
But, you wait till the hair start here and your show start next week, man.

[02:50:46.850 --> 02:50:50.950]
Now that the infinities have a nervous breakdown, he's going to be saying hello and goodbye.

[02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.950]
And that's about basically it.

[02:50:51.990 --> 02:50:52.610]
Have a great day, Pally.

[02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:53.670]
All right, buddy.

[02:50:53.890 --> 02:50:54.110]
See you.

[02:50:55.310 --> 02:50:58.770]
I mean, I hope for his sake, because I don't support any kind of censorship.

[02:50:59.150 --> 02:51:00.270]
Okay, say whatever you want.

[02:51:00.350 --> 02:51:01.430]
If you don't like it, turn it off.

[02:51:01.690 --> 02:51:04.050]
If you want to monitor your kids, if you're afraid they're going to hear something bad,

[02:51:04.250 --> 02:51:05.370]
then don't let them listen to it.

[02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:06.130]
No, no, no.

[02:51:06.370 --> 02:51:06.650]
Kid hat.

[02:51:06.750 --> 02:51:07.210]
I see.

[02:51:07.390 --> 02:51:07.810]
Oh, that's right.

[02:51:07.910 --> 02:51:09.510]
Parental responsibility went out the window.

[02:51:09.970 --> 02:51:10.930]
It's nothing to get there.

[02:51:10.930 --> 02:51:13.650]
Which, if you bring up your kids, these good religionists, what are they worried about?

[02:51:13.810 --> 02:51:15.390]
They're always the ones that are screaming for censorship.

[02:51:15.890 --> 02:51:19.430]
But if they're instilling all these good values in their children, what are they worried

[02:51:19.430 --> 02:51:19.850]
about?

[02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.590]
It ain't the kids.

[02:51:20.750 --> 02:51:21.710]
That's just a smoke screen.

[02:51:22.030 --> 02:51:22.430]
Of course.

[02:51:23.730 --> 02:51:25.370]
What it comes down to is censorship.

[02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:26.490]
That's what it's all about.

[02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:29.290]
Censor, repress, repress, censors, suppress.

[02:51:30.130 --> 02:51:32.030]
Keep everybody go stepping along in the line.

[02:51:32.170 --> 02:51:32.350]
Okay.

[02:51:33.390 --> 02:51:33.970]
You'll see.

[02:51:34.310 --> 02:51:37.630]
Oh, and Mrs. Bush, speaking of that, by the way, says gay marriage is shocking for some.

[02:51:37.710 --> 02:51:38.070]
Oh, my God.

[02:51:38.210 --> 02:51:38.530]
Shocking.

[02:51:39.370 --> 02:51:40.230]
Poor Laura Bush.

[02:51:40.230 --> 02:51:41.570]
She shot.

[02:51:43.370 --> 02:51:44.530]
Santa Monica, California.

[02:51:44.990 --> 02:51:48.890]
Laura Bush says gay marriages are a very, very shocking issue for some people.

[02:51:48.970 --> 02:51:53.210]
A subject that should be debated by Americans rather than settled by Massachusetts court

[02:51:53.210 --> 02:51:54.830]
or the mayor of San Francisco.

[02:51:55.350 --> 02:51:59.410]
As to how she feels about the issue personally, Mrs. Bush replies, let's just leave it at

[02:51:59.410 --> 02:51:59.590]
that.

[02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:01.690]
Let's leave it to the people, not the courts.

[02:52:02.670 --> 02:52:05.610]
You know, like whether blacks could vote or whether women could vote, don't, I mean,

[02:52:05.790 --> 02:52:07.710]
don't let that be decided by the courts.

[02:52:07.930 --> 02:52:08.110]
Right.

[02:52:08.370 --> 02:52:09.230]
Or by the Constitution.

[02:52:09.230 --> 02:52:14.490]
Let's leave it up to the people in an AP interview, Mrs. Bush also endured sexual

[02:52:15.370 --> 02:52:18.850]
abstinence programs for teens, which are slated to get doubled occurred funding of the

[02:52:18.850 --> 02:52:20.250]
president's latest budget proposal.

[02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:21.530]
Sexual abstinence.

[02:52:21.570 --> 02:52:24.070]
It's kind of like Nancy Reagan just say like that.

[02:52:26.130 --> 02:52:29.050]
Abstinence should be extensively discussed alongside contraception.

[02:52:29.170 --> 02:52:30.090]
She said, we know it works.

[02:52:30.190 --> 02:52:31.410]
It's 100% failsafe.

[02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:33.450]
Oh, she shouldn't have said that alongside contraception.

[02:52:33.510 --> 02:52:34.530]
The pope's going to be parked off.

[02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:35.270]
Wow.

[02:52:36.670 --> 02:52:40.230]
She said, most teenagers already we see a lot of information about contraception options

[02:52:40.230 --> 02:52:40.730]
from the media.

[02:52:40.870 --> 02:52:41.650]
I think it ought to be everything.

[02:52:41.830 --> 02:52:45.070]
But I also think abstinence should be definitely talked about is what she said.

[02:52:45.370 --> 02:52:46.550]
Boy, she boring or what?

[02:52:46.750 --> 02:52:46.990]
Man.

[02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:49.590]
She always makes me pine for Hillary.

[02:52:49.950 --> 02:52:51.710]
And that's really a stretch, you know what?

[02:52:51.970 --> 02:52:52.090]
Yeah.

[02:52:52.650 --> 02:52:57.850]
She's almost enough to make Bubba pine for Hillary, which is really saying something 5, 6,

[02:52:58.030 --> 02:53:02.070]
7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Marles line.

[02:53:02.170 --> 02:53:04.330]
Just remember one thing kids, religion equals hate.

[02:53:04.330 --> 02:53:04.990]
OK, that's it.

[02:53:05.050 --> 02:53:05.770]
That's all you need to know.

[02:53:06.270 --> 02:53:09.210]
And of course tax exempt cash, but that's to keep it going.

[02:53:11.310 --> 02:53:11.970]
WDQA, I'm hello.

[02:53:12.850 --> 02:53:13.030]
Neil.

[02:53:13.450 --> 02:53:13.870]
Yes, sir.

[02:53:14.390 --> 02:53:15.790]
I just got off the phone with my brother.

[02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:18.190]
My conservative brother long pissed off and fired up.

[02:53:18.210 --> 02:53:20.110]
So excuse me if I'm sound upset here.

[02:53:20.170 --> 02:53:20.810]
OK, come down.

[02:53:20.930 --> 02:53:21.390]
I'll take two.

[02:53:22.310 --> 02:53:24.030]
I wonder if you heard any news.

[02:53:24.210 --> 02:53:30.250]
I started listening to you late today about the guy writing the book about George Bush paying

[02:53:30.250 --> 02:53:30.790]
for the abortion.

[02:53:30.930 --> 02:53:31.450]
Larry Flint.

[02:53:31.590 --> 02:53:32.890]
Larry Flint, it's going to be out this summer.

[02:53:32.890 --> 02:53:36.750]
We talked about that on this show just before the election in 2000.

[02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:41.930]
And evidently, the Bush-myster and his people got to the woman and she either disappeared

[02:53:41.930 --> 02:53:45.230]
for a while or she shut up or, and Larry Flint couldn't get her to come for her.

[02:53:45.310 --> 02:53:45.810]
But now I have it only.

[02:53:45.930 --> 02:53:46.950]
She's willing to spill the beans.

[02:53:47.930 --> 02:53:51.390]
And even the doctor who performed the abortion is supposed to be going to talk in the book.

[02:53:51.850 --> 02:53:52.850]
Oh my God, that's great.

[02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:55.370]
We got to get him out of there.

[02:53:55.450 --> 02:53:55.910]
That's for sure.

[02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:56.990]
I appreciate you, Neil.

[02:53:57.370 --> 02:53:58.110]
Early enough, man.

[02:53:59.330 --> 02:53:59.810]
See ya.

[02:54:00.270 --> 02:54:00.830]
Don't forget.

[02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:01.850]
We've got to get vote many times.

[02:54:01.890 --> 02:54:02.750]
The third man.

[02:54:02.990 --> 02:54:05.470]
Florida especially because the first 15 don't count.

[02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:09.910]
Especially when it was diabolical voting machines that are already a pre-programmed.

[02:54:10.310 --> 02:54:14.970]
Like that probably wouldn't sound good in our digital stereo, our HDTV stereo, whatever

[02:54:14.970 --> 02:54:15.450]
we got called.

[02:54:16.370 --> 02:54:17.910]
By the way, anybody got one of those radios?

[02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.210]
No.

[02:54:18.530 --> 02:54:20.310]
Our engineering department is pretty proud of that.

[02:54:20.390 --> 02:54:24.510]
Almost as proud as our 24-7 and almost as proud as the audio vault which crashes every

[02:54:24.510 --> 02:54:26.030]
day so we can really get the spots on here.

[02:54:27.490 --> 02:54:27.630]
W.

[02:54:27.710 --> 02:54:27.870]
Q.

[02:54:27.930 --> 02:54:28.030]
A.

[02:54:28.090 --> 02:54:30.310]
Hello, Neil.

[02:54:30.310 --> 02:54:31.270]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:32.470]
Yes.

[02:54:32.570 --> 02:54:33.610]
Two quick things, Neil.

[02:54:33.730 --> 02:54:36.050]
Well, I don't like Bush, but I don't like the president.

[02:54:36.390 --> 02:54:36.630]
Right.

[02:54:36.770 --> 02:54:42.370]
I was calling about the station there during the Super Bowl where hypocrites stay out to condemn

[02:54:42.370 --> 02:54:47.190]
Janet Jackson and the commercials with us fighting in the girl's face.

[02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:48.410]
But that was what I write.

[02:54:48.750 --> 02:54:49.910]
It's over here out of there.

[02:54:50.090 --> 02:54:50.090]

[02:54:50.210 --> 02:54:51.410]
A box sniffing the crotch.

[02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:55.430]
A reptile pills for taking these pills and you'll be smiling.

[02:54:55.690 --> 02:54:56.670]
Oh, see Alice, right.

[02:54:57.330 --> 02:54:59.050]
And it just cracked me up.

[02:54:59.050 --> 02:55:03.610]
I mean, you know, they condemned, oh, this was inappropriate, but all those commercials

[02:55:03.610 --> 02:55:04.490]
were final, right?

[02:55:04.990 --> 02:55:05.490]
There you go.

[02:55:05.550 --> 02:55:06.490]
That's America for you, man.

[02:55:07.110 --> 02:55:07.430]
Yeah.

[02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:09.330]
Go Patriots.

[02:55:10.230 --> 02:55:10.550]
Yes.

[02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:11.610]
That's where I'm from.

[02:55:11.730 --> 02:55:12.050]
How do you know?

[02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.590]
No, kid.

[02:55:12.610 --> 02:55:13.490]
I just kissed it.

[02:55:13.550 --> 02:55:14.290]
Have a great day, Palli.

[02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:15.130]
Thank you.

[02:55:15.290 --> 02:55:16.330]
I'll see you at the hall.

[02:55:16.490 --> 02:55:17.530]
I'll see you at the cookie market.

[02:55:17.850 --> 02:55:18.030]
Bye-bye.

[02:55:18.090 --> 02:55:18.590]
OK, Neil.

[02:55:19.130 --> 02:55:19.770]
21-2.

[02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:21.290]
How did I know he was from Boston, huh?

[02:55:22.430 --> 02:55:23.430]
There we just again.

[02:55:23.550 --> 02:55:27.450]
Well, the Bostonians have a very distinctive accent and they're a lot of good Bostonians,

[02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:28.330]
most of whom stayed up there.

[02:55:28.330 --> 02:55:28.950]
He's a good one, though.

[02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.450]
We like him.

[02:55:30.370 --> 02:55:33.410]
But most people like New England, and they just stay there because it's a nice friendly

[02:55:33.410 --> 02:55:35.070]
place, except of course the Catholic Church.

[02:55:35.170 --> 02:55:38.950]
But that's another story for another day or maybe it's a good story for today.

[02:55:39.270 --> 02:55:41.930]
Don't forget to Mel Gibson when we start the next Wednesday on Ask Wednesday.

[02:55:42.470 --> 02:55:43.530]
Or are we taking that day off?

[02:55:44.290 --> 02:55:44.730]
We ought to.

[02:55:44.970 --> 02:55:45.590]
They did a holiday.

[02:55:46.130 --> 02:55:47.410]
And aren't you lucky, man?

[02:55:48.210 --> 02:55:51.190]
Since I got that vacation coming up in the early near future, they're going to be

[02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:53.550]
foaming at them off about the passion of Jesus.

[02:55:53.550 --> 02:55:56.850]
And since you're that heathen, militant little, expect that always is screaming at

[02:55:56.850 --> 02:55:57.490]
the elder about that.

[02:55:57.790 --> 02:55:58.570]
It's going to be great.

[02:55:58.850 --> 02:55:59.790]
You're talking about it.

[02:55:59.790 --> 02:56:01.910]
I'm going to play Jesus' songs and read from the Bible.

[02:56:03.330 --> 02:56:03.810]
Excellent.

[02:56:06.030 --> 02:56:06.890]
Oh, good.

[02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:08.930]
I love it already.

[02:56:10.090 --> 02:56:11.590]
Twenty till two at five sixty-c.

[02:56:11.610 --> 02:56:12.890]
And the mad dog at two.

[02:56:13.350 --> 02:56:14.350]
Five and the local.

[02:56:14.670 --> 02:56:16.550]
These sixty-five sixty-c.

[02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:18.210]
The radio's on your side.

[02:56:18.910 --> 02:56:20.310]
Q and M.

[02:56:21.730 --> 02:56:22.970]
I got your breath.

[02:56:23.130 --> 02:56:23.750]
They're beautiful.

[02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:24.670]
I'm so popular.

[02:56:24.970 --> 02:56:26.850]
Like nothing you'd seen before.

[02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:28.850]
Excuse me.

[02:56:29.090 --> 02:56:29.790]
A steam father.

[02:56:30.250 --> 02:56:31.430]
What is it, my child?

[02:56:31.850 --> 02:56:33.310]
I have something I must tell you.

[02:56:33.710 --> 02:56:35.150]
What is it, my daughter?

[02:56:35.770 --> 02:56:37.530]
Oh, father, I'm afraid to tell you.

[02:56:37.930 --> 02:56:40.690]
Afraid to tell me your own father?

[02:56:41.170 --> 02:56:43.530]
I fear I will be ashamed upon our family.

[02:56:44.070 --> 02:56:44.610]
Nonsense.

[02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:46.130]
I am your father.

[02:56:46.470 --> 02:56:47.710]
I love you very much.

[02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:49.610]
You must tell me what is wrong.

[02:56:50.170 --> 02:56:51.690]
You promised you would still love me?

[02:56:52.410 --> 02:56:54.190]
Of course, my sweet child.

[02:56:54.750 --> 02:56:58.410]
A father's love is not erased by a simple misdeed.

[02:56:58.490 --> 02:56:59.150]
Very well.

[02:56:59.890 --> 02:57:00.250]
I am.

[02:57:00.930 --> 02:57:03.130]
I am pregnant.

[02:57:05.630 --> 02:57:06.930]
Oh, I see.

[02:57:07.970 --> 02:57:10.110]
Do you still love me father?

[02:57:10.590 --> 02:57:11.730]
Of course I do.

[02:57:12.370 --> 02:57:15.110]
But since you're pregnant and not married.

[02:57:15.510 --> 02:57:16.010]
Yes, father?

[02:57:16.310 --> 02:57:21.150]
I'm afraid I must drag you down to the town square and with the help of my friends

[02:57:21.150 --> 02:57:22.850]
and neighbors, stone you today.

[02:57:23.970 --> 02:57:29.030]
Oh, my daughter, if you've written that this is the punishment for what you have done.

[02:57:29.890 --> 02:57:30.970]
Could you check again, father?

[02:57:31.290 --> 02:57:33.850]
I should only be grounded.

[02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:36.490]
And no, grounding is not what.

[02:57:36.990 --> 02:57:38.110]
It was that you stoned.

[02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:39.850]
It's the first step.

[02:57:40.170 --> 02:57:43.310]
The focus is on a fundamentalist, Middle Eastern family.

[02:57:44.270 --> 02:57:46.350]
May I speak with you, my esteemed husband?

[02:57:47.390 --> 02:57:48.350]
What is it, my wife?

[02:57:49.290 --> 02:57:51.310]
I have something to tell you.

[02:57:51.530 --> 02:57:52.450]
Am I listening?

[02:57:52.930 --> 02:57:54.550]
I am having an affair.

[02:57:55.110 --> 02:57:56.290]
Oh, why is he?

[02:57:57.530 --> 02:57:58.730]
Are you going?

[02:57:59.290 --> 02:58:01.350]
After the backyard of the collection stone.

[02:58:02.270 --> 02:58:03.290]
What do you mean?

[02:58:03.690 --> 02:58:08.370]
Yes, I must drag you to the town square where you will of course be stone today.

[02:58:09.310 --> 02:58:10.650]
You'll be an Esmeralda.

[02:58:10.730 --> 02:58:13.190]
And you've followed the lives of the pregnant family.

[02:58:13.550 --> 02:58:15.970]
And how they deal with the many problems that plague them.

[02:58:16.530 --> 02:58:18.710]
May I speak with you, my esteemed father?

[02:58:18.990 --> 02:58:19.770]
Yes, my son.

[02:58:20.110 --> 02:58:21.170]
My father.

[02:58:21.490 --> 02:58:23.150]
Last night, I used a little drugs.

[02:58:23.650 --> 02:58:25.010]
Well, what do you know?

[02:58:25.430 --> 02:58:27.010]
You are one lucky boy.

[02:58:27.430 --> 02:58:28.990]
Oh, why is that, father?

[02:58:29.510 --> 02:58:32.070]
You are going to get stoned two nights in a row.

[02:58:34.810 --> 02:58:36.310]
You want one of those.

[02:58:36.570 --> 02:58:38.130]
The guiding she is.

[02:58:38.930 --> 02:58:42.050]
The guiding she is shot on location in fact, that era.

[02:58:44.030 --> 02:58:45.830]
145 or 560 WQM.

[02:58:45.930 --> 02:58:48.850]
Speaking of that movie and that that we just played.

[02:58:49.310 --> 02:58:52.410]
We saw this piece on the scene in this morning where you watch them when they show the nails.

[02:58:53.570 --> 02:58:53.810]
Yes.

[02:58:54.550 --> 02:59:00.430]
Replicers of the nails used to hang Jesus on the cross have become the red hot official merchandise linked to Mel Gibson's controversial new movie.

[02:59:00.750 --> 02:59:01.470]
The Passion of the Christ.

[02:59:01.970 --> 02:59:02.610]
Jesus Christ.

[02:59:02.990 --> 02:59:04.290]
All due Jesus Christ is out there.

[02:59:04.730 --> 02:59:12.030]
Pendants made from the pewter two and a half inch nails selling for $16.99 all but flew out of the Christian publication bookstore on West 4033.

[02:59:12.030 --> 02:59:13.810]
The New Yorkers soon as they were put on display.

[02:59:14.730 --> 02:59:23.810]
Hundreds of stores across the country will be selling license items tied to the movie a graphically violent depiction of the last 12 hours of Christ's life which opens next Wednesday on Ask Wednesday.

[02:59:24.690 --> 02:59:27.730]
The souvenirs include a book, pins, keychains, coffee mugs and t-shirts.

[02:59:28.610 --> 02:59:33.490]
Well, we wouldn't want to exploit the crucifixion of Christ for a fun and proper would we?

[02:59:33.810 --> 02:59:35.050]
I got my Jesus Slurpy mug.

[02:59:35.470 --> 02:59:38.990]
But the most unusual collectibles are the nails each of which hangs on a leather cord.

[02:59:39.970 --> 02:59:46.410]
It's side-bear the inscription Isaiah 53.5 referring to a Bible verse that begins he was pierced for our transgressions.

[02:59:46.550 --> 02:59:49.090]
I think they were talking about Billy Pierce used to pitch for the white socks.

[02:59:50.010 --> 02:59:55.490]
The family Christian store in Newark Delaware received a large ship and a merchandise to sell to preview screening the film on Monday.

[02:59:55.930 --> 02:59:56.990]
The response so far has been overwhelming.

[02:59:58.070 --> 03:00:01.750]
They want to buy this product as stores manager Tina Weldon said of the nail pendants.

[03:00:01.870 --> 03:00:03.490]
It's very symbolic for a lot of people.

[03:00:03.490 --> 03:00:05.290]
So forget about those crosses man.

[03:00:05.610 --> 03:00:09.490]
If you think the cross has some effect on Dracula, just wait until you hold up that nail.

[03:00:10.090 --> 03:00:10.190]
Right.

[03:00:10.930 --> 03:00:11.330]
Wow.

[03:00:11.490 --> 03:00:13.210]
And if that doesn't work, you can always poke them in the eye with it.

[03:00:13.570 --> 03:00:13.890]
Exactly.

[03:00:14.250 --> 03:00:16.310]
Or maybe Professor von Helsing could use it.

[03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:22.430]
A California company is manufacturing pendants and other merchandise under licensing agreement with Gibson.

[03:00:22.870 --> 03:00:25.010]
Neither Gibson or the manufacturer return calls yesterday.

[03:00:25.310 --> 03:00:30.570]
In fact, wouldn't it be a lot neater to drive those nails through the heart of Dracula instead of that gigantic spike?

[03:00:31.690 --> 03:00:33.930]
The crosses become such a benign jewelry item.

[03:00:34.090 --> 03:00:36.030]
The shock of its original form is lost to modern people.

[03:00:36.270 --> 03:00:39.730]
Said Charles Hauser, publication manager at American Bible Societies,

[03:00:40.010 --> 03:00:42.690]
not an instant for a biblical scholarship over the Helladys.

[03:00:43.050 --> 03:00:45.590]
Choosing the detail of the spike would be to reinvigorate the image.

[03:00:45.890 --> 03:00:47.150]
They're really trying to capture that.

[03:00:47.210 --> 03:00:48.930]
That this was that day's form of execution.

[03:00:49.550 --> 03:00:52.370]
Oh, maybe they can get some rocks from the guiding Shiite.

[03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:58.390]
But the Reverend Forest Church of All Souls Unitarian Church on the Upper East Side, New York called the pendants Macab.

[03:00:58.390 --> 03:01:02.390]
I expected prominence of the nail, reflects the prominence of the gourd in the movie itself.

[03:01:02.390 --> 03:01:05.190]
He said that becomes the icon for identification.

[03:01:05.870 --> 03:01:06.770]
Well said, man.

[03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:12.290]
Now, that's story about the scientists decrying the White House.

[03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:15.030]
Remember the guy talking about reports on our website, but it's short.

[03:01:15.390 --> 03:01:15.470]
Right.

[03:01:16.210 --> 03:01:18.310]
Scientists accused White House of distorting facts.

[03:01:18.550 --> 03:01:22.310]
The Bush administration has deliberately and systematically distorted scientific facts

[03:01:22.310 --> 03:01:26.390]
in it the service of policy goals on the environment, health, biomedical research,

[03:01:26.390 --> 03:01:28.030]
and nuclear weaponry at home in abroad.

[03:01:28.430 --> 03:01:33.230]
A group of about 60 influential scientists, including 20 Nobel laureates, said in a statement issued yesterday.

[03:01:33.890 --> 03:01:39.250]
The sweeping changes were later discussed in a conference call with some of the scientists that was organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists,

[03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:45.270]
an independent organization that focuses on technical issues and is often taken stands at odds with the administration policy.

[03:01:45.910 --> 03:01:50.470]
The organization also issued a 37-page report yesterday that it said, detail the accusations.

[03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:57.170]
Together, the two documents accused the administration repeatedly censoring and suppressing reports by its own scientists,

[03:01:57.870 --> 03:02:03.410]
stacking advisory committees with unqualified political appointees, disbanding government panels that provide unwanted advice,

[03:02:03.790 --> 03:02:06.710]
and refusing to seek any independent scientific expertise in some cases.

[03:02:07.710 --> 03:02:11.770]
Other administrations have on occasion engaged in such practices, but not so systematically,

[03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:17.590]
you know, on so wide a front to statement from the scientists, said, adding they believe the administration had misrepresented scientific knowledge

[03:02:17.590 --> 03:02:20.150]
and misled the public about the implication of its policies.

[03:02:20.830 --> 03:02:25.110]
A White House spokesman Scott McClellan said that yesterday he had not seen the text of their accusations,

[03:02:25.630 --> 03:02:30.170]
but he said, I can assure you this is an administration that makes decisions based on the best available science.

[03:02:31.390 --> 03:02:36.730]
Dr. Kurt Godfried, an emeritus professor of physics at Cornell, who signed the statement and spoke in the conference call,

[03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:41.290]
said the administration engaged in practices that were in conflict with the spirit of science and scientific method.

[03:02:41.890 --> 03:02:47.570]
Dr. Godfried asserted that what he called the Canvator Attitude Toward Science could place at risk the basis for the nation's long-term process,

[03:02:47.570 --> 03:02:49.610]
prosperity, health, and military prowess.

[03:02:49.970 --> 03:02:55.330]
The scientists denied that had any political motives and releasing documents as the 2004 presidential race began to take shape,

[03:02:55.730 --> 03:03:01.210]
the organization's report, Dr. Godfried, said it had taken a year to prepare much longer than originally planned to be released as soon as it was ready.

[03:03:01.850 --> 03:03:08.270]
I don't see this a partisan issue at all, said Russell Train, who served as administrator of the environment protect the EPA under presents Nixon and Gerald Ford,

[03:03:08.730 --> 03:03:10.690]
and has spoken the conference call in support of the statement.

[03:03:10.690 --> 03:03:15.770]
If it becomes that way, I think it's because the White House chooses to make it a partisan issue Mr. Train said,

[03:03:15.870 --> 03:03:18.110]
again, who served under Nixon and Ford in the EPA.

[03:03:19.610 --> 03:03:25.330]
So that was short, and thanks for reminding me about that, since it's worth mentioning, but it's typical, at least if they're not good, they're at least consistent, right?

[03:03:25.730 --> 03:03:28.550]
Right. I forgot to mention the other day, two days a matter,

[03:03:28.650 --> 03:03:30.450]
fact's already in the end of the show on Thursday about Rush.

[03:03:31.090 --> 03:03:31.830]
What about that?

[03:03:31.830 --> 03:03:32.410]
What about that, I'm sure, right?

[03:03:32.970 --> 03:03:33.330]
So what?

[03:03:34.350 --> 03:03:40.050]
Rush's attorneys Rush Limbock used the law enforcement officers of breaking the law when they seized the conservative radio commentators medical records,

[03:03:40.050 --> 03:03:43.130]
searching for evidence he illegally bought prescription painkillers.

[03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:49.830]
Join by attorneys from the ACLU Limbock's lawyers argued in court documents filed on Tuesday, or is that Tuesday?

[03:03:50.630 --> 03:03:52.750]
Does Bruce William still on the air keep asking that you don't know?

[03:03:52.850 --> 03:03:54.750]
I don't know, like I would listen to him.

[03:03:54.910 --> 03:03:57.150]
Uh, argued in court documents filed Tuesday.

[03:03:58.850 --> 03:03:59.730]
That authorities,

[03:04:00.990 --> 03:04:02.410]
who first notified Limbock,

[03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:04.930]
and given him a chance,

[03:04:06.210 --> 03:04:07.490]
the challenge the seizure,

[03:04:09.070 --> 03:04:12.430]
rather than using search warrants to remove the records from his doctor's orifice.

[03:04:12.930 --> 03:04:19.190]
Limbock has attorneys and the ACLU argue that the seizure violated Limbock's right to privacy and the confidentiality of the relationship between patients and doctors.

[03:04:19.610 --> 03:04:23.570]
The attorneys want the state forth district court of appeal to rule that the record should remain sealed, okay?

[03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:28.210]
And so should his lips remain sealed when he was popping those thousands of oxys, man, all the other crap.

[03:04:28.770 --> 03:04:34.510]
What meaning would the patient protections in the Constitution and the law have if prosecutors could disregard them any time they wanted to,

[03:04:34.510 --> 03:04:37.070]
Limbock attorney, the unshissory blacks had in the statement.

[03:04:37.590 --> 03:04:43.250]
Palm Beach prosecutors seized the records in November for their investigation into whether Limbock illegally went doctor shopping to obtain pain pills.

[03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:47.690]
The crime refers to visiting several doctors to receive duplicate prescriptions of control of narcotics.

[03:04:48.030 --> 03:04:51.510]
Limbock sought treatment for his admitted addiction October, has not been charged with the crime.

[03:04:52.310 --> 03:04:52.430]
Yet.

[03:04:53.710 --> 03:04:55.750]
That's not in the store, I just embossed a little bit.

[03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:56.030]
Oh, yeah.

[03:04:56.030 --> 03:04:56.690]
That's in charge of the crime.

[03:04:57.070 --> 03:04:57.190]
Yeah.

[03:04:57.950 --> 03:04:58.690]
I'll speak to criminals.

[03:04:59.070 --> 03:05:01.930]
Halibutans suspends $140 million in a Mack-8 meal bills.

[03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:03.270]
Okay.

[03:05:03.810 --> 03:05:12.910]
U.S. Energy and Services Group Halibut and once run by Vice President Dick Cheney said it had suspended $140 million in disputed invoices for meal-served U.S. troops in a Mack-8.

[03:05:13.270 --> 03:05:17.530]
It's important to understand this is not any sort of admission as a responsible government contractor.

[03:05:17.790 --> 03:05:18.510]
It's the right thing to do.

[03:05:18.650 --> 03:05:22.050]
So Halibutans subsidiary KBR President and Chief Executive Randy Harrell.

[03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:25.450]
KBR is a good steward of the tax payer dollars you said.

[03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:26.490]
Anybody believe in?

[03:05:26.530 --> 03:05:26.630]
No.

[03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:33.590]
Halibutans already agreed with the Pentagon's auditor the defense contract audit agency to suspend KBR subcontractor billings of $34.5 million.

[03:05:34.050 --> 03:05:35.470]
That's Kellogg Brown and Root.

[03:05:35.650 --> 03:05:36.510]
Let's get to the root of it.

[03:05:37.310 --> 03:05:40.590]
Total suspended subcrime director billings to amount $174.5 million.

[03:05:41.010 --> 03:05:46.970]
Halibutans also agreed with the Pentagon auditors to defer in voicing until the method for charging for meals had been agreed to and upon.

[03:05:47.250 --> 03:05:47.650]
How do you like that?

[03:05:47.890 --> 03:05:48.890]
The anniversary solar freight train.

[03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:51.310]
152 a QAM.

[03:05:51.890 --> 03:05:54.050]
The light is in the middle of the road.

[03:05:54.310 --> 03:05:56.310]
We are supporting O5 C.C.

[03:05:57.050 --> 03:05:57.570]
QAM.

[03:06:00.270 --> 03:06:01.890]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[03:06:03.630 --> 03:06:04.730]
This is your brain.

[03:06:05.570 --> 03:06:05.690]
What?

[03:06:06.730 --> 03:06:07.670]
Any questions?

[03:06:08.470 --> 03:06:10.310]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[03:06:10.310 --> 03:06:16.030]
This is Rush Limbaugh, servant of humanity, talk show host, hemroid, sufferer.

[03:06:16.030 --> 03:06:20.190]
Folks, at over 300 pounds, I know the agony of this kind of dilemma.

[03:06:20.570 --> 03:06:22.490]
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you there's help.

[03:06:23.030 --> 03:06:28.210]
With new Preparation Rush and my Rush to Excellence Suppositories,

[03:06:28.590 --> 03:06:31.750]
now you can end the pain and itching of hemorrhagotissue,

[03:06:32.290 --> 03:06:36.630]
just look for my picture on the box of Suppositories and the applicator tube.

[03:06:37.210 --> 03:06:42.170]
Another fine product from OIV, the obesity and broadcasting network.

[03:06:42.690 --> 03:06:43.210]
Excellent.

[03:06:43.350 --> 03:06:44.610]
Oh, guess what Boca Bryant said yesterday.

[03:06:44.610 --> 03:06:45.230]
What?

[03:06:51.130 --> 03:06:53.070]
3, 3, 2, 3.

[03:06:53.290 --> 03:06:55.450]
It ain't Parliament lights, it's just a Parliament lights.

[03:06:56.850 --> 03:07:00.110]
So that little kid is going to be singing the testifies against Michael Jackson.

[03:07:00.810 --> 03:07:01.610]
If you wish.

[03:07:02.330 --> 03:07:03.590]
I want to testify.

[03:07:03.870 --> 03:07:07.510]
There is no one so plain to sing.

[03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.470]
Oh right.

[03:07:10.050 --> 03:07:13.930]
Let's see the best of one, huh?

[03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.590]
You're the best both of us.

[03:07:14.590 --> 03:07:17.890]
Boca Bryant, Rubberman is a ball spot, which covers a lot of territory.

[03:07:18.270 --> 03:07:18.950]
Or maybe just on his back.

[03:07:19.110 --> 03:07:22.130]
Let me see it again.

[03:07:22.290 --> 03:07:23.150]
Professional sports.

[03:07:23.330 --> 03:07:26.250]
I know that none of our sports nerds will ever touch this with a 10 foot hand.

[03:07:26.670 --> 03:07:27.510]
But I'm going to say it again.

[03:07:27.830 --> 03:07:29.710]
It's the only endeavor I can think of.

[03:07:29.830 --> 03:07:31.490]
I mean, you know, guys give each other a high five.

[03:07:31.830 --> 03:07:32.710]
Attorneys win a law case.

[03:07:32.830 --> 03:07:34.570]
They're high five and they win a bet at the track.

[03:07:34.690 --> 03:07:36.170]
They're high five and have you ever seen it?

[03:07:36.170 --> 03:07:36.930]
Well, you don't go to the track.

[03:07:37.050 --> 03:07:37.910]
But can you imagine?

[03:07:38.490 --> 03:07:40.130]
For, like, for example, me and Fat Rich.

[03:07:41.010 --> 03:07:41.650]
We go to the track.

[03:07:41.650 --> 03:07:44.130]
We pick out a really good winner, 15 to one shot.

[03:07:44.430 --> 03:07:46.570]
Comes in a stretch, wins, pays 35 bucks.

[03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:47.690]
Got a big triple, whatever.

[03:07:47.850 --> 03:07:48.550]
Cash in a big ticket.

[03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:50.610]
Now maybe a little high five action, something like that.

[03:07:50.710 --> 03:07:52.250]
Can you imagine patting each other on a big fat go?

[03:07:52.490 --> 03:07:53.090]
Believe me.

[03:07:53.270 --> 03:07:54.830]
In both our cases, you have a big target.

[03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:56.490]
I can see you guys doing that.

[03:07:56.670 --> 03:07:57.030]
Chou.

[03:07:57.250 --> 03:07:59.430]
That jumping up in the air and banging the past together.

[03:07:59.690 --> 03:08:00.750]
All right.

[03:08:01.570 --> 03:08:01.930]
Right.

[03:08:02.250 --> 03:08:04.350]
We're talking about feeling the earth melt on your feet.

[03:08:04.670 --> 03:08:06.930]
Be the first earthquake in the history of Pompato Park.

[03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:11.370]
But at any rate, but patting guys on the ass, that's a sports thing.

[03:08:12.570 --> 03:08:13.730]
I've talked about that before.

[03:08:13.890 --> 03:08:17.790]
And I'm talking about at the end of the show because I realized I would never bring it up again at the beginning of the show.

[03:08:17.850 --> 03:08:20.090]
Because you know how much respost we've had about that over the years?

[03:08:20.290 --> 03:08:20.330]
No.

[03:08:20.410 --> 03:08:20.650]
None.

[03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.910]
None.

[03:08:22.030 --> 03:08:24.850]
Zero because people, yeah, it's too embarrassing to talk about.

[03:08:24.850 --> 03:08:26.150]
Well, what is the reason for that?

[03:08:26.270 --> 03:08:28.610]
You know, I'm surprised they don't do it here being the sports station and all.

[03:08:29.250 --> 03:08:29.450]
Like, what?

[03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:31.850]
Like, after you've ever seen clearance in the beach, do that.

[03:08:31.890 --> 03:08:34.550]
Give each other a little pox and pox as at the end of a new game.

[03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:37.550]
Like after a big, like, good book or something.

[03:08:37.650 --> 03:08:39.950]
Greg Reed comes by and slots you on the ass to congratulate you.

[03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:40.890]
Can't just see that way.

[03:08:40.910 --> 03:08:42.010]
You're going to slap you when he asks.

[03:08:42.370 --> 03:08:43.550]
And he knows about you.

[03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:47.030]
Well, I hear he might slap some other people on the ass, but that's the story for another show.

[03:08:47.270 --> 03:08:48.410]
Maybe that last show, you know.

[03:08:49.990 --> 03:08:52.130]
Anyway, now, PR Ralph, what time is he?

[03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.490]
Show on.

[03:08:52.550 --> 03:08:53.690]
He's got a good sense of humor today.

[03:08:53.870 --> 03:08:54.130]
He does.

[03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.710]
This is funny.

[03:08:55.230 --> 03:08:57.570]
He says this new sound equipment that you got.

[03:08:57.690 --> 03:08:58.010]
What is it?

[03:08:58.090 --> 03:08:58.430]
H.D.

[03:08:58.810 --> 03:08:59.310]
H.D.

[03:08:59.730 --> 03:09:00.510]
Whatever it is.

[03:09:00.670 --> 03:09:03.030]
He says, by the way, how can you hear this new thing?

[03:09:03.090 --> 03:09:04.210]
And what is it on A.M.?

[03:09:04.210 --> 03:09:05.170]
Please explain in details.

[03:09:05.490 --> 03:09:06.550]
Well, here's all I know about it.

[03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.770]
Okay.

[03:09:09.110 --> 03:09:10.130]
I never heard of it.

[03:09:10.230 --> 03:09:11.050]
I don't know what it is.

[03:09:11.130 --> 03:09:13.210]
We don't know anybody who's got one of those, etc.

[03:09:13.790 --> 03:09:15.070]
Oh, look at this Todd West Palm Beach.

[03:09:15.070 --> 03:09:16.810]
And today's Sunsend on 3E.

[03:09:17.270 --> 03:09:17.790]
Lifestyle section.

[03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:20.230]
You can clearly see a beautiful young woman's right nipple.

[03:09:20.430 --> 03:09:20.810]
Oh, my God.

[03:09:20.990 --> 03:09:21.150]
Oh, no.

[03:09:21.450 --> 03:09:22.450]
That's the end of the Sunsend.

[03:09:23.330 --> 03:09:25.190]
Don't let Michael Palafine out about it.

[03:09:25.310 --> 03:09:26.310]
One of them oozing pals.

[03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:29.990]
It's an article about the director Bernardo Verlucci's latest movie.

[03:09:30.110 --> 03:09:31.070]
I'm not outraged by this.

[03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:32.350]
And would like to see more says Todd.

[03:09:32.690 --> 03:09:34.970]
PS, I think the bookkeeper here just quit the Catholic Church.

[03:09:39.570 --> 03:09:41.190]
Just like the bookkeeper at Q.A.M.

[03:09:41.230 --> 03:09:43.230]
But that's another story, like I said, for another day.

[03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.610]
Right.

[03:09:44.190 --> 03:09:47.250]
So don't forget this is the last 24 hours now.

[03:09:47.490 --> 03:09:50.770]
24 hours less about four minutes to the deadline for our hot couples contest.

[03:09:51.170 --> 03:09:53.450]
Get on there and vote and vote until you can't vote no more.

[03:09:53.670 --> 03:09:54.270]
That's what I'm saying.

[03:09:54.650 --> 03:09:55.390]
Just have a good time.

[03:09:55.950 --> 03:09:59.210]
Mad Dog who always has a good time and believe you may, he learned well.

[03:09:59.390 --> 03:10:00.390]
He's a good student of mine.

[03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:02.430]
He is headed with that money straight to the bank.

[03:10:02.430 --> 03:10:03.390]
He'll be up at two o'clock.

[03:10:03.390 --> 03:10:06.230]
The Humper was right behind him online and watch your back, man.

[03:10:06.390 --> 03:10:08.190]
The Humper, four to seven, he's got a big load.

[03:10:08.270 --> 03:10:09.110]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:10:09.610 --> 03:10:11.530]
I'm gonna run your show on Fising.

[03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:12.770]
You'll get Q.A.M.

[03:10:12.850 --> 03:10:14.030]
Might be for learning how.

[03:10:14.170 --> 03:10:15.550]
You call that a penis?

[03:10:15.910 --> 03:10:17.890]
It just feels like a prick.
