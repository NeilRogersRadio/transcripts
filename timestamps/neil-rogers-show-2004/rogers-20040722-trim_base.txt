What a little quizzling a little sports nerd. Oh, I'm sure like I told you before the show

[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.380]
I think the orders came from above

[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.480]
About the hysterical way that this radio station approached that whole thing on Tuesday. Yeah, that's probably where it came from

[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.980]
What later on child over growing infant and any rate we're gonna talk about all day today

[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.640]
Not just on this show on fact that we got a whole new format now. It's all radio right morning noon a night

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.620]
W. Shack again, you got it in fact anybody want to shack up with the

[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.780]
There you go. There's something to think about and even the rat crimes was but anyway you did all that yesterday

[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.880]
So you tell me

[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.340]
Right, we start with the death hole in the rack

[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.680]
This the sad tragic unnecessary news just

[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.800]
Unspeakable a

[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.760]
Roadside bomb exploded north of Baghdad early yesterday killing one US infantry a first division soldier and bringing to 900

[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.060]
The number of US military forces killed since the beginning of military

[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.840]
Operations March 2003. I thought that once we got sawed him though that that was good again

[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.060]
And what she turned the kings of the kingdom over to that butcher that allow a guy

[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.940]
I thought that was gonna allow us to get off the hook the new world time said

[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.900]
Wow

[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.660]
What can I tell you not looking good anyway with all due respect somebody faxed us there's nothing worse than

[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.520]
Somebody who's a finger pointer and a nitpicker who's picking the wrong nit, you know, I mean

[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.260]
What have it in Fort Lauderdale your full of crap Kevin

[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.140]
He says with all due respect. It's not Keith David. It's David Keith. Oh God

[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.740]
This is when we're doing the actors on Tuesday the over on underrated over as numbers and the others and others and others and

[00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.040]
We talk about Keith David who was in Requiem for a dream who's a big and nasty looking dark-complexed guy

[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.380]
David Keith was a very pasty white-complexed guy and family affair, right?

[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.660]
So I had to write the news to Kevin but Keith David and David Keith are there two different people and all I can say you is

[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.060]
Get a life Keith. I have no life. I mean we make a lot of mistakes on this show

[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.220]
Don't forget we got the Marlon pregame at 12.30

[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.580]
They're gonna mistake right there by saying that because I didn't meet you since people diving for

[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.920]
Anything else they want to get a head start on exiting

[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.300]
Marlon pregame at 12.30 Marlon's after fillies they lost a tough one to one last night 105 game time

[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.640]
So we get out of here at 12.30 of this. Oh, right. What a tough schedule man

[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.720]
Life is good even if you don't care about

[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.440]
It's he's just full

[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.600]
George's boy and and Joe's comments there at the interview show. He's got an excellent point

[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.900]
I'm hearing from everybody even people that don't know him that mole looks just like really

[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.380]
Absolutely is are I mean great with that new

[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.220]
Look

[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.920]
Flat top he had

[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.980]
Flat top used to be a haircut, but now it's just

[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.600]
Well, I guess you call it a haircut. Sure cuz he did cut

[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.600]
God mo here's a man seeking to find a head identity

[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.380]
You know, I mean it's one thing for guys that are looking for a head

[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.120]
But this guy's looking for a head identity. Well, what is it? What what can I do with it?

[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.920]
Anyway, here's George's play yesterday what name are you tired of hearing the most well?

[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.380]
I was thinking anyway

[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.400]
Leaving though George W. Voice dreaded and 50. I was watching this morning when Thomas Kane and

[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.880]
Who's the other one Michael came no no from India Lee Hamilton when they handed him the copy his own personal copy

[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.160]
I wonder if they autographed it of the 911 report and

[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.620]
He took it and thank you and he was he

[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.580]
What's the word he

[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.780]
Strutted away and kind of a doofus he walks like a doofus right he talks like a doofus

[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.720]
Abu Garh rep he does things like a doofus. I mean he's a doofus is what he is this person

[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.440]
George W. Bush 350 and look who came in seconds

[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.080]
Yeah, 75 he was least weird while pull a whole poll today about I'm not doing you on that

[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.460]
Oh, no, Merriam elephant 166 Martha Stewart 145 just leave the poor bitch alone

[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.560]
That's a pretty bitch. I got to play that today. Let me forget I haven't played it a long time. You've been playing that?

[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.360]
No, not that was no that

[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.100]
O pretty bitch

[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.240]
Bobo the Tiger he's still dead 106 Scott Peterson 106 she's still dead in the baby, too

[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.680]
Michael Jackson 79 Jessica Simpson 71. Oh, yeah, what did I just say that the other day?

[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.040]
So what is

[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.380]
John Kerry 60 OJ Simpson 57 Mike Dithka 8 and Emerald Lagasse 8 and back in the day after a

[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.240]
Vagassee would have probably played like a little something but I can't

[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.200]
There was a little raspberry a little sneaker no little raspberry is a good for you

[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.420]
I'll be being in curtain today. I don't know what to say about this. I mean Joan Blondelle who I've got you 90% of this audience

[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.260]
How many people in a whole audience you think know who Joan Blondelle was?

[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.780]
Oh

[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:10.920]
Old old actress with huge jugs Joan Blondelle and there she is stark naked. Yeah, and clean clean shave shaving

[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.200]
Like well, I hear that and I picture she shaving better than Moe is what I'm here

[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.820]
But anyway, we're pretty close here stuff

[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.660]
Maybe we can get maybe more since he's got this whole new altitude now

[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.300]
On some days maybe he'd be a kind enough to volunteer for a picture. We could put a new picture of the new

[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.400]
Flat top Moe against the old bad wig Moe. I think was the doctor that performed the surgery on that hair piece

[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.720]
Anyway

[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.240]
Oh

[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:48.720]
I forget absolutely Joan Blondelle born August 30th 1906 if you were alive today, which he's now she'd be a whole 98 almost

[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.320]
Born in New York City died December 25th 1979 of leukemia

[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.000]
known as wise cracking big boob blue eyes whatever and

[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.240]
That's quite a picture although I don't want to talk about it. That's a wise crack

[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.480]
The interesting part about this on IMDB the biography of Joan Blondelle is that

[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.440]
She made a movie she died in 79 and her last movie the woman inside came out in 81

[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.640]
So if they were just using the dead bodies of prop or are they started working out for a long before they released it

[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.680]
The rebel is 79 the champ the glove battered grease the baron opening night. She was in a

[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:32.280]
Zed in if I would we'd be at ballgame time if I were to read all the movies that she was in Joan Blondelle. She sure got a lot of work

[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.920]
I mean just unbelievable one ton ton the dog who saved Hollywood would her take all

[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.080]
Dead don't die and evidently that might have been the case with her

[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.860]
Vannions support your local gunfighter the thinks

[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.140]
Here comes the brides a cognac of Kona coast the real McCoy TV series and she she was all over the place

[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.200]
So there she is the how to be the curtain if we're over the age of a hundred and

[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.540]
You really desperate you might want to take a look at that. She's stark naked. I mean, it's all there in glossy detail

[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.500]
The

[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:10.440]
September 11th Commission concludes that a failure of imagination not governmental neglect a lot 19 hijackers to carry out the deadliest terrorist attack in US history

[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.120]
The panel calls for an intelligence

[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.780]
Overhaul the confronted al-Qaeda organization in ten on strike and again and here

[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.360]
I thought we had like chopped the head off of al-Qaeda is what I'd heard right I guess they lied to us again

[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.240]
While faulting institutional shortcomings the bipartisan report being released today

[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.320]
Would fact just came out short time ago they handed to it well-presenting

[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.040]
Doesn't blame busher Clinton for mistakes contributing to the 2001 terrorist attacks

[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.760]
The report which is the combination of a 20-month investigation into the plot that killed nearly 3000 people in New York

[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.580]
Washington, Pennsylvania described a meticulous planning and determination of hijackers who sought to exploit witnesses in

[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.020]
Air line and border procedures by taking test flights

[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.160]
A surveillance video that surfaced yesterday shows and why even talk about that thing? I mean what does that video mean?

[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.860]
I've shown it there how many thousand time

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:01.080]
And it's just a grainy video and there's these guys waltz and through and you can't even really make out their face or who they are or what they're doing

[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.180]
Although I thought it was pretty interesting where that one

[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.460]
When I one guy stuck to the detector

[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:10.080]
The president bracing for a report that'll be sharply critical of the government's intelligence

[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.800]
Intelligence gathering said yesterday he was looking forward to somebody reading it to him

[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.940]
He also said his administration was doing everything possible to combat terrorism

[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.380]
Uh Richard Clark, you know that Osham Prabhakit to a troublemaker who tells the truth too often

[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.600]
Dick Clark former counterterrorism saw her in the Clinton Bush administration

[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.340]
And now at ABC consultant said on the networks good morning america show the commission avoided controversy

[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:39.260]
To get unanimity they didn't talk about a number of things like what effect is the war in Iraq having on our battle against terrorism

[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.180]
Did the president paying the attention to terrorism in the first nine months of his administration?

[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.360]
The controversial things the controversial criticisms of the Clinton administration as well as the

[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.900]
Bush administration just aren't there he said what they didn't do was say that the company is actually not safe for now

[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.560]
Then it was then because of the rise in terrorism after our invasion of Iraq like somebody once said on the show

[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.300]
We stirred the hornet's nest and now they're buzzing all over the place

[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.000]
Which has nothing to do with the comedy guys for that

[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.980]
Now really you you talk about over kill that well went on in this market not just on this radio station

[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.900]
But all the TV channels and everybody in South Florida you you're a bunch of crazy people you really are

[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.580]
It means the alien thing practically pale into what significance I would say at least for it

[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.140]
It is not going to last that long but at least for a day

[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.740]
It was just even when you wiped your ass it was

[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.660]
Intensive I every no matter what happened it was just out of control

[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.040]
I was peeing and learning about shak at the same time

[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.420]
Here's today's poll and you better vote fast because we got that ball game at 1230

[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.600]
We don't want to you forget about it. It's very important

[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.920]
How excited are you about the Shak trade

[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.660]
I've got four choices on here now. Maybe I left some out. I don't know we could answer but I think I think I like what I'm there

[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.160]
Yeah, mine too

[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.940]
Anyway, how excited are you about the Shak trade very I'm pumped

[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:04.480]
somewhat I couldn't give a Schmidt less or who the F is Shak those are your four choices. I think that covers it pretty well. Yeah

[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:11.600]
Big ball-headed dark-complicted guy who and then what I did go in the other room when he finally I and again

[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.720]
I we don't want to have Josh court is getting other spanking from Duff but

[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.400]
I'm sitting here and I open the pot there from the score because I I could see when Pat Riley started talking

[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:26.020]
And I don't really know what got on the year from this end or from your ass end or from over there. I know what happened

[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.500]
And then I'm trying to communicate and say uh can I get out of here now?

[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.980]
Can I go in the other room and make some lunch and just uh

[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.280]
Waltz away just walk away just

[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.920]
But I was getting no communication because I guess Josh was so whipped up about he probably was like

[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.720]
Yeah, I forgot to turn your pattern right you forgot to putt

[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.640]
So I've been doing that yeah, he was having a big

[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.680]
Attack and I wouldn't it's one surprise me if they changed the name of the big Mac to the big

[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.520]
When you think at least in South Florida everything's changing down here right

[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.600]
So I went in the other room and I had to score on the TVF punched it over and I saw about three minutes of it

[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.220]
Especially I love the part when he was talking about how overwhelmed he and his wife were by the incredible welcome in Miami

[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.440]
And about there was like just like the president

[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.460]
At that point I went to another channel and made lunch here's a wife

[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.200]
He has a wife you know he has a wife

[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:28.200]
Oh, it is just so and to me what it says it speaks volumes about how desperate the poor people of South Florida really are

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.300]
I mean, they're just ain't nothing going on except grotesque thunderstorms and

[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.980]
Mosquitoes the size of bowling balls and heat and humidity the likes of which even in the deserts of Africa

[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.500]
You seldom see other than that. It's great in the summertime

[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:48.540]
So here was the chance to grab on to something. Please let me grab on let me uh hold on to it anything like

[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.640]

[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.520]

And somewhat six kind of like lukewarm

[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.220]
Like I guess I'm excited

[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:57.920]
Because the media said

[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.080]
Oh what does this say

[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.360]

We already got this

[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.000]
We haven't even talked about it

[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.260]

It's those Arabs

[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.440]
If we were talking about it this morning

[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:17.920]

She was not last night

[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.220]

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.880]
I just got through reading about her

[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.860]
But it's

[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.480]
Already look

[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.880]
We only got two hours to go here

[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.320]
And then they keep faxing this craft

[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.340]
There's amateur program directors out there

[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.600]
Want to tell me what to talk about

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.220]
And what bedtime stories to read

[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.580]
Well, screw you okay

[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.060]
Thanks anyway but screw you

[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.800]
Now let's see here's a fax that says

[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.660]
I'm sitting here waiting to see what

[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.480]
Chak's reaction is

[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.380]
When he comes to fight out about neo-roger's

[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.180]
Will he react like that linebacker

[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.900]
That went to the distance

[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.520]
No that wasn't about me

[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.300]
No that was about

[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.900]
Somebody else

[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.560]
Are you sure?

[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.740]
Yeah that was about Phil Henry

[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.420]
In fact he also didn't say that to me

[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.020]
Or Phil Henry was the mad dog

[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.480]
Oh right

[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.300]
He said that too

[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.020]
Well see see what I mean again

[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:13.620]
Yeah

[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.660]
You know every all these people

[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.620]
We didn't know their crap

[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.060]
Not

[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.220]
They don't know what they're talking about

[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.920]
Where the hell is that

[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.820]
Where's the whole thing

[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.680]
Oh here it is

[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.100]
Hey Brian

[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.680]
Are you happy

[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.400]
Yeah see what mad dog he was talking to

[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.480]
I had to chop it off every night

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.380]
And then they do it that

[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.420]
Suck my s***

[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.120]
Something like that

[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.720]
Chak

[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.600]
You suck my chak right

[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.140]
At any rate

[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.480]
It says

[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.160]
Well he react like

[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.780]
Or will he

[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.900]
You become his favorite banana

[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.700]
He ain't gonna pay any attention to this show

[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.800]
Okay the sports nerds

[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.040]
The only one who does recognize this show is Pat Riley

[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.160]
He listens to this show he gets it

[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.880]
Remember he was saying to the worst team about

[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.560]
You guys are just the lead infernoid managers

[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.260]
Remember that's right

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.160]
Pat Riley even when that's licked on here

[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:53.740]
He gets it

[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.580]
He's okay in my book

[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.340]
Okay even when he's

[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:55.940]
Look at that

[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.780]
That's what I'm saying

[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.460]
Sports nerd people

[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.660]
But at least he's got a sense of humor

[00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.620]
The other people

[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.940]
I mean you think like Jimmy Johnson

[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.300]
You think he paid attention to this

[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.900]
And then of course the brain stem

[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.560]
Remember that

[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.460]
Oh then the rider still on the air

[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.380]
Yeah he's got a lot of funny guys

[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.300]
The brain stem

[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.500]
Anyway what I'm trying to say is

[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.840]
Which has very outward personnel to

[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.660]
He'll react to who I acknowledge you at some point

[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.180]
He will how this will evolve

[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:17.500]
I

[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.200]
You know what I shouldn't care less

[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.920]
I couldn't care less

[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.100]
If he likes the show he hates the show

[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.200]
And let me say it again

[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.320]
Very jackass

[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.100]
Hi Mr. Sia

[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.580]
That must be slipping in my old age

[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.840]
On Saturday there was a column with very jackass

[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.220]
And probably it's the heralds fault

[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.740]
They probably just stuck it in there in their website

[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.640]
Because the website blows

[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.480]
Where he goes out about over the fan

[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.400]
In 1400 they're carrying Tony Bruno and Roe me now

[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.980]
And QN what do I like to carry some of the Fox Sports program

[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.520]
Meaning overnight to replace that crappy sporting news radio

[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.760]
But they couldn't

[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.180]
QN couldn't find clearance to put

[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.000]
Jim Roe and Tony Bruno on from 9am to 3pm

[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.300]
Which was another little shot there by very jackass

[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.840]
Oh yeah and of course I'm sure clearance agrees

[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.920]
Clarence would he would probably lick a dust toenails

[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.580]
If they find a way to get this show off

[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.320]
And then we have to chop Joe down to an hour

[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:05.880]
He doesn't care

[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.900]
And then we have to chop an hour off the mad dog

[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.460]
Same pay

[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:08.920]
Oh right

[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.400]
In mind

[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.560]
So we can get Tony Bruno and Jim Roe on here

[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.000]
Get more of that pure sports on here

[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]
So we can really talk about

[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.060]
Intensely and seriously about what a genius he is

[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.080]
Da da da da da da da da da da

[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.840]
Oh brother

[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:22.900]
Yeah

[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.940]
There he is

[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:24.840]
Dumb

[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.600]
I think dumb is the operative word am I right

[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.120]
Absolutely

[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.080]
Dumb dumb dumb

[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:30.640]
Anyway

[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.600]

FIVER

[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.760]

[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.120]
Shackered and I fever

[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.380]
Yeah

[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.700]
That'll be on the greatest hits collection

[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.240]
Rubbing

[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.500]
I'm more a stony tad burger

[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.920]
Oh Christ don't go to Mount Sin

[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.580]
Whatever you do

[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.320]
He's dead

[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.120]
I want to play just just that little bit of it that we can play

[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.080]
In fact I'm wondering what we can't play on there maybe

[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:00.480]
Huh

[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.900]
I love this

[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.840]
The media raspberry

[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.560]
Oh is there maybe I don't know

[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.140]
So I was standing there one day

[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.400]
Not thinking I was dying

[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.820]
From being able to make

[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.420]
Do do do do do do

[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.640]
Oh my god

[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.500]
I should never be finished

[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.660]
Oh no

[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.540]
Okay

[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.680]
Back was me trapped

[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.800]
To the side

[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.820]
With our own

[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.640]

[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.540]

Morris give is still dead

[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.560]
That's the bad news

[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.740]
We're very sorry we apologize

[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.280]
On behalf of Mount Sin

[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.900]
I there they can butcher anybody

[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.640]
Any hospital like to kill you

[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.480]
Very on pump 22 almost 20 percent

[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.880]
Your pump baby pump it

[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.360]
Who the F is Shack 12

[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.260]
And somewhat 11 out of 111

[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.460]
This should tell you a lot about what's going on in America

[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.960]
Crowds are flocking to a hardware store and Rio Grand Valley, Texas

[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.740]
To see an image of Jesus that's appeared on a tinted window at the business now you can see it

[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.360]
I go to our website and click on the

[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.160]
When you click on this story

[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.180]
About people seeing their Jesus in the window

[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.060]
Just click on the link to the original story and you can see the pictures where there is absolutely

[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.620]
There's nothing there please as

[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.640]
The image first appeared on a true value hardware store window in July 19th and closed employees to what it

[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.420]
Where it came from since being discovered the image hasn't faded

[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.460]
People at the store agree the image resembles the face of Jesus Christ with a crown of thorns

[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.620]
Jesus Christ how do we know what the face of Jesus Christ look like when you come right down to

[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.820]
What it's up for Mel Gibson do we really have any idea no?

[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.940]
Do we really know if there was a Jesus Christ? No, no, I have my doubts

[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.640]
Anyway, I go to church whenever I get a chance

[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.440]
But I'm not a spiritual person. I do believe especially now resident set up to sing the window

[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.840]
Watch local channel six in uh, wherever this is where is this Houston Dallas somewhere

[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.840]
I'm gonna wear a real grand Valley Texas is I'm sure somebody knows watch channel six in Texas somewhere and they'll give you all the details

[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.820]
1027 at 560 WQM speaking of fun now you got another choice not just the

[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.980]
Musgrave look from Moe, but now you got the flat top look absolutely on you evolving guys not here

[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.840]
I just put a before and after picture on there and then take a poll on which one they like best

[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.100]
There you go that would be good that would kill a pool one day good

[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.620]
You like moe the flat top moe or the uh muskrat moe who do you let's go?

[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:34.320]
Anyway, if you don't want to look like a clown like moe or like sand Donaldson or some of the other silly embarrassing people with bad pieces

[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:41.060]
Charles up here is the guy you want to talk to no uh plugs in the head no holes in the head no dangerous pills no

[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:41.480]
BS

[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.400]
What you will have is great natural looking hair that looks like the real thing which Charlie's amazing

[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.940]
Natural hairline system for over 35 years Charlie's been doing it for guys who are losing their hair for guys who are bald

[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.240]
Is a bowling ball is a cubal and Charlie's new skill like hair system is a hundred percent

[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:02.400]
Undetectable. That's how great it looks because it looks like real hair grown out of your scalp and Charlie gives you a guarantee for 30 days

[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.060]
Where the system for a month and if you don't love it and the way it looks and feels and smells if you're not getting more

[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:13.020]
Xenon you ever have in your life then return it for a full refund what's not to like so don't delay if you want to really look great

[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.260]
Forget about the flat top look and the muskrat look and all of a sudden the crap and change your life forever

Paul Martin the Prime Minister in Canada pledged the yesterday to reintroduce legislation to decriminalize the position and use a small amounts of marijuana

[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.600]
As a new study shows Canadians use the drug as doubled in recent years

[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.160]
They're smoking it more and enjoying it more

[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.440]
Amid speculation that the new government would drop the legislation under pressure from the United States

[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.700]
The Prime Minister said uh-uh

[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.640]
After the first formal meeting of his new cabinet the bill will be reintroduced this fall

[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.420]
Mr. Martin statement came the same day statistic Canada released a study showing the number of Canadians

[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:48.760]
Especially younger ones a who admit to marijuana and hash uses almost doubled over 13-year period

[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:57.260]
The federal agency says about three million Canadians aged 15 and older or 12.2 percent admitted in 2002 to using the two cannabis substances in the previous 12 months

[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:02.100]
This was up from six and a half percent 1989 7.4 percent in 1994

[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:08.740]
Marijuana used peaked among 18 and 19 year olds almost 38 percent of that age group reported using marijuana and hash in the previous year

[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:13.440]
Among those age 15 through 17 the rate was 29 percent almost three and 10

[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.840]
Man and almost all age groups more likely to use marijuana and hash than women and there you go

[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.160]
That's the rest of the story

[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:27.800]
So despite pressure from the neon withdrawal USA the Canadian government said oh my dear own business get lost

[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.040]

Hello, good morning. Yeah, sir Shaq line

[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.020]
Listen, I run across a new product for people that are in danger of being

[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.360]
Board the death by all the Shaq talk. Yeah, it's called the Shaq alert

[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:34.440]
It's like the first alert system you wear it and when it when you're in danger of something coming out about Shaq

[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:40.160]
Put you to sleep until a danger's passed. Oh, I don't need that if I I'm already in a coma as soon as I hear the name

[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.900]
Uh, don't you hate what's going on?

[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.300]
Well, then we have to leave it. It's one more good reason that I'm here and you're there

[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.660]
For the way I guess but I'm leaving on him sports

[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.020]
Not too and I just talk

[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:01.480]
First of all correct me if I'm wrong, but they knew for many many many days ahead of time

[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.320]
This was just a matter of time before I deal with being done deal

[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:09.380]
I was no news no breaking news nothing news said. I mean just uh

[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:17.460]
Just a formality that's all what's the big simmous yeah, it's it's insulting to I think the sports fans who really enjoy sports

[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:24.980]
And don't have to listen to all this you know, well keep keep in mind there's a difference between a difference between a sports fan and a sports nerd

[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.300]
Have a good valley and don't forget

[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.100]

Any each other and by speaking to the NHL, you know your panthers may have played the last game ever

[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.220]
I know that Georgia is disbanded about that probably another reason remember is glad to be getting out of time

[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:14.160]
I don't think there might be any because it they had some talks yesterday the union and the elite and the it's looking really grim for an NHL season

[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.620]

You were praying and hoping for and of course you've heard me talk about balance for life for quite a while now

53.1%, very pumped up, whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.220]
21.1%.

[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.620]
Somewhat, 62.

[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.180]
And who the F is Shack, 24.

[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.400]
As in what is wrong with you people?

[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.640]
Are you absolutely out of your mind?

[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.640]
Are you crazy?

[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:55.600]
Are you insane?

[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.920]
Are you over the top?

[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.100]
Are you out of control?

[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.800]
Man, you talk about the media being...

[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.600]
I couldn't believe it when you kept potting up.

[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.740]
What channel did you have on?

[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.820]
I guess it was all of them.

[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.880]
It was six since in particular.

[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.500]
Oh my God.

[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.380]
And even I want to tell you, I don't want to tell you,

[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.160]
it tells out of school as the old saying goes.

[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:16.300]
But Joe Rose feels pretty much, he also realizes how ridiculous this all is.

[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.920]
And he has to put on a happy, excited face and you know, the old Gap tooth look.

[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:23.980]
I am pretended he's as excited as he's supposed to be, but guess what?

[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:24.860]
Not a chance.

[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.100]
And even Muff Lindsay came in this morning and admitted to me that it was just...

[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:33.920]
And what went on in that time on Tuesday was nothing short of insanity of mass madness

[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.520]
as Hollywood would say.

[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.360]
Man, he said it was a real pain in his...

[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:39.740]
Correct him.

[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:40.640]
But then again.

[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.940]
Come like toilet paper.

[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.400]
Fahrenheit 9-11's impact worries Republicans.

[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.680]
Good, anything that worries Republicans makes me a lot happier.

[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.920]
Republicans initially dismissed Fahrenheit 9-11 as a cinematic screen

[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.220]
that would play mostly the Inventory Bush Bashers.

[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:59.280]
Four weeks and 94 million dollars later, the film is still pulling in movie goers

[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:04.520]
at 2,000 theaters around the country, making Republicans nervous as it settles into the American mainstream.

[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.000]
And with all this hysteria about those Syrians on the plane,

[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.780]
we keep coming back to that one scene in the movie again about how many boxes,

[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:16.520]
how many match books and how many cigarette lighters you can carry on the plane.

[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.940]
Well, what are they thinking about?

[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:20.540]
cigarettes?

[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.220]
No, no, seriously, how is that possible that you can allow anything that's...

[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.600]
combustible or can cause any kind of a spark on a plane.

[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.300]
You have to be a lunatic even before 9-11.

[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.500]
I'm not sure if, of course, keep in mind that once upon a time back in the day

[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.780]
you could smoke on a lot of planes back in the day.

[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.480]
Not probably a pretty good idea.

[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.360]
Oops, there's a spark, oops, we're dead.

[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.240]
I'm not sure if it moves voters, the open consultant Scott Reed said,

[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.760]
but if it moves 3 or 4% it's been a success.

[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.020]
Two senior Republicans, closely tied to the White House,

[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.340]
said the movie from director Michael Moore,

[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.200]
seemed as a political headache because it has reached beyond the democratic base.

[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.800]
Independence and GOP-leaning voters are likely to be found sitting beside those

[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:08.300]
set to revelance depriction of a clueless president with questionable ties to the oral industry.

[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.740]
If you are a naive and committed voter wander into a theater

[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.000]
you aren't going to come away with a good impression of the president.

[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.080]
Republican operative Joe Gaylord said,

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.260]
it's a problem only if a lot of people see it.

[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.220]
Well, guess what they are.

[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:22.880]
Based on a record breaking gross of $94 million through last weekend,

[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.900]
theaters already have sold an estimated 12 million tickets to Fahrenheit 9-11.

[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:31.240]
A Gallup survey concluded July 18, the conducted July 8-11 said,

[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.920]
8% of American adults had seen the film at that time,

[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.500]
but that 18% still plan to see it at a theater,

[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.080]
and another 30% of American adults had seen it on video.

[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.480]
More than a third of Republicans nearly two-thirds of Independence told Galopy

[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.860]
had seen it respected to see the film of theaters around video.

[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.120]
Third, high-nine-loving opening June made me in local young theater,

[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.160]
especially on film and time audiences and the audio.

[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:59.720]
When he sat down to watch the film at the varsity theater in Des Moines and Iowa last weekend,

[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.020]
Rob Sheezy, who did the Harbor Antibush feelings two hours later,

[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.180]
he left with conflicted emotions.

[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.560]
You want to respect the president, Sheezy, who said,

[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.620]
he raised a lot of questions.

[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.780]
And Anonako, so nice going Michael Moore, you go, boy.

[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.880]
And you two landed around Staten School, those asked,

[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.840]
wipes at the Aladdin.

[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.080]
What a nice comeback there was.

[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:17.980]
I like it.

[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:18.680]
Cut it on the headphones.

[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:20.300]
Yeah, that was beautiful.

[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.340]
I did a little pause there.

[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:22.360]
Why you can say, ask, why?

[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.120]
Suck!

[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:23.960]
Right.

[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.440]
Or you can say, why?

[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.720]
Why did you hear this?

[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.420]
It's official Clear Channel Counter-Sews Infinity.

[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:32.620]
Oh my God.

[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.400]
Clear Channel Communications yesterday filed a counter-claim against

[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.120]
infinity broadcasting seeking $3 million in damages

[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.840]
tied to Clear Channel's cancellation of the Howard Spurms show on six of its stations.

[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.280]
Clear Channel claims it was forced to cancel the show after infinity and

[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.060]
stern refused to guarantee that the show wouldn't draw more in decency

[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.180]
fines from the FCC.

[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:54.300]
The counter-sew was filed in the same New York Federal Court which

[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.880]
infinity on June 30th by the $10 million breach of contract

[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.100]
suit against Clear Channel over its decision to yank Stern from its airwaves.

[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.960]
The radio show was told because Mr. Stern and infinity refused to assure us

[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.220]
that future programs would conform to the law.

[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.440]
Clear Channel Chief Legal Officer Andy Levine said that was a key

[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.000]
term in the agreement and we gave them every opportunity to make good on their

[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.340]
work before we permanently retired the show of it added.

[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.160]
We simply weren't willing to put the future of our radio station licenses in the hands

[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.360]
of Mr. Stern and infinity.

[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.160]
Fortunately our contract doesn't require us to do that.

[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:31.320]
Unfortunately Greg Readin and Presisting Me Making Any Moose because they finally

[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:34.700]
are coming to their senses and realizing that he's a manifestly irresponsible

[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.220]
lunatic.

[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.120]
Is there any other kind?

[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:38.440]
No.

[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:39.800]
So there you go.

[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:40.760]
That's clear Channel Infinity.

[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.860]
They're aduking it out.

[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.280]
But middle class families do.

[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.060]
5670560, pound 568 TNT and Verizon line.

[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:53.880]
361 votes.

[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:57.600]
We're going to do I think 400 by 1115 or close to it in an hour.

[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:02.460]
In the dog days of the summertime when there's nothing going on except...

[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.640]
I have no life.

[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.620]
I couldn't give a shmit less about check.

[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.540]
That's our poll question.

[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:08.240]
How said to you about the shack trade?

[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.680]
You whipped up and you're getting sucked in with a frenzy, you're getting lumped in with all the sheep out there

[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.540]
is added or what?

[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.580]
190 people say they couldn't give a shmit less.

[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.640]
That's 52.6% very pumped and whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:23.200]
I'm flagged late myself with chains over here.

[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:23.780]
I'm so excited.

[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.160]
76 people, 21% said that.

[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.080]
Somewhat.

[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:27.700]
Somewhat excited.

[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.160]
70.

[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.660]
And who the FB shack 25?

[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:33.840]
WQM Hello.

[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.060]
Good one.

[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.920]
WQM Hello.

[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:38.960]
Hello, Neil.

[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:39.540]
Yes?

[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.920]
Neil, I saw Fahrenheit.

[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.420]
Great, great movie.

[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.560]
I highly recommend it to anybody who hasn't seen it.

[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:47.000]
Only one problem with Michael Moore.

[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.080]
He thinks people in your tax bracket should be taxed at 70%.

[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.060]
What do you think about that?

[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.320]
Scream.

[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.200]
Exactly.

[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:55.140]
Bye-bye.

[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.320]
5670560, I didn't say it was perfect.

[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.240]
He's fat.

[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:03.240]
He affects your mental process many times.

[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.000]
Town 560, I should just do my stuff here.

[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.280]
Okay, because we're not going to get a lot of calls.

[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:12.540]
Just the quizzlings in the drags are left in town.

[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:13.560]
We're not going to leave them to you.

[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.100]
G. Thanks.

[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.260]
WQM Hello.

[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.060]
Hi, Neil.

[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:17.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:18.600]
Good morning.

[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:19.260]
Now.

[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.440]
I was channel surfing on Tuesday night.

[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.840]
I was going through the cable channels.

[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.400]
I ended up on the 700 club.

[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.280]
Because it's so far.

[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.700]
For entertainment purposes only of course.

[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.420]
But yeah, it was listening to what they were saying.

[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:39.560]
And they had something to talk about, the President Bush and print what's like, I think printed.

[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:40.520]
Bandar.

[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:41.080]
Bandar.

[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:46.240]
They were a contra password, didn't they pretty much what he was in relationship

[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.400]
with the Saudis.

[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.280]
And I always thought that the right-wing Chris is one of Bush's side.

[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.440]
Meaning what?

[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:59.600]
Meaning they were saying that that's that wasn't good and it was bad for business.

[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.340]
Yeah, stuff like that.

[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.920]
I mean, maybe they don't like that.

[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.560]
Right here, too.

[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.700]
Do you ever stuff anything about that?

[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.940]
Yeah, actually, because they were saying that the Muslims want to rule the world and

[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:08.280]
all that.

[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:13.040]
So I just felt like, yeah, because I thought they were the demographic George Bush has

[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:13.700]
backing him.

[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:18.980]
But I found out that they didn't like all this Saudi monkey business that was going on.

[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.560]
So I just wanted to say that and let me show you.

[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:22.260]
Okay.

[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:22.600]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.920]
5.6705.6705.6505.60 on the 18.

[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.620]
Don't you understand?

[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.420]
The religion is to all hate each other.

[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.580]
All the believers out there.

[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:32.740]
The one thing they believe in is hate.

[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.620]
That's what it's all about.

[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.900]
Religion equals hate and tolerance.

[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:40.260]
Everybody hates everybody else all the time is what I'm thinking.

[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.140]
Everybody hates everybody all the time.

[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:51.060]
That's the way of life is flourishing.

[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.100]
Absolutely for hate.

[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.780]
I was raised in anger.

[00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.160]
Well, there you are.

[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.180]
That's enough of that for right now.

[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:00.540]
That's it.

[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.360]
I love all of these.

[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.000]
There's a great test.

[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.460]
Thank you, Bokobrani, your okay, and our book, even with that bald head.

[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.180]
That'd be a big pull question.

[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.300]
Who's got the best bald spot?

[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:12.340]
Bokobrani, now that we've finally got that muskrat out to the pasture.

[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:12.800]
Right?

[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.800]
Choice-ratford.

[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:15.720]
Choice-ratford.

[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.240]
See if you don't know who that is.

[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.560]
Who made Mike in sales?

[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.540]
They don't know who that is either.

[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:19.960]
And you know what?

[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.320]
They're lucky.

[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.320]
Stay away from that, Mike.

[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.220]
Let's let people like mad Mike.

[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.480]
I had a kind of people who hang around in the parking lot every day.

[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.740]
And you just never know what today is going to be, which day that somebody like that very quiet, very strange.

[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.120]
I was just going to explode.

[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:33.560]
Right.

[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.040]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.000]
What are you talking about?

[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.620]
Just go up into white's tower with like a shotgun and...

[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.840]
With an oozy.

[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.880]
You just start to get a little red.

[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:44.140]
Right.

[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.460]
Just start to own attack.

[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:54.100]
That's not official, but I'm hearing the rumor that I just started that McDonald's is going to change the name of that burger from Big Mac to the Big T.

[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:55.020]
That's what I'm thinking.

[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:55.620]
Yep.

[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.100]
And probably not a bad idea if he asked me.

[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.880]
Tony Romitz, you're going to order a shack of ribs now.

[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:01.860]
There you go.

[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:03.620]
How about the...

[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.960]
Well, they have a place called the burger shack, don't they?

[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:08.200]
But they did have.

[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:08.920]
Like somewhere else.

[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:09.460]
Right.

[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:10.700]
Well, it could spell over there.

[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.380]
With a Q.

[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.340]
We'll even loan them the Q from WQAM.

[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.080]
Or I'll loan them the Q from Ms. In the...

[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:17.440]
Quizzling.

[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:21.780]
12 minutes after 11 at 5.60 WQM,

[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:25.040]
whether you're moving or renovating, that's the best time to call 1-800 mattress.

[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:30.380]
Make that first night in Dreamhouse, heavenly, with a brand new top-quality brand-day mattress and dial amatris.

[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.020]
You pick the date and time for delivery to fit your move in schedule.

[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.460]
And dial amatris is on time, 99.7% of the time.

[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.480]
Nobody's got a better selection of queen and king size mattresses sets.

[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.980]
Ready for mattresses sets?

[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:42.560]
Sizzes?

[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.100]
For me to deliver them dial amatris.

[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.660]
When you call 1-800 mattress, you get a great mattress.

[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.960]
Head of this count on beatable price.

[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.300]
You won't have to schlep all around town in the rain in the heat.

[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.720]
dial amatris is ranked number one in customer satisfaction.

[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.720]
They were winners of the 2004 Better Business Bureau,

[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.240]
Local Torts of Excellence Award.

[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.020]
When you call 1-800 mattress, you'll choose from the complete line of C. Lee's,

[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.500]
sort of King Coral Simmons, temperate even Stearns of Banana's Foster.

[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.620]
All the smart folks and even some not-to-bright at QAAM

[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.720]
because they know it's a good deal of called 1-800 mattress for their beds.

[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:11.980]
You ought to be doing the same.

[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.740]
Don't get ripped off in those bedding and department stores

[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.740]
paying for the big overhead.

[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.180]
Get an unbeatable deal, unbelievable deal at dial amatris.

[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.620]
Just make that one easy call.

[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.220]
They'll be knocking on your door at no time at all.

[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:26.580]
1-800 mattress, 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S, or online, it's mattress.com.

[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.480]
Line and local,

[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.680]
We're sports radio, 5-60-C-U-A-M.

[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.700]
Freedom and fake cheese.

[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.360]
Facts by the man,

[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.520]
by the man,

[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.820]
Jim and Cashier,

[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.680]
the garbage can,

[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:45.740]
Seven looks,

[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:46.860]
it is suit,

[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.760]
right now next to the fighting suit, big bucks.

[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.220]
Big bucks was by the man.

[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.660]
Bites the dark,

[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:55.760]
fools the dark,

[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.000]
cranking up all the moral stock.

[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.080]
So bliss,

[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.240]
it can't miss,

[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.480]
number one lap of oxalibis,

[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.200]
big bucks,

[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.420]
big bucks to fight a man.

[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.740]
The v-a-t-t-r-s will be packed,

[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.900]
you see it on the screen.

[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.180]
No one cares,

[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.120]
he can't act.

[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.400]
If the mate jumps a dream,

[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:16.960]
Spider-Man,

[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.180]
Spider-Man,

[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.200]
from the cradle,

[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.320]
the guy gets there.

[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.460]
He's got cubs,

[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.480]
there's no doubt,

[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.400]
all of the movies just watch out, big bucks.

[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.040]
Movie houses are filled with,

[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.460]
he's gonna make it killin',

[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.520]
oh, oh, oh, oh, wow.

[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:35.720]
I'm 18 and 560,

[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.500]
WQM, I got only a little row to go.

[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.360]
Better talk real fast,

[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.580]
think about 20,000 phone calls between now

[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.960]
and Marlon pregame time,

[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.020]
1230, Marlon's at the Phills 105,

[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.240]
the Humper Octetable game,

[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.340]
and then the big,

[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.860]
touches he is,

[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.740]
Faxal at 780K10,

[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:51.840]
what is their gambling report?

[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.320]
The Undersen,

[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:53.620]
The Overs,

[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:54.700]
and The Ins and The Outs.

[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.220]
WQA, M, Hello.

[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.860]
Yeah, I think it's George?

[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.320]
Yes, go ahead.

[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:01.660]
Is it George?

[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:02.240]
Yes.

[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.940]
I wonder why you didn't talk about that letter yesterday yet, that rediculous six-page letter

[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.320]
that you wouldn't talk about.

[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.040]
There was another radio on another station that read the whole goddamn thing.

[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.280]
See, there he goes.

[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.120]
He blurted out one of those words that we can say, which something would damn.

[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:21.020]
Right?

[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.060]
Yeah.

[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.300]
That rediculous six-page letter that we didn't want that we were talking about, not wanting.

[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.520]
I just got to your Tony about that minutes ago if you have one ear, even that word,

[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.020]
with a little bit of fancy buildup, maybe, but even so, had somebody write it out for

[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:35.860]
you in the short-term.

[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.340]
It's a pretty nasty work.

[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:37.460]
Yeah.

[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.460]
We're keeping it from them.

[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.180]
Right.

[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.000]
It was on our website days ago.

[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.440]
It's an old story by now.

[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.720]
It's getting stellar than last year's MOTSA, okay?

[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:46.960]
Give us a break already.

[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:51.740]
All right, about the Syrian musicians on the plane and this hyperventilating hysterical

[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.720]
bitch from the Women's Wall Street Journal making a big sentence about it.

[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.120]
It's interesting.

[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.080]
Nobody else is making a big deal about it.

[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.340]
Once they did their investigation, they checked it all out and come to find out that

[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.920]
she's a little over the top.

[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:03.860]
Little bit like that.

[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:04.180]
Yeah.

[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.900]
That's another idiot road.

[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.380]
And we don't really give a crap.

[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.620]
Who else was talking about it?

[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.260]
If you're so impressed, somebody else talked about it.

[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.220]
Go listen to them, okay?

[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.240]
Well, what?

[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.000]
Forget about it.

[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.100]
We don't need anybody programming the program.

[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:15.880]
Got it?

[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.400]
Why didn't you read that letter, George?

[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.420]
Line 9, WQA Am Hello.

[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:22.360]
Deal?

[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.200]
Yes, this is Mike and Girls Point Michigan.

[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.620]
Hey, Mike, how you doing?

[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:26.980]
Good.

[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:27.360]
How are you?

[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.480]
Here's a guy that's got a few bucksies and Girls Point.

[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:30.360]
That's right.

[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.060]
Hey, good.

[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.940]
Hey, you think that Shaq is going to matter against Detroit?

[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.500]
All right.

[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.340]
Oh, boy.

[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.420]
Let me ask you this.

[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.100]
Can I ask you something?

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.620]
Sure.

[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:42.480]
Who cares?

[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.020]
See, there's a guy.

[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.540]
He's not listening on the show online.

[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.260]
He has no idea what we're talking about.

[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.600]
He evidently is one of these people that went and looked at a thing in Miami.

[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:55.580]
I lost sports station, WQA Am, he got the call in number and he calls in, I don't care,

[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:55.960]
okay?

[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.300]
We don't care about Shaq on the show, okay?

[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.820]
We've got 20 hours of the girl up the butt, all right?

[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.280]
Got it all.

[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.500]
In fact, that should have been the model of the station.

[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.760]
On Tuesday, we got Shaq up the butt.

[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.300]
That's right.

[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:10.980]
Say it again.

[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.180]
Shaq up the butt.

[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.180]
Shaq up the butt.

[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.140]
Shaq up the butt.

[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.120]
Shaq up the butt.

[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.040]
Shaq up the butt.

[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:17.300]
Yeah.

[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.240]
I'll just put that on the endless loop, okay?

[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.140]
Shaq up the butt.

[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.200]
Who gives a flying crap who's got an IQ larger than their Tonyil, okay?

[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.120]
You in the sill and Girls Point?

[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.200]
Here's the guy that's got some money, of course, in the when he live in Detroit, what else

[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:30.660]
you're going to do?

[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.480]
Besides sitting around worried about a bunch of big black guys.

[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.480]
Just wait until they start moving in a gross point, baby.

[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.100]
That's right.

[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.800]
In fact, maybe Shaq and some of his buddies will Shaq up there and gross point.

[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.020]
Then you'll have what for.

[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.800]
Then you'll have something really to be concerned about.

[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.880]
Then they'll have to move you back to Palmer Woods in Palmer Park.

[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.520]
423 votes on that pool.

[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.600]
That's pretty exciting, isn't it?

[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.440]
Yeah, we'll take it.

[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.940]
It means that all 50 of the people who are listening voted eight times.

[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:01.440]
Then some.

[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.080]
423, how are you about to Shaq trade?

[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.620]
I couldn't give a shmit less to 115, almost 51%.

[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:11.380]
Somewhat has moved ahead of very much.

[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.100]
Somewhat 92, very excited.

[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:20.060]
I'm pumped 89, 21%, and who the F is Shaq 27, 6.3%, who are just adamant.

[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:20.980]
They don't want to know from it.

[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.200]
They don't want to hear from it.

[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:22.500]
Nothing.

[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.160]
WQAM, hello.

[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.040]
WQAM, hello.

[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.040]
QAM.

[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.060]
It's really good on these days when we're not building the pool.

[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.020]
This is proof positive what we've said for almost 30 years.

[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.020]
530, man.

[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.080]
WQAM, hello.

[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:40.060]
Hello.

[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:40.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:44.620]
Hey, Neil, tell everybody at least tell November to get off Shaq.

[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.800]
Watch us not Shaq.

[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:46.700]
Yeah, okay.

[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:52.960]
560, 7.0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.740]
The time that refused to care.

[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.660]
The town that refused to think.

[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.920]
The town that refused.

[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.140]
Sounds pretty good, don't it?

[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.440]
Yeah, we'll take it.

[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.000]
12.

[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.580]
WQAM, hello.

[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:03.960]
To other.

[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.980]
Yes, is this Neil?

[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:06.700]
Yes.

[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:08.900]
Yeah, I want to ask everything.

[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.140]
There's something right now.

[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:14.460]
If you just graduated from basic training in the Army.

[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.160]
Yeah.

[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.740]
And they had charged it when he saw it as a way I racked it now.

[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:25.160]
They charged him $234 a month for his food out of a private pay.

[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:25.900]

[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.340]
That comes after the taxes.

[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.340]
And they charged him $75 for a pair of sneakers.

[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.200]
In the, when he was in basic.

[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.260]
Yeah, what would you like me to do about it?

[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.420]
What I want to know is that was it?

[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:42.380]
Yes.

[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.460]
$75 for a pair of sneakers and they're buying them in hundreds of thousands.

[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.140]
Right.

[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.180]
Oh, I just don't get to this.

[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:56.240]
Well, probably a downstairs tani maybe owns a little piece in Nike or something.

[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:56.680]
I don't know.

[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.200]
Get out of here.

[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.580]
I don't understand.

[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.840]
Say he's in basic training.

[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:01.440]
He signed up.

[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:01.980]
He volunteered.

[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.240]
We don't have a draft yet.

[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.860]
And she's belly.

[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:05.400]
He can okay.

[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.400]
Just go with it.

[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.220]
Go with a flow, honey.

[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.040]
Go with a program.

[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.120]
Get with it.

[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:09.320]
Right.

[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.500]
Lay back and think of England.

[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.160]
Quit the vision.

[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.780]
$5670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.600]
What a place.

[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.860]
Man, it is just a scary thing.

[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.320]
And our discurses make his presence felt this morning.

[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:23.760]
Thank goodness.

[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:24.560]
He knows better.

[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.160]
As low as my opinion was at that child before Tuesday morning, his performance on Tuesday.

[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.400]
Oh, well, you can leave it one because we don't want to have those drop ins on here.

[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.300]
We have to handle this thing very seriously.

[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.460]
You just don't understand.

[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.580]
You don't get the magnitude of this event.

[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:39.900]
Okay.

[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:40.800]
Yeah, you can.

[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:41.180]
I get it.

[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:41.860]
All right.

[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:42.220]
I get it.

[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:46.020]
We're working with a bunch of simpletons, man, who are like just so far over the top.

[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:52.060]
Just grab it out of this thing for in bleeding it and just squeezing the juice out of it for

[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:52.600]
all they can.

[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.640]
So I try to get blood out of a rock.

[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.860]
I'm not going to say it.

[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:00.180]
WQAM.

[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:00.440]
Hello.

[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:01.500]
This is not.

[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:02.860]
Oh, yeah.

[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.260]
WQAM.

[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:04.480]
Hello.

[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:05.900]
WQAM.

[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:06.540]
Rock and roll.

[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:07.980]
Oh, God.

[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.240]
See what I'm saying?

[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:10.740]
Holy.

[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.500]
What's going on?

[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:11.580]

[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.540]
We are scraping whatever is under the barcles on the bottom of the ship, which I don't even

[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.260]
want to look there.

[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.540]
Holy crap.

[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:21.220]
WQAM.

[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:21.440]
Hello.

[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.000]
Neil, you got to play that shack up the butt thing again.

[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:24.580]
It's hilarious.

[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:25.360]
Yeah.

[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:26.820]
I love it.

[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.940]
Yeah, I bet you do.

[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:30.460]
Oh, okay.

[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.380]
Yeah, I bet you do, sweetheart.

[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.320]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, six, they got to, well, I don't want to.

[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.240]
Because they're going to break.

[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.160]
No, I got to read this article.

[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.100]
It's on our website.

[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:45.420]
Scott C. Smith writes, the drudge guy to internet journalism.

[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.640]
Rips, Miss, drudge, and ass and deservedly so.

[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:49.200]
Right.

[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.460]
When you mention ass, Miss Fudge gets all, there's another one for your bald pole.

[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:54.720]
That's right.

[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.620]
That's so stupid.

[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.040]
The hat that she wears.

[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.580]
By the way, Miss Fudge, I tried to click on something about the math day.

[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.100]
I mean, we had on your website and it went to, you know, you're not entitled to look at this page.

[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.220]
You better get your links straightened out, sweetheart.

[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.200]
Okay, Miss Fudge.

[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.640]
Miss high paid.

[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:12.000]
Paid for own lock stock and bagels.

[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:12.680]
Miss Fudge.

[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.500]
Subhating Jew Fag.

[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.680]
And have a nice day.

[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.780]
26 past 11.

[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.760]
I'm saying one thing we're getting.

[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.240]
Well, that's why they're busy voting on the pole over and over again.

[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:26.860]
Because look at that.

[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:27.340]
I'm pumped.

[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.400]
It's just past somewhat.

[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.060]
But if you put them two together, though, it's 43%.

[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.580]
That's the scary part.

[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:33.840]
43%.

[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.360]
Now, do you believe at any point in the almost in the six and a half years have been on this radio station?

[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:44.800]
Do you believe that at any point, if we asked, are you an NBA fan or are you a heat fan that anywhere near 43% would have said yes?

[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:46.520]
No.

[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.680]
No chance.

[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:48.860]
No chance.

[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:49.300]
None.

[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:57.100]
Which goes to show you that 43% even of this astute audience, this supposedly a crust above a mentally.

[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.940]
And you just heard of it sampling.

[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.920]
Are still getting sucked in by the media hype.

[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:03.880]
That's what it's all about.

[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.320]
Life in America is just a hype.

[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.300]
Whoever screams the loudest and makes the most noise.

[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:11.600]
That's it.

[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.820]
Hey, when you go out to either, you're sick and tired of trying to figure out which menu items are low carb.

[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:24.100]
What if I told you that there is an affordable fast food low carb restaurant that actually cares about your nutrition and offers you an entire menu that really is low carb?

[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.840]
Cut and carbs, cafes, the name of the place.

[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.660]
It's a fast food low carb restaurant that caters to all you low carb diners out there.

[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:34.720]
Stop in and try their pounds away pizza that's low on carbs with a high on taste.

[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.580]
And all kinds of fantastic goodies on them and you like way out wraps, carbohydrates with low carbs.

[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.080]
In fact, they got like the cheesy carb.

[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.480]
But he is going to lay seven at carbs.

[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:49.280]
These so be salads, these soups, healthy way treats, including even factory soft serve ice cream too.

[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.000]
Delicious and taste and very low in carbs.

[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.200]
Cut and carbs, cafe located just outside the Sogrest meal is mall on sunrise, you can call it a 9.5.4.

[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:04.340]
5.14.001 or check them on the web at cut and carbs cafe.com.

[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:09.120]
It's either delicious, low carb wraps, pizzas, quesadilla soup salads, snacks, and even ice cream like I said.

[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.640]
Cut and carbs, cafe where you can dinin or take it out.

[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:16.580]
Just outside the Sogrest meal is mall on sunrise, vulgar arc, stop by or calm 2.00 a.m. at 9.5.4.

[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:17.620]
5.14.

[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.440]
Oh, oh, oh, one.

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.080]
9.5.

[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.820]
And low carb, this is 4.00.5.60.

[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.000]
2.00 a.m.

[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.060]
Gotta thank his old man.

[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.180]
We got him out of Vietnam.

[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.500]
He hid in Alabama somewhere.

[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.540]
And then he had to sail his dry oil well.

[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.140]
Saudi oil made him a millionaire.

[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:57.720]
What's a hard-booting Yale would know where he could fail.

[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.300]
Then talk drunk and went off to jail.

[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.360]
What he got right out.

[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.780]
His daddy's friends had clout.

[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:10.280]
Enough to fight the Rangers on sail.

[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:15.660]
Curses, push ass friends in high places.

[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.300]
Or dip jane in the pain and the end lawn mornies.

[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.080]
Going back, can you lay?

[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.420]
Hill pardon him, stay.

[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.400]
Hill, do what he wants in all places.

[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:38.320]
When you're born rich, you've got all the aces.

[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.100]
George Bush has friends.

[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.380]
I can have places.

[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.080]
Amen.

[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.880]
1132.28 till note at 560.

[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.220]
There's Thomas Kane with the 9.11 Commission report.

[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:52.940]
But remember also.

[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:53.700]
Okay.

[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:55.740]
Let's see.

[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:58.160]
Scott C Smith, who's a writer and beaverton Oregon.

[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:02.220]
No less comments for the website counterbikes.com.

[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.480]
He writes, the drugs guy to internet journalism.

[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.380]
Says, Matt drugs likes to think of himself as a journalist.

[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.560]
Anyone who's visited his website, the drug report,

[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:13.840]
knows that the site is essentially a collection of links to other sites

[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.840]
and the occasional bit of reporting that's encodes by Matt drugs.

[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.340]
Not that Matt drugs actually has any education or training as a journalist.

[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.780]
The closest drug came to the media was managing a CBS gift shop.

[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.420]
In 1995, the earliest version of the drug report debuted as an email newsletter.

[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:33.720]
The drug report website was launched in 1997 and won a drug as early as scoops

[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.640]
was the revelation by Kathleen William Bill Clinton that the

[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:40.180]
Bill Clinton and its actually proposition to run federal property

[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.140]
according to the August 18th, 1997 issue of Newsweek.

[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.240]
Drug law reports what he hears without verifying the source.

[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.180]
I have no editor drug told Newsweek.

[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.380]
I can say whatever I want.

[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.880]
Drugs does get the occasional exclusive, but more often than not.

[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.700]
He's essentially a dumpster diver of internet news looking for scraps

[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:01.380]
that legitimate news outlets have thrown away or relying on unverified email tips from readers.

[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:05.460]
What propelled Matt drugs into the National Spotlight was his exclusive again in

[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.300]
quotes report on Monica Lewinsky's affair with Bill Clinton.

[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.140]
Michael Isacoff of Newsweek did the actual reporting on the Lewinsky Clinton affair,

[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:15.860]
but when Newsweek decided to can the story, drugs took Isacoff's material

[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.760]
and ran with it as a drug report exclusive.

[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.720]
Drug specializes in the sensational throwing out real bits of news mixing

[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.640]
with gossip in a new window and people listen.

[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.420]
Thrudge's website gets millions of hits a day.

[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.900]
Drug favors the conservative point of view, so right we're misconcoun on drugs

[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.920]
to pass along stories about Democrats to put them in a negative light.

[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.680]
For example, during the 2000 presidential campaign,

[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.500]
the following headlines appeared on the drug report about Al Gore.

[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:44.220]
Gore campaign files fly-splag backwards violation of federal code.

[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.060]
Father of internet endorses Al Gore, a popular conservative lie about Al Gore,

[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.680]
is that Gore claimed to have invented the internet.

[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:53.760]
Gore said homosexuality abnormal and wrong vowed not to take money from gay groups.

[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:57.000]
The sensational headline does not mention that the story was from 1981.

[01:14:57.980 --> 01:14:59.760]
This was just a small sampling from drugs.

[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.920]
Clearly, Dredge's agenda is conservative, understatement of the century.

[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.660]
Now that the 2004 presidential race is underway,

[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.620]
Dredge is doing his part to publish sensational stories about the Democratic candidates.

[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:13.700]
Dredge's statistics on John Kerry on January 27, 2004,

[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.360]
reporting that Kerry had taken Botox for wrinkles.

[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.740]
Dredge posted a ledge before an after photographs of Kerry.

[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:23.940]
Kerry's campaign denied the charge, nor does that matter to not that that matters to Dredge.

[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.700]
Another Dredge exclusive in February was that Kerry had a mistress.

[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.160]
Again, the charge was unfound and quickly refuted.

[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.660]
If anything, Dredge is dedicated to his task.

[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.700]
Dredge made much to do about nothing in March with a story, again, in quotes,

[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.540]
that Kerry called a secret service agent a name after the man bumped into Kerry while Kerry was snowboarding,

[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.860]
causing Kerry to take a spill.

[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:45.880]
Oddly enough, Dredge did a little reporting of the incident in the Senate on June 22,

[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.960]
when Vice President Dick Cheney called Senator Patrick Leahy over monthly F-word.

[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.840]
Until I eighth, the big Dredge scoop was that John Edwards and John Kerry were gay.

[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.360]
Of course, Dredge never actually used the words gay or homosexual,

[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.160]
but rather made this suggestion with a series of photographs and some breathless prose,

[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:04.200]
hugs, kisses to the cheek, affectionate touching of the face,

[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.740]
caressing of the back, grabbing of the arm, fingers to the neck, rubbing of the knees,

[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:11.000]
John Kerry and John Edwards can't keep their hands off each other.

[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.260]
On July 19, Dredge had two exclusive scoops.

[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:20.000]
Dredge dredged up the tarot boat toss reference with a twist that Kerry had gone back to wrinkles.

[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:23.440]
After upping for a fresh-based look for most of the campaign year,

[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.360]
then presidential hopeful John Kerry was boldly going back to wrinkles

[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.440]
read the scoop of the century.

[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.440]
The second story is an example of just how dishonest a reporter, again, that word is in quotes,

[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.880]
mad Dredge's, under a huge banner headline,

[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.680]
you're not going to have to look for us on vacation.

[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:41.240]
Dredge ran a series of photos of John Kerry engaging in numerous activities

[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:44.400]
and a quote from John Kerry saying, you're not going to have to look for us on vacation.

[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.460]
You're going to find us, Kerry and John Edwards, working for America.

[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:51.820]
However, Dredge offers no context, nor does he offer any dates for when the photos were taken.

[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.440]
Perhaps John Kerry's an active guy, and does a lot on a weekend.

[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:58.500]
You wouldn't know it from Dredge, fact checking, verification, accuracy.

[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:02.480]
These are concepts for and to mad Dredge. Dredge distorts and he decides.

[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.620]
I should have said Dredge distorts and she decides what it should be saying.

[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.780]
We got the pregame Marlon pregame show at 1230.

[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.420]
Are they saying noon? That sounds like a plan.

[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.940]
Okay. At 1230, then we got the Volgae 105.

[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.460]
I will say this, if you're inclined to listen from 12 to 1230,

[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.960]
I wouldn't get too carried away because we have nothing but spots in there for a half an hour.

[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:27.220]
In fact, you might want to ask Clarence, maybe I should just bail out at noon.

[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:31.440]
Yeah, like on Tuesday, Mandage could do the pregame.

[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:32.220]
Or the pregame.

[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.180]
We can have Mandage do.

[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:37.300]
In fact, Mandage could come out right now and do a little bit of build up for the Marlon game.

[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.000]
That's right, since we're becoming more and more sports-intensive now.

[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.640]
And obviously this poll bears it out. We did the right thing on Tuesday.

[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:43.460]
You bet.

[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.240]
That is very peri would say if we'd do a lot more talk about that,

[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:50.740]
then we're going to have a lot more fans, right? Right, that's how it works.

[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.140]
In fact, if we have like 15-20 stations talking about all day,

[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.360]
it'll bring a lot more people to the...

[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.300]
492 votes in an hour and 20 minutes, man. We are really impressed.

[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:06.340]
How excited are you about the Shack Trade is our poll question on theoranges.com?

[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.420]
I couldn't give a Schmidt last 245 just under 50%.

[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.060]
Very excited. I'm pumped.

[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:15.960]
110, 22.3%. I whipped up into a frenzy.

[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.280]
Somewhat, 109 is another 21%, that's 43.2%.

[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.580]
Are just full-minute to mouth, man. They're doing a Kazzowski right now.

[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.960]
And who the FHAC 34 is 7%?

[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.080]
WQA, hello?

[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:33.020]
Two-inch.

[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:33.760]
Yeah.

[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.800]
I got a question for you. Who does the place of Mohaward on your bits?

[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:40.140]
Is that Jeff the four?

[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.280]
I've seen no one says.

[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:41.800]
Greg Reed.

[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:43.860]
Greg Reed does it?

[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.520]
Or maybe Jack Vinny.

[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.760]
Let's say FACTS about Gross Point says Mike Blacks are already here.

[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.620]
I'm listening on 9 and you're still talking about...

[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.300]
No, we're not talking about...

[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:53.720]
FACTS!

[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:54.300]
Absolutely not.

[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.520]
Says Mike in the Gross Point and now he is listening online.

[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.200]
So we apologize for that, don't we?

[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.020]
Yes.

[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.300]
But he owes us an apology for calling us and I'm stupid basketball question.

[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.160]
I apologize.

[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.960]
Because if he's listening online, he should know better.

[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.600]
They say no stupid sports show and we don't really give a crap about Detroit and about Shack and the heat.

[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.640]
I don't care.

[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.120]
And not one teeny tiny little bit.

[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.360]
I didn't care before Tuesday.

[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:16.460]
I don't care now.

[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:18.280]
I'm not going to be some fully bandwagon jumper.

[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.320]
That's the number one pass time in South Florida.

[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:22.960]
Bandwagon jumping.

[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.740]
Am I right?

[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:25.460]
Fuck you.

[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.020]
Third man.

[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:26.840]
Absolutely.

[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.180]
There's nobody's throwing fans.

[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:28.900]
Wow.

[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:31.800]
Talk about the land of Make Believe.

[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.920]
Twenty before noon at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.220]
When we come back after the break, we have over 500 votes on there.

[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:42.040]
An hour and a half.

[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:42.640]
All right.

[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.120]
Hey, that's something.

[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.780]
That means we've got several people out there voting over and over again.

[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.640]
Talk to the man.

[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.000]
Let me tell you about drive concepts.

[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:52.060]
I've talked about these people for a long, long time on a show.

[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.560]
In fact, I've used them in my home for over 20 years personally.

[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.920]
They've been in town since 1979, which sounds like 25 years to me.

[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:00.420]
And the reason that they're still around is because they're the best.

[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:04.120]
Nobody does a job for you making your carpets look brand new like drive concepts.

[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:10.380]
And nobody gives you a better deal all the way around because they give you a written, guaranteed price upfront before they start the work.

[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:14.440]
No tack on, no surprises, no fully 595 per room scams.

[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.120]
None of that BS.

[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.520]
Just a stupendous, unbeatable job of sucking out the deep down dirt in your carpets,

[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.420]
way down there in the fibers they can't see with an naked eye, which leaves them really, really clean.

[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.580]
I mean, just like brand new.

[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.880]
They drive in a couple of hours.

[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:26.860]
They smell a lot of fresh.

[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.060]
So you really can't clean today, entertain tonight.

[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.360]
Not just a slow dance reality when you call drive concepts.

[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.900]
And when you do make that phone call, you can say the next 15% off there already unbeatable price.

[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:40.140]
If I have a new, you put on the stand by list, just say put my name on your stand by list.

[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:43.300]
They'll call you when they have an opening and they'll be over and do their job no time at all.

[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:48.480]
Pick up that phone and call them right now for your carpeting, your furniture, your draper, your expensive area and oriental rug.

[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:54.720]
It's called tool free 1-800-248-5071 because nobody in the world does a job for you like drive concepts.

[01:20:55.220 --> 01:21:00.220]
1-800-248-5071 or check them on the web at dryconcepts.com.

[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:06.540]
My life and love is this 4.0-60-258-208.

[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.340]
Let's, let's the trick to achieving longevity.

[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.080]
And that's the way I think about often.

[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.500]
Completely, maglies abuse drugs and...

[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.160]
Yeah, party.

[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.100]
Let's take some calls.

[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.360]
Johnson City, Tennessee is on with us.

[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.020]
You've got Nick and Jessica. Go ahead.

[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.500]
Hi Ryan. This is Andrea.

[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.780]
Oh, hi Andrea.

[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.680]
Jessica, is it true you don't drink milk?

[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.680]
Because you can't see your head in the carton.

[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:31.160]
Yeah.

[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:32.860]
Yeah, I'll admit it.

[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:39.180]
Well, is it also true that you hired a private detective to find out if you were related to a Homer and Bart Simpson?

[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:39.740]
Yes.

[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.640]
I don't know what I'm going to do with her. She's out of control.

[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.320]
I love us so high, oh you're on.

[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.940]
Yeah, I can see advertisement from the internet about it.

[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.720]
Nick and Jessica, sex tape.

[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:50.840]
Is that really you guys?

[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:51.440]
Definitely.

[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:52.720]
Yeah, we have a clip.

[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.380]
Take a look at Nick and Jessica.

[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.300]
Nick and Jessica.

[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:56.300]

[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.120]
Wow, what can I get a copy of that?

[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.440]
In the store, you get it now?

[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:03.840]
Yeah.

[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:04.200]
Okay.

[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.740]
I know we're glets and deciding to do this.

[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.440]
Oh no, we're so happy. We did it.

[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:09.500]
We are so happy.

[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.960]
We did off on stuff like that.

[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.460]
Very gratifying for us.

[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.400]
Well said.

[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:19.520]
Looking 45, I think you can pick it up at your neighborhood farm store and also get that carton of milk at the same time.

[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:20.720]
I am so tired of them.

[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.800]
It's just the fact that pulled you had yesterday.

[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.440]
And her?

[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.620]
The two of them.

[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:25.780]
Sure.

[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:28.420]
I mean, I just, they're all over the place.

[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.300]
It's like wall to wall.

[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.460]
Even almost as bad as not quite.

[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:34.980]
523 votes we did.

[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:38.280]
What do I tell you when we came back after the break we had over 500 votes on there?

[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.620]
And not that that means anything, but I just thought I mentioned it.

[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.660]
Last year after the United States invaded Iraq, Carlos Delgado and I was George, I'm sure you're very familiar with Carlos.

[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:49.040]
Oh yeah.

[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:49.940]
He's his favorite.

[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:54.440]
Carlos Delgado in his own quiet way said that for him enough was enough.

[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:00.900]
Delgado, they threw on a blue J slugger by the way who they wish to help would wave his no trade clause and get that out of here.

[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:01.480]
But he won't.

[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:09.620]
And one of America's most respected players in baseball had stood for the playing of God Bless America games to the 2003 season, but about not to do so this season.

[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:12.580]
In an act of simple, mostly I noticed protests.

[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:15.620]
Most of the notice because nobody watches the blue J's and why should they waste their time.

[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:18.060]
Most of the notice protests against the war in Iraq.

[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:23.840]
Delgado a 32 year old first-base minister was remained in the dugout while God Bless America's played you go boy.

[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.760]
Nice going Carlos.

[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.520]
I'm trying not to get anyone mad.

[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]
He said I'm Monday and open.

[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.900]
This is my personal feeling.

[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.720]
I don't want to draw attention to myself or go out of my way to protest if I make the out in the last of the 17th inning.

[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.900]
I'll stand there, but I'd rather be in the dugout.

[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.180]
Good for him says William Rodin in the New York Times.

[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:47.680]
In the world of mainstream sports where cookie cutter athletes rarely take a stand on any issue, let alone one as highly charged as a war.

[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.840]
Delgado is unafraid to question a ritual that he doesn't agree with.

[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:56.240]
Delgado's protest has been so subtle that baseball commissioner Bud Sealick didn't even know about it until I called him on Monday.

[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.460]
He says William Rodin.

[01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:58.600]
Rodin.

[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.300]
When you called me today, you actually startled me, said from his office in Milwaukee.

[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.200]
Sealick later read a statement he had prepared on Delgado.

[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.600]
I mean, the process of getting more information, but eventually I'd like to sit down and discuss it with Carlos Sealick said,

[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:15.780]
I'm very sensitive to this kind of issue, both as a matter of respect for our country and for one's right to express his opinion.

[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.080]
Sealick was a major f***er role.

[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:23.880]
In the aftermath of 9-11 order, it all teams to play God Bless Americans, acting as a political statement into the games.

[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.720]
I don't honestly think that we politicized the issue, Sealick, so calling it a matter of respect.

[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.160]
After all, we do have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:37.660]
With all due respect to Sealick, once God Bless America became a political statement, a player like Delgado became free to express his own political views.

[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.140]
At any rate, I just mentioned that in person.

[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.760]
Anybody care about Carlos Delgado?

[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.820]
No, because what does he have to do with, right?

[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:52.060]
I was just saying, when you look at this poll, I mean, this proves how you people are being led by the nose, just like Alihan.

[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.000]
Same thing. Was it a big story?

[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:54.280]
No.

[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:55.320]
Should it have been?

[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:55.460]
No.

[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.960]
It was of any significance to anybody out there, except people are related?

[01:24:59.040 --> 01:24:59.160]
No.

[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.540]
But whatever the media says, if they tell you to jump through hoops, how high do I have to jump?

[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:06.680]
Yeah, hoops.

[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.200]
Exactly. Hoops, professional hoops.

[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.100]
Right. See how it all ties in together?

[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.800]
No, seriously, as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of...

[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.840]
You love Shakira's tons and he has a plenty of these you close.

[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:25.120]
I'm a little bit dark now, that's an endless story.

[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.460]
There's a little bit dark now.

[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.140]
But now you love her new album.

[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.220]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:34.840]
I think he's far from you.

[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.340]
Oh, I'm falling.

[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.580]
She already made music history by recording her first English language album.

[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:44.620]
And now she's taking her art form to the next level.

[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.400]
I'm re-recording songs that were already into the English.

[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.660]
Only this time they're in English again.

[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:53.460]
I'm so happy that we met.

[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.920]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.760]
No, no.

[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:02.880]
It can't have that more of my deep.

[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.800]
Shakira sings other people's songs.

[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.520]
I'm so thankful for my mind.

[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.720]
They have a lot of love.

[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:13.640]
If you really, really like Shakira's CD, laundry service,

[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.880]
then you'll really, really, really like her new CD.

[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.280]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.700]
No, it's an espagnol and it's those momentals.

[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:24.020]
I will say this. I do love Shakira.

[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.560]
Yeah, what's not to like?

[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:27.860]
Right, she's great.

[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.840]
Love him 49. Love him before noon.

[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.360]
We're just killing some time.

[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.000]
I realize now more than ever before.

[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.460]
I wasn't positive.

[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.140]
Many times we've been like a lead into the Marlin game

[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.980]
or some other sports event or press conference.

[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:42.960]
But we're just like the filler material.

[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.060]
The important sports craft comes on.

[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.000]
That's what really counts.

[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.200]
Because the sports is rock solid.

[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.180]
We're just like hanging on by a thread.

[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.220]
Wait till the week from today when that book comes out.

[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.260]
The whole book will be out on next Thursday.

[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.380]
Can't wait.

[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.360]
Oh, no, that's right.

[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.980]
It comes out on Wednesday, I believe, isn't it?

[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:01.600]
When? You're on.

[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.220]
Wednesday, yes.

[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:04.620]
So next Thursday, since we have another show,

[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.600]
another two and a half hour show before the Marlin game,

[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:08.660]
that'll probably kill all of that.

[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:09.380]
Oh, no.

[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:12.520]
That time a good part of it between 10 and 1230.

[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.560]
So don't overdo it on Wednesday.

[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:17.780]
567.0560.

[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.680]
You're probably going to want to take a lot of these great calls.

[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:22.640]
pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.140]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.620]
This is a big call.

[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:28.000]
The drag line is what we're going to call now.

[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.620]
Before we had the loser line,

[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:31.780]
now we got the drags line.

[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:33.260]
That's all we got left.

[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:34.920]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.300]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.000]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:39.660]
There you go.

[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.200]
That's the middle of our call right there.

[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:41.680]
That's it.

[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:43.880]
567.0560.

[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.940]
There isn't one person yet who's called it.

[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:47.140]
Even with this poll, we're taking it.

[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:50.960]
They tell us why they had no interest before in the heat in the NBA

[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.300]
and professional basketball ever in their lives.

[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:55.680]
And all of a sudden, they're whipped up into a frenzy and they're voting

[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.580]
as they are in this poll, not one.

[01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:58.560]
Not a one.

[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.620]
Has the cohones because they don't want to admit that they're just

[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.320]
a bunch of bandwagon jumping phones.

[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.060]
That would be too embarrassing, right?

[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.620]
Somebody right recognize the voice.

[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.460]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.800]
Yeah, George Scott, thank you.

[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:13.180]
Okay, thank you.

[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.160]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:16.400]
I was a better U and Michael Moore.

[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:17.860]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:21.860]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:22.380]

[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.160]
Jacobi.

[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.280]
567.0560.

[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:27.800]
Pound 560 on it.

[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.540]
We haven't had one of these in a long time, you know what?

[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.600]
Yeah, not long enough.

[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:35.240]
Now, because people, and that business I was rambling, I told up this morning,

[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.020]
that business about extending the contract, knowing all this other crap.

[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:42.480]
I was just having a brain fart, a senior moment.

[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.120]
Yeah, forget about that weakness.

[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:49.640]
But if anybody ever asked me, well, what are you going to miss most about doing a show of Miami for all of these years?

[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:50.540]
Factor, man.

[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.300]
Certainly the colors would have to be right.

[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.340]
Oh, yeah.

[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:54.660]
Oh, yeah, the great phone call.

[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.340]
Tony, you missed that.

[01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:57.760]
Oh, you got food from Tony's today?

[01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:58.280]
I don't know if you had.

[01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:58.720]
Thank you, Brad.

[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.420]
Thank you, Brad, over there at Tony's.

[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:00.820]
You're great.

[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.640]
They're at the Northwest Second Avenue in Summer.

[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:05.440]
193.

[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:07.260]
193rd Street.

[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:08.260]
And they are just fine.

[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.020]
Peaches and subs and all kinds of good stuff.

[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:12.020]
They've been very nice to us.

[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.240]
They've been great to us over the years.

[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.280]
And thank you for this for that.

[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:17.760]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:19.300]
Hello?

[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:20.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:21.560]
Do you like to be on the radio?

[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.620]
You'd like to be on the radio?

[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:25.980]
Well, listen, if you got a good one, hop right on it, okay?

[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:27.500]
He wants to be on the radio.

[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:33.920]
You got a little teeny tiny feet, and they're one of them big old console GE radios, like

[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.900]
I used to have as a little kid.

[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:38.500]
Just hop right on it, but just hit it over, and probably going to break their antiques.

[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.800]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:46.500]
We'll do a searching for the perfect call.

[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.180]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.720]
Yes, Mr. Rogers.

[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.000]
Yes, Mr. Collar?

[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.880]
Yes, good to have you back.

[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.800]
El Boros has been born us crazy.

[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:55.560]
Yeah?

[01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:58.240]
So, just want to let you know that.

[01:29:58.420 --> 01:29:59.420]
You want to let me know that?

[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.620]
Okay, well, I don't really give a crap.

[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.240]
How do you like that?

[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:03.880]
If he boards you crazy, then don't listen when he's on.

[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.120]
Okay, if I bore you crazy, then don't listen what I'm on.

[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.180]
You got no material.

[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:07.860]
You're an idiot.

[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:08.560]
I have no rights.

[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:09.780]
Just thought I'd let you know that.

[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:10.580]
Kiss your ass.

[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.940]
That's a little raspberry for you.

[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:13.840]
Okay, little teeny's on.

[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.180]
What kind of was?

[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:14.900]
Yeah.

[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:15.680]
Well, did a sneaker?

[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:16.320]
No.

[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:17.880]
You can't say that.

[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:18.920]
Now, I'll start with a sneaker.

[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:21.840]
Again, that woman's going to call back about $75 sneakers, okay?

[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.440]
Good thing they aren't giving them all Nike's probably

[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.380]
custom like Too Fitty.

[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:27.960]
WDQA and hello.

[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:29.400]
Neil.

[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:30.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:32.460]
Neil, listen there.

[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:40.620]
I was wondering if you'd seen the show on the History Channel about secrets, secret societies.

[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:41.640]
No.

[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.920]
They had a show on there over the weekend.

[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:51.760]
I've seen it before, but it has to do with our president there, seeing in a secret

[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.580]
society and it's seen in Europe.

[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.000]
Yeah, I mean, it's old news.

[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:55.760]
Old news, apparently.

[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.060]
Yeah, we know all about it.

[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, maybe if you had a secret handshake, okay?

[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:04.060]
I know that Duff likes to give people a secret handshake.

[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:06.220]
You are not alone, guys.

[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.000]
A little finger on the palm of the hand.

[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:09.700]
WDQA and hello.

[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:10.960]
Hey, Neil.

[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:11.760]
Yes, sir.

[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:12.960]
This is Jay.

[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.300]
Well, I still don't get my name.

[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.620]
But yeah, when I was saying about Ben Wagon.

[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.040]
Yeah.

[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:18.820]
Yeah.

[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.200]
I'm not a bad little friend of mine.

[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:26.000]
But my wife now, she wants to watch the NBA just because, you know, she has on down here,

[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:26.340]
Miami.

[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:31.140]
That's all the reason we don't want to watch basketball now.

[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:35.740]
You mean there actually are going to be people going to the arena who are going to not just show up at the game,

[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:41.140]
but they're actually going to watch the game as opposed to going upstairs and is cruising and smoking and drinking and not paying the attention

[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:41.860]
what's going on.

[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:43.660]
That's going to be a better, better accomplishment.

[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:48.220]
Yeah, well, I feel because for example, Michael Jordan, people pay tickets to, you know, to see Michael Jordan.

[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:50.620]
And they want an experience to watch.

[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.460]
They spend more.

[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:52.160]
They spend more.

[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.760]
So you're putting the shack in the same league with Michael Jordan?

[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.000]
I wouldn't say that.

[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:58.480]
Jordan took the league to the next level.

[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.800]
But yeah, you know, the shack is making a big impact.

[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.220]
He's making a very big impact.

[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:02.900]
I got you.

[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:03.500]
I didn't say it.

[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.360]
It breaks my heart.

[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.880]
It makes me want to cry all day.

[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:07.920]
Good luck, you pal.

[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:08.580]
All right.

[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:08.940]
Take care.

[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:10.840]
Say I had to make a iris and okay, a lot of them a few bucks.

[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:11.840]
Times are tough.

[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:18.040]
Hopefully you have a good time in Europe and in Israel as he's probably over there, siphoning off somebody that money that daddy left behind.

[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:18.740]
$9.9 billion.

[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:21.020]
$5.67.0560.

[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:21.620]
Pon-5.

[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.460]
See, I want to give you a parallel.

[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.600]
It called me crazy.

[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:25.380]
You're crazy.

[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.300]
I know that because I don't care about f**k.

[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.140]
But I will say this.

[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.900]
If I don't like, as you know, I don't like fish.

[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.280]
I like some seafood.

[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.440]
Well, I don't want to say it.

[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.180]
Josh can say it.

[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:35.700]
See you.

[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:36.200]
Yeah.

[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.360]
And like lobster stuff like that.

[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.600]
But I don't like fish.

[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:43.660]
So if there's an all fish restaurant.

[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:44.940]
See whatever I'm going with this?

[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:45.520]
Where you going?

[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:46.760]
To another restaurant.

[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:47.900]
I don't care about the NBA.

[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.380]
I don't care about Pro Basketball.

[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.680]
It would make any difference.

[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:51.280]
What?

[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.100]
Or what flavor?

[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.040]
Or how good?

[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.500]
If you had an all fish restaurant, it's an oh, you're really going to love it.

[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.560]
I still wouldn't go there because I don't like fish.

[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:00.200]
Following?

[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:04.280]
As if, if like, I said, oh, I'm going to go to the heat game now because Shaxe here.

[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.500]
But I'm just trying not to see you, but I'm just saying you're taking it personally.

[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:09.420]
But just in general, I don't get it.

[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:10.500]
No, I don't know.

[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:15.500]
And even as little attention as I pay, I mean, you don't have to be a rocket star.

[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:19.380]
I'm a scientist or an NBA fan to realize that putting Shaqil O'Neal in the same category

[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:22.280]
with Michael Jordan, you have to be like some kind of a bozo.

[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.160]
You have to be making like a real stretch.

[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.980]
Even Josh Cordis would agree with that.

[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:26.520]
Damn right?

[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.520]
I don't see the difference.

[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:28.420]
Both bald headed.

[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:29.460]
That's all right.

[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:30.020]
Yeah, good point.

[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.640]
Don't be picking on.

[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.220]
Or you're going to be out, man.

[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.820]
Probably going to call the Saturday afternoon from Greg.

[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:38.520]
Okay, congratulations.

[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.460]
I know it'll actually be next week when the book comes back.

[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:40.940]
Congratulations.

[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:41.640]
I had a good ratings.

[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.020]
And by the way, I've decided to terminate the anti-fuck.

[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:45.340]
Yeah.

[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:46.880]
You better watch yourself.

[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:47.760]
Still.

[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.260]
I got him here.

Hey, basketball fans.

[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.220]
What could be better than watching your favorite players slam dunk?

[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:17.720]
F***!

[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:19.800]
How about watching them get dunk in the slammer?

[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.420]
You can, with the all new NBA criminal league.

[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.100]
Yes, all your favorite players on the court are now in court.

[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.320]
This will be brilliant.

[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:29.420]
Terror live strong.

[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:30.100]
Damon Stoutemire.

[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:31.580]
Climb Robinson.

[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:32.540]
Chris Weber.

[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:33.880]
Jerry Stackhaus.

[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:36.420]
And of course, Al and Iverson.

[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:37.060]
Iverson too.

[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.160]
Eddie Gorge!

[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.280]
Come on, Bateson!

[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:44.440]
When all the NBA super stars are in lockdown, the action is locked up.

[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.440]
The NBA criminal league.

[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.300]
Ah, I'm telling you, this was talent.

[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:52.120]
It's gonna be able to just defeat the NBA team to the most violent prisoner.

[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.600]
Oh, that's good.

[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.100]
They've gone from committing fouls to committing felonies.

[01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:02.260]
And you can be a material witness to all the drama with the NBA criminal league.

[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:05.420]
See, they're very nice, and that's what I call a fair ball.

[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.220]
The NBA criminal league.

[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.820]
Love these youngsters!

[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:14.440]
From until it's 560 WQA, and we are really intensive at arrest of the...

[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.540]
...for the foreseeable future, I would say, right?

[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.620]
From now on, it'll be in the time until it retires.

[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.420]
Oh, and even then, beyond, over and above.

[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.320]
562 votes on the pool.

[01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:25.120]
How are you about the Shack Trade?

[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.500]
I couldn't give a shaman less 275, 49%.

[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:30.080]
Very excited on Pumped.

[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:33.340]
I'm fired up and whipped up to a friend of 127, 22 and a half%.

[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.040]
Someone, 116.

[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.120]
And who the FB Shack, 44, 7.28%.

[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.920]
So you got 43.1%.

[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.100]
They... I just wondering one thing.

[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:44.840]
Why?

[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.320]
That's all I'm asking.

[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:48.120]
What do you mean?

[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:52.120]
I mean, if it's good for South Florida, if it's good for something...

[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.940]
Even if it's good for nothing, well, good.

[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.120]
And here's one that says, who cares about this freaking 911 commission?

[01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:58.780]
We got...

[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:00.200]
Yeah, who cares about this stuff?

[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.960]
But now we've been warned.

[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.200]
We're gonna see. There you go.

[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.620]
We got a warning.

[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.560]
And George has got his warning that if you don't care more about...

[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.200]
He's out.

[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:11.920]
He's out.

[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:14.300]
It's an armadotary. It's probably gonna be everybody's contract.

[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:17.880]
And you can just pretend to care.

[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.500]
You have to like really care. It's like religion.

[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.340]
You can't just pretend to believe in God.

[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:24.160]
You got to believe, man. You got to really believe in the Lord.

[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.680]
I'll wear a Shack bubble hat doll around my neck.

[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:27.460]
Excellent.

[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:31.480]
And then you can wear a more flat top piece too, while you're at it.

[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:33.800]
Somebody QAAM, hello?

[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:35.380]
Hello?

[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:36.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:36.960]
Yeah.

[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:40.300]
I think you ought to have a shack alert.

[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.220]
Yeah.

[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.740]
Somebody sees him out in the highway or something or something.

[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:44.480]
He's shacksighting.

[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:45.440]
Shacksighting.

[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.660]
He's like you used to have the pig alert.

[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:47.320]
Right.

[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.200]
I think that would be great.

[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.740]
Excellent. We'll start that right away.

[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:53.720]
As a matter of fact, I heard some of that banter that was going on.

[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:58.340]
You kept putting on your own Tuesday from Channel 6 and 7 and 4 and 89 and 69.

[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.380]
And the one guy, oh, I'm so excited to be here to see him.

[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:04.280]
Why?

[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:08.020]
I don't get it. I don't understand that.

[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:08.740]
He's...

[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:10.900]
Seriously? Why?

[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:15.200]
Why would you drive anywhere to see a guy who plays a sport or who's...

[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:17.180]
I just don't get it.

[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:17.940]
I'm sorry.

[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:18.980]
It's Shack.

[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:21.060]
Oh, I forgot about that.

[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.660]
Man, you wonder why the world is in the shape that it's in right now.

[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.760]
Right there. Did just that episode on Tuesday, the hysteria, even Muxa, that he would just

[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:33.680]
embarrassed and humiliated by it.

[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:35.560]
We should like to feel relaxed once again.

[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:37.420]
Oh, God. What a thought.

[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.900]
And we got to get these brakes in, man.

[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.980]
If it sounds like it's all spots radio in this half-hour, it is.

[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:50.160]
Because we got the Marlin pregame at 12.30, baby, to which we say we love the Marlins.

[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.940]
And let me ask you, the Marlins fault potato hiss, because they've been going through some rocky road lately.

[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:57.160]
Don't say rocky road. I want to stay on my thing now, please.

[01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:59.860]
I've been doing extremely well, not in a half-pounds.

[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:01.500]
Very good.

[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:03.980]
In fact, next week by Tuesday, I'll be under 190.

[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.900]
I'll be like 187-188-87 for the first time in years.

[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:12.660]
Yeah. I'm back in a way from that 200 thing and the doing very nicely, thank you.

[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.840]
Five minutes past noon at 5.60, all the spots all the time.

[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:19.900]
It's a matter of fact.

[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:21.980]
Another break already?

[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:23.280]
Sure.

[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.780]
Well, they don't care about this show, and they certainly don't care about this show.

[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.660]
Even the sports show didn't care that much about it.

[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:33.140]
Or they wouldn't be putting like 45 minutes of spots on an hour, which they always have done.

[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:36.460]
We're just a bunch of horrors, and only at least on this stage when we admit it.

[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:38.440]

Did he talk it or did he talk it?

[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:52.560]
Charles Oakley of the NBA's Toronto Repters has made a shocking revelation.

[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:57.460]
The former New York Nick claims that 60% of the NBA is on dope.

[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:08.200]
Wackyweed, hot doobies, brass, we ask some high profile NBA players if it was true at Atlanta Hawk Center to Kimbe Mutumble.

[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:15.920]
I'd like to answer you and that question, but my tongue has become unhoot on me and we both have no...

[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.780]
Los Angeles Laker Guard, Colby Bryant.

[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:26.740]
Dude, dude, dude, dude, Philadelphia 76er Guard, Alan Iverson.

[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:32.440]
That's Wack, Wickedy Wack, Wickedy Wickedy Wack, you'll be an outstanding on my Roach clip.

[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:37.400]
And the league's elder statesman, John Stockton from the Utah Jazz.

[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:46.820]
That is 100% false. Sometimes there's a little boogie dantling as the younger players favor the hot hip music, but narcotics...

[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.380]
...at holy not.

[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.560]
The NBA, nothing but X.

[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:54.780]
Colby, 11 at 560 WQ, just 19 minutes away.

[01:41:55.540 --> 01:42:00.540]
Oh, from a pregame show for the Marlon Fila game. Game time 105, in Philadelphia.

[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.340]
560, 7.0560, Tom 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Lens.

[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:08.600]
As we ask the musical questions today...

[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:09.040]
Why?

[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:10.960]
...WCAM, hello.

[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:12.580]
Yeah, how you doing?

[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:13.300]
Okay.

[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:20.340]
Well, first of all, I want to say that the spectacle on local news the other day, which acts best conference was funny.

[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.680]
And it was actually kind of a joke, I couldn't believe it.

[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.340]
But then the other thing I wanted to bring up to you was where I was.

[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.160]
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:29.820]
Yeah, go ahead.

[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:30.740]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:36.440]
And the other thing I wanted to bring up was sort of an observation, I find a humorist I wanted to see what you thought.

[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:41.680]
But, you know, any find one of those makers has to do a prayer that used the word just about 30 times.

[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:46.080]
Oh, I just like to ask the Lord to just be blessed in us and just...

[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:49.080]
I like to see them do one, you know, prayer without using the word just.

[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:49.600]
What do you think?

[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:53.380]
What did he say?

[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:54.720]
Just...

[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:56.720]
Oh, that's what I thought he said.

[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:00.220]
560, 7.0560, Tom 560.

[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:01.160]
I thought he said...

[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:01.160]

[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.940]
...on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Lens.

[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.400]
WDQA Am Hello.

[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:09.120]
Yeah, I would like to know Shaq's Telami size.

[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:11.300]
Hebrew National.

[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:14.160]
WDQA Am Hello.

[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.720]
Hey, Neil.

[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.740]
Remember when Gordy House found it, the wireless?

[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:18.840]
Yeah.

[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.620]
That was pretty cool too, huh?

[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:22.160]
Yeah.

[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:25.460]
And then Harry Lee's in her guide and I never got over it.

[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.000]
That was great.

[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:33.520]
See, I got... you have a little faith.

[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:38.080]
Nobody just keeps plugging away in sooner or later after the first 40, 50,000.

[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:39.400]
Maybe not even 40 or 50.

[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.460]
About 30,000, man.

[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.560]
First 30,000, man.

[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:43.700]
And then you get one that's really just sticks with you.

[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.320]
Six-year ribs.

[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.000]
Kind of like...

[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.620]
WDQA Am Hello.

[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:49.200]
QA Am?

[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:50.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:52.540]
Did you find a source of services program director?

[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:54.220]
About what?

[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:00.200]
I wanted to put in a claim to try to get Jim Rome over there.

[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.380]
No chance.

[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:03.640]
No chance.

[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.280]
We wouldn't put that crap on if he paid us $1,000 a second.

[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:09.640]
Yeah, get lost.

[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:10.320]
Schmuck.

[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.880]
Put a claim in to get Jim Rome over there.

[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:14.560]
Jim Rome is on 1400, idiot.

[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:18.080]
General Men, the Tony Bruno, we're going to have to tell you,

[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:21.200]
are you 15 sports nerds out there that can't get enough of the same...

[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.220]
Seriously, the whole sports nerd thing to me is I can't say it enough.

[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:25.940]
Nothing compares.

[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:30.040]
There is nothing I've ever experienced in my lifetime of any sort.

[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.500]
Whether it's the religious nuts or man.

[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:32.480]
This isn't religion.

[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:33.060]
Right.

[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.480]
This isn't the same category.

[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.400]
It's a religion only...

[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.620]
What's the payoff?

[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:38.200]
Right.

[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:40.280]
And of course, it's how far the payoff is.

[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:43.800]
Oh, I feel better about myself because we won.

[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:44.760]
We did this way.

[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:45.840]
Yeah, we, my ass.

[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:46.320]
Okay.

[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:46.880]
We.

[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:48.660]
Good.

[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.560]
God Almighty.

[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:50.040]
We.

[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.960]
The speaking French now again, like that guy from Lutz.

[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:54.080]
We, we.

[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:56.200]
We, we, we, we.

[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:56.920]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:57.740]
You tell him, Joe.

[01:44:57.740 --> 01:44:58.680]
And let me say it again.

[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:01.180]
Even Joe Rose, the ex-Jach's niffer himself.

[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:04.840]
He used to take a lot of showers with the mad dog and then he even play on the same team.

[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.960]
Even he believes it's ludicrous.

[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:08.680]
It's embarrassing.

[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:09.880]
It's pathetic.

[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:10.980]
It's laughable.

[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:16.900]
The psychosis and the aberrant behavior in South Florida over some dumb jock sign in a contract

[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:18.540]
for millions and millions of dollars.

[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:21.280]
Like this is going to change all of the other things that are going on.

[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.560]
I guess that, you know, it's a good diversion.

[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.380]
It makes people forget about where they really are.

[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:25.380]
The stuff that's going on.

[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.000]
I have no line.

[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:26.240]
Right.

[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:28.480]
1214.

[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:29.740]
Another break already?

[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.160]
You bet because we just want the money, baby.

[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:32.900]
We don't care about it.

[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:33.860]
And you can take GM role.

[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.260]
In fact, you can take him to a role.

[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.220]
And they probably turn him down.

[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.540]
Take one look at him.

[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:39.880]
I actually have a picky a man.

[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:41.700]
Get his ass out of there.

[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.920]
Sound like a 10-year-old and a grade school kid on the ear.

[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.360]
Hey, the deals are heating up right now.

[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.300]
The 2000 from model year is winding down.

[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:50.980]
The entire of that old gas goes where you're driving.

[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:53.860]
You want a new car or truck that will give you dependability and reliability.

[01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:57.120]
Then you need to get on down to Armstrong Toyota Homestead today.

[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:02.540]
On US 120 minutes south of the 36, they're worth to drive to save thousands on new Toyota's.

[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:08.080]
Right now, the Armstrong Toyota Homestead is throwing out all remaining old force and passing grade savings on the U.

[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:13.340]
Least in 04 Camry, at least today and 48 monthlies, just 279 a month with no money down.

[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:14.780]
Looking for a great truck.

[01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:15.820]
How about the Toyota?

[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:19.740]
The Comet 4x4 can be yours and you get a thousand dollars cash back from Toyota.

[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:20.560]
What's not to like?

[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.300]
Looking for the hottest new cars around.

[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:25.440]
Be sure and take a look at the Armstrong Toyota Homestead.

[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:26.380]
They're looking on an operated.

[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:27.400]
They treat you like family.

[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:30.060]
They'll make you a deal that you just can't turn down.

[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.760]
The service department's even open late to late.

[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.200]
We've nets to make sure all your service work is done.

[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.260]
Armstrong Toyota Homestead was the first to even drop your free tires and batteries for life.

[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.020]
And now, they're the first to offer your free replacement parts for life that is absolutely correct.

[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:45.320]
Tires, batteries and free parts for life.

[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:46.720]
Nobody else will be doing that.

[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.340]
You won't get a better deal on your Toyota anywhere in town.

[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:51.080]
So it's worth a drive on down there.

[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:55.640]
Just 20 minutes out to be at 36th at the corner of US1 and 2903rd Street in Homestead.

[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.400]
No bait and switch.

[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.980]
No fully deals just on Vita below every day.

[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:01.580]
Prices 365 days a year.

[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.960]
Drive a little in Sevaton on that new Toyota only at Toyota of Homestead.

[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:11.880]
I can love this is 420565 way.

[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:15.580]
Follow me, Tom Littleboy.

[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.280]
No matter how unfair it may seem.

[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.720]
People judge you by the words you use.

[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:23.240]
Like this one.

[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.400]
Avogar red.

[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:26.120]
What word did you say?

[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.300]
Avogar on.

[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:31.000]
If you express your thoughts like a dysfunctional retard.

[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:38.280]
The only way you'll make it in life is if you're born into enormous will then have a father with friends in high places.

[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:43.240]
Avogar on less you learn hooked on brain cells.

[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:48.340]
It's an easy to use guide on great big words like situation.

[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000]
Learn fancy, fancy, latest words where you want.

[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:54.620]
When you want that's poor English too.

[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.280]
But no matter to order your hooked on brain cells.

[01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:59.560]
Call 1-800.

[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:00.900]
Avogar red.

[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:03.740]
It's 1220 at 560 minutes.

[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:06.320]
The countdown just coming us away from the Marlon pregame show.

[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:07.200]
All right.

[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:10.780]
Of course it often is going to really stink this year.

[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:11.780]
It's going to be like 7-9.

[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:13.460]
Maybe 8-8 would be a little bit of luck.

[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.120]
They have some really blind officials during one of the games looking the other way.

[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:18.500]
But what does that matter anymore?

[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:19.360]
That's right.

[01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:20.720]
It pales in with the panthers.

[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.040]
We may have a lockout this season.

[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.080]
And we can wait for that a great announcer.

[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:26.800]
Broadcast the panther games on radio on QAM.

[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:27.680]
Hockey. What's that?

[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:28.400]
Right.

[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.980]
And of course as far as the Marlon's are concerned.

[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:34.760]
Well they've been playing under 500 since those first nine games since that 8-1 start.

[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.980]
They've been like floundering especially lately.

[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:37.900]
What are they?

[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:38.820]
Third or fourth now?

[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:39.280]
Third place?

[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:40.300]
At a time of third.

[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.300]
Time for third.

[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:42.220]
Three games back then.

[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:43.020]
Oh no.

[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.720]
So they're only three games out.

[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:47.320]
But you know under 500 I believe or they back to 500.

[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:47.900]
500.

[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:48.760]
500.

[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:49.680]
Even Stephen.

[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:51.220]
So they're having a fine year.

[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.620]
Not a great year but they're fine year by all measures.

[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:57.200]
But you know it's the mediocre division like I say and you keep arguing but it is.

[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:00.600]
But what would we care about that?

[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.080]
You know when we got.

[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:02.780]
Right.

[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:04.900]
Right?

[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:06.360]
Right.

[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:08.300]
I mean you talk about phony.

[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.460]
Man oh man they're running around.

[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:14.760]
This is the only place in the world where people after the Marlon's won a World Series last season.

[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:22.920]
The people are going out and buying Marlon paraphernalia and then the following day after the parade going back to the stories that try to return it for a refund.

[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:26.640]
I think what we ought to do is I got a great idea.

[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:28.240]
Rent a uniform.

[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:29.340]
But yeah.

[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:29.940]
There you go.

[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:32.800]
For all the bandwagon jippers rent a calf.

[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:33.640]
Rent a jersey.

[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.920]
Rent a sports schmata something.

[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:36.280]
Right.

[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:41.080]
Because we know that once the team goes into crapper that you're not going to want any part of that.

[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.460]
Who wants that?

[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:52.120]
What does and what does that have to do with five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:53.120]
Goviti QA and hello.

[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:54.160]
Yeah.

[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:54.880]
How do you talk to me?

[01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:59.660]
What do you think about for the two tourism for the Miami?

[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:00.320]
Yeah.

[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:01.480]
You hold shack and crack.

[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:02.980]
I like it.

[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:04.260]
The crack shack sounds good.

[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:05.700]
We got the crab shack.

[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:07.160]
How about the crack shack?

[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:07.400]
Yeah.

[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:08.160]
All right.

[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.600]
I think I got a hell of a deal.

[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.340]
I'll go and partners with the pound 50 50.

[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:13.600]
Make a fortune.

[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.080]
We can retire by the end of next week.

[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:16.560]
The crack the crack.

[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:16.960]
Yeah.

[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.280]
I think there's a few of those already in town though.

[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:20.140]
Oh, are they really?

[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:21.360]
Yeah.

[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.700]
Like that one kitty corner of the station.

[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:23.720]
They were like an eyes during road.

[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:25.920]
Five six seven oh five sixty.

[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:28.480]
Right by the barbershop there.

[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:30.380]
Five sixty on the AT&T.

[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.880]
Thanks to where they sell the meat pies.

[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:34.540]
They cut a real fine and Verizon wireless line.

[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:36.720]
WVQA and hello.

[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:37.660]
Hello.

[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:38.820]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.720]
Is this the meal show?

[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:42.300]
This is the meal show, yes.

[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:42.820]
Okay.

[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:44.880]
I was, I forgot the pound.

[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:47.080]
It's like sixty so I was bringing you.

[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:47.520]
I'm sorry.

[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:49.840]
Can I ask a question?

[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:50.420]
Sure.

[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.800]
About this she had or the, the nearest.

[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.100]
What is the reason why is it that they hate us so much in the first place?

[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:03.840]
Does it have anything to do with the sanctity of the land that these railies are occupying?

[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:05.300]
Oh, it has to do with the head gear.

[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:06.780]
We don't wear the right, the head gear.

[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.160]
No, not the head.

[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:08.880]
Yeah.

[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:09.860]
What started it?

[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:11.000]
What started what?

[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:16.140]
Well, 5,000 years ago somebody decided to tell them God told them to kill each other and they've been trying ever since.

[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:19.580]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty.

[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:21.360]
It's that good old time religion sweet heart.

[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:22.860]
That's what does it every time?

[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:24.880]
And that give it that good old time religion.

[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:28.240]
Let's go kill people don't believe the same crap that we believe in.

[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:30.600]
And I keep it counting that for almost 30 years.

[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:35.320]
And they don't want to believe that most of the people out there because they're brainwashed just like this.

[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:36.500]
Same thing.

[01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:37.100]
It's a religion.

[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.320]
It is a freaking religion.

[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:44.040]
Oh, and this is, you know, you just don't understand maybe because you're not here.

[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.980]
Like I said, this is one more reason I'm glad that I'm there as little as possible.

[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:52.560]
Because it is just so mind boggling to me.

[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:58.640]
I can't think of anything ever in all the long amazing mysterious years that I've been in South Florida.

[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:01.820]
I can't think of anything that even comes close even alien.

[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:02.540]
No.

[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:08.460]
Paired and went significance even though it lasted for a long time because people were bored and they had something to get angry about.

[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.320]
And you want to know they want to get angry don't you because

[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.680]
Pete is our main thing in South Korea.

[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:21.880]
