[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.880]
I'm dialing on the hands

[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.160]
Never watch his hair or seem to have a care, Kobe

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.180]
His name was Kirk, now he's pushing up dirt, Kobe

[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.060]
White thing drew from his chin, doing heroin, Kobe

[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.640]
I have no right

[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.200]
Neil Vano was hot, and now his curt they ain't got Kobe

[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.180]
He got high, said goodbye, then he died, Kobe

[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.560]
Made a million and I'll never took a shower, Kobe

[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.560]
He's a number one hit in heaven's Big Moshpit, Kobe

[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.500]
He'll meet Elvis the King and say grunge with my thing, Kobe

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.540]
That's a looting, so if you're filled with doubt, don't take Kurt's way out, Kobe

[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.580]
He got high, said goodbye, then he died, Kobe

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.080]
Well, we'll see, we're gonna have a whole Kirk Kobe story on there, aren't we? For at least the 10th, 15 seconds?

[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.840]
Lovely, because Kurt Cobain was murdered maybe, or maybe not, how much Yomorson he might have done it, you know

[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.180]
Yomorson might have actually come, he might still have been alive like they say, and maybe he was afraid the Kurt Cobain was gonna take his place in rock and roll history

[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.040]
And maybe to sneak up the automation, it was range out, you think?

[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.620]
Maybe, speaking of people getting their planes, planes blown out, huh?

[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.260]
21 coalition troops dead in the last three days, the beginning of the show we bring in the bad news every day, tried to get out of the way

[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.340]
And of course the mainstream media that what they're actually talking about on CNN right now, which is about time, it's worth it though

[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.000]
U.S. troops battled Iraqi guerrillas today on the edges of Fallujah, which hundreds of Marines and Iraqi troops have surrounded in a major operation

[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.840]
To pacify one of Iraq's most violent cities, the military reports now five Marines killed in that area

[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.680]
The the Americans were killed by hostile fire Monday bringing to five the number Marines killed that day, so that's 10 and you can't even keep count anymore

[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.200]
In northern Baghdad's Kazamiya district tree west soldiers were killed on members of the first armored division, so the bottom line is 21 more in the last three days

[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.360]
And the death just continues, but like you said, El President Tejels is it's worth it

[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.060]
Yeah, in June 30th, don't forget June, that's gonna be the day we're gonna hand over the keys of the kingdom and they're gonna say, I'll ride, we got everything under control, aren't they?

[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.420]
No, chaos

[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:41.180]
On a much brighter note behind the beaten curtain today for your over the age of 100, yeah, and if you got 55 pieces of ID and if all your relatives will sign way their lives to you, you might be able to take a peek

[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:52.400]
And you keep your eye on John Ascroft on his photo one here because his eyes continue moving those BDI's ahead, so be sure you have your hands above the counter when you click on our thing

[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.540]
We got Natasha Hensbridge today very nice Natasha was born in Springdale, Newfoundland Canada A in 1974, which makes her

[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.740]
And raised in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada at the age of 14 she left home to begin her modeling career in the highly competitive Paris fashion world

[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.600]
She landed her first cover on French Cosmopolitan when she was only 15 and since grace the covers of many international fashion magazines

[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:26.400]
She also appeared in commercials for products as such as Lady Stetson oil of Olae, can we say that oil of O'B**k and old spice, which is a beast in our talking model, it's spice just before the show

[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:35.460]
That's the new fragrance that the crow is wearing now. Yeah no more French perfume. No more that the cashmere bouquet crap, he must be moving up in the world, the crow's got the really heavy duty stuff now

[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.260]
How about you and the meeb trobe the meeb the gop

[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:52.720]
I'll pass. Anyway now she lives in LA Natasha and she divides time between the two coast and continues to be in demand as a model while pursuing a blossoming career as an actress and if you check the picture out she appears to be blossoming nicely

[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.220]
Yes Natasha won an award for best kiss in a movie and that's something when I was the MTV 96 movie awards best kiss in a movie

[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:08.080]
Species was the movie with species co-star Anthony Guadera you know who that is no I don't either but you'll know who Natasha is when you take a peek at our beaded curtain today

[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.820]
And again you must have several pieces of ID now we got a big opening day today for the marlins let's hear for those marlins which we love the big time on this show right now

[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.820]
Which we are getting paid by the pound today because we got Zach sitting where Josh Corn is usually since because Josh is out there holding Dave and boring's hand at the ballpark

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.180]
Good morning Josh Corn is yesterday said Dave and boring is living up to his name big time now what he said something like that

[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.640]
I don't want to create a problem for him out there but he thinks of Ann boring is just terminal and he's right

[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.400]
Well I mean we can't look we can't like every bit I tell you who we like right

[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.320]
We like blue the lot

[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.640]
Right yeah we love boobie love who's good he's a little bit a little rock and rolly hey it's a high outside for ball onion

[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.880]
A little rock and rolly but he's great and I don't know why he didn't take the job of the mess wouldn't you take the job of the mess if he really was offered that job

[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.780]
I'm not sure if it was as good as this one what do you mean by that because I think there's they have a three man booth instead of a two man booth so he'd be getting a whole family

[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:13.520]
Oh come on you wouldn't rather with his talent in his future you wouldn't rather be doing in New York at a big apple as opposed to a horse ball horse and buggy place like South Florida

[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.180]
Which they got 60,000 screaming phony's going to be there today and tomorrow there'll probably be seven or eight thousand

[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.480]
I got one word for you one money yeah so there's more money on the deal he's got here what's your saying

[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.540]
Well I mean short term money is not the long term fix oh sorry Zach hey anyway here's here's a red

[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.560]
By the way welcome Zach to our show he's sitting on that side today and tomorrow he's going to be sitting with a beast sitting right now

[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.320]
So make a nice big indentation there for him he'll feel comfortable he'll fit right in trying to break in the seats yeah break it break in the seat

[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.760]
Anyway here's the pull result about the marlins that we took yesterday is pretty looking pretty good for David Samson as a matter of fact

[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:57.440]
See let's look at the glass being very full like the ballpark today and then after we can all say we did it yeah over and over again we can say we did it

[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:05.680]
1850 votes and that was our second pull yesterday so we can definitely say we did it how much do you care about the marlins it's opening day

[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:16.400]
All right all right not at all zero not a 570 30.30.8% that was my vote I'm being honest I'm not going to be a phony like so many of you people I'm not a baseball fan

[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.240]
And if I were a baseball fan I'd start probably still be a Marlin fan I like the marlins okay

[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.620]
I'm just set up with baseball makes me nauseous

[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:31.580]
You're on a mark and it's boring which you admitted yesterday I did not plus your red sucks fan oh yeah and also guess what starts tomorrow night

[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:39.600]
In the middle of the beast tomorrow is the first to play off series NHL stand the cup playoffs and improvements in Montreal be going at it tomorrow night in Boston

[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.400]
There you go

[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.320]
At least they'll have a full crowd for that game talk about attendance man

[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.560]
They they just don't draw flies in that fleet center. I think they should have stayed in the garden don't you?

[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.320]
Yeah with the obstructed views well

[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.560]
I had listened but at least they used to pack it they were packing it in there which I think since they made it legal

[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.220]
They had to move to the fleet center and you can't say fleet enemy center no more either because then you go to jail

[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.540]
Anyway

[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.200]
570 to almost 31% so they don't care at all about the marlins which I think is just disgraceful even though it's true

[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.880]
I'm a fan I go to a few games 487 a

[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.920]
Little bit they care a little bit 440 in other words enough to watch a couple of pitches here a couple there the channel surfing

[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.640]
Oh there I'll watch for half an inning

[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.160]
a lot I'm a huge fan honest 238 only 12.8% and

[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.340]
I'm a baseball fan but not a Marlin fan which we edited

[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.540]
Belatedly we should have had that on the beginning

[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.420]
113 or 6% so actually if you take away not at all or I'm a fan of another team

[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:43.760]
You got about 37% so that means 63% almost two-thirds you turn say that they care at least a little bit which I think is something right

[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.520]
Right if you look at it from a positive viewpoint

[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.140]
Right they may not care like a whole lot there a whole bunch of people that are caring up to be there today

[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.160]
But then tomorrow those five oh we don't have any money. We can't come back again

[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.440]
Because it's not a happening I still I mean I know I'm way out on the limon this one everybody also understands it

[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.700]
And I've been a baseball fan since I was a little kid which I'm not anymore either one but I just

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.660]
The opening day thing just leaves me limp the holiday man everyone around here is festive

[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.460]
It's a holiday. It's a well plus it is Easter week and it's a pace off week and

[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.480]
In fact you can go out to the stadium and break bread or break matsu whichever you choose all depending upon your poison

[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.740]
Yeah, and all you orthodox Jews in Brooklyn quit burning the bread and those fires there

[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.240]
They are whether they inclement weather in the wind and everything has been blowing the fires all around and giving the kitchen

[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.300]
It catches under deadlocks as a matter of fact

[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.980]
Under bagels and deadlocks not a good idea

[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.400]
I guess you can't eat like regular bagels doing pace off can

[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.220]
Sorry, so they're burning their bread and bagels in these big

[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.660]
Barrels I guess right and I've ever heard of that before did you no do you hear that?

[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.640]
Let's see we got three fat Jews on the show today. I think this is pretty exciting. We got a nice short two-hour show

[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.040]
Let me give you today's pull right off the bat because we don't have a lot of time. We don't have too much time to doodle around today

[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.900]
Can I say that no too much time to

[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.880]
And we got a whole new bunch of thanks to Boka Brian

[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.180]
Bleeps

[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.500]
In other words little droppin so if there's a word we can't say we can say hey, we're having a really a

[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.820]
of a time today

[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.480]
Yeah, and then in honor of for all we got we got that

[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.100]
Too bad he ain't gonna be at the ballpark right given away although we don't need him today

[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:32.500]
To give away thousands of tickets to film up sections like he used to so that everybody can go out and of course next time he comes back in a town

[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.380]
Zach will be out there at the ballpark passing out for goodies to everybody all little kids I

[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.120]
Can't say what you're gonna be but anyway now here's today's pool based on all that's happened

[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:49.160]
Well listen no playing me for that Zach. That was the beast yesterday said you got a drug problem or drug problem based on all

[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.680]
It's just a joke don't get all uptight now like George the last thing we need George's on vacation this week

[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.100]
We don't need another uptight unhappy camper there. It's a festive day. It's the holidays now

[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.540]
It's exposed to marlins at 120 the pregame at 1245 and well nothing's perfect

[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:09.760]
So we got Joseph Gaki at the stadium at noon boy. Can you imagine listening to Joseph Gaki and the Dave and boring on the same day?

[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.800]
Man, that is something

[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.720]
Yeah

[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:21.960]
Oh

[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:27.500]
Talk about a snooze fest at the ballpark anyway, let's get serious that was the beast snoring you do know that yeah

[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.440]
It is me that was a beautiful thing that was actually for real anyway based on all that's happened

[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.100]
What's your current take on a war in Iraq especially with all these dead bodies now?

[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:40.560]
It's getting to be really grotesque and getting to be unwieldy and nasty. I supported a hundred percent

[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.920]
I think it had to be done. But it was poorly planned. I'm not sure yet

[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.520]
Over what does that say over 600 American lives have been sacrificed by the bush crowd

[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.520]
It was based on lies or it was based on lies and bush should be impeached

[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.860]
I think we covered all the bases didn't we?

[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.880]
Yeah, let me read the choices again based on all that's happened. What's your current take on a war in Iraq?

[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.300]
I supported a hundred percent

[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.380]
I think it had to be done but it was poorly planned. I'm not sure yet

[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.660]
Over 600 American lives have been sacrificed by the bush crowd

[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.900]
It was based on lies or it was based on lies and bush should be impeached. Oh

[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.760]
Those are your choices on today's fantastic very scientific poll

[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:26.820]
Provinets after 10 to 560 WQ and don't forget Kurt Cobain will be our guest. Oh, and guess what else we got thanks to Volkabryte

[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.060]
What remember how the goddess Randy on air America had the native run?

[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.120]
Remember that sure

[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.460]
Wasn't the right god

[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.600]
Jimmy Carter made a statement the other day about I mean

[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.620]
I'm not playing it because first of all that would be bad would kill some time

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.440]
But we got that too just for a rainy day sure

[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.280]
It's bringing the savings right now and save like never before on a great new car truck from Armstrong Toyota of homestead

You'll find them on US one twenty minutes south of the 836 and Armstrong Toyota homesteads worth the drive to save lots of cash on great

That was it.

[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.420]
Oh, you're being slow.

[00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.860]
Look it out.

[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.860]
There you go.

[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.320]

[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.360]
Oh, the radio.

[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.040]
Oh, the radio.

[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.040]

[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.040]

[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.040]

[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.220]

[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.880]
All the radio.

[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.640]
Oh

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.020]
18 at 560 WQM it was pretty exciting this morning Crow and Joe together

[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:53.080]
That's an idea for a future show don't you think big time the Joe and Crow show and fact how about the Joe Crow and Mojo

[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.300]
Absolutely interesting that be great

[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.340]
Anyway, let's see speaker of the Crow to reason I play that is because Warren chromarty comes back to the scene of the crime again to QA

[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.040]
And it's really shocking. This is one of the like a bad penny, you know, you just can't get rid of it

[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.600]
He just keeps you like a Brad penny

[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.660]
Saturday he was gonna be on from a for to a pregame show 545 and on Sunday

[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.040]
So I guess before Marlon's on deck on a weekend. Is this gonna be a permanent kind of thing? Yeah

[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.400]
Well, I got news for you won't hear him on the Schlachs and where wasn't he over there for a while for about a week

[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.460]
Yeah, he was on the other show. Yeah, he was a book and a guest for

[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.660]
Stugots and then Stu said Terence is a better job of that so get the hell out of here. I got your co-bondits right here home boy

[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.040]
other way if you if you were here right now you'd be voluminous because

[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.380]
Go back to Maddie Bells decked out in Marlon's gear

[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:46.360]
Skippy has his own shirts evidently that say Skippy. Oh, no special for opening day talk about phony's man

[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.440]
What a bunch of freaking phony's the whole town

[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.580]
But I will say this and I said this to be for the show and I mean this the fact is gonna be probably close to

[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.860]
60,000 people there for this opening day today

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:02.480]
And that's just a front-running phony aspect which I've told is famous for but this week when there's a lot of people out of town

[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.400]
I mean there's nobody around

[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.440]
Kids about a school in Broward right? I don't know about Dave, but Broward kids are out of school and

[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.220]
You got your Easter week and the Pesach week and all of these things and so there a lot of people have gone

[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.160]
So the fact that there are 60,000 people there now on the other hand the kids are out of school

[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.560]
Right right so what else are you gonna do keep them off the street?

[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:26.040]
I mean Zach don't have enough drugs to supply to all those kids so at any rate

[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.940]
But he will be at the game tomorrow and be a small sparser crowd you never know

[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.540]
Isn't that what Ferrell used to do with the crown

[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.340]
What's that I'm with the good stuff? I don't know. Don't start picking on poor Ferrell. Okay. He's having a tough time up in there in Atlanta

[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.700]
I hear a show is so terminally boring now because he can't do his thing, you know, what does he do then?

[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.000]
Talk about what happens when somebody opens up their car and thence your car door things like that

[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.760]
No, seriously, that's what ductal me here. She was monitoring

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.000]
48 votes so far on a pull now

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.360]
That's pretty weak for it's been up there a couple of minutes. We should have a hundred already based on all that's happened

[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.740]
What no look we got twenty one more dead the coalition troops over their last three days in Iraq

[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:10.220]
What's more important opening day or dead bodies right opening day? I mean dead bodies are a dime

[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:15.640]
It doesn't lately, you know bodies are kids and body bags. It's a small potatoes, but opening day baseball

[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.220]
We're talking heavy-duty especially on Q.A.M. We're all we know from his supports

[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:26.580]
In fact, I got some really cute. I think Clarence did a couple of these you're working nice his voice on some of these drop-ins here to book a branson

[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.820]
Yeah, that was guilty and for the real Gelly fans out there we got this one. I like a lot

[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.380]
These are great that book of Brian man put him away before it's too late

[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.520]
48 votes you're based on all that's happened what's your current take on a Warner rack

[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.740]
It was based on lies Bush would be in peets 39. That was my vote. I

[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.800]
Think it had to be dumb. It was poorly planned five. It was based on lies three over 600 American lives have been

[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:04.500]
Sacrified by the bush crowd one. I'm not sure yet zero and I supported 100% zero so far

[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.280]
That what you call your overwhelming support

[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:12.720]
So far in this crowd now the good news for this audience since they all of a sudden I have no idea where this concern for my health came from yesterday

[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:17.400]
Because generally die you know die retire something like that right yesterday

[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:23.520]
They took a sudden turn for my health you're drinking all that diet soda and so they convinced me

[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:29.800]
I don't know why cuz I'm easy. I guess I have no sales resistance to quick drinking all that diet coke that caffeine-free diet coke because it's got

[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.940]
As per tame in it. What okay? Oh, I'm sorry like I said

[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.160]
It's got pertain in it

[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.020]
Yeah, we can't say ass

[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.400]
So I've got my candid drug club soda here right now, which is a compromise

[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.320]
I can head that record bunch of that flat water you were talking about yesterday Nia or something like that bottle of water and it's

[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.300]
It has no no kick to it. I'm sure it's that being a fat cow. I mean a guy of good taste

[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.140]
Still I'm just saying what I'm saying you don't drink clean flat water do you I love shelter?

[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.060]
Sucks see there you go shelter in fact. It's a Jew thing

[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:05.620]
They're actually doing pays off nothing like going to the famous years ago and getting that we put a bottle of

[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.720]
Seltzer on every table did you know that but you didn't know that being the punks that you are

[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.240]
The famous I'm watching the avenue man. It was the greatest restaurant in the history of South Florida

[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.960]
They had the big jars of the big things of pickles and oh man the fried crepe was unbelievable

[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:26.320]
Let's go and on every hell. Let's go on every table over put a bottle of Seltzer water. I'm talking about like real like in a real deli

[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.320]
It was great

[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.820]
So at any rate I'm drinking water now that I'm not drinking anymore a diet soda

[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:37.200]
Okay, so he just relax all those people are recording yesterday all and the guy who was plugging his bottle of water there

[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.460]
That was shame the alkaline water. Yeah, it's alkaline

[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.000]
Something listen. I made it this far and case the Ross are out okay

[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:53.320]
All of a sudden they're gonna save my pathetic whole life. Let's see another for the pool get serious now and finish the war

[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.440]
No more than Americans as somebody redlands Jim

[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.420]
No more. Well, okay, I think we got enough there on a pool dish

[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.660]
Which I don't think Zach knows how to add stuff on the pool anyway, huh?

[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.480]
Do yeah

[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.040]
Well, Josh Cornish is out there trying he's taking the no-dos out to Dave Van Bore at the ballpark

[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.900]
It'd be a

[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.020]
Embracing to fall asleep during your broadcast on opening day. I mean any other day when people don't care

[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.680]
It's one thing but to fall asleep so Dave Van Bore has Josh Cornish

[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.180]
They're like slapping him on the back to keep him awake during the game

[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.240]
That's what I've been told his job is out there something like that. Yeah

[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.680]
Look at that now the votes are coming in now they're trickling

[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.240]
83 say it was based on lies and Bush would be impeached absolutely

[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:43.380]
Out of 115 at 72.1 percent we want to and by the way, let me give you that good website again for that crowd in case you haven't checked it out

[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:50.020]
If I have it, it's called impeach central calm all one word impeach central calm

[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.080]
It even has a thing for you to sign their petitions again

[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.600]
I apologize that stop at CC calm us sir

[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.920]
It wasn't really a big deal for a lot of effort to sign those petitions and hopefully Scott will get a couple hundred thousand

[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.280]
He'll send him off and get something done

[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.160]
But we just don't know who Scott is we don't have a last name

[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.600]
I'm not gonna raise any money for a cause that we don't know. Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.240]
It just does make sense right because he could like get hit by a bus God forbid tomorrow in the middle man

[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.320]
Had in somewhere and we never see Scott again and what happened to those signatures

[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.420]
So you have to have a little more control over campaign if you're gonna be involved in addition to which I'm still waiting to see the big shots

[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.560]
Oh, it's bigger than that

[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.800]
Yeah, speaking of my second powers again

[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:32.180]
Infinity broadcasting is reportedly about to be hit with a fine of more than a hundred thousand dollars for a show by Howard Stern

[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.020]
This is a new one

[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:40.120]
Broadcasting and cable says the fine would be the first one involving Stern that'll hit the broadcaster with a separate fine for each

[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.840]
Indicent utterance during a program

[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.300]
Broadcasters were previously hit with a single fine no matter how many times the program

[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:53.860]
Crossed the line but the FCC with their obnoxious the psychotic behavior these days put broadcasters I noticed late last year

[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.080]
They would now face possible multiple fines on the same program maybe

[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.860]
Full bunch the current maximum fine 27,500 for each instance should to be obscene

[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.880]
But that fine is let it against each stationary Michelle

[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.780]
So they don't say exactly what the fine is gonna be but more than a hundred grand against infinity as the fines

[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.740]
Just keep rolling in and you know and what Mel Carmers and says oh, we're fine

[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.880]
It's really small potatoes to them

[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.900]
Here's the fact that says here's one way to think of Condi's testimony, which is coming up Thursday by the way

[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.840]
She's one of the actual terrorists going on a witness to my sense

[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:33.480]
She's gonna tell a bunch of lies that seems shocking and implicate bush to the point of making him seem incompetent and inexperienced

[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.960]
Then she's gonna take the fall

[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.360]
Oh, man

[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.880]
That's up to look forward to who wouldn't want to see Condi's a take the fall

[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.880]
It says in a hole in a world where somebody is always to blame it was all her fault

[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.360]
We she should have known we're all gonna think what a bunch of incompetent India. Well this goes on and on and on

[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.460]
They're gonna blame a black chick then we'll all forget it happened

[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.700]
It says no, we're not gonna forget here until you that nobody's gonna forget

[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.780]
Especially as the body count continues mounting and mounting and mounting and before you know that's gonna be 700 then

[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.040]
It's gonna be 900 then it's gonna be over a thousand

[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.020]
It's all worth it. He was on last night Larry King did a really poor job

[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.700]
So it didn't seem all that animated plus it was past his bedtime

[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.960]
But he was on with Larry last night talking about how this is a Vietnam all over again

[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.660]
It's George W's Vietnam and he's right we're in a quagmire

[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:22.220]
But anyway, we don't want to get too depressing and more but doing not on opening day. Yeah

[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.700]
Right, yeah, that would be un-American. I mean you got Maddie Bell in there writing around like some kind of a clown

[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.960]
Now who what's what's the story? I guess Miguel is probably squeezing my tickets pretty tight, huh?

[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.100]
I guess so with my Marlon tickets because it would seem to me

[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.620]
It would have been really nice if they would like have mailed them to my home or done something like that so that

[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.380]
They wouldn't be just laying around a building like that. But Ray Perry. He's got bigger fish to fry

[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.580]
I'm sure 26 past 10 at 560 Q.A.M.

[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.120]
Your sports radio 560 Q.A.

[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.100]
And now here's

[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:04.460]
Comic-Colale the former I Racky Minister of Information with today's health update

[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.000]
Good news. There is no such thing as SARS

[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.100]
You cowardly American intidels have nothing to fear

[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:20.220]
That's why leading health experts encourage all Americans to fly to Beijing China and

[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.900]
Lick the door knobs of the restrooms at the local walking clinics

[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:31.480]
Also a new study show that smoking cigarettes is good for you

[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.220]
So smoke of me if you got America with today's health update

[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:41.400]
I'm Mohamed Saeed Al Sahaf may God roast your stomachs in hell

[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.900]
Stay tuned to this station for more updates from the Racky Minister of Information

[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.700]
I wonder if he lies as much as the bush mustard. You think on airs Ralph Nader look at that

[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.180]
Oh, he failed to make the Oregon ballot

[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.140]
Oh, that's good news. That's exciting news. I'm ecstatic here

[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.320]
Fail to make the ballot in Oregon. I mean he'll fail to make the ballot in a whole bunch of other states at least

[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.580]
I'm good man like Florida would be good. Keep him off of there when it down causes us out his crusty old ass

[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.640]
Man talk about an idiot

[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.460]
Anyway, 188 votes based on all that's happened. What's your current take on a war in Iraq?

[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.260]
It was based on lies and bush and being peaked to 140

[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.520]
74.4 percent

[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.980]
Look at that Clinton and the UN announced keep drug initiative. There's Bubba

[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:31.240]
50% or more and will you certain drugs who say see has been amazing how like presidents at when they leave office

[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.820]
Then they start doing wonderful things like Jimmy Carter and the Bubba right anyway. They went peace prizes

[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.580]
You can only imagine who Bubba is doing right now

[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:44.640]
Probably a whole bunch of good numbers. It was based on lies this war 14. I supported 100% of dozen the dirty dozen

[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:51.680]
I think it had to be done, but was poorly planned another dirty dozen over 600 American lives have been sacrificed by the bush crowd

[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.380]
10 and I'm not sure yet three they're waiting they're waiting till the death count gets up to at least two three thousand

[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.640]
And they'll say well, maybe this one's such a good idea. It's bigger than dead people Kurt Cobain

[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.700]
So you forgot to remind me to talk about that

[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.300]
It's probably ought to take a collar to even though we have only a two-hour show and I'm thinking to myself

[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.720]
This two-hour deal is is the way to go right two hours. It's the mandatory and the most three

[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.820]
I think I need to get Norma Kent to renegotiate my whole deal with his outfit

[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.040]
Four-hour show is ridiculous. I mean, you know once upon a time back in the day

[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.860]
That I guess was fine, but that's passe, right? Right

[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:29.040]
Who else does four hours on this station? No one well Eddie Kay that's about Eddie Kay only on certain days

[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.600]
But many days he does only a couple right? Well, if there's a late game if there's a late game

[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.600]
When you're on the west coast he's unlike for about a half an hour and whatever

[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.660]
Plus that's late at night late night people like my overnight guys

[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:45.020]
They work like from midnight to five sometime midnight to six overnight the graveyard shift, okay?

[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:49.560]
Right and Eddie Kay quite frankly is a nice guy, but that gambling stuff that's good for people in a graveyard

[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.000]
But at any rate I think three hours would be fine

[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.100]
It's not gonna be 10 to one mad dog one to four the Humper four to seven, right?

[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:01.520]
It's not a rainbow. It's just not gonna do three hours. I beg your pardon manage will not do three hours

[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.860]
How do you know that because you love the two-hour lunch break?

[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.800]
Does he really or how about let me suggest this to you?

[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.960]
No, I got no idea well

[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:15.000]
We'll work on that maybe tomorrow will take a poll on which QAM schedule do you like the most the one that leaves off?

[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.400]
Mo I think that's absolutely one that these two guys like the most well, and by the way

[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.240]
It's interesting to me since Zach is there today. I don't want to get him involved in this controversy

[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:31.500]
But Zach remember here was leaving Mo show as one of the producers in the Mo Howard David in Morning show because of his busy life and his schedule and so on

[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.520]
It's amazing to me that he's on a Joe Roe show, which is only eight to ten just a little bit later on in the morning, right?

[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.140]
Now, why is that?

[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.020]
what?

[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.820]
Okay, now anyway getting back to Kurt Cobain

[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.180]
I'll save that for tomorrow when you're sitting where the beast is I want to rip you an ass today because it's opening day

[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.520]
Maybe Marlon's host of Montreal exposed

[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:53.240]
They're gonna expose the weakness of Montreal. They're gonna kick some ass right there at P.P. Park

[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:59.040]
60,000 screaming phony fan. I mean fans are gonna be waving their banners, and we love the Marlons

[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.980]
It's this great, you know because we got nothing else going on

[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.580]
Happy to make the playoffs again the heat even though they're in the playoffs

[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.420]
I mean it's just it's such a crap deal

[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.260]
Come on the heater like the Marlon's last year, man

[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.540]
Yeah, yeah

[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:19.500]
Yeah, man, yeah, I mean that's such a crappy Lee you can be under 500 make the playoffs, which is pretty embarrassing if you ask me

[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:24.720]
And the dolphins of course what we know they still got Jay Feele and Feeley Goody guys

[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.460]
So it's gonna be really weak in fact Wayne High Zing is gonna be calling Mo again

[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.440]
They're not a bitches ass out not about anything specific just that in general, you know, just out of general principle

[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.460]
So here's a good website cobeincase.com

[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:46.260]
Okay, you got it. Okay, Cobain case one word.com Kurt Cobain left a drug rehab center in Marine Delray, California April 1 1994

[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:53.420]
No fooling you maybe this was just a April fool's dope you think no and was later reported missing as you probably know

[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:59.040]
He was found dead just seven days later. So the anniversary the 10th anniversary is coming up very very soon

[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.720]
Which is why this week everybody's talking about

[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.100]
Kurt Cobain

[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.900]
Anyway, this thing is by a guy a guy named Tom Grant who did this investigation

[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:13.720]
He's a California state licensed private investigator former detective with the LA County Sheriff Department April 3rd

[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.040]
1994 he was hired by Courtney Love

[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.280]
To look at her husband after he left the drug rehab center in Marina Delray, California

[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:27.860]
Miss love stayed in LA. Oh, she just admitted by the way to do an oxy cotton. She got the leftover from Willow that rush can't use this week

[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:35.300]
Miss love stayed in LA while the Tom Grant flew to Seattle to search for Cobain with his best friend Dylan Carlson

[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:41.660]
In fact Carlson and Tom had been in the Cobain residence the night before Kurt's body was discovered in the room of the garage

[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.660]
You're following this now. Yeah, he says the police immediately concludes suicide

[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.760]
I wasn't so sure neither was Rosemary Carol Courtney Love's own entertainment attorney

[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:55.860]
Miss Carol was also a close friend to both Courtney and Kurt something was wrong here terribly wrong

[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.020]
Says Tom Grant

[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:04.900]
After several months of intensive investigation including dozens of taped interviews with Cobain's closest friends and family members

[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:11.460]
I reached the conclusion that Courtney Love and Michael DeWitt the male nanny who lived at the Cobain residence were involved in a conspiracy

[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.220]
That resulted in the murder of Kurt Cobain

[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.980]
It appears this was not the first attempt on Cobain's life by Courtney Love. It was however the first two

[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.220]
succeed. I guess it only takes one that succeeds right right I can have several failures

[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.960]
But if one that's what Robert Blake said it only takes one

[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:35.420]
In December of 94 Tom began speaking publicly about these suspicious circumcises surrounded Cobain's death

[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:41.200]
Attempts to inform the public about this case have been met with physical threats as well as threats of legal action against anyone in the media

[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.600]
Who gives Tom Grant a platform? How do you like that? Don't that sounds suspicious?

[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.100]
Not

[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:55.780]
Motivated by profit rather than truth Courtney Love and her attorneys have taken drastic measures in an effort to keep the public from learning the true facts of this case in spite of all their hot air

[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.760]
This investigation has received coverage in hundreds of major magazines TV and radio talk shows around the world

[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.640]
How come we never talked about this before? I don't know

[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.380]
You are aware of this I've never heard of it before before like last week

[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:14.280]
As I predicted says Tom Grant when I first began speaking out no legal action has been taken against myself or anyone in the media has covered this story

[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.520]
The pathetic cowards of this world can only blow smoke once they've been exposed they run and hide

[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:25.240]
The events surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain are filled with lies contradictions in logic and countless inconsistencies

[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.140]
You miss exciting

[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.180]
Here's just some of what you were never told

[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.040]
Courtney Love was facing a divorce

[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.560]
Kurt was in a process of leaving Seattle and his wife Courtney when he was found dead

[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.600]
Courtney knew Kurt wanted out of the marriage as weeks prior to his death

[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.840]
He asked one of her attorneys to get the meanest most vicious divorce lawyers

[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.760]
She could find someone was using Kurt's credit card

[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:58.580]
What a Kurt's credit cards was missing when his body was discovered someone was attempting to use the missing credit card after Cobain died

[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.840]
But the attempt stop when his body was discovered Cobain was in fear of his life

[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.600]
The shotgun found at the scene was purchased before Cobain left for rehab in Los Angeles

[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.180]
Not after he fled the rehab is reported by misinformed media sources

[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:16.160]
The shotgun was fully loaded with three shells. It was purchased and loaded for protection not suicide

[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.020]
The police claimed there were no legible fingerprints on his shotgun

[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:24.940]
The truth is the shotgun wasn't even checked for fingerprints till May 6th nearly a month after Cobain's body was found

[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.860]
You're putting all these pieces of the puzzle together got it

[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.200]
You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out

[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.120]
There was no suicide note

[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.120]
The note found at the scene by the police was immediately enabled as a suicide note

[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.960]
But this note was not addressed to Kurt's wife and daughter as it says nothing about killing himself

[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.380]
The note was clearly written to Cobain's fans telling him he's quitting the music business

[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:48.880]
There was only a short footnote to Courtney and Francis and the handwriting contained in those lines has been questioned by several handwriting experts

[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.280]
Courtney had another note she kept in secret

[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.600]
Courtney was in possession of a second note after Kurt's body was found

[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.340]
She didn't tell anybody about the second note till several months later when information about it slipped out

[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.980]
During interview with Rolling Stone magazine

[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.740]
The second note the one that Courtney kept in secret clearly defines the first note

[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:07.320]
Which was found at the scene of Cobain's death the second note from Kurt plainly states

[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.420]
He was leaving Courtney leaving Seattle. He was not leaving the planet. You following all that?

[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.020]
And

[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.440]
Zach will get interested in this Cobain was injected with three times lethal dose of heroin

[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.560]
Oh perfect

[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.640]
Cobain's heroin more fiend blood level was 1.52 mg's per liter

[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.540]
This would require a minimum injection of 225 mg's of heroin three times lethal dose

[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.100]
Even for a hardcore heroin addict the drug diazza pan was also found at Cobain's blood system

[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.100]
The obvious questions number one if Cobain injected himself with a deliberate heroin overdose

[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.980]
While would he also shoot himself and I had with a shotgun leaving his baby daughter

[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.900]
Love of his life with horrific visual urinjas to remember him by why wouldn't he just go to sleep?

[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.200]
I the overdose and never wake up too if Cobain injected in three times lethal dose of heroin

[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.060]
Could he then pick up a shotgun and shoot himself when he had been immediately incapacitated

[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.400]
Based on the morphine blood levels found in Cobain's body preliminary research into Kate's Kurt Cobain

[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.700]
Would have been immediately incapacitated. He would have not have picked up that shotgun. It could not have pulled

[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:14.180]
He was not barricaded inside the room as reported by misinformed media sources and it goes on and on and on

[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.020]
It says the official version of suicide was simply a rushed adjugment

[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:24.460]
Which eventually painted the authorities into a corner as reports of a so-called copycat suicide began making the news

[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.820]
Nothing like a copycat suicide, right? Yeah

[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.980]
Pass that along to Josh Friedman just mentioned that team 1041 at 560 Q.A.M

[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:48.260]
We passed away among them Brian Keith Jimmy Stewart's Robert Mitchum and Jacques Cousteau

[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.580]
Listen now as they join Charles Corralts for the end of the road

[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.880]
Attention for all those passengers flying heaven and air they board

[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.700]
Hey Jimmy how is your funeral service?

[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.320]
Yeah, it was just a wonderful wake. How about you Brian?

[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.480]
Very small we kept it to a family affair just playing going from here to

[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:18.000]
Trinity hey, I'll come your own wet jack. That is not shocked. He's not jacked. Jack jerk. Whatever. Are we going from here to

[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:18.900]
Trinity?

[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:25.480]
I'll ask you a question. What's that little tramp sissy? Did you ever buffy her?

[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:31.820]
I don't want to know about this. I want to know that they missed a flash. I understand that he is a man's man

[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.640]
Say how long before we get to return it far away there yet

[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.580]
1047 at 560 W.Q.A.M

[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:44.700]
I just had a great idea for a poll which of these people do you supposedly dead people do you think is going to lie? Huh?

[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.660]
Jim Morrison Elvis Kurt Cobain Dave Ann Boring

[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.460]
That's who I'm going with this that's not right

[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.680]
285 votes are either one of you there you're both eating right now we're here you don't hear me

[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.460]
with the beast mate we like that you are just a weak weatel sister

[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.780]
285 based on all that's happened what's your current take on the war in Iraq

[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:12.640]
It was based on lies and Bush should be impeached 201 70 and a half percent over 70 percent

[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:18.380]
See and peach is asked now to which I say absolutely it was based on lies 24

[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:25.100]
I think it had to be done but was poorly planned 20 over 600 Americans lives have been sacrificed by the bush crowd 19

[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.700]
I supported 100 percent

[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:32.860]
17 which is a mere 5.9 percent and I'm not sure yet for there's still waiting out there 1.4 percent

[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:37.460]
They're not sure yet. You know us every poll no matter what you ask there's always a 3 percent

[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.600]
I'm decided 4 percent on decided is today Tuesday

[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.640]
99 percent Priya said yes 1 percent they're not too sure

[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:51.020]
See what I'm saying right always people just to can't make up their mind in other words what they try to say is they're stupid

[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.520]
Is what I think they're trying to say

[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.260]
Surgey on highly is as the official or count is 615 dead

[00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.640]
That's American soldiers on official count for wounded is 3719

[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.940]
But of course when you say wounded they don't tell us about those who are like very very seriously wounded

[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:10.480]
Which there's an awful lot unofficial dead from the coalition of the pressured into war meaning the brits and the other so-called coalition is

[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.720]
47 so we're talking very close to a thousand out total plus the thousands and thousands of Iraqis but then again

[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.600]
We don't care about them doing no even though we're liberating them and we're gonna have a wonderful democratic former government

[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.700]
But it's emancipation by decapitation so worth it die too freaking bad it was well worth it right

[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.600]
Don't forget now we got Joseph Gackey at the statement noon. Maybe we got Marlins on deck at 1245

[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.460]
Exposed to Marlins game time at 120 the Hebrew hammer on

[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.940]
I can't believe on paysock no less the Hebrew hammer follows the ballgame till seven

[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:48.040]
For big 7 o'clock edd. K. 10 and after that we go off the year till five in the morning and we start all over again

[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.780]
With Mo and Joe and a crow and all that kind of show let's Joe Castell coming back by the way. I don't know

[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:59.120]
So many people get nice in the back in that place, you know, of course you two guys with no nothing about that. No

[00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.620]
What?

[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.140]
WQA and hello

[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.220]
Hello, yes, man. Neil. This is unbelievable the first call of the day is a lady collar. This is shocking

[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.900]
Neil I can't believe I got through this is great look the problem with a

[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.500]
I'm really in favor of impeaching

[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.340]
Bush but then where we left with chaney who's worse

[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:25.260]
Right? Yeah, you can't get rid of him either. Yeah, but chaney couldn't win a fixed election at this point

[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.600]
He couldn't know he couldn't know when or what a fixed election

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.900]
Which is you want to come to one? Yeah, okay, well

[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:37.460]
This let's get George impeached all right. Let's work on it. Okay. See you. She wants to impeach his ass right now

[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.880]
5 6 7 0 5 6 you we're not gonna get a lot of calls these two hours because everybody's they're busy packing up all your goodies

[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.080]
They got the coolers now, you know, all right. You can't take the coolers in the ballpark

[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.900]
You're right. They're probably tailgating as we speak. No, just no

[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:54.000]
Not getting for baseball games. They're at the stadium today. They'll be tailgating. Are they tailgating? Yeah, opening day? Yes

[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.060]
As opposed to tomorrow when the big our big to do our big party out there

[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.840]
Our big get together starts at 11

[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.120]
Well, how come nobody told me about that. How come there's no promo? How come there's no information about that?

[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.540]
I don't even hear recorded promo maybe they're having another auction

[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:14.840]
Uh, maybe we have another silent auction online on qm.com and by the way, how many people visit wqm.com every month

[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:19.800]
I wouldn't worry about the reason too much your fraudulent money with that. Oh, but it's another revenue stream

[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.180]
The only you don't understand is another revenue stream said Clarence is it was streaming down his leg

[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.080]
That was really sad. That was so pathetic

[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:32.040]
Pulling the wool over the eyes of our loyal audience out there as if they don't have another other cons going on in the world

[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.660]
And the beesleys got a condom out of their hard-earned bucks. That's really pathetic if you ask me

[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.400]
WQM hello not there on four shame on you man

[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.220]
Well, they're in a hurry. They're on a way to that big party at 11 o'clock. It's 10.51 already WQM. Hello

[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.740]
Another one five six seven oh five sixty WQM. Hello

[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.700]
Hello, yes sir

[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.120]
I'd like to ask Neil about the noises that he has on the website

[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.080]
Noises that he isn't know we can't talk about those noises sir

[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.700]
Not now maybe back in the day before all of this stuff came down. We can't talk about noises

[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.000]
Not not that one either. Do you hear that one?

[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.140]
So that is my favorite you've got to admit okay. I like that one

[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.340]
Oh, there's something you can you know even Zach would admit in fact you'd both admit that the the

[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:29.540]
Moe and Gildi that book of Brian is invented his version of Moe and Gildi are so much more exciting entertaining and amusing than the real Moe and Gildi

[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:35.800]
Oh without a doubt. I mean definitely funny. Right. There's no see this like that just that sound a lot

[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:42.280]
In fact, I'm gonna just start playing that all day long. I think four hours of that might be yeah get about a 30 share

[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.360]
Yeah, all Gildi radio

[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.560]
I

[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:56.300]
Now I really suggested this with all you know with all difference to my good friend blockhead Joe Rose

[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:02.260]
There's a good guy, but what is he boring uh, but anyway, I'm thinking that a a Moe and Gildi

[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.480]
Bokeh Brian show for me to 10 would far surpass all that sports stuff

[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.240]
You know we got so much sports plus Joe's not on a payroll anyway. He's not getting paid

[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.400]
They never signed in that deal. I don't think so what do you think of that? I think it's a great idea

[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:18.680]
I think that would be funny and book a Brian of course probably have a hell of a time getting paid himself

[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.720]
But nevertheless, he'd have a good time doing it

[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:29.580]
Probably a lot cheaper. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir Jeff pizza loft. Oh, I remember him. Yes. Well, I always have trouble getting through

[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.040]
I don't have any of the numbers anymore

[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.420]
Well, you don't have numbers because we're changing the numbers. You're one of those people that we're changing the numbers on

[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.580]

[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.620]
Here's line nine my very favorite QAM. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.880]
I was waiting yesterday and calling you up about the Espertain country

[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:52.660]
As you buy I just want to tell you if you go to Google and put in

[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:58.000]
Clothed in a cell I don't like potato Google a lot. Hello Google Google Google and put in

[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.860]
Thundering the in a doll Espresain

[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.520]
And you'll get the words that he uses

[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.660]
All crap. It's crap

[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:09.880]
I'm not drinking it anymore. Well, no, it's good. It's all right. No wait a minute. No, no

[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:15.940]
Just a minute. What's all crap? In other words the information is crap? The information about Espertain being junk is crap

[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.800]
It's good

[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:24.600]
Dr. Dena Dell write a little article about it in order to read so in other words crap is good

[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.300]
Well, I'm not

[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.340]
So what should we talk about in the 11 to 12 hours? Should we talk about toothpaste or water? Huh? Of course

[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:41.540]
It's always good when you have to you brush to you know, rinse out your mouth with some real good

[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.800]
The seltzer water. You don't rinse with seltzer. Do you know? No, okay. It's a good idea though

[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.320]
Yeah, look here you're you're you're you just haven't tried it. You would like seltzer

[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.280]
I tried it. It's horrible seltzer's good. What are you talking about? No, I'm sitting here drinking club soda right now

[00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:01.600]
Just got. Oh, I mean flat water is so plain and it always seems to have like a musty taste to it. It's water. It's supposed to be plain

[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:07.180]
But this is a Mahaya man. It's got like a little bit of pepper. Bessons. It's a little bubbly

[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.460]
Yeah, I think all that stuff about Espertains a bunch of crap

[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.640]
Although I will say this and maybe it's just a coincidence

[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.400]
You know in a one-day sense I quit drinking at all that diet soda. Yeah, I feel better

[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:21.100]
Well, there you go now it could be psychosomatic you could be like who the hell knows what it is maybe change of life

[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.180]
Maybe just the fact that we're getting off at noon today

[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.840]
That might have something to do with it

[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.400]
Oh

[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:40.800]

And you never had a chance

[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.280]
You put your name on the ballot

[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.080]
The way you ever had a chance

[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.800]

Stole the election there is where

And now the Nazi rights wingers

[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.580]
And the super-solo election fair is where

[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.060]
Nobody votes for a guy

[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.440]
Who tries to 65 for rare

[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.740]
See you later out later

[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.060]

Yeah, see you later out later

Try to save the land you see

[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.360]
Bye bye bye

[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.920]
Go try your corner

[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.600]
Into a tree

[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.580]
All right

[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.120]
Oh

[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:28.140]
60 WQ AMS are 11 and noon hour and end of set then we're going home bye bye. Why am hope that's right so

[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.300]
Yes, you know who Zach had Passover dinner with last night the event boring no

[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.660]
Kurt Cobain no the conspiracy continues

[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.120]
The very own house one Mr. John Weiner

[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.600]
He's part of the guy. Yeah, two gods. Yeah, part of the family

[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:47.560]
Yeah

[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.780]
Concerning with the enemy. Yeah, no wonder Moe hates Zach

[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.160]
Hey

[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:58.100]
Just do spoil the family and did you give him like a list of all the names of all the guests that the Moe has on

[00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:59.360]
No

[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.680]
Come on you can probably give him all the names and numbers

[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.360]
Clarence's running dry. I don't have any names and numbers

[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.500]
Clarence said he's got a few numbers anyway

[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:11.900]
It's the 367 votes on the pool based on all that's happened. What's your current take on the war in Iraq?

[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.360]
It was based on lies and Bush ought to be impeached

[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.400]
246 67 percent that's two thirds of the audience you turn

[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.340]
I was based on lies 38

[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:25.120]
I think it had to be dumbled with poorly planned 31 another word

[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.240]
Over 600 American lives have been sacrificed by the Bush crowd

[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:34.240]
650 to be exact up to the second that's 26 said that I

[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.640]
Supported 100% 20 and I'm not sure yet six. They're still hanging out

[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.340]
As the carnage continues it's getting really bloody and of course the bloodier can't

[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.020]
Then the Bush are a hunter. They tell us oh, that's a good sign. It means that we're getting the job done

[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.520]
Wow speaking of an idiot bush. Here's another idiot bush. His name is Jeb you heard of him. Yeah

[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.140]
This is this is so outrageous

[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.160]
Unbeatable

[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:03.240]
Saying rigorous screening standards would ensure recipients won't be terrorists

[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:09.360]
You talk about pandering governor Jeb Bush yesterday strongly endorsed issuing state drivers licenses to

[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:15.280]
Both illegal immigrants and foreign nationals who make Florida home for part of the year. Oh, illegal immigrants

[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:21.960]
So all the jokes about 57 chemis and all the other crap illegal immigrants people who are breaking the law

[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.640]
Let's give them a driver's license

[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.900]
Which certainly ought to improve the quality of driving when you think

[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.280]
In fact, he actually says that wait till you hear this hundreds of thousands of people could be affected by the proposal

[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.760]
Which is currently making its way through the Florida legislature

[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:42.260]
Senator Rudy Garcia Republican from high alie. Of course pushing the measure in the Senate says it would able to

[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:47.560]
Stuck an immigration limbo to drive with valid licenses and get insurance while they work to become citizens

[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.800]
Our roads and streets will be safer because of this

[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.900]
Garcia said adding that the sprawling nature of must-floor the cities makes owning a car in necessity

[00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:03.040]
And at the state by not giving illegal immigrants licenses almost tell these folks to break the law because that's the only way they're going to be doing anything

[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.900]
Your legal immigrants wishing to obtain licenses would have to submit to be cleared

[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:13.320]
You know something this is really a great idea because you know all those little jinny buses in date county

[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.880]
Yeah, they're already being driven by those Haitians who would don't know up from down or east from west now

[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.280]
We can replace them with some even more illegal immigrants

[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.920]
Yeah as soon as they wash up on sure. Oh here you go

[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:29.020]
Here's the driver's license and a keystual mini bus. Why not spread the wolf sure

[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.920]
They would have to submit to be cleared by background checks both in Florida and their home countries

[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:38.100]
The state would rely on consular officials to sign off on background checks from abroad

[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.740]
Although it doesn't have the broads name

[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:44.220]
Foreign nationals who visit the state frequently to check up on home to businesses would have to provide proof of ownership

[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:49.660]
This is so unbelievable the good news is the driver's license question presents lawmakers with a potentially

[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.220]
Volatile election year issue one that could woo Hispanic voters

[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.360]
But is also quitted with helping defeat former governor

[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.120]
Gray Davis during last year's re-collection in California

[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:04.060]
Florida's proposal however calls for stricter screening requirements in the driver's license bill signed in law by Davis

[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:08.140]
Bush said his support for the idea would waver if security precautions were relaxed

[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:13.040]
Right, Bush also made a point to say he's not encouraging more illegal immigration in the US

[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.280]
No, he's just pandering to those who don't speak at English. That's all he's doing

[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.100]
What a disgrace and of course guess what paper this is in

[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.880]
Uh the Miami

[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:23.820]
Uh

[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.060]
El Harold

[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.120]
El Harold

[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:28.860]
El Haralo man, El Nuevo

[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.000]
pandering and pandering illegal aliens getting drivers licenses, huh

[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.060]
What a pretty good idea

[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.820]
All from the Pew Research Center

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:45.420]
Public support for war in Iraq has been unaffected by the murders and decapitation of corpses of American citizens of lucha

[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:50.140]
However continued turmoil and violence in Iraq. Maybe taking a toll. Our president pushes approval rating

[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.080]
All right, that's a little bit of good news

[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:57.980]
Let's see first job approval in late March it was 47% now with 43

[00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:04.260]
Disapprove 47 so it disapprove 47% right now and approve 43% and don't know

[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.360]
The movement 10 10% see what I mean?

[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:10.080]
Ernie pull it's like a but the most unbelievable news

[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.180]
Nearly six and 10 Americans 57%

[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:18.880]
Continuatively that the US made the right decision and using military force against Iraq which is unchanged from a mid-march

[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.920]
Pew survey

[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:26.280]
However public attitude toward most aspects of the US mission in the rack of Turt more negative since January in the aftermath of the capture of old

[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:32.760]
Sodom and as this death toll continues mounting and the body bags keep coming back one might just think that just maybe

[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:38.800]
Maybe they're going to start getting a little bit more negative like our various two-d audience which overwhelmingly says impeaches us right now

[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.360]
They did it in those two lives and Bush would be impeached look at that 67.3%

[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:51.160]
260 more than two-thirds it was based on lies another 40 there's another 10% how do you like that?

[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:57.420]
So even the ones who don't think you ought to be impeached still you got 77.7% believe it was based on lies

[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.620]
I think it had to be done was poorly planned 38

[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:01.940]
33

[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:10.480]
Uh over 600 American lives have been sacrificed by the Bush crowd 27. I supported 100% 22 5.5% 5.5%

[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.300]
Is all he gets and I'm not sure yet six

[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.280]
Six people are they want directions to the ballpark

[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:23.100]
56705 60 pound five 60 on the ATT but the bad news for carry though is in Florida

[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.080]
Always closing the gap he was like 23 points behind

[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:33.020]
And the latest pull by the Orlando Sutton Aligned WESH news channel two in Orlando state wide Florida poll shows

[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.880]
Bush 51% in Florida carry 43%

[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.100]
But that's better than 23% in a rear is yeah

[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.980]
I'm assuming that you go our both registered to vote yes

[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.820]
Yes, sir, and you're both voting for carry yes, yes, sir

I'm not telling you who to vote for but I'm just asking I'm just inquiring

[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:56.660]
So that's three fat Jews voting for carry right here to counterbalance Robert Creeper room sure is gonna be voting three

[00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.700]
Oh, he has a lot of that kid he needs before he gets out of there before he retires in about seven or eight years

[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.920]
And moves on to his legal career. He needs a real pounding

[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.680]

people i'm gonna what it's supposed to be

[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.220]
negative i'm gonna best mood today i've been in

[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.620]
a long time you want to know why because it's

[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.480]
opening day because i'm off of that damn

[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.340]
diet soda i'm drinking my club soda here

[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.060]
which i like and spuddy your crappy attitude

[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.840]
and number two it's opening day we got a nice

[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.200]
short two hour show you see my whole attitude

[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.500]
on life would be so much different if i had

[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.980]
i mean two hours is unrealistic not for the kind of

[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.580]
money they're paying me but three hours not a

[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.340]
hopper he went from four hours to three

[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.280]
and allegedly the word is on the street he

[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.020]
didn't take any pay reduction right no paid

[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.760]
right so why not four hours to three for

[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.600]
this old fart huh paid my dues

[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.860]
seems logical sure and we might have

[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.440]
said the contract a little bit after that

[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.740]
you know like another week or two i mean

[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.600]
right other they are other one or two shows

[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.420]
maybe George can do the extra hour there you go

[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.540]
but you know something i think you just hit the jackpot

[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.280]
there you go and our with George it a

[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.040]
keeps the audience away or something like i mean

[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:02.800]
something like that wqm hello how you doing Neil

[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.380]

it have to be 11 to two you understand that

[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.580]
probably because he can't listen at 10 i see or

[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.500]

[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.280]

five six seven oh five sixty all the events in the world that are going on

[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.120]
the important things that are happening uh

[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.280]
mankind is probably like uh in the very very twilight of

[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.080]
immediate resistance and here we are on the way to the ballpark for

[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.120]

[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:08.020]

[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.660]
these good calls between now and now but you notice you can probably hear

[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.560]
they tinkle and the twinkle in my voice now because uh you know

[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:51.240]
even if it was just a three hour show i'd be in so much better frame of mind but

[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.780]
when it's four hours and it's like you know ten after ten and you say oh my god

it's only ten at class i just started the area four hours to go that's too long you know that

[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:03.960]
right am i right yeah too long that slave labor man it's cruel and unusual punishment for me

[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:08.340]
and the audience because by about one thirty man you're still getting like really cranky and you've

[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:12.860]
talked to Reverend Jones about seventy five times just a oh and George starts hyperventilating

[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:17.800]
that's Reverend Joe's and then you just want to scream out like that

[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:25.040]
you know it's oh i love that to me if that's all i heard today that's just that sends me an

[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.480]
orbit he's the best i could hear next hour just that three hours and here and now something

[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:36.960]
and maybe a little mo

[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:43.820]
based on all that's happened here's our pull question you can see Natasha Hensbridge if you're

[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:48.520]
about eighteen or over and you have fifteen pieces of id behind the beaded curtain on the

[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.600]
erudges dot com which you'd be while you wouldn't be amazed because you know what a bunch of

[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.540]
perverts and disparate as we got out there i mean we get an enormous response on our website the

[01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:00.180]
sad part of it is we got how many people read the story about third man and arrest them just

[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:05.120]
want to see the naked pictures that's okay we don't mind Natasha Hensbridge who turned how old is

[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.740]
she about third man this year Canadian a and she's a naked as a jay bird based on all that's

[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:15.320]
happened this year what's your current take on the war in Iraq as the body count unfortunately

[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:22.860]
continues 480 votes it was based on lies and bush should be impeached 325 67.7 percent

[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:27.600]
it was based on lies 47 in other words they're not ready for impeachment quite yet but they're

[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:33.480]
thinking about it they're getting close uh i think it had to be dumbled was poorly planned 37

[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:39.300]
over 600 american lives have been sacrificed by the bush crowd 32 i supported 100 percent

[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:45.440]
look how many supported 6.2 percent pretty weak and i'm not sure yet nine nine who are still

[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.940]
trying to figure out what planet they're on earth or Uranus 26 past 11 at five 60 wqm if your

[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.800]
Are you as well?

[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.960]
It's the same as you are.

[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:37.560]
No.

[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.440]
Now we're making movies about the crucifixion.

[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.760]
People in the theaters are mounted as...

[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.220]
It was okay but wasn't as good as Mad Max.

[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.700]
Jesus Christ, movie star, Rex Rie and the Tocque.

[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:58.700]

[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:58.700]

[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:58.700]

[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:58.700]

[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:58.700]

[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:58.700]

[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.320]
Jesus Christ, take a look.

[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.920]
Don't see the film till you read the book.

[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:08.600]
All right.

[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.040]
Jesus Christ, on the screen.

[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.920]
There was no heart she sees.

[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:19.980]
Jesus Christ, T.E.T.

[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.180]
Finally got her name in variety.

[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.720]
Jesus Christ, love is God.

[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.920]
Are you as well?

[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.360]
It's the same as you are.

[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:31.860]
Absolutely.

[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.980]
Love a 32 happy paysloth to all the Yiddloth out there.

[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.780]
Happy Easter to all the goyem.

[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.540]
And all the Muslims cut it out already.

[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:39.940]
Would you please?

[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.720]
513 votes on a pool.

[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.420]
Not too shabby.

[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.980]
We got the kind of a semblance of a show.

[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.040]
But this inspired me today.

[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:47.320]
I think the Beast had a good idea.

[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.160]
George wanted to.

[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.780]
The big one and two are with George Rodriguez.

[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.220]
He's getting paid the big bucks.

[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.200]
He can do an hour if he did.

[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.160]
It's good practice for the days when he has to like fillin'

[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.700]
like in July and August most days.

[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:00.940]
Yep.

[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.440]
When I'm doing those very difficult two day a week.

[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.780]
56670560.560 on the AT&T.

[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:09.040]
Boy, you're talking about red and dry.

[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:09.780]
But why not?

[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.640]
You know, they've expended all of their energy

[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.180]
getting all whipped up for the ball game today.

[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.020]
For opening day.

[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.860]
I think if 60,000 people are going to be there at P.P. Park today.

[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.380]
That's probably the entire town everybody's in town.

[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.600]
It's a skeleton crowd just like they're in the building.

[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:26.840]
Is there anybody in the building?

[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.400]
No one in the building.

[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.560]
Nobody in the building.

[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.680]
The carloas.

[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.820]
And the freaky carloas out front.

[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.060]
Oh god.

[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.160]
And like I said, no people out front.

[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.020]
And that's it.

[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.860]
Because everybody's over at the ballpark pretending to be big Marlins fans.

[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.320]
And I can understand it because it's in town where quite frankly is very, very boring.

[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.540]
I mean, you know, the sun is nice and the beach is in the water and the beach is in the water.

[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.920]
And the sun, but it's pretty boring.

[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:55.340]
And a whole lot of old people and a lot of people in real speaking English and a lot of illegal aliens just waiting for that driver's license.

[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.060]
So they get their 57 Chevy on the road.

[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.920]
And you know, what do you expect?

[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.320]
So here's it's opening day.

[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.060]
Wow. I don't really care about baseball.

[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.360]
I don't know what this team is.

[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.160]
But it's opening day. It's a happening.

[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.760]
It's something. Let's go.

[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.320]
Yeah. Let's get it in there.

[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.840]
Come in the QA and hello.

[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.300]
Legal aliens just waiting.

[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.700]
Yeah. Yes, sir.

[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:19.700]
It's 11.30 in the morning and I'm writing just a two mile backup on a turn bike for the for the Marlins game.

[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.520]
All right. How did it work?

[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.600]
I heard about phony, huh?

[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:24.520]
Yeah. Have a good time, Pally.

[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.720]
Two hour back, eight mile backup on a turn bike.

[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.280]
My suggestion is turn around and go home.

[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.620]
Well, that would be bad. Don't say that.

[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:34.940]
We want to get 80,000 people in there just like a dolphin game, right?

[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.220]
I think they open the upper deck.

[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:42.140]
They're opening up the upper deck. They're going to have people sitting up there with David Samson in a box in the sky box.

[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:46.020]
More Howard David is going to be there. He's going to kick what's his name.

[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.780]
I'd like to have mode to a ballgame. When you like him to a baseball game.

[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:50.400]
No. Why?

[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.700]
Oh, then I forgot that great hate.

[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.320]
I don't know. See, I don't think Zach hates Mo as much as you do.

[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.780]
Now, that would be an interesting conversation.

[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.680]
You know, huh? Which one of you hates him worse?

[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.640]
I do. I think Beast is up there.

[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.100]
Yeah.

[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:09.160]
Now, Zach, he's, Zach is more laid back. Zach is a little bit more, uh, although you know we haven't played today.

[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.800]
What? What's up?

[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.840]
And I'm not really sure. I haven't listened to any of the, uh, to see since we got the language police going.

[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:20.220]
I haven't checked out to see if you see all ratings for the last book.

[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.480]
Yeah, I know what's wrong with that is.

[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.780]
You could possibly be us.

[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.420]
Watch your back.

[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.240]
Zach, where you won't wait for no more.

[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:05.900]
Oh, brother, oh, that's love. I don't understand.

[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.900]
You can eat from a trough while you're in both ears.

[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.720]
That big, that's much you made a rating school.

[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.520]
You just like clipped and it's all your fault.

[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.040]
And a straight dip pat ass out of it.

[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.140]
Oh, I think the food outta you now.

[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:19.940]
That's right.

[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.700]
Listen what we say.

[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.800]
Make your back, Zach, where you want.

[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.480]
Wait for more, no more, no more.

[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.120]
No more, no more.

[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.260]
Watch your back, Zach, where you want.

[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.040]
Wait for more, no more.

[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.400]
Yeah, lucky you got a strap here.

[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.300]
And I want more time in your room.

[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:46.660]
No!

[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.480]
I love that. And there's no bad words that we had a bleep out in there either.

[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.060]
Nice. That was fantastic.

[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:57.180]
But even though it's now, of course the fact that we got Zach there and the beast is gone.

[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:00.500]
I'm glad I got both of you because the beast can override any lies that you might tell.

[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.720]
Now, the clearances are not there.

[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:02.440]
Where do we see it?

[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:06.520]
So we got nobody to hold your hand, twist your arm, put words in your mouth.

[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:11.900]
Now, when you left the Mohawar Davided show, it was mainly by his want you off of the show.

[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:12.940]
It was mutual.

[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:13.280]

[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.660]
See, he won't tell it true. Now, when the beast will tell us the real story.

[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:21.600]
Yeah.

[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.880]
I think both parties want to go in a different direction but more so for Mohaw.

[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.060]
Yeah.

[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:32.360]
But this business about, well, you know, Zach had this other job and all of this other stuff in his life.

[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.900]
And the meantime is right there 8 to 10 with Joe Rose, so anybody can see through that lie.

[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.160]
No, but I do have another job.

[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.780]
Yeah, see, have another job.

[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.620]
But in the meantime, you could have still been on there with Mohaw if he would have wanted you to be there.

[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:41.960]
Absolutely.

[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.340]
You wanted you out. Absolutely.

[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.960]
You had to be the scapegoat for his failures.

[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.540]
For that bad piece.

[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.240]
Probably your life is much better being off of it.

[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.580]
That's right. I'm curious about, I'm really curious about that because I'm not there most of the time.

[01:16:54.700 --> 01:17:00.500]
And I'm really curious about the 8 o'clock crossover when Joe Rose is standing there waiting to go in the crossover.

[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.000]
What crossover?

[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.720]
Huh? What crossover?

[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.300]
No, I don't mean crossover in terms of like we're used to where we'd be on each other's shows.

[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:12.160]
But I'm turning it in terms of the changing of the guard at 8 o'clock when Mohaw is going out and Joe is coming in and the beast also.

[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.180]
Usually it's, it's, it's Moh trying to talk to Joe and Joe ignoring Mohaw.

[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:16.900]
Really? Yeah.

[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:21.960]
So in other words, Mohaw again is extending the hand of friendship even after he bit it and chewed it and spat it out.

[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:24.660]
Like he tried with me.

[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:25.200]
Right.

[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:31.500]
See, this is a sad situation where you got a cranky, nasty, bitter old man who tries to get everybody can and just rips them and asks.

[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.560]
And then like, oh, well, you know, shake my hand.

[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.240]
It'll let's be friends now. Yeah, screw you, Moh.

[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.000]
Okay? You know what I mean? Absolutely.

[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:38.340]
Make me sick.

[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.200]
Anyway, see, that's one thing I'm not, all the way.

[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:47.000]
We'll come in early next week. I think what I'm going to do is take that muskrat hair piece that we have with our Lewis McGell's head and do like I always do.

[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:52.100]
I'll just sit there across from him from about 7.15 to 8 o'clock every morning when I'm there.

[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:56.020]
I'm staring at him, huh? Plus you'll get to meet our new producer, Shy.

[01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:58.700]
Yeah. Is he Shy? Oh, he's still there?

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]
Yeah, Shy from his friend.

[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.140]
He's coming in New York. Yeah.

[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.200]
Yeah, I can't believe he's still there.

[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.300]
The savior of the Messiah.

[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.220]
Here's where he'll have one bad trend. He'll be gone.

[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.540]
21 till noon at 5.60.

[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.260]
Boy, I've said it. The pressure is mounting now.

[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.040]
You can feel it. Can't you?

[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:12.800]
I have no life.

[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.860]
I mean, in Marlins and the X-Foes, what more could anybody want?

[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.440]
What's not to like opening day?

[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.000]
Oh, you can smell the hot dogs and the beer and the soda and you can smell all the other, the shoe leather and the other, the gloves and the...

[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.280]
Oh, God.

[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:26.720]
Plus cross straps.

[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.880]
I bet crows over there.

[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:29.980]
Goldie.

[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.660]
Isn't it time you call dial amateurs a 1-800-MATRUS?

[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.900]
Dial amateurs backs up everything they say in their advertising.

[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:37.440]
100% that their competitors still use lots of lies.

[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.960]
When you see a macro set making outrageous claims read the fine print.

[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.320]
There are lots of lies, lots of BS weight, not there.

[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:50.080]
Here's an example. In big print, the ad screen, no down payment, no interest, no payments for 24 months.

[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.160]
But the tiny print at the bottom reads like a encyclopedia disclaimers,

[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.780]
requires a minimum purchase higher than the advertised sell prices.

[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.980]
Many times not a single advertised item would qualify for even financing.

[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.000]
Interest penalties 21% or more.

[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.820]
Shoppers who need financing the most rarely qualify anyway.

[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.040]
Dial amateurs ads have no tiny print, no dislaimers, no lies, no BS.

[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:12.120]
When you call 1-800-MATRUS you discover there's never an after-charge for same-day delivery.

[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:18.280]
And dial amateurs take same-day delivery orders all day long from Kindle to Stewart, from Palm Beach to Fort Myers, even in Ojos.

[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.620]
When you call 1-800-MATRUS you pick the date and two-hour delivery window you want your mattress delivered.

[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:27.620]
So call now and see why 1-800-MATRUS is ranked the best in the universe in overall customer satisfaction.

[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.400]
And dial amateurs reminds you to read the fine print because they want you to know what you're buying,

[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.920]
even if you decide not to buy from them.

[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.560]
So do what I always do when all the smart shoppers do make the one easy call.

[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.820]
It's the easiest piece of shopping you'll ever do.

[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.380]
Just sit there on your fat ass and call 1-800-MATRUS and log onto their website, macrus.com.

[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:48.760]
Dial amateurs 1-800-MATR-ES, the honest way to buy you a great new bed.

[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.360]
I'm a man more.

[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.120]
This is 420-0-560-2AM.

[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:00.160]
But buy one with one of them. Give me another beer.

[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:03.780]
Ooooo!

[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:13.000]
Take me out to the Marlins.

[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.760]
Let me go get the crowd.

[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:20.960]
Yeah, who's those pickers and drunk and slabs?

[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:26.320]
30,000 who wheels will circumcise those they all.

[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:33.340]
Root-root like a bunch of pigs while we all root for our teeth.

[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.520]
They'll drink 8-9, 10 carts of beer in their penalties day.

[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.020]
Hey, great.

[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:49.020]
They'll drink 8-9, 10 carts of beer in their penalties day.

[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:52.920]
Ooooo!

[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:56.100]
11-43-17 away from Joe Zagaki.

[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.000]
Joe Zee, man, he is the best.

[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.840]
Joe Zagaki sucks, okay?

[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:00.420]
Okay.

[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:03.680]
He'll be out there at P.P. Park speaking of Pantaluni's P.P.

[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.360]
What are we going to get a name for that stadium?

[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.160]
I should ask.

[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.180]
I don't want him like starting trouble, but are we ever going to get a wheel off of the stadium?

[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.300]
Wayne refused to put it back to Joe Robbie.

[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.200]
He what?

[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.880]
Wayne is refusing to put it back to Joe Robbie.

[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.900]
He wouldn't want to do that because Joe Robbie paid for with his own money,

[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.840]
which is why his family is in hot to the rest of their lives.

[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.060]
But nevertheless, at least Joe said, he was a hard ass.

[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:25.980]
If you don't want to build it for me, I'll build it and then they will come, you know?

[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:30.100]
As opposed to Wayne who's like, oh, come on, either do it for me or I'm not going to play there.

[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:30.480]
That crap.

[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.460]
I'm going to play that bit again.

[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:33.880]
Wayne, you make us all sick, okay?

[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:37.860]
If you give these poor guys a better deal, these poor billionaire guys a better deal,

[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.620]
they wouldn't have to be begging for new stadium.

[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:43.020]
Just give them a little bit of the concession stuff and just cut the crap.

[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.100]
564 votes on the poll based on all that's happened.

[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:48.920]
What's your current take on the war?

[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.220]
The mess in Iraq, the atrocity, the psychotic crap.

[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.340]
It was based on lies and Bush had been impeached, 275,

[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:58.880]
2-3rd, 66.4% say that.

[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.320]
It was based on lies, period, 52, say that.

[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:06.340]
I think it had to be done, but was poorly planned about Fiddy say that.

[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:10.740]
Over 600 Americans have been sacrificed by the Bush crowd, 43.

[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:12.620]
What's that T on the end of over?

[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:13.580]
I just noticed they're Eric.

[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:17.700]
I don't want to start picking on Eric, but overt is that an overt act on your part Eric?

[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.560]
Oh, an overt mistake.

[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:25.260]
I supported 100% meaning the war, 36.3% very weak, and I'm not sure yet, still 10.

[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.980]
Still 10 around a way to the ballgame already fried.

[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.280]
But can you imagine how pickle they're going to be at that ballgame?

[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.680]
Man, they're going to be just...

[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:40.080]
566-705-60, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.000]
WQM, hello.

[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:41.860]
Not there.

[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:43.820]
WQM, hello.

[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.340]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.200]
Good morning.

[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:52.720]
An honor of opening day and how baseball was before weighing ruined it for me personally.

[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.780]
Could you play that play by play on the radio?

[01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.180]
Oh, I don't have a day.

[01:22:58.660 --> 01:22:59.760]
There used to be good enough.

[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:00.720]
Oh, you don't have it.

[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:01.260]
I love that.

[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.300]
I always give me goosebumps.

[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.880]
All right, well, maybe when you get back to town, it's a little bit...

[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.320]
We'll try to find it.

[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.360]
Thank you, Neil.

[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.080]
Have a great day.

[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.240]
We love the Marlins.

[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.480]
I mean, you could find it back there.

[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.800]
It's on a wall back there, but I don't want to make you stand up.

[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.140]
Well, it's a waste of a lot of energy.

[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.000]
I might burn off a couple of calories by standing up.

[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:26.280]
Plus, I don't think you're tall enough to find the find at this back there in a wall.

[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.640]
You know the one she's talking about?

[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.580]
Is it above 3 feet?

[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:31.240]

[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.860]
Which one's above 2 feet off the ground?

[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.640]
I think it's going to be able to find it.

[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:35.860]
Now, don't worry about it.

[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:36.880]
It's almost the end of the show.

[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.600]
She's very nice, but when she starts getting pushy, you know, it gets to be the end of the show.

[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:41.900]
Oh, can you find it?

[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:42.720]
No, we don't have it.

[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.060]
I mean, we do have it, but somewhere.

[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:45.640]
Look at that.

[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:46.820]
Blue Jays, maybe.

[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:47.560]
Nice start yesterday.

[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.840]
Blue Jays against the Tigers against the pathetic Tigers.

[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:50.960]
Final score, Detroit 7.

[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:51.480]
Blue Jays.

[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.020]
Nothing.

[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:52.860]
The big O.

[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:53.620]
Wow.

[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:57.100]
I sure hope that isn't a premonition, a predecessor for the Stanley Cup playoffs.

[01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:58.740]
Could happen.

[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.620]
Anything's possible.

[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.060]
Is anybody in South Florida?

[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:02.580]
Anybody?

[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:04.420]
Talking about Stanley Cup playoffs.

[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:04.920]
Huh?

[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:05.960]
Yeah.

[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.120]
Come on now.

[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:11.780]
Get one.

[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.420]
What is wrong with you people down there?

[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.620]
Is something wrong with that town?

[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.580]
Is something really, really wrong?

[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:17.720]
What do the Pethers play?

[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:19.160]
Let's do a hockey show.

[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:19.700]
What do you say?

[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:20.440]

[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:29.260]
And for Rise and Wireless Line, it's so sad.

[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.340]
Got some great series coming up.

[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.560]
Got somebody competitive.

[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:35.700]
Look at all the teams that had over 100 points in Eastern Conference alone, right?

[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.160]
Oh, sorry.

[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.100]
WQM, hello.

[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:41.760]
Yes, hello.

[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:42.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:45.160]
Hello.

[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:46.600]
Too slow for me, pal.

[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.200]
Have a nice day.

[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.380]
WQM, hello.

[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:50.220]
Neil, how are you doing?

[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:50.520]
Good morning.

[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:50.920]
Pretty good.

[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:53.960]
Sponey that you're talking about.

[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.720]
I'm talking about hockey there.

[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.460]
I don't know if you heard about this.

[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:00.700]
If it was called in the last couple of days, but on Sunday, looks like

[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:03.520]
guilty, levable profanity fly in the period break there.

[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:04.080]
Oh, no.

[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.860]
During the intermission there of the second.

[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.740]
Well, I don't want to hear the word.

[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:10.420]
Well, I'm not going to say it.

[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:14.720]
During the second and third period, I get all the production staff there got them with silly string.

[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.780]
And after it does this sign off, right after that, when the camera is still on, it turns around and says,

[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:20.960]
you have some guys.

[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:21.720]
Really?

[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:22.940]
He said it.

[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:28.420]
He means on the big thing there on the jumbo tron.

[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.440]
On the jumbo tron.

[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.940]
Whatever the call I'd write.

[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:33.600]
I'm about 99.99% sure that I'm there.

[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.160]
Oh, my God.

[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:37.280]
That might be the end of his broadcast where we'd have panther organizations.

[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:38.760]
They get wind of that.

[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:40.000]
With any luck.

[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.920]
So thanks for bringing that to their attention.

[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:42.540]
Thank you.

[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:43.140]
No problem.

[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.020]
And go lead.

[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.180]
Have a great day.

[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:45.700]
Go lead school.

[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:48.640]
Maybe Lisa and Ottawa start Thursday right at the air Canada Center.

[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.120]
Final score in the first game Toronto 5 out of a one.

[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:53.560]
Eddie.

[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:54.380]
Eddie.

[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.040]
Eddie.

[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:55.960]
I can just feel now, man.

[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.020]
This place is going to, this town is going to be on fire.

[01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:59.460]
They are going to be smoking.

[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.480]
See, that's a difference.

[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:02.480]
It's like that all the time.

[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.480]
It's not just this phony.

[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.820]
Well, it's opening day and we're all going to go out there.

[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.720]
Of course, you know, I'm, it's going to be, don't you think it's going to be real interesting to see tomorrow and Friday?

[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:12.800]
And Thursday, rather, how many people show up?

[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:14.780]
Yeah, obviously.

[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:17.840]
Because the expose are probably about the worst draw on the entire league.

[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.880]
I mean, nobody wants to see the expose even in Montreal.

[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.760]
They don't want to see him.

[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.240]
Even though they played pretty good most of the early part of the season last year.

[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.180]
But I mean, nobody wants to see them.

[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:25.620]
Right.

[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.300]
But there's no, there's no people from Montreal.

[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.160]
Thank goodness.

[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:29.740]
Right?

[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.440]
Still a few left over.

[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.280]
Few frogs.

[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:32.680]
Yeah.

[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.940]
They'll be their way of inner Montreal flags.

[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:37.660]
Drinkin' a lot of Pepsi's.

[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:41.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, POM 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.040]
Well, that's something about Jeff Rimmer.

[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.780]
I mean, Jeff Cohen, Rossin Guy.

[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.280]
Jeff Cohen called in earlier.

[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:46.580]
Yeah.

[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.280]
So for free plug.

[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.780]
I was surprised he hasn't brought you guys any months of pizza today.

[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.580]
Well, yeah, what's the deal with George?

[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:52.040]
He's in here.

[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.420]
Because you're both polishing.

[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:55.360]
You're both probably going to fade away by a noon.

[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.460]
I would think he's going to bring any food too late now, Jeff.

[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:58.780]
Maybe tomorrow for Zach.

[01:26:59.120 --> 01:26:59.680]
That would be nice.

[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:00.640]
Zach and Josh.

[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.100]
Because I don't think Zach's ever had that.

[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:03.100]
The beast, you don't need it.

[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:03.980]
We're trying to keep your ass alive.

[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:04.520]
I won't be here.

[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.340]
I know.

[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.800]
I'm saying we're trying to keep your ass alive.

[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.860]
That's why I'm saying not today.

[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:08.980]
WQM, hello.

[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:10.280]
Yes, man.

[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.060]
I took to Neil Pley.

[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:11.780]
Speaking, sir.

[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.380]
Oh, Neil, how are you?

[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:13.900]
Pretty good.

[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.680]
Happy, uh...

[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.060]
Stuck us.

[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:16.560]
Pass over.

[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:17.860]
Happy issue, boys.

[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.600]
Neil, you remember I don't got you hot down there.

[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.440]
I don't know if you've got plans anymore about the baseball manager.

[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:27.780]
That's talking about the play years on the...

[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.240]
Oh, no, Jenny, I know that one.

[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:29.900]
We can't play that.

[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.520]
Yeah, because there was only one with a...

[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.520]
Every other word was a...

[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:35.060]
Yes, right.

[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.540]
Too bad, well.

[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.360]
It was a bad, too bad.

[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:37.360]

[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:38.540]
It was a bad, too bad.

[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:39.760]
I'm, uh...

[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:40.820]
I've written to, uh...

[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.620]
Just about everybody, uh...

[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:44.800]
I can get to about it.

[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.400]
I think, uh...

[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.500]
I'm going to get some answers back.

[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.400]
If not, then I think I'll get the vote for me.

[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:49.820]
Hold your breath, man.

[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:50.520]
Hold your breath.

[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.080]
Okay.

[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:52.700]
Well...

[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.100]
Good work, honey.

[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.160]
Good luck to us, man.

[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:55.800]
Thanks for trying.

[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.440]
I'll see you on a boat.

[01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:58.880]
Is that guy a treadmill?

[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.820]
Freedom of speech is dead, baby.

[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.340]
Freedom of speech is finito.

[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:02.820]
Let's see.

[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.020]
Hey, it says this facts.

[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.060]
And so I watched Bremer and his thugs.

[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.600]
I have to laugh when he and Bushy describe what's going on in Iraq.

[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.200]
I don't laugh.

[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:09.900]
I want to cry.

[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:10.640]
It's not funny.

[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.420]
When they see things like these thugs and the dead enders,

[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.640]
every cliche and phrase this administration puts out

[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.140]
to describe who and what's happening.

[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:20.120]
Have they been watching the same thing we watch or read?

[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.100]
See, if you'd watched the BBC, in fact,

[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.420]
I could put the BBC on right now,

[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:24.740]
but they probably cut me off the ear.

[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.080]
I mean, then you'll see what the news is really all about.

[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:27.720]
What's really happening?

[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:28.640]
The speech is a lot of countries.

[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.980]
All democracy is a very, very long process.

[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:32.840]
Very, very long.

[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.440]
That's what he said.

[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.460]
He said it's very, very long.

[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.960]
We should probably should have bleep that.

[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.680]
Because we don't know what he's talking about.

[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:38.680]
We said it's very, very long.

[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:39.340]
See?

[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.200]
It says, if this turnover happens on a 30th,

[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.200]
Bremer should turn over 10 bodyguards he travels with

[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.180]
because everything will be just fine on that day, right?

[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.240]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.780]
And it says, take care, Pally.

[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.220]
I wonder who this is from, Pally.

[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:52.220]
Hi, Pally.

[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.960]
The worst news I have for the audience is that Jeff Hyfe,

[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:57.880]
aka Fatboy, was bouncing around there

[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.380]
with his 800 pounds in shorts.

[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:00.420]
Hi, Pally.

[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.960]
In honor of the Marlon opening day that the entire sales department's over there.

[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:05.560]
Everybody works in a building and so on.

[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:09.040]
What a phony, phony bunch of really...

[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.620]
Oh, God.

[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.260]
It's just a minute.

[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:15.180]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.780]
No, because they're going to go over there and suck down the free booze, the free food.

[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.240]
Any chance that any of these people have to get out of this building they go?

[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:23.800]
Any excuse.

[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.700]
No, it's a matter of fact, just to show you what a dedicated employee I am.

[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.180]
What a real...

[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:30.380]
I'm going to stay here till two.

[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:30.900]
I'm going to...

[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.180]
You know what you won't be hearing me.

[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:32.880]
Well, you could hear me.

[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:34.480]
I'm going to stay until two.

[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.420]
Do you believe me?

[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:36.980]
No.

[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:37.620]
Oh.

[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.280]
Maybe on the internet.

[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:39.960]
No.

[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:44.360]
I tell you the day that Thorella and I did that hour on the internet when he was pointing the

[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:45.080]
trance hole and all.

[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:45.380]
Goodness.

[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.800]
That was great stuff, man.

[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.960]
Every other word was...

[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:48.420]
One of those.

[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.400]
That was classic.

[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:54.620]
That one only was a classic, but that's the kind of radio that the public really wants to hear.

[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.840]
A Michael Powell and Michael Cops and all you other lunatics, you fascist, you Nazi bastards, you...

[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.300]
That's what the public wants to hear.

[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.860]
It's funny, it's amusing, but the sense of humor is gone.

[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:06.500]
I see their owner.

[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.080]
It's done for Perrine and Tristan.

[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.420]
It appears to the Perrine and Tritia.

[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:10.980]
There might be a kid in the car.

[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:13.400]
See a flash of a booby for a half a second.

[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:14.260]
Oh my God.

[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.260]
We're going to go to Hell in a hand basket now.

[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.720]
A Tisca de Taskin.

[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:18.800]
He said something about a basket.

[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.360]
He's fired.

[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:20.000]
Yeah.

[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:21.040]
Wow.

[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:23.300]
Anyway, it's 11.53.

[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.220]
Marlon, man.

[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.180]
The pressure is...

[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:25.880]
I'm almost ready.

[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.080]
I'll just let a big one out now.

[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:27.720]
Why?

[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:28.940]
In local.

[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:31.400]
We're sports video fights in the US.

[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:32.900]
You AM.

[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:35.880]
On the whole investigation.

[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:36.940]
The children.

[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:37.680]
The children.

[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:38.460]
More than that.

[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:38.860]
The children.

[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:39.700]
The children.

[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.180]
More than that.

[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:41.580]
The children.

[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:41.780]

[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:41.900]

[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:42.900]
The children.

[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:43.760]
More than that.

[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:44.300]
The children.

[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:45.800]
More than that.

[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:45.800]

[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:46.900]
More than that.

[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:47.620]
The children.

[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:47.620]

[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:48.200]
The children.

[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:48.840]

[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:48.900]
The children.

[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:48.900]

[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:49.040]
The children.

[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:49.560]
More than that.

[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:50.580]
The children.

[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.220]
More than that.

[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.220]
The children.

[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.900]
More than that.

[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:57.580]
The children.

[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:57.580]

[01:30:58.340 --> 01:30:58.820]
The children.

[01:30:58.820 --> 01:30:59.040]
More than that.

[01:30:59.460 --> 01:30:59.460]

[01:30:59.460 --> 01:30:59.820]
More than that.

[01:30:59.820 --> 01:30:59.820]

[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:01.660]
More than that.

[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:02.360]

[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.220]
More than that.

[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:06.200]
The children.

[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.740]
More than that.

[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:13.280]
More than that.

[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:13.820]
More than that.

[01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:15.360]
More than that.

[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:15.580]
More than that.

[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:15.580]

[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:15.580]

[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:15.580]

[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:15.580]

[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:15.580]

[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:16.040]
This is Queen.

[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.200]
Michael Powell won a nowhere to move that.
