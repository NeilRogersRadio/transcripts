[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]
Hey Joe, quick dance like a mean guy most of you are a mean man.

[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.800]
Tell me you two a.m. my daddy Ford Lutter J.

[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.880]
Quick be in an old mini Joe, come on.

[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.200]
Yes, he see.

[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.400]
What word did you say?

[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.700]
What word did you say?

[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.980]
What word did you say?

[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.520]
Yes, he see.

[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.440]
Oh, right.

[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.280]
No hands.

[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.040]
There's no need to feel down or have no feet.

[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.780]
But you can touch the ground a new eyeball.

[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.260]
So put your glass eyeball down.

[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.380]
There's a place you can be.

[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.540]
Happy ladders.

[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.080]
There's a special today for some fingers.

[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.800]
It's double to one day if you're buying.

[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.320]
Less than ten parts you'll find.

[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.040]
You can use their new express line.

[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.040]
Four, four, four, four, four, four.

[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.640]
Take silver body parts and you'll see L.A.

[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.420]
Take silver body parts and you'll see L.A.

[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.220]
Play have everything from a thumb to a jaw.

[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.000]
All you need is your own dog.

[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.800]
You get your body parts and you'll see L.A.

[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.520]
All sorts of body parts and you'll see L.A.

[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.240]
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.360]
You can get a new heart even ain't all the parts.

[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.280]
You can put it on your credit card.

[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.500]
It's 10.02 at WQAM on Monday.

[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.360]
If the beat goes on, baby, we can't say squad.

[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.780]
We can squad little bit but can we say it?

[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.100]
No.

[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.320]
It is just amazing what's going on.

[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.380]
Friday, there was like a little light bulb that went off

[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.300]
over the top of my head.

[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.420]
I'm standing there taking a leak.

[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.160]
Can we say that?

[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.420]
No.

[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740]
Taking a ****** P going.

[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.060]
Of course, my little bathroom, my second bathroom,

[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.500]
is only a few feet away from this lovely little studio.

[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.140]
I'm playing that dolphin song, a KJ dolphin song

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.860]
that everybody loves about the dolphins' stink and this and that.

[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.240]
In the middle of it, he says 50,000 ****** bull sitting in the stands

[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.840]
and I thought, oh no.

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.020]
Now, Georgia, of course, being Johnny on a spot

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.860]
and being Panicky as he should be, dumped it.

[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.960]
Right, I think.

[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.860]
Well, I'm pressing the dump button just to reactably.

[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.080]
Just for the hell of it, just to make sure.

[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.460]
Right, like every 15 seconds of it.

[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.720]
Right, just to make darn sure that nothing bad gets on the air.

[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.580]
Oh, listen.

[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.280]
I know.

[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.760]
I find out this morning that the elistice is growing

[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.540]
and of course they don't want to give us any specifics.

[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.440]
Well, you give it a shot.

[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.400]
Take your best shot and then we'll let you know afterward

[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.840]
whether you said something bad or not.

[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.720]
Anybody who really believes there's free speech in America anymore,

[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.380]
you're crazy.

[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.620]
You have to, you're suitable.

[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.660]
You need to be in a rubber room somewhere.

[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.360]
You can't say squat.

[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.620]
So the new deal is we can't say G-Damn.

[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.420]
I don't know how else to, how else to phrase it.

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.820]
We can't say God ******.

[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.240]
We can say God bless America.

[00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.960]
But that's the newest one.

[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.840]
We're still trying to get a ruling.

[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.420]
They're having a confab somewhere.

[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.400]
We're having a ruling on crap.

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.440]
Can we say crap?

[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.020]
As of now, we can still say crap.

[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.040]
Now that bit that we have by Bob and Tom,

[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.820]
head shampoo, I don't think we can only say head if you're going to go.

[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.440]
I don't think we can say it under any circumstances.

[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.540]
No.

[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.680]
If you're going to go take a leak like I said before and go to the head.

[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.040]
No.

[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.300]
Or he's got a good head on his shoulders.

[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.020]
Can we say that?

[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.920]
You have to say dog in it.

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.100]
Head in shoulders if we had an advertising for that.

[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.780]
See just like that farting horse and a super bowl commercial.

[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.280]
If there's money to be made, then you can say whatever you want.

[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.980]
And it's okay.

[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.200]
I thought there was money to be made.

[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.280]
What? In crap?

[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.460]
In, yeah, insane crap.

[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.880]
Well, look at what we're doing.

[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.440]
Here's the poll result from Friday, 20, 475 votes.

[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.440]
Damn, they're 20, darn, they're 2500 votes.

[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.400]
We can still say damn.

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.020]
We just can't say damn.

[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.640]
G-damn.

[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.240]
Which of these people places are by the way, Ariel Shiro and nice job on our road map sweetheart.

[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.160]
He's doing it, isn't he?

[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.860]
Oh, man.

[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.760]
Look at him.

[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.760]
And now they warned us today that they're so whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.020]
They want his head on a plate.

[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.860]
Oh, I'd pay money to see that.

[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.820]
Or it'd be a kosher plate?

[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.980]
I don't know, but it'd be a hell of a big head.

[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.740]
It's a good thing they don't want his whole body on a plate, man.

[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.960]
Woo!

[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.000]
I think they have to use a platter.

[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.660]
Which of these people places or businesses do you think is the most overrated, mostly hype we asked in our poll?

[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.880]
George W. Bush, 446.

[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.240]
And Richard Clark says he's a freaking liar.

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.880]
A freaking effing liar is what he said about El Presidente.

[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.540]
Howard Stern, 281.

[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.100]
Ah.

[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.800]
Joe's, I can still do that as of now.

[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.900]
Now, tomorrow I'm not too sure.

[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.000]
We're going to get some more clarification for him.

[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.100]
Just wait, pervote.

[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.860]
Joe Stone crab 209.

[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.720]
Parasultant 172, Russell Mball 158.

[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.660]
South Beach, overrated 150.

[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.260]
Ronnie Ray Gunn, 82, Walmart 80.

[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.640]
Walmart, number one on the Fortune 500.

[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.080]
Biggest, uh, most, uh, grave robbing business in the world.

[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.280]
Larry King, 78.

[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.140]
Disney 70, Rosio Donald 65.

[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.280]
Rikki Tiki, Sanchez 64.

[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.440]
The Outback Steakhouse 60.

[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.780]
I'm surprised it's such open hostility at the Outback, right?

[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.960]
Benefit 51.

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.280]
Donald Trump 49, Planet Hollywood 49, Hard Rock Cafe 41.

[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.800]
The Rascal House 38.

[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.560]
Alex Pinellas 37.

[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.200]
Saga Rasmills Malt 36, Jimmy Buffon 36, Alien Gonzalez, Alien Edo 35.

[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.320]
Podcasted in over 34.

[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.700]
Simon Cowell 26, WQAM 25.

[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.760]
The Bahamas 23, Smith and Walensky 17, the Swap Shop 16.

[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.120]
Niagara Falls 13, Bayside 11, Chuck E. Cheese 11, George Lucas 9,

[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.940]
and the Sequoia coming in last place, pulling up by the rear head three.

[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.440]
For the Miami Sequoia.

[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.460]
So that's quite a list of places that people think are highly overrated.

[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.700]
That whole state of mind thing, you know what we left off at the Forge?

[00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.680]
The Forge on the Beach?

[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.140]
You're right.

[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.500]
It's another state of mind.

[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.020]
I mean, if you don't know anybody in there to Schmir, if you don't know the Major D,

[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.420]
they sit you in that room way in the back.

[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.660]
The one where a few people got shot.

[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.500]
No, I think it was in the front that got shot.

[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.440]
But at any rate, they sit you way there in the back.

[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.840]
And the service is just pathetic because they figure out some kind of a schlepper

[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.080]
that shouldn't be there in the first place.

[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.380]
And then when you get those, those microwave potatoes, that's the best.

[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.220]
What are they?

[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.920]
This was years ago, many years ago, maybe they really butched up the rack, do you think?

[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.380]
No.

[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.380]
Hamas teed killed an airstrike as the Israelis once again,

[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.700]
Ariel Shiroin opens up the floodgates of hell.

[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.520]
That's what the Arabs are saying today.

[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.000]
Sheik Ahmed Yasin, the spiritual group of,

[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.700]
spiritual head of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, was killed.

[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.420]
He was butchered, smashed to smithereens and an Israeli airstrike.

[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.020]
He was targeted as he returned from a mosque in Gaza City at daybreak.

[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.120]
Reports that he was being pushed in his wheelchair when he was directly hit by a missile.

[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.780]
Good hit, by the way, but not the, not good timing.

[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.400]
Two bodyguards and one of his sons were reported to be among those killed.

[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.700]
At least 15 people were wounded.

[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.320]
Those pain in the ass bystanders.

[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.080]
Can we say ass?

[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.280]
No.

[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.800]
Oh, sorry.

[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.560]
Oh.

[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.920]
Well, let me ask you about that.

[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.980]
At the funeral procession in Gaza City,

[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.200]
mourners jostled the touch Yasin's coffin,

[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.500]
which was draped in a green Hamas flag.

[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.700]
Gunman wearing Hamas headbands fired shots in the air,

[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.960]
kind of like in Halea.

[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.140]
They said today they killed an Islamic symbol,

[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.000]
and now they're saying every house in Israel will be a house of death.

[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.000]
They're saying they're pledging that the stuff is really going to hit the fan now,

[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.700]
and they want Ariel Shiroin's head on a plate.

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.460]
I didn't make that up.

[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.560]
That's what they're saying.

[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.280]
You know them?

[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.960]
Yeah, them.

[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.440]
They're saying so the entire Arab world,

[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.180]
even those people that weren't all that crazy about Hamas in the first place,

[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.220]
they're all like bonding together now.

[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.160]
So Shiroin is doing for the militants in the Middle East.

[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.380]
He's doing for them what Bush did for Osama Yamanah.

[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.600]
Right.

[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.280]
I'll go ahead and attack Iraq and just turn the whole Arab world against you

[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.080]
and just turn the Iraq into a hotbed of terrorism.

[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.720]
So I didn't watch Richard Clark.

[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.180]
I had the audio on tape, which we will play today from CBS to 60 minutes.

[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.720]
So I guess that you know, Paul O'Neill and Richard Clark,

[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.400]
all of these people, they just want to sell a book.

[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.200]
Isn't that must be it?

[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.900]
Yeah, that's what the right Wimmers will tell you.

[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.240]
Oh, they're just making it up.

[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.880]
Look at the timing.

[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.900]
His book is coming out today.

[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.920]
They just want to sell a book.

[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.440]
Hey.

[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.840]
What's the job in the Caribbean?

[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.180]
Right.

[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.160]
That must be it.

[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.340]
In connection with Richard Clark,

[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.440]
well, let me first give you the pool today.

[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.160]
Let's hop right on that.

[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.320]
With all the FCC crap going on,

[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.160]
and of course it's a good thing that we can still say crap as of today.

[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.240]
I mean, maybe tomorrow we couldn't take this pool.

[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.080]
Hey, we could have a, uh...

[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.660]
We have to say tomorrow with all the FCC stuff going on.

[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.440]
But being a vulgarant or potty mouth,

[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.160]
I just can't, I can't say stuff.

[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.400]
You know, when I want to say crap,

[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.580]
we should make it the word of the day while we can say it.

[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:01.900]
Right.

[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:02.500]
That's right.

[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.180]
When I want to say crap, I don't say stuff.

[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.200]
Like, I'm going to go take a stuff until we can't say that.

[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.100]
With all the FCC crap going on,

[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.200]
Neal should, and I've got five choices on here,

[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.740]
and I've, did I leave anything obvious out?

[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.420]
I don't, I don't know what the other options are.

[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.020]
Nothing obvious.

[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.320]
Retire!

[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.560]
Keep going as Vestikhan.

[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.460]
Just keep ripping bush and ass.

[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.400]
See now we can still say ass today.

[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.700]
Play music, or go back to all bedtime stories.

[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.380]
Those are the five choices on the pool today.

[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.540]
Daisy Fuentes behind the Beated Curtain today,

[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.380]
if you're over the age of 80.

[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.300]
And you swear I never look at it again.

[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.380]
Daisy Fuentes.

[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.780]
And like I told you,

[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.480]
when you click out of that Beated Curtain thing there on our website,

[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.400]
be sure and keep your eye on John Ascrot's eyes.

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.140]
They're moving around.

[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.720]
He's monitoring you.

[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.560]
Newsweek magazine has learned that in the months before 9-11,

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.260]
the US Justice Department curtailed a highly classified program called

[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.220]
Catchersmit to monitor Alcatas suspects in the US

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.020]
after a federal judge severely chanced eyes the FBI

[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.300]
for improperly seeking information of our type terrorists.

[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.640]
During the Bush administration's first few months in AuraFist,

[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.020]
Attorney General John Ascrot downgraded terrorism as a priority,

[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.680]
choosing to place more emphasis on drug trafficking and gun violence,

[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.180]
report investigative correspondent Michael Isacoff

[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.880]
and assistant managing editor Evan Thomas in this week's

[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.140]
Mark Twainon issue of Newsweek, which is on the newsstands today.

[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.060]
Let me say it again, Ascrot wanted more emphasis on drug trafficking

[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.320]
and gun violence to that they didn't put a rush in the slammer.

[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:28.960]
That would have been good.

[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.460]
Popping all them oxies.

[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.460]
Oh, brother.

[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.720]
They sure had their priorities, right?

[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.620]
And of course, they also left out of this to show you how that liberal media

[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.420]
is covering things up again, covering up naked statues and drug trafficking.

[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.240]
You know what I mean?

[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.280]
All of these things.

[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:43.820]
That's right.

[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.320]
You know what this is like a dream.

[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.260]
This is like a nightmare that never ends.

[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.800]
We're going along, singing a song, doing our thing all of these years.

[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.280]
And then all of a sudden, like, oh, when you can't do this anymore,

[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.140]
and you sure can't do that, and you can't say this,

[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.280]
and everybody's getting fined and suspended and fired left and right.

[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.420]
And the public is like, we're like, we're like that.

[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.380]
Just like that.

[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.620]
And the mainstream media, other than 60 minutes,

[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.600]
the mainstream media is just going on with their agenda,

[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.420]
just bringing that cash register,

[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.480]
making as much money as they can, and that's it.

[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.820]
I'll guarantee you, I'll guarantee you,

[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.880]
that if it was CNN they were after for some crap they put on the air,

[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.840]
or for some stuff they put on the air,

[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.880]
then all of a sudden you'd be seeing, oh, my goodness,

[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.960]
they're after us, they're freedom of speech is gone,

[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160]
and what are we going to do about this?

[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.380]
They'd be screaming around the clock 24-7.

[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.580]
But they're not.

[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.760]
And they're sure not after Fox News, although,

[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.120]
see what I'm thinking is that maybe some people

[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.040]
ought to start protesting, just like the student people

[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.660]
are protesting Oprah, which will get to that.

[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.240]
Start protesting all those racey shows on the Fox Entertainment Network

[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.380]
as opposed to the Fox Right-Wing News Network, right?

[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.080]
What goes around, comes around.

[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.580]
And see just how many fines they get,

[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.740]
and how many licenses they lose at Fox,

[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.880]
for all of that unacceptable left-wing,

[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.540]
commie, pinko, radical, rabid, homo, stuff that they put on Fox Entertainment,

[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.660]
so they can make the money to fund Rupert Murdoch's Right-Wing Agenda.

[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.980]
Anyway, and you catch my drift so far?

[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:15.940]
No, repeat it.

[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.460]
I'm drifting.

[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.400]
10-13 at 5-60 WQM, you're on...

[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.740]
Unbelievable station for the new millennium.

[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.240]
Hey, listen, we just can't say nothing no more.

[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.760]
And we got to look at the front page article

[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.800]
from Saturday Sunset, known by Little Tom Jicke,

[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.000]
which, Tommy, you know, see, this is one of the reasons

[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.320]
I don't like doing those things no more,

[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.160]
is because Tom means well, and I appreciate the coverage of the issue,

[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.860]
and the stop FCC.com plug in his other story.

[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.360]
But at least get it right.

[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.480]
I didn't say QAM has stripped my this and taken away.

[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.260]
I said, based on the FCC, vagueness and rulings now,

[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.960]
I can't play all of this stuff no more.

[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.500]
But he puts it in such a term to kind of create

[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.040]
like an adversarial relationship,

[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.720]
which we already have on of those anyway.

[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.020]
Get it right, Tom. But thanks anyway.

[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.840]
10-13 at QAM, hey, if you're fat as a cow,

[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.080]
and just about everybody in their brother in America is,

[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.220]
balance for life isn't tough to stick to

[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.820]
like most of those other so-called diets,

[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.980]
because balance for life is the premier meal delivery service

[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.020]
based on the zone diet by Dr. Berry Sears,

[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.360]
and they deliver all that delicious prepared food

[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.140]
right to your doorstep,

[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.280]
I'm not talking about prefabricated garbage,

[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.100]
no crap in your little sack.

[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.460]
Three delicious fresh meals, two snacks every single day.

[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.780]
So with all of that food, five feedings a day,

[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.320]
you can't really say you're on a diet.

[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.860]
So try for yourself the real meal service that delivers

[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.360]
results based on the zone diet,

[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.860]
and don't settle for imitations.

[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.460]
Imagine there's no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning,

[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.180]
no calorie counting, not even any carbohydrate counting,

[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.660]
and people on balance for life are losing an average

[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.520]
of 12 to 18 pounds a month.

[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.760]
The zone diet's been proven to lower diabetes,

[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.560]
high cholesterol and high blood pressure too.

[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.440]
I think what they mean is lower your blood sugar,

[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.320]
is what they're saying.

[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.040]
I don't know how you lower diabetes.

[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.420]
And now if you ever wanted to try the South Beach diet,

[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.580]
here's your chance, balance for life is the closest thing you'll ever find

[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.560]
because balance for life is the only meal delivery company

[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.840]
that offers you menu choices that lets you go from phase one to phase three

[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.440]
of the anxious South Beach diet.

[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.580]
So feel the difference, see the results on the scale just about right away.

[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.780]
If you're frustrated, if you're fat, it's unhealthy.

[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.960]
Trust me, do it before you become diabetic.

[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.640]
Believe me, if I ever told you anything true,

[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.080]
that's the true right there.

[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.740]
Call them toll free, one, eight, six, six, two, two, five,

[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.960]
forty, five, forty, three.

[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.940]
That's one, eight, six, six, two, two, five, forty, five, forty, three.

[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.580]
Or check out their website, balanceforlife.com.

[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.420]
My life and love.

[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.780]
This is for trail by city.

[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.040]
We will you a-

[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.520]
I will start with your Gothamers book.

[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.960]
Freedom's day, freedom's day, let's bury our heads.

[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.200]
Oh, freedom's day, freedom's day, let's bury our heads.

[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.520]
That's a good one.

[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.260]
This room we're in, okay?

[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.200]
It's very scary, but...

[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.800]
I'm going to say that's very happy.

[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.320]
OK.

[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.720]
Stop MCC.com.

[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.860]
We're doing really well on there.

[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.300]
Florida is a very strong current effect.

[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.380]
We're right on California's ass at the moment.

[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.880]
We're making some big move in there.

[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.620]
In fact, I just took a look at it.

[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.600]
I see your boy Miguel sign on there.

[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:39.900]
It's good.

[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.820]
Should I put that on here?

[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:41.560]
Yeah.

[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:41.820]
Yeah.

[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.220]
No, he came in to say, hey, I just

[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.000]
signed the thing.

[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.840]
Go look and see if my name is.

[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.240]
Nice going.

[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.540]
Miguel, of course, that means he's

[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.380]
going to fall out of favor in the Hispanic community,

[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.960]
although probably not because even our good

[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.220]
close personal friend over there at the most

[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.360]
speaking English station, Joe Ferrero, at Arreo L. Sol.

[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.780]
Please quote in this time, Jake article two.

[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.200]
I'll get to the article in a whole bunch of stuff.

[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.660]
Then we got the audio from the Richard.

[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.860]
I don't know whether we really need to play that.

[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.840]
Don't you think everybody saw 60-minute signs of that?

[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.300]
No, I know.

[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.300]
We really need to play that.

[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.480]
I'm just, it just did joke.

[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.460]
Just for a little facts.

[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.240]
Here's a little tease.

[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.600]
Right now.

[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.820]
See, there you go.

[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:15.700]
No, no.

[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.440]
Really, why they had you right?

[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.860]
Why they had a lightweight life?

[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.420]
Leslie Stahl, do that piece.

[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.700]
I mean, it's like the future of the world

[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.740]
is hinging into balance.

[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.220]
And they've got Leslie Stahl, who's

[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.340]
OK like maybe doing cooking recipes

[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.660]
or reviewing Martha Stewart.

[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.320]
Humanity.

[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.720]
I mean, oh, she is so embarrassingly juvenile

[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.100]
and so soft and morick.

[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.680]
She's weak.

[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.280]
Weak.

[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.260]
That was one for Mike Wallace to be doing.

[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.320]
Or Ed Bradley.

[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.720]
Or also, yeah, Bradley.

[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:41.960]
Huh?

[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.320]
Yeah, Ed would have been great.

[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.200]
Yeah, that would have been a dynamite

[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.260]
with a little earring in the mirror.

[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.780]
But anyway, it's nice going, Miguel.

[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.560]
Don't I'm telling you right now.

[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.100]
And please don't take this lightly.

[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.760]
And there are going to be some people say,

[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.660]
well, you know, they're going to get a few thousand signatures.

[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.500]
And what do I mean?

[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.300]
We got almost 67,000 signatures on there now.

[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.960]
Those are friends, Scott up there in New York.

[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.060]
I'm stock SCC.com.

[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.540]
And if some stuff are grandizing pompous fools on a year,

[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.920]
would spend more time promoting that thing instead of just

[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.040]
making a link on their websites.

[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.180]
We'd have hundreds of thousands already.

[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.100]
You need to get together with Eric.

[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:17.700]
OK.

[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:17.760]
OK.

[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.120]
No, listen to me.

[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:19.400]
OK.

[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.140]
Whoa.

[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.380]
No, I'm serious.

[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.160]
Remember the So far campaign I did an I&Z many years ago,

[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.600]
SOFAR, save our first amendment rights.

[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.120]
We need to rekindle that only for the purpose of raising some money.

[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.900]
We need to get together with Eric and maybe even Norma Kent.

[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.780]
Because what we did was we have to create a corporation.

[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:38.540]
OK.

[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.040]
Because I don't want people sending in checks made up to me.

[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.040]
That's bad.

[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.840]
In fact, we got enough, I might just leave.

[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:49.120]
No, seriously, in set up a corporation like that, not for profit.

[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.220]
And then take the money and buy ads.

[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.220]
And I'm talking in the next month within the next month.

[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.620]
And buy ads in like I'm thinking you want to say today.

[00:17:59.300 --> 00:17:59.540]
OK.

[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.560]
I'm telling you where else I might even think about putting on.

[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.600]
I know this is disgusting, but you know, on the Fudge report

[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.240]
on that website, with all the people that view that every day

[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.680]
and put the banner up there, stop SCC.com.

[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.440]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:11.760]
I do.

[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.040]
So you and Eric need to brainstorm that.

[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.840]
Because I don't have the, yeah, I'll be more than happy

[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.120]
to make a nice donation to start it like a grand or a couple

[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:20.980]
of grand and some like that.

[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.300]
But if we can raise maybe like 50 grand,

[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.280]
and then we need to find out what the rates are like in USA

[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.820]
today and L, New York Times.

[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]
That's what we did before.

[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.380]
Only this would be just for the purpose

[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.920]
of promoting the message that's on here on this website.

[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.960]
And then the actual website itself, stop SCC.com.

[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.220]
So we can get that million signatures.

[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.660]
Because at the rate we're going now, it's going to take months

[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.080]
and months and months to get to a million.

[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.360]
Because there just isn't enough publicity for this thing.

[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.880]
I think I read somewhere that our bell promoted over the weekend

[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.760]
on his show, but most of his people are on that new planet.

[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.700]
That's the problem.

[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.740]
Takes a long time for their messages to get here.

[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.980]
But stop and think about one other fact

[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.120]
that it makes it so difficult.

[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.100]
If you're working for a cheap channel,

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.440]
if you're on one of their stations,

[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.800]
are you going to go on here and promote stop SCC.com?

[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.720]
No way, Jose, I don't think so.

[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.340]
Not unless you think you can sneak your signature on there.

[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.000]
You're not going to find out about it.

[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.780]
See what I mean?

[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.420]
But if you're like a well-known personality,

[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.800]
I'm one of the cheap channel stations,

[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.440]
you're not going to go on here and promote stop SCC.com.

[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.220]
Even though you should, because that would,

[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.520]
they're cropping people who have a nervous,

[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.720]
they'd have a cow is what they've had.

[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.960]
Here's the fact that this is last week I fact you're stating

[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.480]
was ironic you could say G-Damn, but not other words.

[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.060]
Yeah, last week we could say the whole thing.

[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.900]
Now I can only say G-Damn.

[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.060]
Gee.

[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.520]
I guess the Bible thumpers woke up.

[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.540]
He said, now it's got nothing to do with the Bible thumpers.

[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.580]
It's got to do with our corporate attorneys over there

[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.920]
in Fort Myers, Naples, where we're going to hang it out in the

[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.340]
Rangia.

[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.480]
Says, Doc, shall I use the Lord's name in a van?

[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.320]
Neil, Vey, Neil God, oops, oops, Neil God.

[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:00.980]
Neil God.

[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.460]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.200]
Neil God.

[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.020]
Cut it out.

[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.160]
When and doubt, cut it out.

[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.580]
Tom Jicker writes on Saturday on the front page of the

[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.140]
Sun Sentinel.

[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.920]
Thanks again, Tom, but next time get it right.

[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.520]
I just don't like being misquoted.

[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.240]
He did that to me twice.

[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.460]
He did that in the first article.

[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.280]
And then he did it to me again.

[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:28.360]
And I'd never said that, well, forget about it, that this QAM

[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.700]
has stripped mine my occasionally risque program.

[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.140]
Does that sound like what I would say?

[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.140]
No.

[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.080]
First of all, QAM doesn't have enough smarts to figure out.

[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.660]
I mean, we've got 5,000 comedy bits in here.

[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.220]
Do you think that they went through the thing and no?

[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.620]
No.

[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.240]
It's just based on what the FCC rulings are right now and based

[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.880]
on the corporate interpretations of same, which were desperately

[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.040]
trying to get some clarification.

[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.360]
It's a hell of a deal.

[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.120]
All you people listening to me right now, when you go to work

[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.800]
every day, you have to beg your employer to say, to tell you what it

[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.420]
is that you can do and you can't do.

[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.740]
Like if you drive a cab.

[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.420]
OK, boss, how fast can I drive today?

[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.900]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:07.720]
I would say.

[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.640]
About 30, man.

[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.000]
Yeah, even on I-75 or the 30.

[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.000]
Because there's no stop signs.

[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.640]
Well, we're in the same pickle here now.

[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.620]
The FCC's got these vague and ambiguous rulings

[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.820]
they're making up as they go along.

[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.300]
You're be data, curtail freedom of speech,

[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.680]
the curtail you're ability to enjoy your entertainment,

[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.440]
radio TV, pop up posters, cable next, satellite radio TV

[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.900]
next, internet next.

[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.400]
There's no ending it.

[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.840]
Time jicker writes, sound Florida radio host

[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.700]
warrant a cleanup back to avoid fines.

[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.220]
Justin Tinkerbell might as well have torn up

[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.780]
Neil Rogers' radio playbook when he ripped away part of Janet

[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.400]
Jackson's top during the Super Bowl halftime show,

[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.340]
petrified by the specter of draconian new penalties

[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.380]
from the FCC, up to $500,000 per offense for broadcast

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.620]
in decency, sound Florida station managers

[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.040]
have tightened the rules on what air talent may say.

[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.160]
Rogers, who has been the dominant personality in the Miami

[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.360]
Fort Lauderdale market for more than a quarter century,

[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.260]
says his employer WQM has virtually stripped mine

[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.580]
is occasionally a risk aid program.

[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.880]
That's not what I said, but anyway.

[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.740]
They've taken away about 70% of my comedy bits

[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.280]
at Rogers, that again is not what I said,

[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.160]
who has been given a new list of forbidden words,

[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.280]
that's true, which includes trademark epipates.

[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.600]
He's used thousands of times over the years,

[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.020]
which of course is absolutely correct.

[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.060]
Those are in addition to the infamous seven taboo words,

[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.080]
George Carlin once coined in the comedy routine,

[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.480]
which became an official part of broadcast law.

[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.700]
I have about 5,000 comedy bits in the computer,

[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.060]
said Rogers earlier this week.

[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.460]
How do you listen to everyone to see

[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.160]
if something that is now forbidden is in it?

[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.820]
I find myself auditioning bits during my breaks

[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.440]
to make sure they're all right before I put them on.

[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.580]
I've been playing some of these things for 25 years

[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.440]
and suddenly they say I can't do them any more.

[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.360]
The ripple effects of also read Spanish language radio

[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.780]
with its own new list of forbidden words.

[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.360]
I backed myself into a corner here,

[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.700]
I'll finish this after the break, okay?

[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.460]
Because I don't wanna like have to rush through it.

[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.380]
Did he say rush?

[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:54.860]
Okay.

[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.200]
Right.

[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:57.460]
I don't have the proper pills here

[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.560]
to be able to talk fast enough and no helium either.

[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.020]
1026 at 560 WQM,

[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.600]

[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.820]
It's really, it's, who could have ever believed this?

[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.080]
You know?

[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.280]
Who could have ever dreamed this?

[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.360]
And in addition to which,

[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.480]
who could have ever dreamed that the response would be

[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.180]
so like Nambi Pambi?

[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.200]
Oh, gee.

[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.700]
It's scary, but then again, you're in America.

[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:25.640]
I'm not.

[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:26.560]
Don't tell me.

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.200]
Are you gonna really dead end crappy job?

[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.840]
Are you overpaid underworked?

[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.080]
What did I say?

[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.920]
Always thinking about Todd Dreck.

[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.240]

[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.920]

[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.980]

Five and a local,

they're 65 cities,

[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.520]
the radio's all yours now.

[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.780]
Q-A-M.

[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.260]
The L-I-Six-C-W-T-L-A-M.

[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.420]
And then the Lord said,

[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.820]
let there be light and low.

[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.320]
There was light from the same people

[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.420]
who brought you the much beloved talking Bible.

[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.580]
Comes a new 10 volume set brilliantly updated for the eighties.

[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.980]
Yes, it's the wrapping Bible.

[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.220]
There was dark everywhere than the man said.

[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.540]
Light and the light was there.

[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.880]
He said, I done good.

[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.100]
There's no doubt on the seventh day.

[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.600]
He just chill out.

[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.260]
Genesis, Genesis, beginning of death, beginning of death.

[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.340]
Finally, the good book is bad.

[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.200]
And he's wearing his mask.

[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.280]
Check it out.

[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.520]
There's a town called Sodom and the water.

[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.800]
Everybody pointed like no tomorrow.

[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.140]
God looked down, said, now my fault.

[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.700]
Don't look back or you turn too strong.

[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.860]
I'm white to the feet, started to breathe.

[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.240]
The cow came up and they touched each.

[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.360]
Take a look, y'all.

[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.440]
I'll let you go.

[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.740]
Imagine all the songs, all the parables.

[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.960]
Every sacred, biblical word interpreted by the finest second MC's of all time.

[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.760]
Genesis, Genesis, to the wrong.

[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.900]
A wrapping Bible, making his word fresh again.

[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.900]
1033, boy, those markets are in a precipitous drop today.

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.500]
I'll tell you that.

[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.780]
I used to sound, but we're not allowed to.

[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.060]
Am I you, Burton?

[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.460]
I would make a sound effect about that.

[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.020]
Don't do it.

[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.160]
The ripple effects right, Tom J.

[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.500]
You can't have also reached Spanish language radio with its own new list of forbidden words.

[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.400]
Before I finish this column, I got two more choices for our poll today.

[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.680]
With all the FCC crap going on, Neil should, I got two more.

[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.920]
Do a sports show.

[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.140]
Or do an all hockey show.

[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:34.980]
Come on, Eric.

[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.000]
Let's get those two on here.

[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.640]
Get a lot of votes.

[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.100]
Remember a vote for the hockey show.

[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.480]
Then he can replace you.

[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:41.140]
Sure.

[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:41.740]
Come on.

[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.620]
If something do next year, there's going to be no season.

[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.740]
Or before I finish, jik is column, the Panther organization.

[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.820]
Once again, pissing off people from coast to coast.

[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.180]
It's kind of like there in some kind of a contest to see if they can have like an empty

[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.960]
arena by the time they have the last game.

[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.240]
They now have what they call the Lexus parking spaces.

[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:10.340]
The four rows, double rows, which is the closest to the escalator to go into the arena,

[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.600]
which used to be when you, and keep in mind that the people

[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.020]
who pay for the good parking there, they pay extra for that.

[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.780]
I think it's ten bucks a game.

[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:24.080]
But no, you can't park there in no mold because now those good spots are the Lexus area.

[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.760]
You have to be driving Lexus and you also have to pay on top of that.

[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:27.760]
Yes.

[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.860]
So if the game, I think it was a Buffalo game on Saturday.

[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.200]
I got a spy report.

[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.700]
And they had a pretty good crowd because they were given up, given away LaWango, something

[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.920]
or other, given away some free stuff.

[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.560]
So people brought their kids and they showed up.

[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.880]
You know, people that don't really care about the game, but if there's something free,

[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.360]
they'll be there.

[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.680]
And there were like ten Lexus's parked in there, out of about six, hundreds parking spots.

[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.680]
And everybody else had a walk an extra 100 to 200 yards to get to the escalator.

[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.820]
And a lot more people are pissed off and fired up.

[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.940]
See, I hate to break the news to you, Alan Cohen.

[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.240]
Most people don't drive a freaking Lexus.

[00:27:59.380 --> 00:27:59.980]
How do you like that?

[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:00.500]
You idiot.

[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:01.440]
God.

[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.460]
Airbnb, time they get a chance.

[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.460]
They turn around and do something to piss off the fans.

[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.900]
For example, there was a game a week or two ago when it was raining cats and dogs.

[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.960]
And so people come into the arena with their umbrellas.

[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:14.920]
Well, guess what?

[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.020]
Can't have an umbrella.

[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.980]
That's a weapon.

[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.220]
Can't bring an umbrella in here so the people have to go back to their cars, stash their umbrella

[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.700]
and then come wallsting back into the arena and the pouring rain getting soaked.

[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.160]
Maybe we ought to do a poll on that.

[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.800]
Some more ideas so that we can have nobody at the sporting events in South Florida.

[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:42.140]
Anyway, the only problem said talks your host and week a Santos on Friday is that an English word is the same for anybody who speaks the language.

[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.500]
But depending on the country, a word in Spanish can be either harmless or incredibly offensive.

[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.700]
Una palabra en español.

[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:55.600]
Santos and his sidekick Joe Ferrerro have been held up as local heroes since they made a pred call to the del Castro nine months ago.

[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:02.800]
Their morning show on WXDJL Seoul FM 95.7 is the most popular on Spanish language FM radio.

[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:10.820]
The coconut grove based Spanish broadcasting system, which owns WXDJ and other stations, has distributed the list of 21 words,

[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:17.060]
mostly references to sexual and excretory organs and functions that can no longer be set on the air.

[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.080]
Some of these are so offensive, Santos said one would have to be an idiot to use them.

[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:30.240]
However, the second generation Cuban Americans said the list included one word that the dictionary defines as the female sexual organ for Cubans the same word,

[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.620]
although an explotive has a different meaning and is commonly used in everyday language.

[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.640]
Don't say what it is, please.

[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.840]
You can say our show has some colorful content.

[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:44.020]
Though I never thought it was offensive said Santos, who considers the FCC's reaction to the Janet Jackson stop a witch hunt.

[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.480]
Absolutely correct.

[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.420]
Everybody in the industry is scared of that because of the outrageous fines the FCC's imposing he says he says I'm not a millionaire.

[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.560]
I don't want to take the risk there.

[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.340]
Do I want the FCC to use me as an example?

[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.640]
Does that how he said it as sample example?

[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:06.560]
However, critics say the FCC's refusal to be specific about what is permissible now is left broadcasters and uneasy on a unfair position.

[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.920]
Absolutely correct.

[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:13.260]
One new guideline according to the FCC is would an average adult judge the material to be offensive.

[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:21.440]
Where do you find the average adult Rogers asked what is an average adult I guess the FCC will decide to play at safe stations.

[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:29.580]
They're being extremely cautious in addition to the banished comedy bits and words WQM told Rogers he can no longer broadcast flatulent sounds.

[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.600]
Now there's one thing I can interject here.

[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.480]
Okay, remember the Raspberry guy that used to call in in the drive you nuts.

[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.380]
How could we forget how could we forget?

[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.900]
Well, let me say this to that could be a Raspberry see I was asking you about Raspberry.

[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.940]
Right, I like Raspberry spec I got some in the fridge right now I got Raspberry for strawberry.

[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.560]
So I don't think you should be allowed to and incense in peppermint.

[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.460]
Rogers who show airs from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. is the local English language talk host most affected by fear of the FCC.

[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.660]
Most affected by fear.

[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:09.560]
Be afraid. Be very afraid of the FCC WQM does sports the rest today to market other prominent on music stations are owned by clear channel which primarily uses syndicated talent.

[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:19.640]
Clear channel which dropped how it's turned from six stations including WBGG has instituted a zero tolerance policy toward indecency for all its talent local and syndicated.

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:27.940]
They're going to want to talk they are in decent effect if you look up the word in decent and the dictionary you'll see Lowry Maes and Dave Ross and people just pictures next to it in decent.

[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.840]
That's to channel and John Hogan the driver.

[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.060]
Rogers who makes a reported million dollars a year says he's neither stubborn or stupid and that's well of that.

[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.640]
I'll do whatever they want as long as the checks keep coming every two weeks as Rogers you just have to be more creative.

[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:50.780]
He's already proven he's capable of that tweaking the FCC in the process instead of using one of the new forbidden words he says vice president Chinese first name.

[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:56.140]
Oh how clever aren't I clever now thanks Tom but next time get it right.

[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.920]
the story on the year because there's an aspect to it that's you know delicate but I just want to say

[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:29.060]
this if anybody thought that Mo Howard David it was like a good guy no no not just a good guy

[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.320]
but if he was like reforming a little bit like he was trying to change his ways maybe that happened

[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.560]
and I'm not saying I'm the one that's standing up but this guy's Scott in New York with his

[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.580]
petition right it makes a lot of sense to me it's a great thing and a lot of and I'll also say

[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:56.820]
this which I never do but the people in this audience have really responded big time when we

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.300]
started with this thing a week ago tomorrow when when somebody called in a turn of sound to that

[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:05.240]
website there were like 1700 people from Florida who would uh sign those petitions now we got

[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:11.080]
almost 9000 so somebody out there is paying attention and somebody is pissed off and fired up can we

[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:16.460]
still say that as if today we can still say that in fact you know what we ought to do is just play

[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:20.660]
that all the rest of the day yeah it's off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that it's off

[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.180]
gets me fired up when I hear someone say that you what I'm saying what while we can well I'm

[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.760]

everything they say and they're advertising 100% but their competitors still use lots of false

[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.500]
and deceptive claims when you see a mattress that making outrageous claims do yourself a big

[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:48.540]

[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.840]

anyway regular guys suspended over Stump Gone Array

[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:26.080]
WKLS Atlanta's Morning Show the regular guys hosted by Larry Wax and Eric Vaughn Hasseller

[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:31.000]
have been suspended from the clear channel Atlantic Rocker following a Stump Gone Array on Friday show

[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.300]
the host were reportedly working during a commercial break on a stunt in which a porn actress

[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:41.800]
was taped simulating various sex acts the duo planned to wear the tape backward kind of like in the

[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.380]
exorcist thus avoiding any indecency problems but the dialogue went out over the year

[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.760]
rolling underneath a commercial WKLS management told our in-arbor conducting a swift and

[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.820]
thorough investigation of this morning's WKLS broadcast our preliminary understanding is

[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.480]
that a microphone was left open accidentally during a commercial break

[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:09.680]
how do you like that suspensions firings finds you name it for example

[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.160]
the nearly three-year-old broadcast that brought Howard Stern his first in-decent he finds

[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.780]
in June of 98 and while Stern and his crew defining terms like Blumkin balloon knot and the

[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.420]
David Copperfield phrases used in regular rotation by opian Anthony before they were cancelled by

[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:33.540]
Infinity in August of 02 the content cited in Thursday's 27,500 dollar fine against Infinity

[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:38.960]
was a July 26 2001 Stern show that triggered a complaint by a listener of Stern Affiliate WKR

[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.400]
can detroit that's the same station facing a 27,000 dollar forperture for Daiminsky in

[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.940]
Doyle a fine recently upheld by the FCC Infinity maintains that the Stern material wasn't

[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:54.780]
actionable indecency and didn't contain any description of sexual extroletory organs or

[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.760]
in a apparently offensive manner and Fendini also argues that the Commission's generic indecency

[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.540]
definition is unconstitutional see that's where I wholeheartedly agree nobody's got any idea what

[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:12.680]
they're talking about including the FCC in previous rulings the Commission's fine not only the

[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:17.720]
station cited in the complaint but others that are the same broadcast so far it's only fine KRK

[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.260]
something that's not sitting well with Commissioners Michael cops and Jonathan Adelstein both

[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.880]
tried to the Commission for not finding other Stern Affiliates in their statements with cops

[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:31.220]
suggesting that WKR case and decency track were warranted a track record more than a slap on a

[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:36.520]
wrist in other words yank their license this Michael cops he makes Michael policy like a good guy

[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:43.300]
rabid foaming at them out and he's a Democrat and then it goes on in the article too it's on our

[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:48.500]
website to list the whole conversation in there about what is a bumkin I don't want to go into

[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:55.660]
and we certainly won't but how are Stern accused oh this is in the New York Post accused

[00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:00.060]
Oprah Winfrey of being a fellow potty mouth saying the afternoon TV queen is there the same kind of

[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:04.460]
kinky sexual material for which he's being pilloried and I've noted that on some of the Stern

[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.620]
websites they're stirring campaign which I wholeheartedly endorse for people to write letters

[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:13.320]
to the FCC and we're filing complaints against Oprah then you're going to see the stuff hit the

[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:19.880]
fan you know what I'm saying then it's going to be a whole different yeah if they find me for

[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.680]
this then they've got to find Oprah the darling of the world Stern to list is after trying to play a

[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:30.820]
shocking excerpt of her an Oprah show on teen sex and if they find Oprah he said all hell is going

[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:35.320]
to break loose the shock shock pleaded on the air with the states in general manager to let him

[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:40.740]
play a tape of Winfrey and her guest discussing and a rock erotic activity known as tossing the salad

[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:48.080]
yeah this is Oprah Winfrey at four in the afternoon saying this Oprah graphically discusses it

[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:54.300]
Stern called as told as K-Rock boss Tom Qzonko whatever his name is on Thursday's Winfrey show a

[00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:00.020]
writer for her magazine oh explain in meticulous detail what she described as popular sexual

[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:06.720]
pastimes from her friends teenagers including Orlan anal sex practices the writer Michael Michele

[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.180]
view for it also described in detail a variety of other slang sex terms don't believe it's

[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:15.100]
Stern pleaded with his producer this is what's going to expose the hypocrisy this is our battle of

[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:20.960]
the bulge if they find me they have to find her yet you imagine the headline Oprah Winfrey find for

[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:26.820]
indecency Qzonko put Stern's rad on hold for ten minutes and sought counsel from Infinity Broadcasting

[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:32.040]
lawyers after Stern threatened to call malcarmas in prison of infinity perv and via con the lawyers

[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.600]
turned down his request and Stern's were a producers kept the sexual references off the air

[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.880]
under the standards as they now exist our answer is do we believe that that's indecent no we

[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:47.640]
don't too sonno said do we believe that they the FCC believe it the answer that is yes everything

[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:53.120]
and anything they don't like is indecent a spokesperson for the FCC's enforcement bureau told

[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.920]
the post she hadn't seen any complaints about Oprah show typically the FCC doesn't act or come

[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.680]
in on controversial broadcast until a complaint is received FCC guidelines also we in fact are

[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.520]
such as contact the material that appears to pander as used to titillator shock a Winfrey spokesperson

[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:13.780]
center show was on production hiatus and that Oprah was unavailable for comment well what a coincident

[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:19.180]

on our website about the Cuban vote I guess they're talking about it huh but yeah they were they

[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:59.120]
were touching on that on the news too how they're a little disenchanted pretty disenchanted with

[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.840]
the bushmeister who promised he's going to do this going to then set in fact a lot of people

[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.560]
are figuring if he invaded Iraq and spent a hundred billion dollars how much less would it have

[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:11.780]
cost to invade Cuba and you would have a say to hell with pedale right which he promised all kinds

[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:20.360]
of crap and of course as usual uh left them hanging could it do that cheap when rupert murdoch calls

[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:27.880]
this is a great column of the online beat by John Nichols in the nation he says last Friday the

[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.600]
Bush administration was busy pumping out hopes that the war on terrorism was about to yield the

[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:35.800]
victory the capture along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan of the repeated number two

[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.900]
man and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network as it turned out Dr. Al-Zawahiri was probably not

[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:44.080]
among the millifin so it hold up in heavily fortified compounds that were sold by Pakistani troops

[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.860]
and the U.S. advisors but by most measures the prospective capture of what administration

[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:53.940]
aid described as a high target value was treated as a very big deal by the Bush White House at the

[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:57.720]
same time administration aid to a busy trying to hold together the coalition of the sort of

[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.900]
willing that was cobbled together to support the invasion of Iraq with Spain's new prime minister

[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:06.060]
declaring the occupation aid is asked to and threatening to withdraw that country's troops from Iraq

[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.760]
and with Poland's president telling European reporters that his country was misled about the

[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:15.540]
nature of the threat posed by Iraq the administration has its hands full surely national security advisor

[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:20.160]
Kandaliyz or rice a key player on all the fronts that were in play had a very long list of

[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:26.560]
responsibilities no time for diversions on Friday right wrong rice took time out in the middle of the

[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:31.860]
day to address a secretive gathering that included global media mogul rubbert murdoch and top

[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:36.560]
executives from TV networks newspapers and other media properties owned by Murdoch's news quote conglomerate

[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:42.040]
rice spoke at some length via satellite to Murdoch and his cronies would gather that the posh risk

[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:46.240]
call the hotel in cancun mexico according to reports published in the British press

[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.160]
the guardian newspaper which said a reporter to cancun revealed that rice was asked to address the

[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:57.420]
by executives of the Murdoch controlled fox broadcast and cable networks in the us the fox family

[00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:01.780]
includes of course the fox news cable channel which the guardian correctly describes as hugely

[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:06.200]
supportive of president George Bush although she's not there in person the presence of

[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:09.900]
his rice underlines the importance of rubbert murdoch's news operations for the Bush administration

[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:14.840]
which may face growing criticism that led the country to war on false pretenses ahead of November's

[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:20.060]
presidential election the guardian can count of a cancun gathering explained in addition to fox

[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:24.700]
murdoch controls the Bush friendly weekly standard magazine and New York post newspaper as well

[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:29.920]
as 35 local TV stations in the 20th century fox movie studio thanks to Bush administration

[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:35.760]
appointees to the FCC Murdoch's reaches rapidly expanding in the US in December the FCC approved

[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:42.260]
newscrop 6.6 billion dollar takeover of direct TV the country's leading satellite TV firm that decision

[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:47.660]
made Murdoch the only media executive with satellite cable and broadcast assets in the US in other words

[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.560]
rupert murdoch is a very powerful player in the media and because of his willingness to turn his

[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:57.040]
properties into mouthpieces for the administration and the politics of the United States so it should

[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.760]
probably not come as any surprise they'd like the politicians in any number of countries where

[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.600]
Murdoch has come to dominate the discourse Bush administration officials answer ruper it's

[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:10.760]
called even when they're supposedly preoccupied with national security concerns rice's willingness

[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.480]
to brief fox fox executives as especially intriguing in light of the fact that she continues to

[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.440]

Jewish dance today

i was in the Israeli defense forces back then and i hate to open it to you

[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.860]
and a personal level i'm sure you're delighted with the fact that matter is

[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.480]
this uh... this is opening up a can of worms that's going to be grotesque and

[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.520]
brutal on a lot of innocent people are going to die

[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.020]
true

[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:14.360]

[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.960]
air fat has never been able to control

[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.380]

came out of your mouth was put in there by somebody else like misfudge in his case i'd feel rich

[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:43.080]
isn't that the ultimate whore right i mean it's just pathetic air every time the right wingers

[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.480]
have got some crap that they want to plan there it is on the fudge report and there's misfudge

[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:54.520]
on the air sunday nights in all 50 states spew in her right wing crap self-hating faggot man

[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:01.000]
tragic didn't learn anything from david brock anyway the unstopped two weapons experts said yesterday

[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.160]
the invasion of a raki or ago was not justified by the evidence in hand at the time i think it's

[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.960]
clear that in march when the invasion took place the evidence that had been brought forward

[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:15.440]
was rapidly falling apart set hans blix oversaw the agency's investigation into whether a raki

[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.340]
had chemical and biological weapons that's what he told the late edition with wolf blitzkrieg on

[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:24.360]
CNN yesterday blitz described the evidence secretary state colon paupers ended the win

[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.540]
to the security council in february 2003 as shaky and he said he related his opinion to us officials

[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:37.740]
including national security adviser khan the lieeze arise that's doctor rise to us i think they

[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:42.980]
chose to ignore us blitz said well hamad al-baraday director general of the international atomic energy

[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:48.700]
agency spoke to cn from ia headquarters in austria al-baraday said he had been pretty convinced

[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.540]
that a raki had not resumed its nuclear weapons program which the ia ea dismantled in 97

[01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:00.860]
days before the fighting began vice president chanee what's his first name don't say it i won't

[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:06.300]
vice president chanee waiting with an opposing view we believe a raki leader sada mousain has in

[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:11.620]
fact reconstitute nuclear weapons i think mr al-baraday frankly is wrong chanee said and i think

[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:15.960]
if you look at the track record of the ia ea in this kind of issue especially where a raki's

[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:20.540]
concerned they've consistently underestimated or missed what sada was doing now more than a year

[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:24.940]
later al-baraday said i haven't seen anything on the ground at the time that supported mr chanee's

[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:30.140]
conclusion or statement so and i thought to myself well history's going to be the judge and of course

[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:35.920]
the story goes on to say as we all know no evidence of the weapons program has been found so far

[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:42.880]
none zero nada ni nte nete none just mention that in passing

[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:27.060]
message board it's infected even doubt on reply from somebody you agree with me but then it's gone

[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:34.220]
it's gone after like two minutes we know there's one thing i'm just discovering is this weekend i

[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:38.160]
spend tons of time looking at just every kind of website under the sun that might in any way

[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.060]
where you know they have to do with this and discern people are just like him every everything in

[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:48.200]
the world is we're all revolves around him he's the sun all the rest of us are you know the planet

[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.120]
and we're all around howard so if it doesn't have to do with him and the fact that he's making a

[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.120]
martyr of them out of the cell that's not worth talking about yeah they've had a bit on ntr this

[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:03.200]
morning on morning edition about uh... he actually said they had a clip of his show and he actually

[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:09.320]
said oh it's not all about me i just want to laugh about it's about time though at least he said

[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.680]
it it's about time he finally got the message but i think the people in the york are not getting

[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:19.180]
involved in the stock fcc thing because they still get to listen to him you know they're not

[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:23.820]
suffering from it but you're missing one point though he's been belly-ekin on the air for the last

[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:27.400]
two or three weeks that he's about to get canned altogether and then infinity's going to have to take

[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.780]
him off the air so you think they would be the first ones that would be on there but he's just

[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.300]
not promoting he's got a link to it on his website but i mean we could have a link to it also

[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:40.240]
which we do but unless i talked about it we wouldn't get any response exactly well i i want to

[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.620]
have to be a crazy person you must be out of your mind you have to be a lunatic

[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:21.820]
if we had a democratic congress which we don't even as spineless as they are but if we did have

[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:24.880]
impeachment proceedings would be going on right now i believe that

[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:29.200]
but we don't and i haven't got a tournament chance in hell so what's the point

[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:38.380]
with all the FCC crack going on Neil should just keep riving bush and ask 458 two-thirds say that

[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:47.340]
67.1 percent two-thirds you turn keep going as best he can 140 retire 39 oh look at that

[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:54.860]
something five point seven percent retire do a sports show sixteen go back to all bedtime

[01:29:54.860 --> 01:30:00.620]
stories only twelve they hated that George in fact to a hockey show has got eleven almost as

[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:05.760]
many as the bedtime stories and play music six out of six hundred eighty two votes that he just

[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:10.200]
say six hundred eighty two votes and then i want to have yes what he just said wow

[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:17.080]
there's another reason for that smiley face for the third straight year

[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:22.260]
wal-mart stores tops the 50th annual fortune 500 ranking of the nation's largest companies

[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:27.060]
and is certainly at the top of our list of companies that we hate that we despise

[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:32.880]
wal-mart the Bentonville Arkansas based discount retailer is one of only three companies ever

[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:38.460]
to top the prestigious list which was announced yesterday by fortune magazine the other companies are

[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:44.620]
Exxon mobile what is shock oh by the way thanks mr. president for those low gas prices

[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:50.020]
Exxon mobile which roses spot the second place and general motors which slipped the

[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:56.200]
notch to third rounding out the top ten companies are Ford motor GE Chevron Texaco

[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.560]
so did he say Chevron Texaco

[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:09.620]
oop city corp IBM an American international group i don't know whether i can

[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.800]
a bell choney or anymore you know today isn't that course isn't that like a core sound

[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:21.000]
and isn't that expatory activity can we even say core i mean if we can't if we can't play

[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.080]
the farting sounds anymore we certainly belching sounds are you expelling gas just from a different

[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:32.120]
orifice you see the idea that we sit back and we take all of this crap now infinity are the only

[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:35.480]
people with the resources and the balls to fight it they've been fighting it for years to keep

[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:39.860]
stirring on here because he's their cash cow but the rest of the people just roll over Beethoven

[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:45.100]
roll over roll over oh yes yes yes yes or whatever you say yes sir did you say that yes you did

[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:50.320]
yes sir and i'm gonna say it again the idea that this station which Greg has been desperately trying

[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:54.480]
to destroy for the last two years and doing a pretty good job of it that we put for all on the

[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.840]
year for two hours even though many of you enjoyed him but nevertheless the idea that we did

[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:03.260]
that at the time when it was obvious to all of us that the climate was changing could put it

[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:09.020]
loosely uh was an act of madness if you ask me remember how we discussed that i would say to

[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:15.960]
you how come why did they decide to do this now yeah they lost touch with reality are they out

[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:20.740]
of their mind is Greg a loose cannon is he like irresponsible and goofy is all hell

[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:25.980]
i think the local number is five sixteen the radius of yours

[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:36.500]
q and this is mark morgan it's the twelve to one hour on q eight and okay it's twelve

[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:40.020]
known a q a now let's this is going to be a difficult hour because we're going to like have to

[01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:44.360]
look at all the breaks in don't don't panic okay okay but i want to play the audio from 60

[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:49.520]
minutes last night Leslie stall and Richard Clark right now a special presidential commission

[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:54.120]
is investigating whether the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon in september

[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:59.840]
eleventh two thousand one were preventable there were a few people in a better position to answer

[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:05.860]
that question then Richard Clark the administration's former top advisor on counter terrorism

[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:11.800]
who left the white house last year Clark has helped shape u.s policy on terrorism since the

[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:17.460]
nineteen eighties when he got his first presidential appointment from Ronald Reagan he went on to

[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:23.740]
serve the first president bush then was president clinton's terrorism's are and was held over by

[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:30.140]
president George w bush in testimony before the nine eleven commission later this week and in a

[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:35.960]
new book to be published tomorrow against all enemies Clark will tell the story of what happened

[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:42.740]
behind the scenes at the white house before during and after september eleventh he does so first

[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:50.220]
tonight on sixty minutes on the terrorist struck on the morning of nine eleven it was thought that

[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:56.320]
the white house would be the next target and the building was evacuated it went from having hundreds

[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.120]
of people in the white house complex a hubbub of activity to being totally abandoned

[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:07.420]
Richard Clark was one of only a handful of people who stayed behind he ran the government's

[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:13.780]
response to the attacks from the situation room in the west wing well i kept thinking of the words

[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:22.360]
from apocalypse now the whispered words of marlin brando when he thought about Vietnam the horror

[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:30.000]
the horror because we knew what was going on in new york we knew about the bodies flying out of the

[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.880]
windows people falling through the air we knew that some have been loud and had succeeded in bringing

[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:44.040]
horror to the streets of america after the president returned to the white house on nine eleven

[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:50.800]
he and his top advisors including Clark began holding meetings about how to respond and retaliate

[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:57.060]
as Clark writes in his book he expected the administration to focus its military response on

[01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:03.340]
Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda but was surprised that the talk quickly turned to another target

[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:09.980]
you relate a conversation you had with secretary of defense rumsfeld well rumsfeld was saying that

[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:17.620]
we needed to bomb a rack and and we all said but no no al-Qaeda is in Afghanistan we need to bomb

[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:23.520]
Afghanistan and rumsfeld said there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan and there are lots of

[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:29.560]
good targets in Iraq i said well there are lots of good targets and lots of places but a rack had

[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:33.800]
nothing to do with it you wrote you thought he was joking no initially i thought when he said

[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:38.600]
there aren't enough targets in in Afghanistan i thought he was joking now what was your reaction

[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.340]
to al-

[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:54.360]
you know it's akin to what a franklin Roosevelt after pro harbour instead of going to war with

[01:35:54.380 --> 01:36:01.840]
your pan said let's invade mexico you know it's very analogous if it didn't they think that there

[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:07.460]
was a connection i think they wanted to believe that there was a connection but the CIA was sitting

[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:12.520]
there the FBI was sitting there i was sitting there saying we've looked at this issue for years

[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.420]
for years we've looked for a connection and there's just no connection and you told them that

[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:22.720]
absolutely you personally and i told them that George tenet told who did you tell i told that

[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:30.200]
to the group to the secretary of state the secretary of defense the attorney general they all knew

[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:36.820]
it you talk about a conversation you personally had with the president yes the president we were

[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.540]
in the situation room complex the president dragged me into a room with a couple of other people

[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:50.840]
shut the door and said i want you to find whether Iraq did this i never said make it up

[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:58.700]
but the entire conversation left me and absolutely no doubt that George Bush wanted me to come

[01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:05.360]
back with a report that said Iraq did this didn't you tell him that you looked and there'd been no

[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:11.940]
i said i said mr. president we've done this before we've been looking at this we have looked

[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:16.500]
out at with an open mind there's no connection he came back at me and said Iraq sadam

[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:22.640]
find out if there's a connection and in a very intimidating way i mean that we should come

[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:27.600]
back with that answer we wrote a report you in other words you did go back and we went back again

[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:33.640]
and we looked you did and was it a serious look did you it was a serious look we we got together all

[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:39.700]
the FBI experts all the CIA experts we wrote the report we sent the report out to CIA and downed

[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:45.900]
FBI and said would you sign this report they all cleared the report and we sent it up to the president

[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:53.020]
and it got bounced by the national security advisor or deputy it got bounced and sent back saying

[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:59.820]
the wrong answer come on do it again wrong answer do it again did the president see it i have no

[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:05.800]
idea to this day if the president saw it because after we did it again it came to the same conclusion

[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:11.420]
and frankly Leslie i don't think the people around the president show him memos like that i don't

[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:19.080]
he sees memos or he wouldn't like the answer Clark was the president's top advisor on terrorism

[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:24.580]
and yet it wasn't until 9-11 that he ever got to brief mr. Bush on the subject

[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:30.840]
Clark says that prior to 9-11 this administration did not take the threat seriously

[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:37.600]
we had a terrorist organization that was going after us al-Qaeda that should have been the first

[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:44.840]
item on the agenda and it was pushed back and back and back for months you were about to testify

[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:52.440]
publicly before a committee that wants to know if the Bush administration dropped the ball

[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:57.000]
what are you going to tell the committee when they ask you that there's a lot of blame to go around

[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:05.040]
and i probably deserve some blame too but on January 24th 2001 i wrote a memo to

[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:12.040]
kindly surprise asking for urgently underlined urgently a cabinet level meeting to deal with the

[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:22.860]
impending al-Qaeda attack and that urgent memo wasn't acted on do you blame her for not

[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:31.160]
understanding the significance of terrorism i blame the entire Bush leadership for continuing to

[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:37.760]
work on the cold war issues when they came back in power in 2001 it was as though they were

[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:43.140]
preserved in amber from when they left office eight years earlier they came back they wanted to

[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:50.380]
work on the same issues right away Iraq star wars not new issues that the new threats that

[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:56.600]
had developed over the preceding eight years Clark finally got his meeting to brief about al-Qaeda

[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:03.180]
in april three months after his urgent request but it wasn't with the president or the cabinet

[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:09.860]
it was with the number two's in each relevant department for the Pentagon it was Paul Wolfowitz

[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:14.260]
i began saying we have to deal with bin Laden we have to deal with al-Qaeda

[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:20.080]
holding an influence the deputy secretary of defense said no no no we don't have to deal with al-Qaeda

[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:24.840]
but why are we talking about that little guy we have to talk about a rappy terrorism against the

[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:30.820]
United States and i said Paul there hasn't been any Iraqi terrorism against the United States in eight

[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:38.780]
years and i turned to the deputy director of cia and said isn't that right and he said yeah that's

[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:43.300]
right there is nowhere Iraqi terrorism against the United States in eight years in eight years

[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:50.880]
explain that he explained that there was no Iraqi terrorism against the u.s. after 1993 when

[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.260]
sada mousain attempted to assassinate the first president bush while he was visiting Kuwait

[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.060]
we responded to that by blowing up Iraqi intelligence headquarters and by sending a very clear

[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:09.020]
message through diplomatic channels to the Iraqi saying if you do any terrorism against the

[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:13.380]
United States again you won't just be Iraqi intelligence headquarters it'll be your whole government

[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:20.400]
it was a very chilling message and apparently it worked because there's absolutely no evidence

[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:27.680]
since that day of Iraqi terrorism directly against the United States until we invaded them now there's

[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.760]
Iraqi terrorism against the United States was there any connection between sada mousain and al-Qaeda

[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:41.740]
were they cooperating no was it rock supporting al-Qaeda no there's absolutely no evidence of

[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:47.300]
Iraq was supporting al-Qaeda but you know you call certain people in the administration and they'll

[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:52.760]
say that's still open that's an open issue well they'll say that until health reasons are there

[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:59.760]
by June 2001 there's still hadn't been a cabinet level meeting on terrorism even though the

[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:06.700]
u.s. intelligence community was picking up an unprecedented level of ominous chatter the CIA director

[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:13.380]
warned the White House George Tenant was saying to the White House saying to the president because

[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:19.380]
he briefed him every morning a major al-Qaeda attack is going to happen against the United States

[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:26.120]
somewhere in the world in the weeks and months ahead you said that in June July August the last

[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:32.000]
time the CIA had picked up a similar level of intelligence chatter was back in December 1999

[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:38.760]
when Clark was the terrorism czar in the Clinton White House Clark says president Clinton ordered

[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:44.420]
his cabinet to go to battle stations meaning they were on high alert holding meetings nearly

[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:51.100]
every day that Clark says helped thwart a major attack on mousain jelous international airport

[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:57.420]
when this al-Qaeda operative was stopped at the border with Canada driving a car full of explosives

[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:04.620]
Clark harshly criticizes president bush for not going to battle stations when the CIA warned him

[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:10.480]
of a comparable threat in the months before 9-11 he never thought it was important enough for him

[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:17.180]
to hold a meeting on the subject or for him to order his national security advisor to hold a

[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:22.400]
cabinet level meeting on the subject why would having a meeting make a difference if you compare

[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:31.500]
December 99 to June and July 2001 in December 99 every day or every other day the head of the

[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:36.140]
FBI the head of the CIA the attorney general had to go to the White House and sit in the meeting

[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:41.980]
and report on all the things that they personally had done to stop the al-Qaeda attack

[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:47.240]
so they were going back every night to their departments and shaking the trees personally

[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:54.900]
finding out all the information if that had happened in July of 2001 we might have found out in

[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:59.040]
the White House the attorney general might have found out that there were al-Qaeda operatives

[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:06.860]
in the United States FBI at lower levels new never told me never told the highest levels in the FBI

[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:14.900]
the FBI and the CIA knew that these two al-Qaeda operatives both among the 9-11 hijackers

[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:20.580]
had been living in the United States since 2000 yet neither agency passed that information

[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:27.900]
up the chain of command or told Dick Clark as the White House terrorism coordinator and here I am

[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:32.360]
the White House saying something's about to happen tell me you know if the sparrow falls from the

[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:39.240]
tree I want to know if anything unusual is going on because we're about to be hit no one tells you

[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:46.140]
the FBI knows they're in the country Leslie if we had put their picture on the CBS evening news

[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:51.960]
if we had put their picture on Dan rather on USA today we could have caught those guys and then

[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:57.700]
we might have been able to pull that thread and get more of the conspiracy I'm not saying we could

[01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:05.240]
stop 9-11 but we could have at least had a chance but as we all know the al-Qaeda sleeper cell was

[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:11.860]
left free to plan the 9-11 attack while Dick Clark kept agitating for the high level White House

[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:19.040]
meeting he'd been seeking you finally did get your cabinet level meeting finally when did that

[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:26.620]
meeting take place the cabinet meeting I asked for right after the inauguration to place one week

[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:36.180]
prior to 11 when Clark got his meeting on September 4th he proposed a plan to bomb al-Qaeda sanctuaries

[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:42.800]
in Afghanistan and to kill Osama bin Laden it's the same plan he had tried to persuade the Clinton

[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:49.740]
administration to adopt to no avail when we come back Clark's view of the president's actions

[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:56.720]
after 9-11 and the White House view of Clark when we come back this is from a 60 minutes last night

you know

[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:14.100]
he says that the Bush administration should have and could have taken out al-Qaeda and its training

[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:20.360]
camps in Afghanistan long before the attacks of September 11th he also says the fact that

[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:26.780]
Osama bin Laden is still at large is another major failure made possible by what he calls the

[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:34.140]
administration's sluggish response to 9-11 Clark's book in effect an indictment of the president's

[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:39.980]
handling of the war on terrorism arrives just as Mr. Bush is beginning to hit the campaign trail

[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:44.500]
in earnest i'm George W. Bush and I approved this message

[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.380]
the president's new campaign ads highlight his handling of 9-11

[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:57.840]
he's making it the centerpiece of his bid for reelection

[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:06.580]
you're writing this book in the middle of this campaign the timing i'm sure you will be

[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:12.020]
questioned about and criticized for why are you doing it now well sure i'll be criticized for

[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:18.240]
lots of things and i'm sure they'll launch their dogs on me but frankly i find it outrageous

[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:23.580]
that the president is running for reelection on the grounds that he's done such great things about

[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:30.180]
terrorism he ignored it he ignored terrorism for months when maybe we could have done something to

[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:36.800]
stop not 11 maybe we'll never know does a person who works in a white house

[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:45.640]
oh the president his loyalty yes well this is not a loyal book i'm sorry no no i know it's just

[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:52.780]
up to a point up to a point when the president starts doing things like risk american lives

[01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:01.440]
then loyalty to him has to be put aside and the way you think he risked people's lives i think the

[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:08.700]
way he has responded to al-Qaeda both before 9-11 by doing nothing and by what he's done after 9-11

[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:17.500]
has made us less safe absolutely don't you think he handled himself and hit all the right notes

[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:25.500]
after 9-11 showed strength got us through it you don't give him credit for that he gave a really

[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:31.360]
good speech the week after 9-11 you don't give him credit for anything nothing i think he's done

[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:37.520]
the terrible job on the war against terrorism that may be the most serious indictment yet of the

[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.740]
administration's handling of terrorism since it comes from the president's own former terrorism

[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:48.780]
advisor it's not a surprise then that the number two man on the president's national security

[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:55.720]
council steven hadley vehemently disagrees with Clark he says the president has taken the fight to

[01:50:55.720 --> 01:51:02.740]
the terrorists and is hardening the homeland dick Clark he was the administration's top official

[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:10.940]
on counterterrorism how would you describe the job he did look dick is a very dedicated very knowledgeable

[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:16.640]
about this issue when the president came into office one of the decisions we made was to keep

[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:22.280]
mr. Clark and his counterterrorism group intact bring them into the new administration really

[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:28.040]
he says Clark did a good job but is just dead wrong when he says the president didn't he the

[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:35.300]
warnings about al-Qaeda before the attacks on 9-11 the president heard those warnings the president

[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:42.680]
got met daily with his chief of intelligence the director central intelligence George

[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:47.660]
tonnet and his staff and they kept him fully informed and at one point the president became

[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:53.520]
somebody impatient with this said i'm tired of of swatting flies where's my new strategy to

[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:59.740]
eliminate al-Qaeda hadley says that contrary to Clark's assertion the president didn't ignore the

[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:06.240]
ominous intelligence chatter in the summer of 2001 all the chatter was of an attack of potential

[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:13.760]
at al-Qaeda attack overseas but interestingly enough the president got concerned about whether

[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:18.580]
there was the possibility of an attack on the homeland he asked the intelligence community look

[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:23.480]
hard see if we're missing something about a threat to the homeland and at that point various

[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:28.880]
alerts went out from the federal aviation administration to the FBI saying the the

[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:34.340]
intelligence suggest a threat overseas we don't want to be caught unprepared we don't want to

[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:39.820]
rule out the possibility of a threat to the homeland and therefore preparatory steps need to be made

[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:46.920]
so the president put us on battle stations now he's the top terrorism official in this

[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:51.700]
administration at that point he said he didn't go to battle stations well i think that's just wrong

[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:57.200]
in the he also says Clark was wrong when he said the president pressured him to find a link between

[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:03.440]
Iraq and nine eleven we cannot find evidence that this conversation between mr. Clark and the

[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:07.740]
president ever occurred now can i interrupt you for one second we have done our own work on that

[01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:15.460]
ourselves and we have two sources who tell us independently of dick Clark that there was this

[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:24.260]
encounter one of them was a natural witness look the i stand on what i said but the point i think

[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:29.740]
we're missing in this is of course the president wanted to know if there was any evidence linking a

[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:37.460]
rock to nine eleven so he's not denying the president asked for another review nor is he denying that

[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:44.340]
Clark wrote a memo stating once again that a rock was not involved in nine eleven in fact the white

[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:52.260]
how showed us the memo dated september 18th as Clark said it was bounced back the notation reads

[01:53:52.260 --> 01:54:00.080]
please update and resubmit and it was written by steven hadley i asked him to go back not wrong answer

[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:06.720]
i asked him to go back and check it again a week or two later to make sure there was no new emerging

[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:12.260]
evidence that a rock was involved that's what i was asking him to do some hadley says the whole

[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:18.300]
issue about a rock was moot by the time Clark submitted his memo since the president at a meeting

[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:24.660]
with his war cabinet at camp david had already decided to focus the u.s. response to nine eleven on

[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:31.480]
Afghanistan which is what Clark had been recommending but Clark says it was not moot because the

[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:37.380]
administration wanted to make a rock phase two of the response no matter what happened in Afghanistan

[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:42.800]
you can't distinguish between al-Qaeda and sadam when you talk about the war on terror

[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:50.060]
Clark intends that with statements like that the president continually left an impression that sadam

[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:58.180]
had been involved in nine eleven the white house carefully manipulated public opinion never quite

[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:05.820]
lied but gave the very strong impression that they're right here they knew better and it is

[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:11.060]
deliberate they didn't know better they didn't know better we told them the CIA told them if the

[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:15.780]
CIA told them they didn't know better and the tragedy here is that americans went to their death

[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:22.500]
in a rock thinking that they were avenging september 11th when a rock had nothing to do with september 11th

[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:29.340]
i think for a commander in chief and a vice president to allow that to happen is unconscionable

[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:36.500]
and he thinks the president to this day misinterprets the nature and the scope of the terrorist threat

[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:43.660]
he asked us after nine eleven to give him cards with pictures of the major al-Qaeda leaders

[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:47.660]
and tell us when they were arrested or killed so we could

[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:53.860]
draw x's through their pictures and you know i write in the book i have this image of

[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:59.200]
George Bush sitting by a warm fireplace on the white house drawing x's through al-Qaeda leaders

[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.800]
and thinking that he's got most of them and therefore he's taken care of the problem and while

[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:09.760]
George Bush thinks he's crossing them out one by one there are all these new al-Qaeda people

[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:14.580]
who are being recruited who hate the united states enlarge measure because of what Bush has done

[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:20.920]
he says that the war in iraq has not only inflamed anti-americanism in the Arab world

[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:27.640]
it drained resources away from the fight in afghanistan and the push to eliminate Osama bin Laden

[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:34.060]
is not correct iraq as the president has said is at the center in war and terror

[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:39.220]
we have narrowed the ground available to al-Qaeda and to the terrorists there's sanctuary in

[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:44.160]
afghanistan is gone there's sanctuary in iraq is gone Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are now

[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:50.160]
allies on the war and terror so iraq is contributed in that way to narrowing the sanctuaries

[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:57.800]
available to terrorists don't you think that iraq the middle east and the world is better off

[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:03.280]
with Saddam Hussein out of power i think it's just a why we held you that that's the reason

[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:07.940]
i think the world would be better off if a number of leaders around the world were out of power

[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:14.580]
the question is what price should the united states pay the price we paid was very very high and

[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:19.620]
we're still paying that price what do you mean we some have been lawden have been saying for years

[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:27.240]
america wants to invade an arab country and occupy it an oil rich arab country he'd been saying

[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:33.100]
this this is part of his propaganda so what did we do after 9-11 we invade an oil rich and occupy

[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:38.300]
an oil rich arab country which was doing nothing to threaten us in other words we

[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:45.560]
stepped right into bin Laden's propaganda and the result of that is that al-Qaeda and

[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:51.420]
organizations like it offshoots of it second-generation al-Qaeda have been greatly strengthened

[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:57.060]
exhibit a he now says is the attack on the passenger trains in Madrid

[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:05.060]
ticklerk work for Reagan Bush one Clinton and now here he has a track record

[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:12.700]
why do you think a man with those credentials would be so completely critical of the way this

[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:17.400]
administration has handled the war on terrorism well i don't know i've not read the book i don't

[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:22.280]
know we said about the prior administration which again uh was in office and dealing with this

[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:28.120]
problem for eight years we were in the office dealing with this problem for 230 days the time when

[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:33.240]
he left us the conversations i had with him was that he was pleased that the leadership

[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:39.900]
provided by the president he did tell you he was pleased when he left my my belief was that he

[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:45.700]
appreciated the leadership that the president had provided but there's no hint of that in his book

[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:52.780]
or in our interview when clerk worked for president clinton he was known as the terrorism czar

[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:59.080]
when george bush came into office though he kept clerk on at the white house he stripped him of his

[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:06.260]
cabinet level rank they demoted you aren't you open to charges that this is all sour grapes because

[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:14.020]
they demoted you and reduced your leverage your power in the white house no frankly if i had been

[01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:20.860]
so upset that the national coordinator for counter terrorism had been down graded from a cabinet level

[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:26.440]
position to the staff level position if that had bothered me enough i would quit i didn't quit

[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:33.680]
not for another two years he finally resigned last year after 30 years in government service

[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:39.860]
the senior white house official told us he thinks clarts book is an audition for a job in the carry

[01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:46.560]
campaign are you working to defeat bush and are you working to help carry get elected no i'm not

[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:52.300]
working for carry i'm independent i'm not working for the carry campaign we're here at harvard right

[01:59:52.300 --> 01:59:59.840]
now you teach a course at the Kennedy school with carries national security advisor um-huh

[02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:06.270]
i have worked for Ronald Reagan i have worked for george bush the first i have worked for george bush the

[02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:12.010]
second i'm not participating in this campaign but i am putting facts out that i think people ought to

[02:00:12.010 --> 02:00:20.370]
know looking back on september 11th the day itself beside the attacks and the in the horrible

[02:00:20.370 --> 02:00:29.730]
images of those planes hitting what do you remember i remember trying very hard to keep my

[02:00:29.730 --> 02:00:38.350]
emotions in check i knew people in the Pentagon i knew people in the world trade center

[02:00:39.630 --> 02:00:45.850]
i assumed that friends of mine had died and in fact it turned out they had i felt an enormous

[02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:53.950]
rage and anger against al-Qaeda but also a rage and anger against the u.s. government that we

[02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:59.470]
hadn't been able to stop this well i'll tell you something some of that rage is in this book

[02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:07.350]
well it should be over the weekend we got a note from the Pentagon saying any suggestion that

[02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:12.950]
the president did anything other than act aggressively quickly and effectively to address the

[02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:21.090]
al-Qaeda and Taliban threat in Afghanistan is absurd there's that ticket and i keep sound like

[02:01:21.090 --> 02:01:26.670]
did you see the goddess on us again no i was watching jerry oh shame on you there she was looking

[02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:31.850]
to a really butch talk thirty two at five sixty w.e.c. it's the last mortgage eleverney the only one

[02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:36.130]
mortgage from financial group the benefits are incredibly pay zero closing costs zero application

[02:01:36.130 --> 02:01:41.550]
fee zero credit fee and zero discounted points get the new low interest rate of just one point

[02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:45.750]

[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:27.460]
ready

[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:34.020]
And in our king is an idiot.

[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:40.200]
I don't know why they want to die, but now he's here.

[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:43.300]
First groom's in there for years.

[02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:45.680]
With President Thump's studded.

[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:54.960]
Oh, what I get to go both once more.

[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:02.240]
And get to we all voted for one.

[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:05.000]
Here you want this.

[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:10.700]
Don't love love, lips drumming stupidly.

[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:16.060]
Don't love love, mindless drunk, it rich kid.

[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:21.360]
Don't love love, he's even lumber than me.

[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:25.460]
He's President Thump's studded.

[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:27.580]
Yeah, don't care what it took.

[02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:31.200]
You got him in by hooker cross with the Christmas.

[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.000]
Oh, I know what's best for you and I, but how don't feel?

[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:38.720]
We've got a great leader here.

[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:41.580]
Oh, with President Thump's studded.

[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:44.460]
President Thump's studded.

[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:47.140]
President Thump's studded.

[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.700]
President Thump's studded.

[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:51.080]
2121 of class 60.

[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:52.400]
Good bleeps in there, thank the Lord.

[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:53.660]
Thank goodness for that, huh?

[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.140]
Yeah, thank you.

[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:57.700]
849 votes on the pool.

[02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:01.140]
By the way, we need, let's see, 262 more people to, uh,

[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:04.620]
side of petition on stopfcc.com by 2 o'clock.

[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:06.180]
Or we're going to be pissed off.

[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:09.520]
That'll get us to a nice even 9,000 so far.

[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:10.960]
And that'd be good.

[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.040]
We'll take it.

[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:12.800]
So far.

[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:15.260]
Well, with all the FCC crap going on,

[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:17.380]
Neal should we ask 849 votes.

[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:19.800]
Just keep, uh, rip and push and ask 571,

[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:23.980]
which I think Richard Clark did a magnificent job at doing.

[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:27.040]
Keep going as best he can 168.

[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:27.920]
Retire!

[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:28.880]
Look at that.

[02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:30.780]
54. It's up to 6.3%.

[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:32.200]
In fact, you've been watching that going up

[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:33.920]
as I was playing the Leslie Stallpes.

[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:36.360]
I can't imagine all those people are like me to be off the air.

[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:36.660]
Can you?

[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:38.160]
Oh, no, I can't imagine.

[02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:40.020]
Do a sports show 18.

[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:42.620]
Do a hockey show 17.

[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:47.180]
Go back to all bedtime stories 14 and play music only 7.

[02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:47.820]
Damn it.

[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:49.020]
Only 7.

[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:50.240]
For playing music.

[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:52.920]
It's wrong with these people.

[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:56.060]
Here's the facts from a chronic in Bokus,

[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:57.720]
says thanks for playing the 60 minutes audio.

[02:05:57.940 --> 02:05:58.500]
Enjoy the show.

[02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:01.740]
Uh, he says, not you might be used to know that up here in central Florida,

[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:02.900]
QM is coming in fine,

[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:06.720]
but is surrounded by right wing Orlando stations at 540 and 580.

[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:07.340]
We're surrounded.

[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:10.700]
So I listen to Richard Clark calmly tell the truth,

[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.440]
one can with just a touch of a finger to the radio just down to rush.

[02:06:14.980 --> 02:06:18.540]
They're trying to rewrite history to save John Kerry or up to Neil Bush.

[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:19.760]
Are Neil Boards?

[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:24.440]
The same coveted owns CBS is publishing that book Endless Loud Lies.

[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:27.640]
Well, I miss Fudge, must have Neil Boards worked up to a frenzy.

[02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:31.400]
Yeah, the goddess was on CNN, they were with that right wing sportser, Armstrong Williams.

[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.120]
What a contrast.

[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.020]
Keep the truth coming.

[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:35.680]
He says go natural as soon as you can.

[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:36.840]
Oh, what a joker.

[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:38.520]
Back to George P.S.

[02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:42.380]
Found stop FCC.com several weeks ago through a mention on move on.org.

[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:45.280]
Groups like that with large memberships need to keep pushing on that.

[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:45.680]
And you're right.

[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.900]
All you people that are involved in move on.org, you should get them off the dime.

[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:53.280]
We could have our million signatures in no time.

[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.740]
Couldn't we if they would really push this instead of just, you know,

[02:06:55.980 --> 02:06:57.400]
a little mention here or a link there?

[02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:58.240]
That's not good enough.

[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:00.040]
You got to keep pushing it, man.

[02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:03.080]
Am I right or what?

[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:05.240]
Look at he split it could be done.

[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:06.760]
Ah, there he goes again.

[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:08.160]
Jack, did you hear him say that in Friday?

[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:09.060]
I heard it.

[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:09.420]
Yeah.

[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:11.160]
See, he's monitoring you now.

[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:12.100]
You don't realize it.

[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:13.820]
He's monitoring your actions.

[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:14.740]
I'll get you.

[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:16.600]
19 till one.

[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:20.760]
The mad dog, it to the Humper from Windom, Nassau, Crystal Palace, 4 to 7 to 7.

[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.600]
The Humper in a Bahamas, man.

[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:24.660]
And then Hurricane Outline at 7.

[02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:29.000]
Orlando, El Segiri, the big 8 to 10, who was embarrassingly a week with Mo this morning.

[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:30.500]
What was he doing on the this morning?

[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:32.820]
Sitting in for a gully.

[02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:35.220]
Avikade 10 and sporting news radio overnight.

[02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:35.880]
Oh, but why?

[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:37.160]
What is he doing on there?

[02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:42.720]
Oh, I mean, Mo by himself is better enough, but Mo and the big Mo and O.

[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:44.540]
Oh, man, that's an Omo.

[02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:46.080]
Yeah, the Omo show.

[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:50.100]
I've been telling you for years, you ought to call Donald Matrist 1-800 Matrist.

[02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:54.900]
They back up everything they say and they're advertising 100%, but their competitors still like to lie a lot.

[02:07:55.660 --> 02:08:00.280]
When you see a Matrist sad making outrageous claims, please do yourself a favor and read that fine print.

[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.080]
There are just tons of lies and BS out there.

[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:03.860]
Here's an example.

[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:09.500]
The ad screen half off, but this only applies to a limited selection of items that you'd never choose anyway.

[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:11.080]
Everything else, of course, full price.

[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:14.000]
And they probably doubled the regular price first anyway.

[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:16.980]
And you'll probably never be able to make a first-range if you don't like it.

[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:20.720]
But at Donald Matrist, the ads had no tiny print and no disclaimers.

[02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:26.920]
When you call 1-800 Matrist, you'll see that the prices are so low, other stores have to offer half off sales just to compete.

[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:29.460]
Now, Donald Matrist has an over 30-day-

[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:30.400]
About 30 men.

[02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:32.480]
...competitive exchange policy on all beds, including yours.

[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:38.220]
And don't forget, when you call Donald Matrist 1-800 Matrist, you're getting company ranked number one in customer satisfaction.

[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:45.800]
From Kendall to Stewart, Palm Beach to Ford Myers, Donald Matrist reminds you to read the fine print because they want you to know what you're buying even if you decide not to buy from them.

[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:51.260]
So what you'd be waiting for, do what I've done for years now when you need new bed, make that one simple call.

[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:53.120]
They'll be there knocking on your door no time at all.

[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:58.400]
Call 1-800- what is it? 1-800 Matrist, that's what I said, or log on to mattress.com.

[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:04.420]
Dialometrist 1-800-MATTR-ESD, honest way, the smart way to get you a great new bed.

[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:10.400]
My, my, and local, here's sports video 560- you and you AM.

[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:31.020]
Tired of playing FCC, fans from me, feeling so censored, my show is now sterile.

[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:40.200]
Don't know what you expect me to be, but under arrest next, take me off my show.

[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:43.560]
Shop, shop, shop, go, that's true, that's not to go.

[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:48.440]
Everywhere that I say is under the microscope.

[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.060]
Don't know who's next to go, get mine, get mine, get mine.

[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:57.300]
Fight, we come so glad, we are everywhere.

[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:02.240]
Here it comes so bad, everything we've done.

[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:06.640]
Fight, we're coming, how we're stirring all I want till now.

[02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:10.980]
It's the way more dirty, but the fire being too.

[02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:22.840]
Now I've got to do promising for 9000, before the 8757 we included in the 23 more singers who's on there by 2 o'clock for 9000.

[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:30.200]
From Portland. Yeah, 243, as all we ask between now and 2 o'clock,

[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.320]
another hour and 12 minutes, you think we can do it? Come on, let's get with it.

[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.240]
What does it take? Like I said in the letter that they never published in the Sun Central,

[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:39.480]
what does it take to get people off their ass?

[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:44.540]
You know, I was going to play the word police there and I just don't, I mean, we can't play it.

[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:50.360]
Oh, so as limited as we were before the Jicca article on Saturday,

[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.980]
we're even a lot more limited now, right? Sure.

[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:57.060]
We can't say G, damn, we can't say this, we can't say that.

[02:10:57.060 --> 02:11:03.220]
And there would be those goody-two shoes people would say, well, you know, you don't need to use that kind of language anyway to do a radio show.

[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:05.280]
You know what it reminds me of?

[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:12.040]
If you want to a theater to see like the big new movie of the day, whatever it might be.

[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:17.760]
And every time they used a four-letter word in the movie and sent it here in the word, you hear like that, right?

[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:20.980]
Well, you don't think started censoring movies at the theater.

[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:25.860]
People would say, what the hell is this all about? We were here in those words in movies 30, 40 years ago.

[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:31.660]
Not no more. If you can't entertain people without that kind of language,

[02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:36.480]
if you can't entertain people like they're all a bunch of five or six-year-olds, then you just ain't no entertainer.

[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:41.980]
Lenny Bruce is rolling over at his grave as what's going on right now.

[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:46.180]
And the public sits back as usual, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like that.

[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:50.380]
Can't get him off the rass, you know, Leslie Stahl, who just like we said before,

[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:53.780]
so what a weak choice to do that very, very important interview.

[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:59.040]
The waterline that just blew me right off the chair.

[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:02.780]
She says, do you think he really risked people's lives?

[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:08.520]
Just like in the Godfather, who's being naive now, okay?

[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.700]
Do you think he really risked people's lives? Well, here's one.

[02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:18.620]
An explosion in Baghdad near a US patrol killed another American soldier and a Iraqi interpreter, the military said.

[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:23.440]
While a car bomb blew up near a US Air Force base north of the Capitol Monday,

[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:26.160]
killing two Iraqi civilians and wounding 25 others,

[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:30.840]
the explosion in Baghdad wounded three US soldiers beside the deaths.

[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:35.340]
Do you think he really risked people's lives based on lies?

[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:39.040]
Based on the fact that they already made up their mind to go in there?

[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:42.760]
Well, there's no good targets in Afghanistan. There's lots of good targets in Iraq.

[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:44.300]
So says Rumi.

[02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:47.320]
And we still have that picture of him shaking hands with his good buddy,

[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:49.440]
a buddy, a Sodom back in the 83.

[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:50.980]
That picture's still there on the website.

[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:56.860]
What does it take to get it across to the American public? They're hopeless.

[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:00.240]
Absolutely positively hopeless.

[02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:05.820]
5667-0560, pound 560 on a GAT and TNT in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:07.580]
Calls today way off.

[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:10.480]
Way week, really weak.

[02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:12.700]
WQA, hello.

[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:14.280]
I'm listening.

[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:16.680]
WQA, hello.

[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:17.760]
Yeah, how you doing, you'll?

[02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:18.280]
Okay.

[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:25.040]
I think CBS would have have a lot more credibility with that story if they had disclosed

[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.000]
that their parent company is...

[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.100]
What's every disarmament?

[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:30.660]
Well, I'm just saying, I think it's going to be a great read,

[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:33.480]
but I think they're self-serving that they're promoting it,

[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.240]
and it's almost conflict of interest.

[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:37.560]
I don't think so.

[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:38.440]
Okay, thanks, Neil.

[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:39.000]
Okay.

[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:42.880]
Parat that the Miss Fudge Line, it's conflict of interest.

[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.100]
Why? Because you never understand that when you got these gigantic companies

[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:50.600]
that own publishing companies and broadcast companies, what does that have to do with it?

[02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:51.640]
Who doesn't own what?

[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:52.280]
Right.

[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:56.260]
But what's all this improved? This guy's just parading again the same thing,

[02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:58.020]
the same right-wing garbage from Miss Fudge.

[02:13:58.400 --> 02:13:59.640]
This is the response now.

[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:04.040]
Let's smear CBS again because they have a vested interest here.

[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:05.040]
They're promoting a book.

[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:06.140]
Forget about the book.

[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:07.340]
Forget about what they're promoting.

[02:14:07.340 --> 02:14:08.740]
Listen to what the guy said.

[02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:10.120]
So if he'd gone on date one,

[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:12.400]
this isn't some raving liberal went on.

[02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:14.500]
It is the guy worked under Reagan and Bush one,

[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:15.980]
and Clinton and Bush two.

[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:22.220]
This isn't like some wild-eyed liberal came on here and made these charges,

[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:24.900]
but don't confuse some of these people with the facts.

[02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:27.920]
And this is the way the right-wing always operates.

[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:31.020]
They've got all the hook words, the buzzwords, the catch phrases, you know.

[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.800]
Just throw that stuff out there and inundate the public with it

[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:36.100]
and pretty soon they'll start to believe it.

[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:39.060]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:40.640]
How you doing, Uncle Neil?

[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:41.420]
Pretty good.

[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.760]
That was a real interesting last night.

[02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:48.580]
It's just every time they put somebody to rebut the gentleman's name,

[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:50.320]
I can't forget the Bush administration.

[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:54.340]
They always do a real good Ralph Crandon imitation, a hominahamina.

[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:58.560]
And CBS, I think, did a pretty good job with getting back to him

[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:02.300]
that it was pretty much like his signature on those notes and certain things.

[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:07.220]
And it just gets to the point that no matter what you put out to American spaces,

[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:09.780]
they're still not going to believe, they're still not going to listen.

[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:13.460]
They can listen to what Russia is, where rewriting his three or two in that.

[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:17.220]
And I just, you know, I don't know what to do, but it's just,

[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.140]
as long as you just keep on pushing along,

[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:21.780]
and maybe some people will listen, it's just,

[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:24.900]
where can you send money on how you guys are going to do that?

[02:15:24.980 --> 02:15:28.360]
We're looking up to, what's the money to get this thing advertised?

[02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:30.160]
Well, we're working on it.

[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.160]
All righty. And you had mentioned something else before about something,

[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:38.520]
somebody mentioned something about, you know,

[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:41.160]
brush something on the show or whatever.

[02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:44.320]
You know, and they just had something in Daytona,

[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:46.040]
where they just busted another hotel,

[02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:47.560]
because the girl lifted her top.

[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:50.140]
Oh, it was with the girls on wild, what the court had said,

[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:51.720]
and they're making money off of that.

[02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:54.700]
But it just depends on what part of the country you are,

[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:56.240]
and what they're going to allow to go on,

[02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:57.200]
and what they're not going to allow.

[02:15:57.520 --> 02:15:58.360]
No, not anymore.

[02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:01.020]
Yeah, well, I guess like you said,

[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:02.420]
it's almost four years ago,

[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:04.800]
it's a start of Nazi Germany here, and I got a lot of money.

[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:05.700]
Okay, good luck to you, Pally.

[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:06.340]
I'll see you at the border.

[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:06.700]
Okay.

[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:08.980]
WQM, hello.

[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:10.520]
Not there, line one.

[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:11.260]
QAM, hello.

[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:11.780]
Neil.

[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:12.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:14.160]
Can you cut me some flat jacket?

[02:16:16.220 --> 02:16:16.820]
WQM, hello.

[02:16:17.220 --> 02:16:17.540]
Hey, Neil.

[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:18.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:21.040]
I voted at stop.cc.com.

[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:22.760]
Thanks for putting up the word.

[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:25.320]
And you keep on everybody get up off the rack.

[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:27.460]
I can't believe you haven't gotten from the Godfather

[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:30.240]
when Sonny is running out of the house and he gets wiped on the causeway.

[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:31.740]
I can't believe you haven't gotten that job.

[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:35.440]
So you can tell everybody the good news from Sonny.

[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:36.780]
What's that?

[02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:39.540]
What does that mean?

[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:40.400]
I don't get it.

[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:41.520]
I was hoping you could explain it.

[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:43.000]
Tell them the good news from Sonny.

[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:45.900]
Okay.

[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:51.600]
567-0560, we need 239 more signatures for 9,000 by 2 o'clock.

[02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:52.900]
That's just the number I picked out of there,

[02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:54.520]
and I thought we could easily get that.

[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:59.060]
In fact, probably we do a public service to stop taking the calls between now and two,

[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:00.520]
and just let them get to their computers.

[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:05.680]
Because I would say there are level of the calls about 90% today on a scale of zero

[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:06.560]
of been minus infinity.

[02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:07.500]
But that's okay.

[02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:09.380]
I mean, there are a lot of stress, a lot of pressure.

[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:14.360]
WQM, hello.

[02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:15.660]
Hey, Neil.

[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:16.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:23.920]
In these trying economic times, I've sworn to let you know of a website called

[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:24.240]
FSTC.

[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:29.340]
I don't know if you've heard of it, but it basically has people on there registering

[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:35.160]
and telling people where the lowest price gasses or the highest price in the last 72 to 84 hours.

[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:35.680]
Right.

[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:38.000]
I found it very useful.

[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:45.480]
Also, my wife and I each went on FSTC.com and it's sort of our vote.

[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:50.860]
And I'm sorry to hear that over 70% of your comedy bits are now unplayable.

[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:52.460]
I would say 90% now.

[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.500]
90% that's unbelievable.

[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:56.300]
All right.

[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:57.540]
I'll see you on the red planet, Neil.

[02:17:57.840 --> 02:17:58.360]
Okay, Pally.

[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:00.140]
Bring the gas.

[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:04.720]
Now see, or nearly if I said bring the gas, I would, you know, decide I would drop in there.

[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:05.620]
We can't do that, no more.

[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:09.460]
You just get in the habit of doing all of these things like it's like getting out of bed

[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:09.800]
in the morning.

[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:10.600]
Can't do it, no more.

[02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:11.520]
All of these things.

[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:11.980]
Right.

[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:14.420]
Can't do this and you can't say that.

[02:18:14.620 --> 02:18:15.280]
And based on what?

[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:16.300]
Well, we just decided.

[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:17.600]
We just made it up.

[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:23.940]
Michael Powell was offended by that booby on TV.

[02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:24.900]
He never saw one before.

[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:26.360]
He never looked in the mirror before, I guess.

[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:29.760]
Just dazzling.

[02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:31.760]
The idea that we're always talking about.

[02:18:31.860 --> 02:18:34.460]
Oh, America, the greatness of men are all the freedoms we've got.

[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:37.180]
And about the freedoms we're going to help them have in Iraq.

[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:38.360]
Let me say it again.

[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:42.460]
I guess he's talking about the freedoms that we used to have here in America.

[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:44.380]
My life and life.

[02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:45.020]
All of these things.

[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:46.760]
420560.

[02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:48.380]
You ain't as you am.

[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:52.740]
Stavantutuawe!

[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:54.260]
Hi, V.

[02:18:56.120 --> 02:19:00.600]
John Aaron McCaxi, Carbate Driver, Central Park.

[02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:03.380]
You look that mean, so quissically.

[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:05.860]
I could tell he was in a dock.

[02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:09.880]
So I acted out my puncture in.

[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:12.640]
And with my arms the trees I made.

[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:15.320]
There's no bug to speak English anymore.

[02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:16.680]
Oh great, great.

[02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:22.120]
I went down to my home and I met which weather.

[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:23.620]
Weather is nice and sunny.

[02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:26.960]
I walked into a liquor store.

[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:28.880]
But the guy there talks real funny.

[02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:32.500]
I asked him for a pint of Holtion Beamy's ass.

[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:34.520]
Now in the end, what does that mean?

[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:36.840]
The butter's too English.

[02:19:37.380 --> 02:19:38.120]
And I'm all.

[02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:41.860]
At the corner deli.

[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.260]
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan.

[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:45.980]
Speak English, melee.

[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:49.320]
Or you can go back to Iraq.

[02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:00.420]
I came here many years ago.

[02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:02.880]
Learned my ABCs.

[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:05.820]
I don't say much is grossiest.

[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:07.540]
I say pretty pretty.

[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:12.260]
So get yourself to a classroom quick here in America now.

[02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:13.540]
Stop making mistakes.

[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:15.860]
You know what I speak English.

[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:20.740]
We're going to do a 560 WQM.

[02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:25.020]
8771 Florida petitionless signatures on at stopfcc.com.

[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:27.280]
229 go in a hour.

[02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:27.860]
Can we do it?

[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:28.800]
Not even close.

[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:30.780]
We won't come into the million miles.

[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:31.780]
That's sad.

[02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:34.020]
No, we'll do something eventually.

[02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:36.820]
What does that mean?

[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:37.620]
It's all good.

[02:20:37.800 --> 02:20:38.560]
Every little bit helps.

[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:39.900]
We'll do something eventually.

[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:42.280]
I don't get the significance of that statement.

[02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.560]
We'll do the fundraising thing and all that.

[02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:45.400]
I see.

[02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:49.360]
Well, it's just disappointing though that these people just don't get it.

[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.300]
They just, I mean, you know, they're some who did.

[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:53.900]
But I think we've shot our so far.

[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:55.240]
You know, my catch my grip.

[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:56.500]
So far.

[02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:58.560]
Last week, two or three days.

[02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:00.440]
And there was this big response in everybody.

[02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:02.160]
But that said, the rest of them don't care.

[02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:05.140]
They don't care enough to send their very best or even their very worst.

[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:09.860]
You think they want a big big shot big time.

[02:21:09.960 --> 02:21:11.240]
A schmuck like me gets on air.

[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:12.160]
Can we say schmuck?

[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:12.380]
No.

[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:13.120]
I don't think so.

[02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:14.460]
A big time like me.

[02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:20.680]
I mean, people think that I'm exaggerating that I'm bellishing this.

[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:22.420]
We don't know what the hell we can say anymore.

[02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:26.040]
And the idea that we got some brought over there in Naples who sit in there

[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:28.160]
who fancies herself as some hot shot attorney.

[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:31.580]
And she's sitting there making these decisions now based on the best advice

[02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:32.580]
in our corporate lawyers.

[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:33.760]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:36.900]
What the hell does that mean?

[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:38.540]
I think the music thing is the answer.

[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:39.800]
Maybe you don't have to worry about any words.

[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:41.440]
Of course, then you got to worry about the words in the music.

[02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:44.300]
But it's very easy to like instrumental's baby.

[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:46.220]
Yeah.

[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:49.080]
All ventures all day.

[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:52.000]
Make sure that none of those instruments sound anything like a sound effect.

[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:53.740]
So maybe I like to heal them by the chance.

[02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:55.500]
So once in a while, we're throwing a little chance.

[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:57.460]
Lots of adventures.

[02:21:57.820 --> 02:21:58.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:21:58.340 --> 02:21:58.900]
Love the ventures.

[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:02.320]
Maybe a little bit Mitch Miller, although they had some vocals.

[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:02.800]
Right.

[02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:03.780]
How about Ray Coniff?

[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:06.140]
We got Frank Nils, like the music box dancer guy.

[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:08.100]
And how about some polkas sound good to me?

[02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:08.640]
Right.

[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:09.540]
John Tash.

[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:10.940]
We got a CD in here somewhere.

[02:22:11.540 --> 02:22:11.780]
Right.

[02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:16.480]
Although, we got some polkas in here, but not really sure we can play like this one.

[02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:17.240]
We can play this one.

[02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:17.340]
Yeah.

[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:19.460]
I'm not going to lose it.

[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:21.760]
I'm not going to lose it.

[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:23.760]
Oh.

[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:28.140]
You're a turd.

[02:22:58.100 --> 02:22:58.980]
Oh, Raspberry.

[02:22:59.280 --> 02:22:59.420]
Hey.

[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:05.460]
After clarifying when it's a Raspberry, 560560.

[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:11.640]
560 on the AT&T line with all the FCC crap going on, Nils should do what is our poll question

[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:12.980]
843 votes.

[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:15.760]
Just keep ripping Bush and ad 639.

[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.940]
Keep going as Vesti can, what 84?

[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:20.140]
Retire.

[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:21.480]
57.

[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.720]
6% say I should retire.

[02:23:24.140 --> 02:23:25.160]
Not a bad idea.

[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:25.940]
Send me some money.

[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:31.360]
In fact, instead of raising money for the ads for stop FCC.com, how about just my retirement

[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:32.460]
fund sounds good instead?

[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:34.160]
Okay.

[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:36.080]
Do a sports show 21.

[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:38.000]
Do a hockey show 21.

[02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:40.740]
Go back to all bedtime stories 14.

[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:42.180]
Well, that hasn't moved even one vote.

[02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:43.080]
They hated that.

[02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:47.540]
In fact, 50 people who did like it, they probably go on now anyway.

[02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:51.720]
Not enough bedtime music 7 out of 943 votes.

[02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:56.420]
Under God, key phrase for court this week.

[02:23:57.180 --> 02:23:58.080]
No, God.

[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:00.620]
I love this.

[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:01.980]
I think we'll do the poll on it tomorrow.

[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:05.860]
Boston Gloves taking their own poll on it.

[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:08.580]
And it's about 50-50 last time I checked.

[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:12.540]
It's about even steam or shocks the hell out of me, especially with all the good cat looks up there in the England.

[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:24.440]
The Supreme Court plunges back into the nation's culture wars this week exploring a new the role that religion can play in public life as the Justices examine the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance.

[02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:31.540]
And I'm one of those old folks old enough to remember before they used to go step us along and make us say under God in the Pledge of Allegiance.

[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:34.220]
In Jesus' name, Amen.

[02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:40.300]
On Wednesday morning, the Justices will hold a one hour hearing with attorneys over the meaning of the words in the pledge,

[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:42.880]
affirming that America exists under God.

[02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:43.900]
Deal, God.

[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:50.820]
A phrase that appeals courts at a Monterey religious exercise and must be omitted when public schoolchildren recite the pledge.

[02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:52.180]
And those people who say that are.

[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:53.600]
Absolutely correct.

[02:24:53.880 --> 02:25:02.680]
The lower court ruling has been condemned by President Bush, both houses of Congress and a multitude of political religious and conservative advocacy organizations, organizations.

[02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:09.500]
And has produced 51 legal briefs more than in most cases arguing the pros and cons of the issues before the Supreme Court.

[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:26.520]
The Tutor on ruling in February 2003 by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Basin San Francisco as one of the support of a number of organizations, including Americans United for Separation of Church in State, the ACU and various atheist groups, as well as a number of scholars of law, history and religion.

[02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:33.580]
Americans United calls the case the most controversial religion in schools case since the school prayer decision of the early 60s.

[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:35.880]
That's 1960s.

[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:44.420]
If the Justices decide that the phrase under God makes the pledge like a prayer, they could strike down its use in public schools, the only setting at issue in a case.

[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:53.560]
But if they're persuaded instead that the phrases they pay throughout the expression, like the Declaration of Independence and the Statement of Basic Rights come from the Creator, they probably would uphold the pledge.

[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:01.980]
The ruling on that, and by the way, not only do we force kids to recite the Declaration of Independence in schools.

[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:05.280]
No, no. So where's the connection? I don't get it.

[02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:13.120]
But it's a patriotic expression. I didn't know that God was all that patriotic. I thought he liked the Jews over there, although lately he wouldn't know it.

[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:22.020]
The ruling on that constitutional question could be difficult for the Court either way said Brett G. Sharf, a law professor at Brigham Young,

[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:30.340]
he liked some young. The Court in this case is reaping the consequences of decades of vacillating an uncertain doctrine in this area of law.

[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:36.120]
The relationship between government and religion, the pledge Kate Sharf said, may give the Court an opportunity to clarify its doctrine.

[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:43.380]
Although ruling either way on the pledge to be a major event in constitutional law, two factors may prevent the Court from deciding the question at all.

[02:26:43.380 --> 02:26:59.860]
First, only eight of the nine justices will hear the case and decide it. Oh, here's some great news. Great news. Finally, Justice Antonin Scalia recuse himself from the case after questions were raised about his impartiality because of Sharf public criticism he had made of the nine-circuit decision.

[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:10.320]
Scalia's absence from the pledge case raises the prospect of a four-to-four split, which would simply uphold the appeal-score decision against the undergod of phrase, but without an opinion by the justices.

[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:20.240]
That would make the appeal-score decision binding only in California and the eight other states include in the nine-circuit, but that would be a considerable result affecting nine million public school students to which we say.

[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:20.740]
Oh, right.

[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:27.640]
Yeah. Second, a basic question is there was no more of the Supreme Court lower courts have the authority to decide the case.

[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:38.280]
That question involves that dispute going increasing with complexes, the case unfolded about whether the California atheist who successfully challenged the pledge recital in public schools had a legal right to bring his case.

[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:41.680]
If he did not, his lawsuit would be dismissed and the pledge was tant as it is.

[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:50.100]
But that would make the issue go away as a conservative advocacy group, the AC at the American Civil Rights Union told the court in a legal brief.

[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:58.400]
There should be no doubt that if this case is dismissed without decision, another test case on the same issue will be brought somewhere in a country and in about three years that case will arrive in this corporate determination.

[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:04.820]
In the meantime, it added school districts across the nation would have no reliable idea of whatever teachers could lead students in the pledges recital.

[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:06.760]
Kind of like us here on the year, you know what?

[02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:14.480]
They have no guidance. We don't know what the law is today. It's one thing tomorrow. Something else today. You can say tomorrow you can't say it Wednesday.

[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:17.520]
Maybe we can say Thursday we can't say crap.

[02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:27.840]
The fact that there are people just forming at the mouth about this about what's going on with freedom of speech in this country is staggering to me.

[02:28:28.060 --> 02:28:29.120]
It's amazing.

[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:39.400]
It's not just about how it's stirring or above a love sponge or the two guys that got suspended in Atlanta or all of these other fines and firings and suspensions going on and threats.

[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:44.600]
We're going to take away your license. We're going to find you $50 million.

[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:50.100]
I still say they ought to make it $10 trillion. Everything wants to say, huh?

[02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:52.600]
If you tend to say crap, it should be $10 million.

[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:58.700]
Take your pinky. So crap, crap, crap. There's there's 30 million right there. How do you like that?

[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:00.140]
Oh my god.

[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:01.260]
30 million.

[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:04.880]
Yeah. 30 million for crap.

[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:13.100]
Here's the fact that says I understand most anti-bush advocates people to make when it comes down to the bush followers not believing in the lives of the administration.

[02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:17.040]
I honestly believe many of the Bush rights and new widths so all eyes believe in the agenda.

[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:24.460]
The approve of takeover of weaker nations and the destruction of other societies.

[02:29:24.460 --> 02:29:26.780]
This is a little bit too soon and lecture for me.

[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.220]
Let's see. Is any windows illegal? No.

[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:33.720]
I mean, can you play the if you think this is a song is dirty go up yourself?

[02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:37.760]
Well, no, see that that's farmer's daughter.

[02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:39.280]
Right.

[02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:44.100]
Also, this one's signed the stop FCC.com. Thank you.

[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:49.720]
Now we can play that because the words aren't there. They just don't exist.

[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:56.980]
I mean, if they're there in your mind, that's up to you. That means you've got a potty mouth dirty mind like most of us, but they're not there.

[02:29:57.820 --> 02:30:00.380]
In fact, I think I'm going to play that after the break. There's absolutely nothing wrong.

[02:30:00.620 --> 02:30:03.900]
That's one of the few that we can play that's even like a little bit suggestive.

[02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:10.900]
But double on time now can't do no double on time or triple on time and quadruple on time 50 years in jail.

[02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:16.880]
No parole. No really parole for good behavior for quadruple on time.

[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:25.660]
But I'm sure that our brain trusted QA and I working feverishly right now they're emailing and they're calling and they're they're crying.

[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:30.360]
Oh, Greg, what are we going to do to get us all the answers we need, aren't they?

[02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:36.960]
Yeah, sure. It's so tough to stick to those diets, man.

[02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:40.440]
A lot of them sound good in the beginning and then you lose interest and you have to count calories.

[02:33:35.100 --> 02:33:38.720]
If you think this is dirty, you can go f*** yourself.

[02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:41.200]
Excellent! Thank you for the good job.

[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:43.400]
F*** whoever did that. They did. Came that way.

[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:44.740]
Oh, that's what I meant.

[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:53.720]
118 is 560 WQM Mike Faxes and says MimeyGasPrices.com. Check out what bushes, buddies, paying gas. Love your show. See you at the border.

[02:33:54.140 --> 02:33:55.220]
Hi, I'll hitler says Mike.

[02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:01.780]
Pretty sad. Thanks for those low gas prices, Mr. President.

[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:03.000]
Thank you very much.

[02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:10.840]
560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. The calls have been fabulous today. Make no mistake about it.

[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:12.180]
WQM, hello.

[02:34:12.820 --> 02:34:15.460]
Hey, Mr. Ryzen, how you doing? I'm finally guys.

[02:34:15.460 --> 02:34:15.520]
Okay.

[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:19.900]
Right wing about out and date. They out the date of panic.

[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:23.780]
Tania with a large ass right now, man.

[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:25.160]
Yeah.

[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:29.060]
They scrambling the date, man. I think this is what purpose means.

[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:32.720]
If this guy was sent to bad personal, sent to them.

[02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:38.520]
Why didn't they make the said now? I mean, why wouldn't he that bad when they kept them from Britain administration?

[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:40.860]
If this guy, this car guy was so bad.

[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:44.880]
What about Reagan and Bush one about daddy?

[02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:48.760]
This is what I'm saying. This guy's been up for 30 years. All of a sudden now he's been up.

[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:49.940]
By turn, man.

[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:53.120]
But they kept it. Listen, let me explain something to you, Neil.

[02:34:53.340 --> 02:34:53.860]
Explain it.

[02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:56.080]
These people here are so corrupt.

[02:34:56.520 --> 02:35:01.360]
You know what I mean? And this one hundred payment for I go, because I'm about out of mature.

[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:02.500]
I just want to be that fire.

[02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:06.460]
George Terry shouldn't be ashamed to say what he feels and me.

[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:08.220]
What he say. These people are corrupt.

[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:10.420]
I would so happy when he said that.

[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:14.220]
If you want to get the post, if you want to get the post of this country, listen to the speech, man.

[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:17.300]
They have some real idiot calling me into this show.

[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:18.020]
Yeah.

[02:35:18.140 --> 02:35:19.600]
You really see what we do with it.

[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:20.220]
I'm the American man.

[02:35:20.260 --> 02:35:20.580]
I said.

[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:23.240]
Oh, okay.

[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:24.060]
Polly, hang in there.

[02:35:24.180 --> 02:35:24.720]
See the border.

[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:27.560]
I don't think it was in 8798.

[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:29.020]
We're not making much progress.

[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:32.080]
You're two hundred and two away from 9000 on stopfcc.com.

[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:36.060]
I don't know what it, like I said, what it takes, but we're not going to bust the gut about it.

[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:38.060]
Bust the one?

[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:38.660]
Gut.

[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:40.160]
Top of gut.

[02:35:41.180 --> 02:35:42.600]
You can't play it.

[02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:44.820]
We can say it. We can't play it.

[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.220]
Can't say this. No more.

[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:49.800]
But they definitely don't care.

[02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:51.660]
Hey, listen, don't bother.

[02:35:51.740 --> 02:35:52.500]
You don't bother me.

[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:55.100]
We can play the same five bits over and over again.

[02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:56.260]
I could pay the same.

[02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:57.400]
I said we won't get a bonus.

[02:35:57.880 --> 02:35:58.140]
Yeah.

[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:00.540]
Well, so we won't get no more bonus.

[02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:01.300]
Oh, well.

[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:01.880]
This way it goes.

[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:04.200]
The onus is on the bonus.

[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:06.860]
What about that under God business?

[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:08.100]
Well, we'll do that tomorrow.

[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:09.200]
We'll take the poll.

[02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:13.880]
The now the Boston Globe and their polls.

[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:14.720]
Interesting the way that.

[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:17.200]
And I notice since I mentioned it, it's probably our people.

[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:21.220]
Probably people going on Boston, Boston.com, which is the Globe's website.

[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:22.620]
Go ahead. Have a good time.

[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:25.040]
I noticed it's kind of like 47 to 40.

[02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:26.920]
Do want to keep the plates away.

[02:36:27.020 --> 02:36:27.800]
It is now with the under God.

[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:30.500]
And then the other 13 or 12 percent, whatever was it.

[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:32.360]
Who the hell cares?

[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:35.060]
Aren't there more important things for the Supreme Court to be worried about right now?

[02:36:36.100 --> 02:36:37.300]
Not just one of them things.

[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:41.240]
Like maybe freedom of speech, something like that, like the Bill of Rights.

[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:42.300]
You can't have that.

[02:36:42.300 --> 02:36:44.200]
You can't have freedom of speech.

[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:46.040]
We'll decide what speech it is.

[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:49.380]
And then we'll let you know maybe one of these days and maybe not.

[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:50.560]
So you just keep guessing.

[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:54.620]
That's what amuses me about our middle-level management people is.

[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:57.340]
Well, gee, I mean we gave it that list last week.

[02:36:57.800 --> 02:36:58.540]
Oh, gee.

[02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:01.260]
We want some guidelines.

[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:02.800]
We want a company policy.

[02:37:03.020 --> 02:37:03.140]
Okay.

[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:05.020]
We want some rules and regs.

[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:08.220]
We want a road with some speed limit signs on it.

[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:10.500]
88-09.

[02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:12.520]
Just not just drive it down the big Hershey highway.

[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:15.220]
Okay, although Muff probably has been down that road a few times.

[02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:16.920]
See what I mean?

[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:17.820]
There you go again.

[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:20.400]
88-09.

[02:37:23.220 --> 02:37:23.900]
191 away.

[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:24.780]
Do you think we can make it?

[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:30.400]
Hello?

[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:31.860]
Oh, boy.

[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:33.460]
He's laughing.

[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:36.420]
It wasn't that good.

[02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:38.540]
Oh, that's not what he said.

[02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:40.640]
It was probably true, but it wasn't that good.

[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:46.380]
See now there's another one that is right along that line.

[02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:46.840]
Careful.

[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:48.040]
Right on the edge.

[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:51.240]
I think on the safe side, but nevertheless, I don't think it would say that.

[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:52.020]
No, you know.

[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:54.600]
WQAM, hello.

[02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:58.040]
And nice talking to you too.

[02:37:58.260 --> 02:37:58.960]
WQAM, hello.

[02:37:59.520 --> 02:37:59.960]
Neil.

[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:00.780]
Yes, sir.

[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:01.600]
How you doing?

[02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:05.420]
Yeah, I just wanted to call about the freedom of speech as you would in the censorship.

[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:10.740]
When I got to high school in mid-80s, there was this older guy I worked with.

[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:14.280]
And he told me a story back in 1939 when he went and sing gone with the wind.

[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:17.580]
He said that when he said, frankly, starlet, I don't give a damn.

[02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:22.360]
The whole theater was like, oh my gosh, did he say, damn, oh my god, are you crazy?

[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:24.800]
They made such a big deal with it.

[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:26.100]
Oh my god.

[02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:28.260]
It was unbelievable.

[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:30.640]
That was just like we were going to look back at this.

[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:32.620]
That was 65 years ago, man.

[02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:35.580]
65 years ago, and now we're making them look progressive.

[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:39.340]
All right, Neil.

[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:40.500]
Thanks again, Pallion.

[02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:41.520]
Don't say again, damn it.

[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:41.880]
I'm out.

[02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:42.320]
See you.

[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:42.560]
Thanks.

[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:45.720]
80809.

[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:49.680]
We need to 191 people out there who care enough to send their very best.

[02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:53.640]
I'm sure that if we just push it and plug it and crank it and twist it.

[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:54.900]
Oh, we can't say that either.

[02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:55.940]
No.

[02:38:57.160 --> 02:38:58.620]
You're sitting right there at your computer.

[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:00.800]
All of you idiots there at QAM.

[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:02.760]
I'm a girl cared enough to send his very best.

[02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:04.180]
He signed on a petition.

[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:05.300]
What about Josh?

[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:06.020]
Did you do it?

[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:06.480]
I did.

[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:07.620]
Josh did it.

[02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:08.740]
George did it.

[02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:09.540]
I did it.

[02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:13.060]
Anybody else in an establishment probably not.

[02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:14.160]
But your mom didn't do it.

[02:39:14.940 --> 02:39:15.840]
She don't have no computer.

[02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:16.720]
Hey, my fault.

[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:17.740]
Right.

[02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:20.080]
She didn't have no computer.

[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:23.220]
What do you mean Josh is mom?

[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:25.820]
I bet you your mom didn't do it either, George.

[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:26.500]
You're mom, yeah.

[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:27.000]
No, mom.

[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.060]
Yeah, your mom didn't do it either.

[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:28.980]
She don't know nothing.

[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:32.520]
Everybody's got a computer and if not they can go steal one real quick, okay?

[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:37.380]
In fact, you can go right now in any of those places.

[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:40.200]
They're all over the place and spider-jorge is ignorance about them.

[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:41.900]
All those internet cafe places.

[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:43.240]
They're all over the here and Toronto.

[02:39:43.240 --> 02:39:44.240]
There's one in every corner.

[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:45.820]
I just said I didn't see any down here.

[02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:46.940]
Internet cafe.

[02:39:47.140 --> 02:39:48.240]
Pop a little change in that machine.

[02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:50.840]
They give it a little little ticket comes out with a number on it.

[02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:51.560]
You pop that number.

[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:52.760]
You put it in there and bottom bank.

[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:53.660]
You're on the internet.

[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:56.980]
For just a few cents you can be on there long enough to go out there.

[02:39:56.980 --> 02:39:59.800]
You can go to stopfcc.com and sign a petition.

[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:00.800]
Put your name in a dry.

[02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:02.160]
You don't even have to put your address on there.

[02:40:02.220 --> 02:40:03.160]
Just the city where you live.

[02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:04.420]
You don't have to put your shoe size.

[02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:05.560]
See, there are a whole lot of people.

[02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:06.480]
Oh, gee, I'm scared.

[02:40:06.620 --> 02:40:07.400]
I don't want to put mine in.

[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:07.880]
Why not?

[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:11.760]
If you're that scared of the American government, then you should be moving right now.

[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:13.300]
You should be on a banana boat somewhere.

[02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:14.800]
If you're really that scared.

[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:15.760]
I'm throwing you.

[02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:20.940]
As much as much content as I have for the present government there.

[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:25.440]
I mean, if you're that nervous about it, then how the hell can you possibly still be in America?

[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:29.040]
Catch my drift?

[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:29.980]
Well, they got their guns.

[02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:32.560]
Let me just see.

[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:35.340]
It's hard to refresh this thing because it doesn't have an 88-16.

[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:36.300]
Well, what do you do?

[02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:38.120]
We got seven more there while I was writing in Raven.

[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:39.040]
Then eight good enough.

[02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:41.120]
That's not good enough.

[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:42.580]
They ought to be coming in here.

[02:40:42.660 --> 02:40:43.960]
I don't understand this thing.

[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:49.860]
I'm not saying they're getting a million signatures guarantees that we're going to get these clowns to back off.

[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:53.440]
But it's a hell of a way to make the politics and sit up in an election year and take a look and say,

[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:56.740]
wow, people are pissed off and fired up and they're not going to take any more of this.

[02:40:56.920 --> 02:40:58.200]
We better start looking at this.

[02:40:59.580 --> 02:41:08.360]
We better start addressing the issue as opposed to just posturing as moral goody two shoes who are wholelier than now because we think that's the perception of public wants of us.

[02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:08.920]
Vlony.

[02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:11.920]
We know you're all about your perverts, all you people in Congress.

[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:13.740]
You're a bunch of perverts just like we are.

[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:18.380]
So why don't you just loosen up a little bit and stop the crap.

[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:19.680]
Crap. Say it again.

[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:20.840]
And smell over the cake. Crap.

[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:23.840]
Don't they make that good macaroni and cheese crap?

[02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:24.600]
Yeah, it is.

[02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:26.020]
I do like that.

[02:41:26.180 --> 02:41:26.680]
Can't eat it.

[02:41:26.740 --> 02:41:27.520]
But poor. I do not.

[02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:28.580]
I want that brand.

[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:30.120]
You know, no.

[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:31.200]
What's the good one?

[02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:32.420]
All of the other ones.

[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:33.480]
Borden makes a nice one.

[02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:34.480]
You know what's really good?

[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:36.020]
Yeah, I do.

[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:36.740]
But what are you thinking about?

[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:37.960]
Hamburger Helper.

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:39.100]
Oh, yeah. I agree.

[02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:39.940]
Wow.

[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:40.620]
You know it.

[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:42.340]
But I told you those stories.

[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:44.720]
What I used to do in Sarasota when I weighed 50,000 pounds.

[02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:45.780]
Hamburger less helper.

[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:49.500]
I cook up the whole thing with a hamburger with a pound of hamburger.

[02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:52.760]
Cook up the whole thing, give me a big jug of Hawaiian punch with sugar.

[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:54.160]
I need that pie.

[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:54.800]
And watch out.

[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:55.820]
Like the football game.

[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:56.460]
College football.

[02:41:56.480 --> 02:41:57.180]
A Saturday afternoon.

[02:41:57.180 --> 02:41:57.880]
Eat the whole thing.

[02:41:58.060 --> 02:41:59.000]
And you weren't even a smoker.

[02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:01.020]
I mean, I want to pipe.

[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:01.460]
I smoke.

[02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:02.940]
Ah, and I see.

[02:42:03.060 --> 02:42:04.080]
Josh, did you notice that?

[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:04.800]
Mark the time down.

[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:07.440]
Mark down the time.

[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:08.200]
126.

[02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:10.420]
Monday, March 22.

[02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:11.920]
We are a pie's promoting food.

[02:42:12.260 --> 02:42:13.380]
He's promoting drug paraphernalia.

[02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:16.440]
And not only that, but he's promoting that potty mouth.

[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:16.840]
Hurrah.

[02:42:18.460 --> 02:42:18.860]
Hurrah.

[02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:18.980]
Wow.

[02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:22.380]
Thanks a lot for Rob, by the way, for being on the station because it was his, all of that

[02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:23.040]
business with him.

[02:42:23.140 --> 02:42:24.920]
That's what started where we are right now in QAM.

[02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:29.840]
I'm not blaming him for the whole national thing, but in terms of QAM, that's why they're

[02:42:30.420 --> 02:42:32.140]
unloading their diapers every five seconds.

[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:34.120]
That's it, unloading in their diapers?

[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:34.740]
Well, that too.

[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:37.860]
27 after 1 at 5, 60 WQM.

[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:40.480]
You're a very pure and lily white station.

[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:41.400]
Make no mistake about it.

[02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:43.640]
Be sure to tell everybody where as pure as it gets.

[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:47.020]
Just like from the White House.

[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:47.700]
Pure crap.

[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:51.500]
If you're in a dead end job, if you're underpaid and overworked, how'd you like to get

[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:55.700]
yourself a real career and a big paycheck that goes along with it so you can basically

[02:42:55.700 --> 02:42:56.320]
have a life?

[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:57.080]
I have no life.

[02:42:57.180 --> 02:42:57.680]

The radio's on your side.

Thank you.

[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:46.080]

[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:52.660]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:54.920]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:54.940]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:55.060 --> 02:43:55.060]

[02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:56.000]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:56.320 --> 02:43:56.320]

[02:43:56.440 --> 02:43:56.840]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:56.840 --> 02:43:57.000]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:57.140 --> 02:43:57.860]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:57.860 --> 02:43:58.700]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:59.220 --> 02:43:59.580]
Hey, yeah.

[02:43:59.640 --> 02:43:59.640]

[02:43:59.640 --> 02:43:59.640]

[02:43:59.640 --> 02:43:59.640]

[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:00.560]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:01.120]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:01.120]

[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:01.840]

[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:02.360]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:04.900]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:07.780]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:21.140]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:25.380]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:37.000]
Hey, you can reach out to us.

[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:37.000]

[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:37.020]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:37.020]

[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:37.020]

[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:37.140]
Hey, yeah.

[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:37.140]

[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:37.140]

[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:37.140]

[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:37.140]

[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:41.340]
I'm a frog, dressed for a new American century

[02:44:42.140 --> 02:44:45.100]
Their version of my call

[02:44:45.100 --> 02:44:48.740]
For control of the world's economy

[02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:53.160]
The party's own city bank is too big, sloped

[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:54.100]
Me na-

[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:55.360]
Me na-

[02:44:56.260 --> 02:44:57.820]
Me na-

[02:44:57.820 --> 02:44:58.720]
Me na-

[02:45:02.140 --> 02:45:04.060]
Dr. Inks, you're down in the floor

[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:07.020]
For positive economy, you're proud

[02:45:07.580 --> 02:45:08.540]
Me na-

[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:13.520]
Right, listen a little bit of that during the break to make sure I could play it

[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:17.360]
And then I just trusted Vokabrion to finally record one bit

[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:21.000]
I didn't have one of those words and I scored a bride

[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:22.120]
There's one

[02:45:24.020 --> 02:45:26.980]
8846 from Florida on stopfcc.com

[02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:29.840]
150,000 to go for 9,000

[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:31.300]
Wouldn't that be sweet?

[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:32.900]
And a half an hour, 154

[02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:35.860]
They could do that in the next 10 minutes, you know, if they wanted to

[02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:38.900]
If they really wanted to, if they wanted to cure enough to sit there very best

[02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:39.860]
Just this one time

[02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:44.020]
Just this one time people get with it

[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:47.480]
Get your finger out and tap it

[02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:49.700]
That computer keyboard

[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:53.160]
Stopfcc.com

[02:45:53.940 --> 02:45:56.360]
And stop the insanity once and for all

[02:45:56.360 --> 02:45:59.120]
Egypt unveils Restore its sarcophagus of Ranzi 6

[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:01.400]
What's that bit we've got where he says sarcophagus?

[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:02.400]
Oh, that's an otter bit

[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:03.080]
Right

[02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:08.140]
There's a word you don't hear too often, I don't know why it's a great word

[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:13.080]
Egypt yesterday unveiled the Restore its sarcophagus of Ranzi 6

[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:17.020]
Peace together from 250 fragments and now on primitive display

[02:46:17.020 --> 02:46:22.640]
Where was first entered in the massive tomb of the ancient fairy, Eferro, who ruled about 3,100 years ago

[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:28.200]
Chip Vincent, director of the Egypt project of the American Research Center in Cairo

[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:32.900]
So the 10 American Canadian and Egyptian experts worked for two years on the reconstructed these sarcophagus

[02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:36.020]
Carved in the shape of a mummy from a single block of green conglomerate

[02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:40.760]
In the past visitors to the tomb would only see the broken pieces of the sarcophagus, Vincent said

[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:43.400]
Now they have the experience to see the head and the face of the pharaoh

[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:44.900]
Ain't that great?

[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:47.060]
It's something

[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:52.900]
The Restore Lid shows a face with wide set eyes and full lips and the cross-tands held a whole royal sceptors

[02:46:52.900 --> 02:46:57.320]
Much of the lid is missing, however, and some fragments on the sides of the supporter would steal rods

[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:03.180]
They must be trapped in their pants in the White House, so I'll tell you after that piece on 60 minutes last night

[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:04.600]
Which we played the audio last hour

[02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:10.560]
To try to out-chain you to bring him out of the closet, vice president Dick Cheney out of the bunker

[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:16.820]
To bring him out of his hiding in his bunker like Heinrich Himmler and put him on with Rush today

[02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:19.440]
I wonder how many they were popping to two of them, huh?

[02:47:21.340 --> 02:47:24.440]
You've heard of Hell's of Pop and I should call that Troll Pills of Pop and

[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:27.360]
How come we don't hear any more about that other than

[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:27.860]
Shut up!

[02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:31.240]
Roy Black is pissed off about this and Roy Black is pissed off about that

[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:33.040]
And they're picking on poor Rush

[02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:35.260]
We don't want to say he's a hypocrite, do we?

[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:35.800]
Yeah

[02:47:37.980 --> 02:47:39.380]
Finger pointing ton of crap

[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:42.240]
Come on, Wilmo, we need some more, Wilmo, what the-

[02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:44.700]
Give me the shipment, Wilmo, the good stuff

[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:48.220]
88-46, what did I say when we were going?

[02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:49.820]
I forgot to turn it down

[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:51.540]
What do you mean by that?

[02:47:51.700 --> 02:47:54.060]
In other words, you throw it in the towel, you don't think I can do it

[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:55.980]
No, it can be done

[02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:59.000]
I mean, no, physically it can be done

[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:00.680]
I mean logistically it can be done

[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:06.340]
But in terms of this crowd, I mean there is somebody from Coral Gables on there which we thank them

[02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:10.740]
But the last five people to sign in Deanna Washington, the state of Washington, Michigan

[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:14.480]
And White Lake, Michigan, no less, and Coral Gables

[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:17.060]
Well that's good, that's something that could happen in the Gables, thank you

[02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:22.500]
The guy that said he's doing the thing with it

[02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:26.160]
Now what did this- what just happened here? Why did this print out? I didn't print it. Did you send me this?

[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:27.340]
Said you what?

[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:29.900]
I must be losing it. I just printed out the-

[02:48:29.900 --> 02:48:31.180]
Well the stop FCC resolved

[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:32.700]
I didn't send that

[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:37.240]
88-46 and we're not that far behind California, I should point out

[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:40.880]
We'll- again, make it into a contest, make it into a fun thing

[02:48:42.340 --> 02:48:46.140]
And we'll raise $50,000, $100,000 faster than you can say

[02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:48.000]
Absolutely correct sir

[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.060]
And get ads all over the place, we'll have our million signatures

[02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:52.040]
At least we'll go down fighting anyway

[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:56.720]
As opposed to just pretending we're on some kind of an ego trip, I don't want to mention any names

[02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:58.840]
Just can't stand that stuff

[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:06.020]
Canadians horrified by the discovery of an alleged serial killer in their midst of an confronted with even worse news

[02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:08.260]
They may have eaten animals that ate the victims

[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:10.000]
You see this story? No

[02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:16.400]
The farmer suspected of killing at least 22 women is feared to have disposed of their bodies by feeding them to his pigs

[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:23.980]
The pigs were slaughtered on his farm, 30 kilometers that's 18 miles east of Vancouver and the meat given hundreds of local people

[02:49:23.980 --> 02:49:24.640]
Oh right

[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:28.960]
Police this week confirmed samples of the pig meat probably contained human DNA

[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:34.360]
Raising the prospect of those living near the farm of suspected killer Robert William Picton ate his victims

[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:36.680]
They're eating people

[02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:38.920]
Sounds like bokehburgers all over again

[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:45.220]
Picton 54 apparently had a habit of slaughtering pigs wrapping up the meat and distributing it to associates and friends

[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:47.540]
Many of Picton's victims were prostitutes

[02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:50.780]
The killer regularly gave birth from his farm to other sex workers

[02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:57.240]
In the old days I have a great line for that but I can't say it in the old days we'll just have to imagine it

[02:49:58.260 --> 02:49:59.500]
Back in the day

[02:50:00.700 --> 02:50:07.040]
Those are my friends that he served up said one prostitute this week after learning she may have eaten meat contaminated with her friends DNA

[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:11.980]
Families of the missing women expressed shock at the news with one telling event Cuba radio station

[02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:13.400]
I'm not eating dinner tonight

[02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:16.500]
How about some macaroni and cheese please?

[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:18.280]
Trace

[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:24.340]
Police have asked anyone with frozen pork products from the farm to turn them into authorities immediately

[02:50:24.340 --> 02:50:31.000]
Health officials are examining whether human pathogens and diseases such as hepatitis and HIV could have been transferred through the meat products

[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:35.000]
Police arrested Picton in February 2002 but only announced this week

[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.000]
They had found human remains and other DNA samples at the farm

[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.880]
He's been charged with 15 counts of first degree murder and the disappearances of women over the past 20 years

[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:45.720]
They were eating people

[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:48.000]
Yeah but they were hookers

[02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:53.500]
Like I said back in the day there are a lot of lines possibilities that come to mind

[02:50:53.500 --> 02:50:55.560]
But that's because I'm a prover just like you are

[02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:57.180]
Sure, proud of it

[02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:01.420]
With all the FCC crap going on that's our poll on neo-roger.com

[02:51:01.420 --> 02:51:06.040]
A thousand and fifty four votes that's not too shabby

[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:11.780]
Neal should just keep ripping bush and ass 714 67.7%

[02:51:11.780 --> 02:51:13.480]
And look at this scot McClellan

[02:51:13.480 --> 02:51:14.840]
He pursued a policy

[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:17.980]
Richard Clark's accusations irresponsible

[02:51:17.980 --> 02:51:20.320]
Yeah they can't handle the truth at the White House

[02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:25.860]
It's not responsible to tell it like it is that they fake the whole world into a phony war

[02:51:25.860 --> 02:51:28.440]
And that they're doing all these human sacrifices over in Iraq

[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:32.840]
So anyway just keep rubbing bush two-thirds say that

[02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:35.660]
Just keep going as best he can 206

[02:51:35.660 --> 02:51:38.020]
Just keep on trucking can we say trucking?

[02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:38.300]
No

[02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:39.960]
Just keep on doing it

[02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:44.040]
Retire! 63.5.9% say hey you old fart!

[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:44.940]
Retire!

[02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:47.560]
Especially before the election they'd like that

[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:50.100]
Do a hockey show 24

[02:51:50.100 --> 02:51:52.120]
Do a sports show 22

[02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:55.280]
So a hockey show has moved in the lead how do you like that?

[02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:58.520]
That's all I'm hockey fans that are pissed off and fired up about that

[02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:00.620]
Lexus Parking Section Aritha Macarena

[02:52:00.620 --> 02:52:05.300]
That to me is when you're having trouble selling any tickets when you're giving all those tickets away

[02:52:05.300 --> 02:52:08.600]
When the only time you can give any asses in the arena or when you're given something away

[02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:12.020]
When the team is like basically no chance left for the playoffs now

[02:52:12.020 --> 02:52:13.400]
With that I wonder when yesterday

[02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:19.400]
And you're pissing people off by creating a Lexus Parking area with like 9 or 10 cars in there

[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:24.560]
And all the other people have to shut that much further even though they're paying additional for preferred parking

[02:52:25.940 --> 02:52:29.240]
I heard that I didn't know what the screen will read the Chiquitas Banana

[02:52:29.240 --> 02:52:30.680]
I just can't believe it!

[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:35.060]
Anyway, retire! 63.5.9%

[02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:37.180]
Hockey show 24, sports show 22

[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.740]
Go back to all bedtime stories only 17

[02:52:40.740 --> 02:52:44.540]
They hated it and play music 8 out of 1062

[02:52:44.540 --> 02:52:46.580]
Come on! Let's play some music!

[02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:48.640]
What do you say? All that hits all the time

[02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:50.380]
We got all the great English to go along with it

[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:54.780]
I don't think Clarence and the muffler too are crazy about the music idea

[02:52:54.780 --> 02:52:56.340]
They didn't have too much to say about it

[02:52:56.740 --> 02:53:00.100]
But I'm actually that the two of them fiercely are working on it right now about our dilemma

[02:53:00.100 --> 02:53:02.100]
They're working on it and the dilemma too

[02:53:03.460 --> 02:53:05.640]
Oh see that's a quadruple on time

[02:53:07.940 --> 02:53:09.380]
We'll stop it!

[02:53:09.380 --> 02:53:10.700]
I don't even know how to respond anymore

[02:53:10.700 --> 02:53:14.600]
Seriously, it has reached a point where every time you say anything you think

[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:16.600]
Well, wait a minute, I couldn't say that, did I just say that?

[02:53:18.100 --> 02:53:19.800]
141 at 560 WQM

[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:22.960]
Here's one thing I'll tell you I've been using dry concepts in my homes for over 20 years

[02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:27.100]
Because there is nobody anywhere in the universe that comes close to the job they do for you

[02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:30.740]
And the whole deal all the way around, they don't give you any ripoffs when they finish the job and say

[02:53:30.740 --> 02:53:33.140]
Oh guess what, it was extra for this, extra for that

[02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:38.300]
They give you a written guaranteed price up front before they start doing their fantastic dry cleaning job

[02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:43.620]
So whether you're a carpet, area-wrecked, draper, you want them professionally cleaned, call the experts at dry concepts

[02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:45.340]
Because they're simply the best in the universe

[02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:50.400]
Using dry concepts certify trained technicians, they'll dry clean your carpets like you dry clean your clothing

[02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:51.680]
That's why they call it dry concepts

[02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:54.860]
Leaving them vibrant in color, soft to the touch they smell emity fresh

[02:53:54.860 --> 02:53:58.060]
They're drying a couple of hours and it looks like you had brand new laid down

[02:53:58.060 --> 02:54:02.400]
See, I can't say laid no more, brand new carpeting laid down on your floor and even if you didn't

[02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:05.920]
And don't forget with dry concepts your rugs will be dry like I said no time

[02:54:05.920 --> 02:54:07.680]
And also you can clean today and entertain tonight

[02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:12.420]
And when you do make that call to dry concepts, please ask them how you can get on their stand violist

[02:54:12.420 --> 02:54:17.940]
Because that'll save you an extra 15% off your next carpets cleaning off their already unbeatable reasonable price

[02:54:17.940 --> 02:54:22.180]
Call them today, you'll never dream of calling anybody else again, we use these people the first time

[02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:25.940]
They're the best anywhere call 1-800-248-5071

[02:54:26.860 --> 02:54:29.760]
That's 1-800-248-5071

[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:31.940]
Or check them on the web at dryconcepts.com

[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:37.940]
We're Sports Radio 5-6-1-UAM

[02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:38.900]
2-8-M

[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:45.940]
J-J-K

[02:54:55.540 --> 02:55:02.740]
To the women's ammunition, George W says no

[02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:09.700]
All those girls in wet t-shirt, he stopped the show

[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:16.740]
He stepped out of the parties in the out-of-home

[02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:18.780]
Yes!

[02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:23.820]
Now my spring break sucks, it's no fun at all

[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:29.560]
We say this fight, but she's red

[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:32.880]
I'm party!

[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:41.060]
We can't party, we can't laugh, we'll be, can't play

[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:48.120]
They won't even let you stay out past eight

[02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:55.300]
The budget meant it's rated as such a trend

[02:55:58.340 --> 02:56:02.060]
6 years' break, we're just gonna beat final class

[02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:07.880]
We say this fight, but she's red

[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:08.520]
Absolutely

[02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:10.960]
I'm party!

[02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:17.300]
147-560-WQM is gonna be so sad, 88-83

[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.620]
We just need another 117 to get to 9000

[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:23.480]
But we only have 13 minutes to do it, I don't think it's gonna happen to you

[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:23.760]
No

[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:27.100]
Close but no cigar

[02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:30.900]
Jackson Brown was just inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame March 15

[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:32.480]
We can go today

[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:33.520]
Right

[02:56:35.020 --> 02:56:37.460]
Carlos Verralla, the great Cuban singwriter, songwriter

[02:56:37.460 --> 02:56:40.700]
And what I say, singwriter, singwriter, singwriter, songwriter

[02:56:40.700 --> 02:56:46.140]
Applied for a visa to come to the US to sing his powerful amazing songs, he had concerts planned in Miami, New York and LA

[02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:47.360]
Our government turned him down

[02:56:48.260 --> 02:56:53.160]
These have been denied to other Cuban artists because their visits are detrimental to the interest of our country

[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:56.840]
In essence, the government says that if Carlos Verralla plays concerts in the US

[02:56:57.580 --> 02:56:59.800]
The money he makes would go to Fidel Castro

[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:00.920]
This is untrue

[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:06.120]
In Cuba, renowned artists keep much of what they earn because the government does want them to leave the country live somewhere else

[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:10.800]
Yet the Bush administration used the same reasoning to keep Abraham from rear of the Buenevac de Social Club

[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:15.880]
And Manuel Galban from attending the Germany award, the Grammy Awards ceremony in LA last month

[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:16.940]
Both men won awards

[02:57:19.220 --> 02:57:20.820]
Germany, I guess, was a 40-inch slip?

[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:21.600]
I guess

[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:27.060]
And also forth to postpone a concert by Spanish Flamengo master Paco de Luchia

[02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:28.180]
Luchia?

[02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:28.880]
C.

[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:33.380]
Paco de Luchia because he plays with Alan Perez Rodriguez, a Cuban word bassist

[02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:38.160]
I congratulate the State Department on finally determining that Mr. Perez is not detrimental to the interest of our country

[02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:43.200]
Although those of us who were able to reschedule and hear him play this month know that he's a truly dangerous man

[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:49.640]
In a profound way, our government takes on the role of a presser when it tries to control which artists will be loved access to our minds and our hearts

[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:52.920]
We may think we are isolating Cuba with our embargo and our travel restrictions

[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:55.180]
But it is we Americans who are becoming isolated

[02:57:55.180 --> 02:57:59.280]
People travel to Cuba from Australia, Britain, Canada, Italy, and Spain

[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:01.420]
Countries would consider stocks allies, eh?

[02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:05.600]
US foreign policy toward Cuba is unpopular in America and for good reason

[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:08.920]
It stops Americans from traveling to Cuba and Cubans from coming into the States

[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:13.180]
It stops us from sharing medicine with the EU and restricts our ability to sell food to the Hungary

[02:58:13.180 --> 02:58:20.660]
This policy is an outdated relic of the Cold War and exists only as a political payoff to the Republican-leaning Cuban-American voters in Miami

[02:58:21.500 --> 02:58:25.800]
The policy of punishing Cuba works only when Americans see the angry face of Cuban repression

[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:31.600]
But in the face of Carlos Verrella, the language and the language of his music, Americans would not find the mask of a demon

[02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:34.020]
But here the aspirations of people just like themselves

[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:41.780]
Perhaps the most prominent paradox here is that Carlos Verrella is known not only for his talent but also for his courage to speak out through his songs

[02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:44.800]
Many of which have been interpreted as critical of the Cuban government

[02:58:45.500 --> 02:58:50.720]
While these young Cubans respect the accomplishments of their leaders, they are already indeed impatient to run their own affairs

[02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:56.980]
They want freedom for themselves and independence for their country, they want the new Cuban to be created by the Cuban people not by the US

[02:58:57.800 --> 02:59:04.420]
I believe in justice in human rights in the US and abroad, I'm saddened by the treatment by the Cuban government of the political dissidents in their country

[02:59:04.420 --> 02:59:11.820]
Along for the day when there's freedom for both Cubans and Americans to travel in both directions across the streets of Florida without undue interference by their governments

[02:59:12.500 --> 02:59:19.060]
I want this freedom not just for artists but for all people American and Cuban who live each day in the hope for a just and prosperous future

[02:59:19.060 --> 02:59:22.600]
Giving Carlos Verrella a visa to sing in America would be a good way to begin

Table talkers all are saying I know piti and cattle don't have any reservation out of provoked battle that world annihilation
