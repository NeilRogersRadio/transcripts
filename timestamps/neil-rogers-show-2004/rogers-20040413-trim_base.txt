[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.600]
Don't worry, Loner, just forget about it.

[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.040]
Why don't you go back to Canada to get you to faster?

[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.780]
See you later, Ralph, later.

[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.240]
It kinda fits right in.

[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.200]
Yeah, that's the whole election up.

[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.580]
See you later, Ralph, later.

[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.920]
Yeah, that's the whole election up.

[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.500]
Go buy yourself a new suit, man.

[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.120]
Are you complaining again?

[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.700]
Drop your debt to your smart man.

[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.220]
No, no, love.

[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.900]
I love you.

[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.340]
Asked you never had a chance.

[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.800]
You put your name on the ballot.

[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.140]
No way you ever had a chance.

[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.360]
With bills on it, you.

[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.740]
And the band I'll leave your hand.

[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.440]
Corporate twin is building a cow.

[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.400]
Thanks to you, the right twin is.

[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.400]
Stole the election where it's where.

[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.340]
I'm not trying to say the afraid of engineering, but...

[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.180]
And now the Nazi right twin is...

[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.560]
I'm not afraid of the old family, but...

[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.640]
The old election where it's where.

[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.940]
Everything is screwed out.

[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.540]
The old party votes for a guy.

[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.820]
Which lies on 65, or maybe.

[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.240]
See you later, Ralph, later.

[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500]
Yeah, that's the whole election up.

[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.880]
See you later, Ralph, later.

[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.240]
Yeah, that's the whole election up.

[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.880]
Go buy yourself a new suit, man.

[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240]
And drop your debt to your smart man.

[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.380]
See you later, Ralph, later.

[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.740]
Try and save it in the street.

[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.980]
Don't try.

[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.740]
You're called out.

[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.460]
And to a tree.

[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.460]
That's the thing.

[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.320]
Wow, this place is un-believeable.

[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.720]
Un-believeable.

[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.420]
That's what I just said.

[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.700]
It is just amazing.

[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.100]
How is it possible that I have a better radio studio in my apartment in Toronto

[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.020]
than here in WQAam in Miami?

[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.860]
How is that possible?

[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.420]
Oh, boy. This is a toilet.

[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.800]
Hey, by the way, thanks for that neat new TV we got up here.

[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.460]
Not, not, not.

[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.080]
Well, but it won't be about, but it's the first year when they first

[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.540]
there and they add all this other crap.

[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.860]
You know, it's just a double talk.

[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.860]
That's what you get.

[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.720]
Georgia speakers are all screwed up.

[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.100]
We're here like snack, crackle, and pop,

[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.460]
which ought to really be good today.

[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.420]
Then we got all the rain and all the...

[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.540]
It kind of fits him with the other stuff.

[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.200]
It's like the whole thing.

[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.080]
It's under and lightning.

[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.780]
Well, maybe it is.

[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.960]
Maybe it's the rhythm of the rain.

[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.460]
The one that is working halfway.

[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.940]
And you're complaining too much, okay?

[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.580]
Too much.

[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.600]
Cut it out.

[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.820]
Anyway, boy, we got a lot of stuff going on here.

[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.640]
Now, how it's stirring?

[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.060]
What a...

[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.380]
Whole heat turns out to be, huh?

[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.280]
What a, what a jerk.

[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.960]
He thinks the whole world revolves around him.

[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.940]
It doesn't?

[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.220]
Oh, clone.

[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.880]
Anyway, here's our poll result from yesterday.

[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.300]
And we're going to do this.

[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.560]
I had a great idea because it'll eliminate my habit of

[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.420]
coming up with some great new poll idea every day

[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.260]
because there's too much pressure and stress

[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.200]
with this studio and all the crap going on here.

[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.260]
We just don't...

[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.740]
We just are capable of doing that.

[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.320]
At least I'm not.

[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.360]
I'm usually just a little bit of a...

[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.440]
I've seen your poll.

[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.200]
Anyway, which of these do you care about?

[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.900]
At least, least, least.

[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.560]
Get it right.

[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.260]
Golf, how many votes do we have?

[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.560]
1902, not too bad.

[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.620]
That was a great year.

[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.600]
Golf 545.

[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.340]
Religion 464.

[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.180]
This thing don't sound worth a crap in here either.

[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.300]
Religion 464.

[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.120]
Give it a good battle.

[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.520]
But golf, number one.

[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.800]
Ah!

[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.640]
No, no, no.

[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.520]
They don't care about golf, which I say.

[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.260]
It says a lot of good things about our passive audience out there.

[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.120]
Not the ones that call in because they're another...

[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.980]
Poolewoodwood breed.

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.880]
Religion 464.

[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.300]
Howard Stern 322.

[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.360]
So, evidently, there are some people that don't think the world revolves around how we...

[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.360]
And the freedom of speech is more than just about him.

[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.380]
Wait till I get to that.

[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.440]
Those two stories back to back.

[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.200]
The one where suddenly he and Robin are saying,

[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.520]
oh, well now we want everybody to work with us.

[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.560]
It's not just about us.

[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.960]
It's about the whole industry and all this other crap.

[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.540]
And then come to find out, well, guess what?

[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.940]
He's going to like go back and out everybody else in a business

[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.000]
and put the stuff on his website to show that everybody else,

[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.740]
all the clones of him are filthy and disgusting in the ought to be fine too.

[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.900]
As in...

[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.820]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.240]
Right.

[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.680]
So, you know, it all revolves around Howard with this 30 million year.

[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.900]
Poor baby.

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.640]
Hockey.

[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.700]
317.

[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.940]
They don't care about hockey.

[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.060]
How about those maple leaves?

[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.740]
I have no idea how they did that.

[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.860]
Eddie, Eddie, he did it.

[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.560]
He's pretty steady.

[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.440]
The Marlins on 19 see the big drop off there.

[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.780]
They love the Marlins and especially those rings.

[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.520]
I didn't know how did I miss it.

[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.820]
I read both the fish wrappers Sunday morning.

[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.820]
But somehow I missed the deal about the rings.

[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.680]
They had almost riots out there.

[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.100]
Right.

[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.900]
I heard Mad Dog talking about that going home yesterday.

[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.380]
Older valuable.

[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.640]
Over the free rings.

[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.920]
You think that maybe some of them might have thought

[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.780]
they were getting that...

[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.060]
Ring?

[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.780]
That might have been it.

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.500]
Yeah.

[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.820]
Brass ring.

[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.880]
The brass ring.

[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.660]
Grab out of that brass ring.

[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.060]
Oh, you can't say brass without ask.

[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.380]
But at any rate, uh, yeah, there were some asses out there

[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.180]
and no question about it because they just...

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.880]
They said somebody said a car on a fire

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.120]
and they were like, uh...

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.720]
All kinds of crap going on out there.

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.400]
P.P. Parkers.

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.760]
We want our free rings.

[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.000]
See, so all of this belonging

[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.700]
that everybody's whipped up about the Marlins,

[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.740]
to some extent that's true.

[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.980]
But they're all whipped up about anything

[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.860]
where there's something free being given away.

[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.380]
Even if it's worth just a few cents.

[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.400]
Stop turning man.

[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.020]
30 cents.

[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.800]
I mean, whatever.

[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.940]
They're 50.

[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.000]
No, I forget about him.

[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.820]
He's bad news.

[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.240]
30 cents.

[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.260]
So they just carried on like a bunch of lunatics

[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.940]
as usual.

[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.120]
I say, I don't know.

[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.440]
Maybe I'm just cynical, I guess.

[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.220]
But I have to raise four eyebrows

[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.940]
when I see this time getting all I whipped up,

[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.580]
all that phony baloney enthusiasm

[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.220]
because it really doesn't exist.

[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.700]
Anyway, let's see.

[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.860]
The Marlins 119,

[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.300]
the stock market 90,

[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.860]
stay out of that if you're smart.

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.720]
Politics 34 and sex 15 people

[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.360]
who care least about sex.

[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.460]
Maybe they can't have that anymore.

[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.420]
That could be it.

[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.460]
That could be part of our crowd.

[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.240]
Maybe there would be...

[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.760]
Those are 15 of that 100 people at Pompato Park

[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.320]
and the lobby down there on Saturday night.

[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.680]
Screaming for their free programs.

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.700]
I'm online.

[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.540]
I was first.

[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.380]
I wanted...

[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.960]
Now I wanted now.

[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.640]
No, seriously, you have never...

[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.920]
I don't care where you've been

[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.500]
or what you've seen.

[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.800]
You have never seen anything like that.

[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.160]
You wound up at Pompato Park.

[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.720]
No.

[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.360]
No.

[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.500]
You have never seen...

[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.240]
I want to apologize again to my friend

[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.280]
Toby at Pompato Park,

[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.580]
even though I'm not part of that problem.

[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.280]
But I just feel so bad for her.

[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.760]
Because she's such a sweetheart

[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.080]
and she has to put up with such.

[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.760]
I mean, obnoxious, disgusting,

[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.500]
old, smelly,

[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.220]
smarmy,

[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.020]
cretons.

[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.900]
I mean, what is that?

[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.820]
What is it about?

[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.620]
I don't know.

[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.080]
There's plenty of old people in Toronto.

[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.220]
They don't behave that way.

[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.260]
You encounter them.

[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.020]
You go out shopping.

[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.860]
You're walking on the street.

[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.900]
They're just like anybody else.

[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.260]
You come here and the old people are like,

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.620]
yeah!

[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.660]
You know,

[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.060]
it feeds on itself.

[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.280]
They feed on each other.

[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.780]
Is that it?

[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.540]
It's kind of like this place.

[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.440]
They go money.

[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.520]
It's kind of like our engineering department.

[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.100]
It's like a disease.

[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.860]
You know, let me just say this for clearance and muff.

[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.700]
I don't care if they put a new TV in her night.

[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.740]
You can pump the audio up.

[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.780]
In fact, put it on right now.

[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.720]
There's Richard Bevanista.

[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.420]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.200]
You're going to rush your script.

[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.700]
Yeah, you're going to have some pornographic channel.

[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.000]
Okay?

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.240]
Oh,

[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.600]
get the sensors gone.

[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.340]
I'm going to be a old channel.

[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.780]
Yeah, we'll get back on the CNN channel.

[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.080]
Okay.

[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.320]
What does that spell?

[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.340]
It's interest.

[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:22.980]
Okay.

[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.920]
No, no, that's it.

[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.460]
I just wanted to make sure that we can handle that.

[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.040]
So if there's like the world comes to an end

[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.040]
today or some horrible things happen,

[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.860]
at least we're in touch.

[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.280]
As I mean, I realize that it doesn't do with ball games

[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.900]
or sports, stuff like that, but we'll do the best we can.

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.700]
So that was the pull yesterday.

[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.640]
Here's today's pull.

[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.880]
We'll get out of the way right off the bat.

[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.420]
Oh, let me tell you before that,

[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.300]
our girl of the day on the beaded curtain page is Kate Moss.

[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.940]
Very good.

[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.060]
Kate Moss.

[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.720]
And I don't really think most people

[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.820]
need to hear too much about Kate Moss.

[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.160]
She was born January 16, 1974, which makes her about...

[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.100]
About 30, man.

[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:56.620]
Yeah.

[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.040]
Right?

[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.160]
In Croydon, Surrey, England.

[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.960]
Really? I didn't know she was English.

[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.380]
Kate Moss?

[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.440]
No. Get out.

[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.240]
Thought she was American.

[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.080]
Get out of town.

[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.900]
I thought she was American.

[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.040]
Are you crazy?

[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.800]
What on earth?

[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.260]
No, someone like you do the sandwich or do.

[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.540]
Kate Moss, that skinny chick, the skinnier chick I know.

[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.740]
Your future's bleak, that heroin chic.

[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.640]
You got to lay off the blow.

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.060]
Kate Moss, that skinny chick, we want to know what's the deal?

[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.100]
The clothes that's wrapped when you're in rehab.

[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.260]
You're worse than Ali McVill.

[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.180]
She's unmarried.

[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.760]
Let's see, 33, 23, 35, or in centimeters, 84, 58, 89.

[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.060]
That sounds like some of the people in our sales department.

[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:48.680]
Fat boy.

[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.680]
Let's see.

[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.620]
She's ads for Calvin Klein of session 1, 2, 3.

[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.300]
Dolce Gabbana, Gianni Versace, all this other stuff.

[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.340]
We know who Kate Moss is.

[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.820]
If you've been hiding under a tree, under a rock,

[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.740]
then you don't know who that is.

[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.280]
But don't forget a rolling rock cat.

[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:05.880]
There's no moss.

[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.160]
She's something like that.

[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.280]
Johnny Depp, who is a boring thing in the paper.

[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.600]
One of the fish rappers this morning about Johnny Depp,

[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.640]
who says that when he was here,

[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.940]
when he was here in South Florida,

[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.700]
growing up, that he ate like,

[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.280]
go home for a baloney sandwich, then go back out again,

[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.680]
come back later for a few peanuts, go back out again.

[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.740]
I don't know what that meant.

[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.280]
That he's weird, that he's weird.

[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.360]
The first time he saw Romaine let us, he freaked out because he didn't,

[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.720]
you know, because he just was kind of like a little hickster down here.

[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.940]
Or a sheltered...

[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.600]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.460]
Kind of that.

[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.820]
As opposed to like a real sophisticated connoisseur now.

[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.780]
I love Johnny Depp.

[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.240]
I mean, you're not going to get me to know Johnny Depp.

[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.320]
He gave Kate Moss a diamond necklace once, gift wrapped in his butt.

[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:46.820]
Yeah.

[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.860]
Well, by the way, he just split up with whoever.

[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.540]
Whoever.

[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.300]
Not Kate Moss, whoever he's been doing.

[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:53.880]
Oh.

[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.020]
Anyway, back in the day, I could have said something about him.

[00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.380]
I know.

[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.140]
I know.

[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320]
Pretend that I'm not.

[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.720]
That's funny what you were just saying.

[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.520]
Anyway, here's today's poll, which of these people or things you care about least?

[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.320]
The war in Iraq?

[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.760]
Oh, let's put Kate Moss under tuna.

[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.580]
You'll have to add that.

[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.860]
Oh, add it.

[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.160]
Sure, we can put the...

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.760]
I have the power.

[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:21.420]
And don't forget, folks, if you're over the age of 75 and you've got 45 pieces of ID and 25 old parts who will vouch for you.

[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.680]
And give you a free program from Pompa No Park, then you can go behind the beaten curtain very briefly and take a look at Kate Moss naked.

[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.640]
Because we don't want no punks out there.

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.800]
Under the age of 55, look at it naked women.

[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.600]
They might get aroused or confused or, I don't know, incensed.

[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.660]
So there she is.

[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.180]
Which of these people or things you care about least?

[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.100]
The war in Iraq?

[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.540]
Rush Limbaugh?

[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.620]
Al Franken, the Mimea dolphins, the Mimea heat, Routhnater, the Pope, gay marriage or Kate Moss.

[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.020]
What I'm trying to do is make a list of things that are not necessarily related.

[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.200]
See what I'm saying?

[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.680]
One from Colomé, one from Colomé.

[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.000]
This is tough.

[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:58.780]
What?

[00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.880]
Oh, yeah, it's a tough choice.

[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.440]
Which of these people or things you care about the least?

[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.960]
I would say the Mimea heat.

[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.720]
That's what I chose.

[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.640]
Yeah, I mean, I just, it's so ridiculous.

[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.240]
When you were sticking the joint out, nobody wanted to talk about them at all.

[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.460]
It's so typical of this time and now, oh, they're going to make the playoffs.

[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.240]
They've been winning a bunch of games and were heat intensive.

[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.700]
They broke the attendance record the other night to see what's his name.

[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.140]
What's his name?

[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.760]
I don't know.

[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.060]
Some big tall guy.

[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.100]
Right.

[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.120]
You know, back in the day, I would have probably said Schwarzer.

[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.180]
Which of these people or things?

[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.400]
Look at that. We already got a few votes.

[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.320]
Gay marriage. Five.

[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.240]
Well, that's not worth talking about those yet.

[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.540]
But there's the pool. There's Kate Moss.

[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.700]
And we're off to a running start.

[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:43.960]
Equipment sucks.

[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.060]
Speakers we can't hear.

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.400]
And you know what? I don't care.

[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.520]
I just don't care.

[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.340]
There's a song, right?

[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.240]
In fact, these guys keep asking, well, you're glad to be here.

[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.660]
No, I'm not glad to be here. I'm not glad to see these people.

[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.600]
I'm not glad to be here. I'm glad to see Duff.

[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.700]
She's okay.

[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.740]
But other than that, Clarence, I don't really want to see him ever again.

[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.040]
I mean, you know, it's not personal.

[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.980]
Well, partly, I just don't need to see him.

[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.280]
He just brings, adds nothing to my life.

[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:07.820]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.900]
Does he have anything to your life?

[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:10.760]
Sports?

[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:11.420]
Yeah.

[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.340]
12 minutes after 10 already at 560 W.

[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.060]
Victoria Secret, by the way, next victim of all the censorship.

[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.160]
We'll get to that.

[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.080]
Now we'll get to Howard's and all of that stuff.

[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.100]
It's just really tragic.

[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.920]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.960]
It's the only one mortgage from financial group.

[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.140]
The benefits, please listen.

[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.120]
They're incredible. You pay zero closing costs.

[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.640]
Zero application.

[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.740]
Fee zero credit bureau. Fee even zero discounted points.

[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.420]
Get the new low interest rate at just 1.25%.

[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.460]
If you have $100,000 alone, your payments are just $334 a month.

[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.420]
If you have a $200,000 alone, you pay just $668 a month and don't forget.

[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.360]

[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:51.120]
26 past 10 at 560 wq a.m. Home of the most incredibly incompetent. Let's see engineering

I think it takes the cake sales there they are what they are we got a lot of spots, you know

[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.100]
At least we got spots by hooker by crook, but engineering man

[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.020]

Your sports radio 5 60s you a

[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:12.760]
UAM

[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:21.360]
We makin on this is jobal on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God

[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.400]

1031 at 560 w2 q. I am happy Tuesday to you and spot of all of the array and the clouds and nasty weather

[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.860]
We're gonna try to be upbeat here in spite of the engineering in spite of all of this so crap that's wrong

[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.540]
We'll be beat up because you notice we always kind of come last no matter what else is going on

[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.900]
It's the transmitter. It's the sports people. It's uh the weather. It's something else. We come last

[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.300]
And you know up to school mall screw the engineering people

[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.220]
Even fix it. He you know he means well, but you're right. He's fried. Oh, you know who else looks fried? Who's that?

[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.980]
I'll give you a clue. Oh, right man. He must have had some wild time at the masters you talk about green lizards

[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.840]
He must have some still crawling around in his pants. I had possible

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.320]
I walked in just to give him the wave yesterday because I don't see him that often my good close personal friend the mad dog and

[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.100]
He looked fried still

[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.880]
I'm not talking about just uh, I mean really fried. Yeah. Do you know I'm talking? I know what he is

[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.980]
You know you don't want to discover why I don't want to know which I was

[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.200]
Now here let's see of Pope Scott 42

[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.020]
Which of these people are things do you care about at least I'm I'm just curious Pope 42

[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:45.440]
178 votes rush limbaugh 28 pop a couple rush. Okay. Kate Moss 25 come on

[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:50.020]
She's scrawny game merge 21. How about if the Pope married rush limbaugh

[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:57.080]
My knee heat 18 Ralph Nader 16 Al Franken 13. What about if Ralph Nader married Al Franken? Oh boy Al Franken's boring man

[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.220]
Here's so boring

[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.840]
Uh, Miami dolphins 12 and Warren Iraq three now three who care least about that

[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.700]
Now I want you to think about that they care more about that whole list

[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:13.840]
Mm-hmm then the war in Iraq than all these Americans and all the other hundreds and thousands of people are dying for no reason at all based on a pack of lies

[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.740]
Don't forget we have that

[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.360]
Searching for the right word that antagonist factor out there in the audience. No, no

[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.800]
These people are being honest. These polls are 100% scientific

[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.120]
Ah

[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.620]
Here's here's something that's going to give you a lot of comfort in solace

[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.820]
Oklahoma pool sites too much sex and violence on radio and TV

[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.080]
Yeah, Oklahoma pool

[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.440]
I ride

[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.420]
It can know what I mean. Certainly if you're going to take the uh, temperature of America sure

[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.460]
Right, would they're going to stick to thermometer deep inside the recto right certainly with a rectal thermometer

[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:50.120]
Can we still say that? I don't I doubt it. We'll check call up over there in a west coast

[00:27:50.120 --> 00:28:00.120]
You can still say rectal thermometer and you know what to do with it. Oh, don't say it's out that don't a consumer logic pool of 750 registered Democrats and Republicans commissioned by the Tulsa world

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:06.800]
Suggested that a majority of Oklahoma's are concerned with the amount of sexual and violent content on radio and television. Oh my god

[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.140]
Right

[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.040]
82 to 86 percent

[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.420]
I don't understand that. I mean, it's either 82 or 86. I would think or somewhere between or maybe 84

[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:20.440]
percent say they're often or sometimes offended by adult language

[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.100]
violence sexual content and homosexuality on radio and TV

[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.060]
Those who would say they say they attend church. Oh, by the way, he has risen and he's still

[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.720]
Yeah, he's rising. I think those people may be on vacation

[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:43.740]
Huh, I don't know. No, no, no, no, no, no, those who say they attend church several times a week were twice as likely to be offended often by sexual content

[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.700]
Then those who attend church annually

[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:52.140]
Respondents who call themselves conservatives were nearly twice as likely to be offended by sexual content as those who call them liberals

[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.540]
How many liberals are there in Oklahoma?

[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.760]
I would think that many if you count some people three times. Yeah

[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.320]
Wow

[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.720]
So in other words, you got the basically America has been taken over by the Puritans

[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.120]
Mm-hmm. All of these people make the Puritans look pretty wild by comparison by the Amish

[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.920]
All of the Amish mind their own business. No, that's true. So let's not insult the Amish

[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.960]
These people have been taken over by crazy fundamentalist kind of very much like the

[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.300]
Fundamentals who pulled off 9-11 the ones that were fighting the evil doers right now

[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:27.120]
So that's the evil doers against the evil doers is right the way I see it very much in common. Yeah

[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.900]
Words of a feather

[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.560]
Flot together. I said flock. Okay

[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.320]
Look into all of the stuff that's going on here, and it's just it's just amazing. It's astonishing

[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.540]
What a jackass Howard Stern turns out to be like I said he could have the very first week

[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.640]
The guy called his show

[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.080]
Yeah, it's got he called his show

[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:56.980]
He offered him an outlet a venue or very ingenious idea. Let's get the public all whipped up into a frenzy

[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.480]
Let's get a

[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:05.980]
Million signatures and have them all sent letters to their you know sent all of the signatures to congressmen and senators and

[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.360]
During this election year led people understand that we're not going to take all of this

[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.820]
Made up as we go along censorship laying down people are pissed off about it, but no

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.960]
And we gave it a little bit of a shot here in our own little corner of the world and I realized what the who the hell am I kidding?

[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.260]
You know

[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:26.640]
He could have done it on 30 some odd stations and all the major markets in the country except this one

[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.280]
And

[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:34.340]
Didn't do it and maybe some of this today will explain you why I mean I just the one thing that bothers me a lot

[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:39.020]
Just drives me up the wall is people with big egos, you know, I mean absolutely right

[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.980]
People with big gigantic puffed up egos. I'm listening who think that their stuff doesn't stink. I'm listening

[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:52.060]
Okay, calm down. I haven't seen him in these two. I look in the windows. I'm yesterday. Look pretty bad. Look like he was right on the edge

[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.460]
The edge of tomorrow. No the edge of yesterday

[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:06.020]
Anyway, WXRK K rock morning host Howard Stern slammed the FCC's community standards decree during yesterday's program questioning

[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:12.160]
How the FCC's mandate of basic and decency fines on community standards could apply to the six third channel stations

[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.700]
Each and different radio markets which goes to show he isn't up to speed even doesn't understand it's no longer community standards

[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.720]
Which we've been through all of that anyway

[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.100]
The broadcast aired on April 9, 2003 broadcast of the Howard Stern show and a complaint

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.820]
lived only in one of those markets Miami as we know no one else complaining all those other markets

[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.880]
Stern said since it's based on list of complaints why then do they find you other markets for the broadcast

[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:41.100]
Stern also noted that a show has a limited shelf life and the attack present bush for spending time cracking down on his and other

[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:46.320]
Programs over in decency concerns instead of focusing more attention on Iraq and other issues facing the country

[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:52.160]
Meanwhile, I want you to listen to this carefully now, right that last sentence. This is building. It sounds pretty promising here so far

[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.440]
Meanwhile co-host Robin Quivers important listeners and others in the entertainment industry to join their fight

[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:04.920]
Let's not make it what the FCC is doing to us anymore. She said let's make it what the FCC is doing in other words to everybody and we say

[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.340]
Yeah, it's about time better like that ever then you go girl, but

[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.260]
There's a big butt

[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.840]
In the middle of all this

[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.780]
That ego just uh, he can't control it out of control

[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:25.080]
Howard told his listeners yesterday that he's not taken in spite with the FCC overlaid broadcast and decency lying down and says

[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.080]
He plans to post content from other shows like his on his website to shine light on other programs

[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.880]
That might be susceptible to indecency fines, but have thus far flown under the radar

[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.700]
There's about 50 shows that I'm going to start posting on the website Stern said

[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:42.240]
I'm going to get transcripts of their old shows too and we'll start getting those people fine too

[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.340]
Which he obviously doesn't understand how it works because putting transcripts on a website doesn't get you

[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.100]
Finally, somebody complained for the broadcast at the time, etc. And so on that they aired

[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:55.280]
He says we'll take man cow from Chicago will take Dave Shelley and chainsaw from KGB sand ego

[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:01.100]
We're going to start doing this to everyone now. This is the same guy who just got through a sand that all of us in the industry have to work together

[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:06.480]
We want to show it's about all of us. He says there's other broadcasts doing the same stuff all clones of me

[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:13.280]
See there's that big gigantic big nose ego sticking out again and the FCC's effectively says they're okay

[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.540]
But I'm not in the meantime

[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:19.640]
He ignores the fact that other people are gotten fired that several other states have gotten fine big humongous fines

[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.980]
He is oblivious to that

[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.980]
And while Stern credits parent company Viacom with backing him up

[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.920]
He's convinced his days on radio are numbered

[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.480]
The company that I work for is 100% behind email Carmison is 100% behind me

[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.660]
And they have said that they're going to fight all of this stuff into whatever they've got to do

[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:40.400]
But no company can stand up to this kind of government pressure. We will be off the air. I'm pretty smart about this stuff. He says

[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.280]
He also wishes you to warning that if he does wind up taking the show to satellite radio

[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.540]
Broadcasts will be the ones who ultimately suffer if I go on there

[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:53.260]
I will destroy these radio stations that I'm on Stern said people will follow me not everyone

[00:33:53.260 --> 00:34:01.460]
But most people will I mean you talk about a massive gigantic humongous out of control ego. I mean even this building

[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:06.820]
I'm listening. I've never seen an ego like that. Absolutely. We've seen some pretty big fat puffed up egos in this place

[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:13.540]
Is that is that incredible? She he's gonna bring down the whole everybody else and it's just he's gonna be the only one left standing

[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.960]
Or sitting or however he's doing a show

[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.000]
But don't forget it's not just about us. We're gonna

[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.100]
So evidently they had a

[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.280]
What do they call us a moment? It's a moment of clarity here. Right. Just just a very brief

[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:33.280]
Moment of clarity and then all of a sudden that big fat pompous ego came back in the rigans all about Howard

[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.460]
And where's Howard gonna be and he's gonna be on satellite and then everybody's gonna go out and buy satellite radio and

[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:43.060]
I got my note order. No. Yeah. I ordered 10 just in case

[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.800]
Just in case they block out the first nine

[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.120]
It is a pretty sad

[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:53.040]
So that's the reason that all of this crap continues going on. I mean there and the same with rush

[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.980]
Russia's too busy. You know talking about how Jen carry you know smoked dope or something

[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.240]
uh

[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:04.580]
Yeah, I mean there are the people who have the nationwide audience who can be doing something positive about this stuff

[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:10.260]
Are you sure and instead it's like well? I'm gonna bring everybody else down. I'm gonna go on XFM or X whatever the thing is

[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.220]
It's a tragic is what it is

[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.820]
Major pompous ass

[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.240]
I'm sorry major pompous cool

[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.060]
19 before 11 but he's pretty clever. He knows about this stuff

[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:31.320]
Right, so he's gonna post all of this stuff on his website from a zignan. I say let's post on his website transcripts of every show all right

[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:31.880]
right

Quadrilo

Slight of the livery every hour

[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.420]
And that's how come you gotta come and pick it off

[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:45.820]
Yeah

[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.740]

This is me just want to

[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.160]
One cut short

[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.200]
I got a few complaints

[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.520]
How the heck I supposed to eat

[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.380]
The one time so

[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.080]
When you can't

[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.760]
To give me a press

[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.320]
Expo you fool

[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.320]
Was this

[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.700]
Why you don't give me my

[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.140]
Subpackage

[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.240]
No master packet

[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.700]
To put on

[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.340]
That's a me again

[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.300]
Oh boy

[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.160]
This is gonna be real

[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:29.420]
Man

[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.480]
You left out my port

[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.560]
Frey raise

[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.620]
What do you think is

[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.160]
It's 1049

[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.760]
Do we have the right time now because yesterday

[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.580]
I want to apologize to the mad dog

[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.860]
And everybody connected with that show

[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.140]
I one thing about me

[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.680]
I'm never you're never gonna find me

[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.800]
Late on this show

[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.520]
It's like it's to be

[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.260]
In fact even a little before to a show

[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.060]
I'm ready to go

[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:50.740]
You know like 30

[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.020]
About one 15 sounds good

[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:52.380]
You know

[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.340]
But we ran over a minute and a half yesterday

[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.500]
Because somebody didn't

[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.940]
I mean this place is just a disaster

[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.600]
Over the weekend

[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.960]
They had to like a power surge

[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.200]
The TV broke on Friday

[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.980]
Nobody bothered to reset the clock

[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.800]
And here's a joke

[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.840]
Nobody cares

[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.880]
The only time they care about this place

[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.700]
Is when they want to come here

[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.580]
And dittle around with stuff

[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.560]
And screw around with it

[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:09.940]
Oh yeah

[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.200]
Like your good friend Carlos

[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.060]
So pickerier

[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:13.780]
Whatever his name is

[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.760]
At any rate

[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.700]
Which of these people

[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.900]
Or things you care about

[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.620]
The least is our poll question today

[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.260]
The poll 56

[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:20.960]
As in

[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.120]
Q 56

[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.260]
What does the Q stand for?

[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:23.860]
Cuban

[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.340]
Rush Limbaugh

[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.020]
Forty-no, he's

[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:26.600]
One of yours

[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.680]
Rush Limbaugh 44

[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.620]
It's about his Polish

[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.840]
Kate Moss 41

[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.040]
I'm talking about your friend there

[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.660]
Oh

[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.040]
Your subversive friend

[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.940]
Uh, Game Merge 29

[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.640]
The Miami Heat 27

[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.500]
Al Franken 21

[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.580]
God is he boring

[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.220]
Uh, Ralph Nader 20

[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.800]
Miami Dolphins 15

[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.020]
And the war in Iraq then we have four

[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.480]
And you're right

[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.780]
Just to be smart asses

[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.520]
They think it's funny

[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:47.860]
Yeah

[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.360]
Like it's gonna change my life

[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.540]
Like it's gonna change

[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.820]
It's gonna change a decimal point on my paycheck

[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.200]
Like I'm gonna make less money if they vote that

[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:56.960]
Right, that's right

[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.440]
If you keep voting for the war in Iraq

[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.140]
I'm gonna make a lot less money next time

[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.560]
Or speaking of voting

[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.980]
So Miguel the rumor around the building

[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.440]
That we're starting is he's gonna vote for Kerry

[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.040]
Right

[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.380]
He's gonna

[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.040]
Good

[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:08.900]
Nice going Miguel

[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:09.760]
Always liked him a lot

[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.160]
Okay

[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.880]
If he were ugly I'd like him a lot less

[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.160]
But

[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.640]
No, seriously that's great

[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.680]
Now you're voting for Kerry

[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:15.600]
He's

[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.620]
Our mystery guest in there

[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.320]
He's voting for his

[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.220]
So that's uh, I know

[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.840]
If you could vote you'd vote for Kerry too

[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.500]
But George Camp vote

[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.600]
I got my brother's voting card

[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.040]
I'm gonna use it

[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:22.680]
Oh, that

[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.160]
Well somebody's

[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.440]
What's the trouble with getting it

[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.320]
It's so sick

[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.420]
Well, I called him to get it

[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.280]
And then go out and work

[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.020]
Now where was he living?

[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.200]
Oh, in Brown

[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:30.920]
In Hollywood, yeah

[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.440]
Go down to

[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.060]
Dave County

[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:33.800]
Go to little right

[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.680]
Vote twice

[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.020]
Without a name you could probably vote

[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.340]
20 times maybe even

[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.460]
But about 30 man

[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:38.660]
Right

[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.740]
A lot of other dead people voting

[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.060]
Why not?

[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:40.780]
Sure, why not

[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:41.580]
Oh, that's bad

[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.300]
Don't

[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.200]
Today yesterday was Monday

[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.900]
A week ago yesterday your brother died

[00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.920]
Now you're right in front of it

[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.080]
He'd be lotsin

[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:48.420]
Oh yeah

[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.720]
Then that's a good way to look at it

[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:49.880]
Yeah

[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.840]
He's a sport always

[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.520]
Instead of saying

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.040]
Oh, he's in a better place now

[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:53.660]
Oh, I'm fine

[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.040]
He's in a box

[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.840]
Or he's in a box in a hole

[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.100]
Galvanized

[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.300]
Aluminum or something

[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:00.580]
So, Pope Scott 58

[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:01.440]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.100]
That's good news

[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.160]
And of course he has risen

[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.000]
Don't forget about that

[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.080]
So, let's start rolling out the Mester eggs

[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.320]
I don't understand why that's so complicated to go

[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.820]
And into Orthodox Jews

[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.980]
Believe what everyone

[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.820]
Leave me alone

[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:13.460]
No, simple

[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.140]
Simple

[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:14.860]
You know what I mean

[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.360]
It's you know harm

[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.200]
Leave the rest of us alone

[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.540]
It's not for my own good

[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.260]
Jewels in the country

[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.200]
It's for your own good

[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.060]
That you should leave me alone

[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.780]
Because I might get a little bit porky about it

[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:22.160]
So, what I'm saying

[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.700]
Every one of them

[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:23.820]
With them

[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.100]
They get a next for jewel in their country

[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:25.720]
Is that what it is?

[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.180]
They get brownie points

[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.540]
Crownie points

[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.280]
The brownie points get brownie

[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.340]
I don't know how that goes

[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.840]
Here's a little bit of good news though

[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:34.920]
Little bit

[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.200]
I don't want to get everybody all depressed

[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.040]
With that stuff about

[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.500]
Victoria's secret

[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.720]
And everything is going off the air

[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.920]
And Stern is an egotistical pompist ass and all that

[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.540]
So, here's a little piece of good news

[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.900]
And again, the Democrats are spineless cowards too

[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:46.280]
But

[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.300]
The reason that the pendulum

[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.640]
And I use that term loosely

[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.320]
Is swinging so far to the right now

[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:51.680]
Is because

[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.600]
What we got in power

[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.440]
You got your

[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.040]
Right wing, neo-con lunatic president

[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.720]
You got your right wing congress

[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.580]
And the right wing supreme court

[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.320]
So, there are no checks and balances anymore

[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:02.780]
But

[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.660]
Onespected retirements in divisive Republican primary races

[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.540]
Have turned the battle for control of the U.S. Senate

[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.460]
Into a toss up

[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.140]
With November's election shaping up

[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.680]
As another series of excruciatingly tight contests

[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.080]
To fill the closely divided chamber

[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.480]
According to campaign officials in both parties

[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.700]
So, it's important that you vote 60, 70, 80 times

[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:28.580]
Democrats, who less than a year ago, face dim chances of overcoming the GOP's 51-48 majority

[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.780]
Now leading the polls in all seven competitive races

[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.000]
In which head to head public polling has been done

[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.180]
A trend that would produce a gain of three democratic seats

[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.240]
In Oklahoma

[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.220]
Oklahoma

[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.100]
Holy moly

[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.760]
That is really saying something, you know what

[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:44.880]
Wow

[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.100]
Exactly, Oklahoma

[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.980]
Uh, Colorado

[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:49.940]
Alaska

[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.120]
Control of the Senate could be critical for the next president

[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.820]
If John Kerry wins but faces a GOP-controlled congress

[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.840]
It's unlikely he'd be able to pass major domestic initiatives

[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.420]
But if Bush wins reelection

[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.940]
But his hamstring by democratic control

[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:03.240]
Senate

[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.920]
He'll have a more difficult time getting his judicial nominations approved

[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.960]
Thank God

[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.720]
Ew, God

[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.500]
Oh man

[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:09.780]
In Oklahoma

[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.960]
Democrat Brad Carson strong showing in the early opinion polls could mean a gain for the Democrats

[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.040]
And a new Native American senator

[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.200]
Native American

[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.060]
We'll take it

[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.700]
And Colorado's race to replace Republican Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell

[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.580]
Democrat Ken Salazar leading in the polls to become the first Latino in the Senate

[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.720]
In a quarter of a century

[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.180]
So we're going to Indian, A, SPIC

[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.200]
And now in Alaska

[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.260]
Once a guaranteed Republican strong will now appears in play

[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.240]
Oklahoma and Alaska is shocking to me

[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.860]
Yeah, those are such hotbirds of Republican uh

[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:43.720]
With incumbent Republican Lisa Murkowski replaced your father Franklin and become governor

[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.280]
Trailing slightly in the polls

[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.380]
And and yeah

[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.140]
A contentious Republican primary in Pennsylvania could offer Democrats a chance there

[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.700]
If challenger Pat Tumey upsets veteran moderate Republican senator Arlen

[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.540]
Single bullet theory specter

[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.280]
April 27th

[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.300]
That's not there far off in the A primary

[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.120]
That's like only two weeks away from today's matter of fact

[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.620]
Ciderico is a little a little ray of hope

[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.400]
That maybe we can start and maybe not swing the pendulum back

[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.260]
But at least stop it right now so we can stop like in about the 14th century instead of going all the way back to

[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.680]
Beginning of time into the stone he's back into the caves

[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:23.260]
Which of these people or things do you care about the least the Pope 61

[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.860]
Rush Limbaugh Fiddy this is out of 283 votes

[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.800]
Kate Moss 47 game marriages got

[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.940]
Miami Heat 29 Al Franken 25

[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.880]
Ralph Nader 21 the Dolphin 16 I mean the dolphins that would be

[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.740]
Secrelegious say the care least about the dolphin almost voted for the dolphins

[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.800]
No, you care less about the heat

[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.440]
That was honest you could at least name

[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.540]
Some dolphin player for the dollar player 72 dolphin codes. Yeah, if you

[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.380]
Well, you could also name Pat Riley

[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.300]
Who?

[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.600]
Rick Riley

[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:02.340]
And then Warren Iraq 4 out of 293 four wise guys for the far probably the four of boyfriends out there little punk

[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.920]
Center might have a narrow old

[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.380]
York right now. Yeah, I can't say

[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.700]
Yeah, they're squeezing each other

[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.620]
1056 at 560 WQAM

[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.040]
Let me tell you right now. Where's the a copy oh there it is. Oh boy

[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.620]
I would be the worst thing that could happen to me is to lose the copy for the pizza loft

[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.420]
Okay, especially on the day that Jeff's coming back on the air with us

[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.620]
And you want to know why because now that hockey season for the Panthers is over

[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.900]
He's gonna need to do a lot extra business to feed the rimmers every day lunch dinner

[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.440]
They're not even open for breakfast, but I understand the rumors. He's opening up early just for them

[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.620]
You're been over there with them right

[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.160]
The one and only pizza loft and Davy maybe the rain nothing like it

[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.700]
In fact, there are other restaurants that charge twice the money and don't come close to giving you the quality food and portions

[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.000]
Certainly that you get at the world famous loft

[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.420]
No BS coupons like those of the joints because pizza loft every Thursday offers a special where you buy any on tray and the second one is half price

[00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:00.800]
Every Tuesday like today when you buy one eggplant dinner the second one is only five bucks no coupon needed every Monday by one

[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.800]
Those on you didn't know the second one is only five bucks and guess what again no coupon necessary

[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.640]
Well, can you imagine those old people from Pompato Park lining up for the coupons for oh that that's one reason

[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:14.940]
Jeff don't want that and the formula for success at the pizza loft is consistency whether you go in today a week from

[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:20.040]
Shabuwa's or whenever they're same delicious food big portions everything cooked fresh to where do you can't beat it?

[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.540]
In fact, it's the only restaurant in the country that has no microwave

[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:28.800]
They're not nukin nothing and everything is either baked or sauteed and even on a weekend on Fridays or Saturdays

[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.040]
You don't have to wait for a table because they've got so many seats

[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.820]
They've got over 200 fat seats and they'll deliver the same great menu all around town like from west

[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:41.200]
There they'll go as far as to Flamingo and north to sunrise south to Pines Boulevard east to 441 and they do a fantastic

[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.880]
Java catering for your home or office as well for just five bucks for a person

[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.480]
So if you want a great treat man

[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:23.720]
If you're on the radio you're not a usual train

[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:29.520]
No denial call to government control your brain. Don't you defend it is now

[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.440]
Nothing

[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:47.800]
Well

[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.160]
Blank 새� finger

[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.680]
You can officially walk girls, you can't say that

[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.940]
They're gonna make it free

[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:12.340]
With reprisals in order to fall for the FTC

[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.020]
We'll find you a better and take your license away

[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:22.720]
For that's for all I know to be a virtue one more

[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.720]
For I could have my radio's to be destroyed

[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.520]
No shut the stick no now

[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.980]
I can't laugh no, okay

[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.800]
Except for why you'll clear me up on acts

[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.540]
You'll be the victory one

[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.620]
Oh, girls, you can't say that

[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:42.940]
Can't say crap, both of you

[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.940]
That's 1102 at 560 WQM

[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.860]
Look at those phones, baby

[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.240]
Are they on fire or what?

[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:47.680]
Huh?

[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:48.660]
On something

[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.960]
Well, maybe they just don't care no, I don't know

[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.540]
I mean, they're just too busy voting on our pool

[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.020]
560-560

[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.880]
Oh, good news, even more good news

[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.920]
Yeah, then open up

No more US soldiers dead at the moment

[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.460]
There will be more

[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.940]
Unfortunately, there will be a lot more

[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:05.480]
Any woundings?

[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.560]
Because we'll talk about the wound

[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.940]
Oh, we do not discuss that

[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.120]
560-560

[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.100]
Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Lime

We want to take at least 6,000 calls today

We got the mad dog at two, the Humper in the studio at four

That's coming

[00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:38.930]
WQAM, hello

[00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:40.970]
Hi, dear, I'm sorry, okay

Great, um, by the way, is the name of your pool

[00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.910]
Things I couldn't care less about?

[00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.590]
No

[00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.130]
Well that sounds like Reverend Jones to me, yeah

[00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:51.550]
No?

[00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:54.090]
I want to just call it, I don't know, somebody else

[00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:55.570]
WQAM, hello

[00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:56.490]
Neil

[00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:57.050]
Yes, sir

[00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:58.810]
How are you doing? This is John Bond?

[00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:00.170]
Oh, okay, great

[00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:03.470]
At least he was a little sociable to me, that's good, that's a good name

[00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.310]
Yeah, you're stepping up, I'm glad to see you probably

[00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:08.010]
He probably went to CA, child anonymous, huh?

[00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:09.490]
He's taking a little tiny baby steps

[00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:11.790]
Very good, and maybe in a couple of weeks

[00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:12.950]
Maybe in a few years

[00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.730]
We'll be able to have like maybe a sentencer too

[00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:15.850]
Like 10 to 20 rub, good

[00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:16.650]
Like a whole paragraph?

[00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.190]
No, I'm talking about a sentence like in Rayford

[00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.150]
Ah, 30 men

[00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:20.590]
10 to 20

[00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:21.870]
He can string them together

[00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:23.950]
Here's a good message, you see that?

[00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.750]
I'm gonna understand what's going on, here's a message from Georgian James

[00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.110]
But it's a blank page from St. Paul, Minnesota

[00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.030]
Nice try, Georgian James, maybe you want to fax it again

[00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.210]
Because it's just a blank page

[00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:36.830]
I want to know what's on the mind of the public

[00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:37.170]
Wish message

[00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.430]
Or maybe it was already censored, you think?

[00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:41.310]
Yeah, that's a possibility

[00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:42.450]
That's a fax machine, yeah

[00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.990]
WQAM, hello

[00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:45.770]
QAM, but just in the blank page

[00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:46.390]
QAM?

[00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:49.150]
Me, the world is full of crazy people

[00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.670]
No

[00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:51.490]
Crazy people

[00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:51.930]
Yeah

[00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.970]
But, anyway, you keep Cameron out there

[00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:57.350]
Maybe you put some sentencing people's heads

[00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:59.630]
No, come, Cameron, okay, me and the hammer man

[00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:01.070]
Or hammering

[00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.390]
Hammering, hang, five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty, pound, five

[00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:06.390]
Like I said, let's take thousands of calls today

[00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:09.910]
Let's take 50, 60, 70,000 calls by two o'clock

[00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:11.430]
I'm just in that kind of a mood

[00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:15.110]
And nobody's going to like impose any food on me that I don't want

[00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.890]
I don't waste your time even trying

[00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:18.830]
And if that, I'm going to tell you right now

[00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:21.030]
If that sac shows up in my house again tonight

[00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:24.310]
Tristration is never going to be the same again

[00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.450]
I'm telling you right now, I'm not blaming our other friend Troy

[00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.770]
Tristration, I told him yesterday

[00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:29.410]
Thank you, but no thank you

[00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:30.610]
I don't need any extra food

[00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:31.590]
I'm as fat as a pig

[00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.950]
I'm trying to do something that your brother couldn't do

[00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.250]
That your two fat friends couldn't do

[00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:35.810]
You know what that is?

[00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:37.130]
Stay alive

[00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:39.690]
I'm trying to do something that Morris Gid couldn't do

[00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:40.430]
Stay alive

[00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:43.150]
It's a worthy cause

[00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:44.310]
In fact, I wish I had that song

[00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:45.490]
Do we have BG's in the middle line?

[00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:47.270]
Ah, we got it

[00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:48.090]
I'll find it

[00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:48.130]
I'll find it

[00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:49.570]
They stole that remember from you

[00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:51.430]
They stole my BG's

[00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:53.330]
Back in the IOD because I borrowed it

[00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.970]
Put it back in that we saw it

[00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:56.770]
I guess what, now did I actually play this?

[00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:57.810]
There was something here

[00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.210]
We tried this the other day to see if we could play this anymore

[00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.230]
And it was a problem here

[00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:04.890]
I think there might be a...

[00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:06.750]
I was standing there one day

[00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:09.070]
Not thinking I was dying

[00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.310]
What do you say do do?

[00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:14.310]
We can still do do do or say anything

[00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:17.230]
I should ever keep being dulled

[00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:22.570]
I'll pick back mostly track inside my bowels

[00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:24.130]
I'm long ha ha ha ha

[00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:28.290]
How can you've died from infected fog?

[00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:30.330]
We can say we just can't make a sound

[00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:31.990]
There's these budget doctors in

[00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:34.690]
Now my heart stops

[00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:36.070]
You schmucks at Sinai

[00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:37.570]
Oh, I know what it is

[00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:38.690]
He says GD in there

[00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:41.230]
What?

[00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.990]
I forgot

[00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.390]
Yeah, well so had I

[00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:45.750]
I'm just playing that in Zach

[00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.190]
He's listening in the Josh and we're all sitting here

[00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:49.590]
And I'm like, ah! He says GD

[00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:52.630]
See, there are some of them

[00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.810]
They're just so impossible to accept

[00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:56.550]
I mean, you know, I really don't care

[00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.350]
I just want the money

[00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:59.010]
I don't care if they want me to say hello and goodbye

[00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:00.430]
If they just want me to play guilty

[00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.450]
I can do that

[00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:03.570]
I can sit here like a...

[00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:06.070]
No problem with the big smile on my face

[00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:07.170]
That's fine with me

[00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.630]
From my music entertainment

[00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:10.370]
Yeah, I can even...

[00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.870]
Yeah, like the...

[00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.750]
The first thing we got on a website

[00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:15.650]
I can even move my lips

[00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:19.410]
Too bad we don't have any shield

[00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:20.490]
Man, we can make it a hit now

[00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:24.850]
Yeah, watch my lips move

[00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:25.910]
I'm bringing a camcorder

[00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:27.070]
Yeah, that's a beautiful thing

[00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.130]
But there's some of them that are just so ridiculous

[00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.650]
And of course, probably the beesleaves are getting a little bit nervous

[00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:36.810]
Because they also carried that stern show over there in Tampa

[00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.590]
And, uh, Fort Myers-Nables

[00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:39.090]
That's right

[00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:40.510]
We discussed this last week

[00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:42.990]
And you just know pretty soon they're gonna be saying

[00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.650]
Oh, we're fine

[00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.370]
Yeah

[00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:47.910]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.170]
That'll teach them

[00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.670]
To be playing fast and loose with the FCC

[00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.230]
To be putting a bunch of filth and smut on the air

[00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.050]
We're gonna have to be running those fake auctions on a website

[00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:58.590]
Every day pretty soon

[00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.330]
On the QA auction at a website

[00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:04.630]
We'd better lock these doors like with a padlock then

[00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.130]
Oh yeah, they'll auction over

[00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:09.710]
And don't auction off most lovely piece that's sitting on Louise McGill's head over here

[00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:10.310]
Don't do that

[00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:10.850]
That's right

[00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:11.330]
Whatever you do

[00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:12.370]
That's what you do with Muscrat

[00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:15.530]
Oh yeah, in fact, Louise is ready to do the Muscrat ramble right now

[00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.350]
I can see it with a big fat asses

[00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:19.010]
We got a lot of good stuff in there

[00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:20.610]
We got Gerr and Rique up there

[00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.750]
Who's, uh, Smokin' Three Joints

[00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:24.930]
Just for the hell of it

[00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.190]
We got a nice beer for the whole-

[00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:27.490]
One of my teddy bears is up there

[00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:28.430]
The-

[00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:29.710]
Yeah, we got all the more perfect

[00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:30.050]
Right?

[00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.470]
Action figures, George Poit at the-

[00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.570]
Got the picture of the sales department

[00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.150]
I guarantee it that's worth several dollars

[00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:35.970]
For my teddy bear

[00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:36.410]
For my teddy bear

[00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:36.430]
Right?

[00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:38.490]
That's my thing

[00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:41.250]
Got the Panther thing with a Panther jersey out of that plaque

[00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:43.030]
I guarantee you get at least 20 grand

[00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:44.730]
The OJ murder weapon over there

[00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:45.590]
So let's see now

[00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:47.270]
When the Ferel find comes in

[00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.250]
Well, I'm thinking this is just the activity iceberg

[00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.090]
Because let's see if they had-

[00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:53.650]
Let-

[00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:57.070]
I don't have any idea how many different incidents are going to be listed in that complaint

[00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:58.010]
About third, man!

[00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:01.630]
Okay, so let's say 30 times 27,500

[00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:05.290]
Okay, let's see, 1,2,3,0 is 5,22

[00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:05.890]
That-

[00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.070]
That's only 825 grand small potatoes

[00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:09.490]
Ah, they carry that around on them

[00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.790]
They carry that pocket change, in fact, if you shook that tree hard enough

[00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:14.550]
It would probably fall out of the branches

[00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:16.050]
Yeah, in bandsaw

[00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:27.050]
Let's go on and shake the tree and see what we can get out of it

[00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.050]
And play the first part of that over and over here

[00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:29.830]
That's a classic

[00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:32.450]
We'll have to have him redo that and delete

[00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:35.390]
Now there's a whole bunch of me needs to redo, Old Baldi

[00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:38.070]
Because they're too good to just lose them, you know?

[00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:40.470]
Yeah, that's one of them

[00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.730]
Sure

[00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.190]
We don't need to have him say God

[00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.250]
F*** was America or anything like that

[00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.910]
Right?

[00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.710]
Now can we still play the Man Dog thing?

[00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:49.570]
Of course it's silly!

[00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.710]
I was thinking about that every day

[00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:54.230]
Every single day, fart sounds

[00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.650]
Right

[00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:57.110]
Now, something else I want you folks to know

[00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:59.370]
I don't want to get too nervous, but if you're like an elevator

[00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:01.150]
Or if you're like a publics

[00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:03.630]
Or any place where it's occurred in a mall with crowd of people around

[00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:05.650]
You can still fart, but they have to be SBDs

[00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:08.230]
Or SBQs

[00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:09.670]
SB, I don't know

[00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:11.690]
In other words, they have to be silent

[00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.170]
Right, they can't even make that

[00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:13.970]
No!

[00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:15.270]
Oh, those are the worst!

[00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:16.990]
The hissing ones

[00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:19.690]
Oh man, the hissing really pisses off the FCC

[00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:20.770]
Right, not for a Hissie fit

[00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.530]
I'm hissing and pissing off the FCC

[00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:24.230]
Right?

[00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:28.390]
And they will throw Michael Cops and Michael Paltrow a Hissie fit

[00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:29.190]
If you do that

[00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:30.690]
So don't make those sounds

[00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:34.010]
If you do it very quietly, very, you know

[00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:35.790]
Sub-Rosa, then it's okay

[00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:36.430]
But if you're like

[00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.290]
Why I was gonna make a Raspberry, but nevermind

[00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:40.790]
I'm gonna kinda start out quiet and then like, right at the end of it

[00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:41.710]
Oh, explosive

[00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:44.750]
Let's not get into a graphic discussion of this

[00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:45.890]
Exkritory activity

[00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:47.450]
See, there's the lightbulb, see

[00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:48.610]
There's the sound cable

[00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:51.350]
Automatic

[00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:55.210]
In fact, we have that new digital thing

[00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:57.570]
There's a big article in the business section in the herald today about how

[00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:59.250]
This is a whole new industry

[00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:02.070]
Radio stations are buying thousands, even public radio

[00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:02.610]
Yeah

[00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:05.150]
Is buying this new digital delay thing

[00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:06.350]
We can go up to 20 seconds

[00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:08.530]
And then the one I talked about a couple of weeks ago

[00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:10.730]
Or maybe that was last week when you were gone

[00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:13.030]
They have one that actually will edit out words

[00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:15.590]
You program it with certain words

[00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:18.350]
And if they get on, it automatically edits them out

[00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:19.030]
Oh, handy

[00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:20.690]
Yeah, the little sound comes on

[00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:22.990]
You place the word instead, it covers it up with

[00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.530]
One of them

[00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:24.470]
You just feed it the dictionary

[00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:28.250]
No, you program it ahead of time, the ones that you don't want on there

[00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:29.330]
Not all the ones you do

[00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:30.770]
Headets out, sound as well

[00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.790]
Yes

[00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:33.510]
Fort sound

[00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:34.510]
That sound

[00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.350]
Now I'm not sure what Geldy's doing when he's making that sound

[00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:38.050]
Uh-oh

[00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:40.510]
Ooh, something smells bad

[00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:42.190]
I don't know what that is

[00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:43.450]
It's 11

[00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:46.450]
Childish, juvenile

[00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:48.130]
People are dying

[00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.750]
Lives are being erased over nothing

[00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:53.490]
We should be having impeachment hearings right now

[00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:57.510]
And instead we got people worried about fart sounds on the radio

[00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:00.510]
Oh, my freaking god

[00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:02.230]
Zine America, man

[00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:06.070]
It's only one thing that I would like to say

[00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:07.810]
Oh, Canada

[00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:09.270]
That's it

[00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.670]
Carmen

[00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:12.030]
Get that off

[00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:12.930]
Right now

[00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:14.230]
Oh, it's January, no

[00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.890]
Oh, my god, the good old Jenny, you go, boy

[00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:21.770]
12 minutes after 11 at 560 WQM when you shop for quality footwear by now

[00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:24.090]
You better know that Brandy's is the place, man

[00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:25.270]
They've been going there for years

[00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:28.470]
Brandy's been around in this town in Pompano for, I'd say, a coon's age

[00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:31.010]
Because if Brandy's shoes, it's an unbeatable combination

[00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.830]
You find the biggest selection of men's and women's shoes

[00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:35.450]
The best service and the best prices in town anywhere

[00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:39.750]
And all the top quality names and shoes that you love like rock ports, floor shine, SAS

[00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.250]
Spirit, Timberland, naturalizer, and lots more

[00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:45.630]
And with Brandy's humongous selection, you can just about bet anybody's life

[00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:50.790]
Even that clearance is life on it, that whatever size and style you need it's sitting on a shelf waiting to slap on your fat foot

[00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:55.490]
So find out for yourself, I'm most of Brandy's customers, not just keep coming back, but every time they come into the store

[00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:57.010]
They usually buy several pair

[00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:59.810]
Brandy's open daily nine to nine Sundays 10 to five

[00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.250]
You'll find them in that same great location they've been doing it right for years

[01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:07.030]
They're at 1290, North Federal Highway in Pompano Beach, it's always worth the trip to Brandy's

[01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.350]
No matter where you'll be living it

[01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:13.070]
And you can be sure and stop by Brandy's this way because they got their big store-wide SAS sale

[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:18.030]
