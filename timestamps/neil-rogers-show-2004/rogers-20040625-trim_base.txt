[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.520]
Joe Rose is coming back Monday.

[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.980]
Oh, thank the Lord.

[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.560]
Thank you.

[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.620]
Thank you, George.

[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.480]
Oh, George.

[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.220]
George, radio 5, 6, 8, WQAM, Miami Ford, Lutterdale.

[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.460]
Which means Gildi and Mar are going to be together again

[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.980]
Monday morning.

[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.120]
That will be something to really hear.

[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.240]
Stayed in front of you now.

[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.020]
Two years later and say it took me a little while.

[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480]
A little slow learner.

[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.060]
But Neil, I apologize.

[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.820]
It's a video.

[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.120]
You are the truth.

[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.100]
It's Friday.

[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.480]
You bastard.

[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.940]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.200]
Can't believe the language I hear all TV.

[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.220]
Every home of word is an obscenity.

[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.180]
I don't used to be the cable was a horror on words.

[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.720]
But now the networks let their actors curse.

[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.720]
Oh, my God.

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.180]
There's no end in sight so this is sad of T.

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.360]
All the dialogue contains profanity.

[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.420]
Square and like a sailor on a 3-day pass,

[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.280]
Words a whole lot worse than ads.

[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.760]

[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.400]
I have no.

[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.040]
I have no.

[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040]
I have no.

[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.380]
There's no telling when they'll drop on on the U.T.

[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.380]
Vice President Dick Cheney blurted out the F word.

[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.280]
A Democratic senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont during a heated exchange on the Senate floor

[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.980]
congressional aid.

[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.640]
Say, yesterday we got people dying all over the world.

[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.400]
Innocent people.

[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.660]
We got bombs of bursting in air.

[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.160]
And what are we worried about?

[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.260]
The Vice President uttered the F word.

[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.580]
I think this allegation is even more grotesque than suggesting that the Vice President might

[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.560]
have a dick daughter.

[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.440]
The incident occurred on Tuesday in a church discussion between the two that touched on

[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.920]
politics, religion and money.

[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.180]
With Cheney finally, finally, say I'm tongue-tied.

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.560]
I can't because I'm right on the edge of it.

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.700]
Cheney finally telling Leahy to F off or go F yourself the A.C.

[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.800]
And I said, how do you like that?

[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.680]
I think he was just having a bad day, Leahy was quoted as saying on CNN, which first reported

[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.140]
to be incident.

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.700]
I was kind of shocked to hear that kind of language on the floor.

[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.960]
Oh, let's hear it on CNN.

[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.560]
Come on.

[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.940]
That doesn't sound like language the Vice President would use, but there was a frank exchange

[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.860]
of views at Cheney spokesman Kevin Kellams.

[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.380]
Leahy and other Democrats have called for congressional hearings into whether the Vice

[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.180]
President helped the Alabama Burton with lucrative contracts in Iraq.

[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.660]
After the West led war, the toppled Sodom was saying during their exchange, Leahy noted

[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.100]
that Republicans had accused Democrats of being anti-Catleg because they're opposed

[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.120]
to some of President Bush's anti-Aversion judges, the A.C.

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.880]
That's when Cheney uploaded with the F-Bomb A.C.

[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.940]
According to Senate rules, profanity is not permitted in the chamber, but when the

[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.300]
exchange occurred between Leahy and Cheney, it was just a photo opportunity.

[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.080]
The Senate was not in session, so there was technically no foul, no harm, no foul.

[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.040]
You can't get much foulder than Dick Cheney.

[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.360]
Oh, and speaking of the FCC, I've got that way down in my pile, but we better get right

[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.700]
on it.

[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.920]
Better start talking fast because everybody's going to be going lining up to go see Fahrenheit

[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.060]
9-11 today at a theater near you.

[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.780]
We're piloting.

[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.780]
22 theaters here in the GTA in the greater Toronto area, Iraq, carrying it.

[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.280]
I'll be running out there this week for this year for sure, and we'll discuss it at

[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.920]
9th on Monday.

[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.540]
George won't be with us though, he'll be on vacation.

[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.460]
In fact, he'll be watching it over and over again.

[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.900]
Right.

[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.980]
Good news finally.

[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.860]
Some great news.

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.620]
US courts keep stay on media rules, which Michael Powell is pretty pissed off about this,

[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.040]
by the way.

[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.060]
Anything that pisses Michael Powell off makes us very happy.

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.720]
A US appeals court refused yesterday to allow loose and federal media rules on media

[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.640]
ownership to take effect, dealing upload a large media companies like News Corp that are

[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.560]
hoping to expand.

[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.760]
The US court of appeals for the third circuit said the new rules would not take effect

[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.960]
until the FCC better explain how it came up with them.

[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.780]
How much the how many brown paper bags they took and how much was in them.

[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.200]
The commission is not sufficiently justified.

[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.940]
It's particular.

[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.620]
It's particular chosen numerical limits for local television ownership, local radio ownership

[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.600]
and cross ownership of media within local markets.

[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.480]
The courts tune at 18 page opinions said.

[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.220]
How do you like that?

[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.740]
Andrew Schwartzman, a lawyer for Prometheus Radio Project who filed the law, so it said

[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.680]
the court in order to the FCC to take the regulatory thumb off the scale.

[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.780]
It looks like the court agreed with us that preserving democracy is more important than

[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.980]
helping big companies grow bigger.

[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.160]
Schwartzman said, wasn't that Dr. Schwartzman in Faso?

[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.760]
Was that his name?

[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.640]
I don't know.

[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.740]
The Diet Doctor.

[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.080]
Don't you remember Dr. Schwartzman?

[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.920]
I don't remember his name.

[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.720]
What a memory I got.

[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.820]
Well, I know my Diet Doctor is Mr. Venusier Dawn.

[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.180]
No.

[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.680]
Anyway, let's take a look at yesterday's poll result.

[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.460]
I'll give you the obedient curtain today, boy.

[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.520]
Oh, boy, if you're into anorexic babes, wow.

[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.300]
Alexander Paul, I don't recall her on Baywatch being that skinny and that skanky.

[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.580]
Yeah.

[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.100]
Yeah.

[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.300]
She was.

[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.520]
The skinny is a reed.

[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.740]
A while.

[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.640]
And we don't mean gray.

[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.700]
What current American political figure has the biggest pair of colonies we asked yesterday?

[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.960]
And it wasn't easy.

[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.440]
I know it was a lookworm response because Michael Moore won overwhelmingly as he should have.

[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.940]
Look at that.

[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.420]
753 votes out of 1508.

[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.240]
Almost half the votes almost exactly have went to Michael Moore on the day of his fantastic

[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.780]
movie.

[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.700]
George W. Bush, 200, although not necessarily in a positive way.

[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.300]
Big balls.

[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.860]
Chanter Reno, 152.

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.680]
You go, boy.

[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.460]
Howard D. 97.

[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.680]
It's a big drop off down to poorer Howard Dean.

[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.100]
Richard Clark, 62.

[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.980]
Ted Kennedy, 47.

[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.760]
Little Dennis, Cassandra, 38.

[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.720]
Little guy with a big pair.

[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.900]
Al Sharpton, 37 with a big dark pair.

[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.140]
Al Gore, 28.

[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.520]
Who opened up a big mouth again yesterday, which we applaud him profusely.

[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.660]
It's a better late than ever.

[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.500]
Although it would have been a lot nicer four years ago, right?

[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.000]
Yeah.

[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.600]
Open up a mouth and say something.

[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.840]
Al Deraze.

[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.400]
Al Gore.

[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.500]
Drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein,

[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.200]
torture, treatment.

[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.520]
Abu Gharram.

[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.460]
Jesse Jackson at 18, Charlie Wrangler at 18.

[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.900]
Love Charlie Wrangler as a real smittenist derby right there, boy.

[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.340]
He don't take any crap from anybody.

[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.660]
Joe Biden, 15.

[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.680]
Russ Feingold, 13.

[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.160]
Barney Frack, Frank had 10.

[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.760]
Hey, fellow, 47.

[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.920]
John Bro had six.

[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.680]
John Bro said, no.

[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.820]
To the FCC and all that crap the other day, but he was the only one.

[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.340]
He was the only one.

[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.980]
And he's retiring the end of this year.

[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.680]
You can't complain about the balls in the Senate because you won't find any.

[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.360]
I bet you don't know.

[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.020]
She'll lay the would approve of the US Senate because you don't have to worry about them

[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.940]
saying we got balls.

[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.880]
John Bro six, Maxine Waters, she had four in Glenn Gavin Newsom.

[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.520]
Mira San Francisco, who started with him, gave marriages out there, even though he's very

[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.540]
head of roll three votes for Old Gavin.

[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.680]
The only other Gavin, I know is Gavin McCloud.

[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.800]
You know, I named Gavin.

[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.200]
Nope.

[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.000]
Just have.

[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.920]
Nice.

[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.560]
Alexandra Paul is on our behind-to-beating curtain today.

[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.520]
If you're one of those really horny guys out there, really desperate or maybe like a

[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.320]
guy who wants to take a peek at some hot chick.

[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.800]
Well, we don't have no hot choice.

[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.240]
Once upon a time she was from the naval up, I would say.

[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.760]
No, she didn't have anything there either.

[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.460]
Wow.

[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.300]
She is really scrawny.

[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.300]
She's got a real, well, she used to have a real pretty face.

[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.260]
She's like, he okay, she's still kind of great.

[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.300]
You got a good in Christine.

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.560]
New photo right here.

[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.000]
Well, Christine isn't exactly like yesterday's movie.

[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.740]
And I guarantee one other thing too.

[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.000]
And it is John Stockwell was a lot prettier than she was.

[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:41.980]
Man.

[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.280]
Don't get me started on that.

[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.000]
I'm sorry, he was just a fine, fine young man.

[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.140]
Anyway, she was born July 20, 1963 in New York, in New York City.

[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.360]
And I think anybody was born in New York.

[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.980]
Let's see, that makes her like 40, almost 41.

[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.000]
Not quite.

[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.060]
She's hanging on to 40.

[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.740]
She was in landslide.

[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.040]
Well, that's still being made.

[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.860]
Post-production for TV, saving Emily also for TV.

[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.960]
It's coming out soon.

[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.700]
Winning women TV series, a haunted woman,

[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.940]
Baywatch Hawaiian wedding TV movie.

[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.480]
And of course she was in Baywatch originally 8 million episodes.

[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.140]
Redemption of the ghost breaking up really sucks.

[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.880]
Breaking up really, I can't say sucks.

[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.240]
Diary of a sex addict.

[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.700]
Rough air, danger on flight 534.

[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.700]
It was made for TV movie facing the enemy.

[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.640]
Ten attitudes above and beyond.

[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.500]
Boy, she's made, you wouldn't believe it.

[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.920]
She has made movies up the ass.

[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.280]
And you probably would like to see those.

[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.820]
Man, oh man, oh man.

[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.440]
She has made just dozens of movies.

[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.240]
Although I would say majority of them

[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.360]
like made for TV movies.

[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.640]
Yeah, most of them.

[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.100]
Most of them.

[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.060]
Night watch.

[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.140]
Piranha.

[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.520]
All kinds of big watch movies.

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.060]
Yeah.

[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.640]
1995, Piranha.

[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.120]
Oh, that Piranha.

[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.440]
AKA Roger Corman presents Piranha.

[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.920]
And anyway, Alexander Paul.

[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.080]
And you'll be a little bit unsure, dismayed over the fact that you could probably use the sandwich.

[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.840]
Maybe you'd like to buy a Ruben sandwich for a goose or up a little over the weekend.

[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.280]
I'll see.

[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.980]
So here's the very short and cursed clip uncredited, by the way.

[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.660]
Uncredited in this morning's hero.

[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.600]
Do you have to search for it to find it after yesterday's fallacious

[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.940]
story about Joe Rose this and Joe Rose that?

[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.480]
I think the whole thing was a plant, if he asked me, okay?

[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.640]
A house plant.

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.140]
No, I'm serious.

[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.460]
I think the whole thing was just an idea to get a little free publicity from Barry Jackass.

[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.700]
And of course that always works out.

[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.320]
You can kiss my rear end.

[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.440]
They write one church sentence today.

[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.360]
It says WQM General Manager Greg Reed said Thursday.

[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.580]
He and Morning host Joe Rose have resolved their issues and Rose will be back on the

[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.900]
air Saturday morning and eight to 10 a.m. weekdays.

[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.420]
Now, did I tell the audience that yesterday because just like my close friend Mo.

[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.060]
Do do do do do.

[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.220]
I am the truth.

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.520]
You want the truth to come to this show.

[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.160]
If you want a lot of BS, just listen around to the rest of the shows and the rest of the

[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.340]
dial.

[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.380]
They hear all kinds of BS.

[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.380]
Balloney.

[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.240]
But if you want the real story like I told you yesterday, they had their meeting on Wednesday

[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.840]
and it was already a done deal.

[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.480]
But I guess since they were going to get their free publicity, the empire was already going

[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.360]
to be Greg's lucky for the four million time.

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.720]
Why not just let him go ahead and put some crap in a paper, right?

[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.920]
Plus it will keep certain people on their toes.

[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.840]
I just cannot wait.

[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.500]
I'm serious.

[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.560]
I'm going to get up early on Monday morning because I just can't wait to hear the reunion.

[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.620]
The reunion idea.

[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.180]
Mo and Gilded.

[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.460]
Just listen for the love.

[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.040]
That's right.

[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.700]
You know about love 94.

[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.780]
We got love 56.

[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.040]
I'm 5.60.

[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.560]
Q.A.M.

[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:36.740]
Okay.

[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.760]
Here's today's poll question.

[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.820]
We've done this once before.

[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.460]
But it's long enough ago that we can repeat it.

[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.080]
And if you think that we're not going to repeat polls, you must be dreaming.

[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:43.960]
Oh.

[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.920]
I don't have to tell you the idea of how to put the poll question every day.

[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.700]
That's enough to make me want to call in sick.

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.100]
Brutal.

[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:50.940]
Yeah.

[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.340]
I mean, I enjoy doing the show.

[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.980]
It's just the idea coming up with a poll question every stinkin day.

[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.380]
And then of course, if they don't like it, they respond like a bunch of little kids in the sandbox.

[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.580]
Anyway, here's today's poll.

[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.260]
If you had tons of cash, where in the world outside Florida would you live?

[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.360]
Now we haven't done this poll before because we let them.

[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.920]
We let them use, you know, Miami or whatever.

[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.780]
We're not doing it.

[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.640]
And that's so boring.

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.280]
I would live right here.

[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:14.700]
Yeah.

[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.420]
I'll screw you.

[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:15.700]
Okay.

[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.500]
If that's the case, then stay there and don't vote.

[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:18.520]
God.

[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.140]
If you had tons of cash, where in the world outside Florida would you live?

[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.440]
Started with three.

[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.900]
I don't think I put the original one on there for Eric.

[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.460]
Oh, and I see a fourth one.

[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.300]
I was on her too.

[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.380]
I put Las Vegas.

[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.200]
I don't know why so many people say that because if you have a ton of money,

[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.180]
dining and gambling and dancing, the shows.

[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:39.160]
Yeah.

[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.460]
Okay.

[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.600]
The Amsterdam for obvious reasons.

[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.360]
I put Hawaii.

[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.160]
I didn't necessarily put a city like Honolulu or anything like that, just Hawaii in general.

[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.820]
Very expensive to live there.

[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.540]
But if you had a ton of money, boy, you can go.

[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.720]
And then I see Lake Tahoe is on here.

[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.480]
Who put that on you?

[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.040]
That was me.

[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.760]
Oh, that was you've been there?

[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.320]
Yeah.

[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:56.940]
It's nice.

[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.000]
Let me tell you my Tahoe story.

[00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.820]
It's a very brief one.

[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.640]
Many, many years ago, I was on vacation.

[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.360]
I was in Sacramento, California.

[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.620]
Oh, Sacramento is great.

[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.500]
I just love that city.

[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.980]
And they have a harness track there.

[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.740]
So that's all I need.

[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.120]
And anyway, I thought I'm going to go to Tahoe.

[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240]
I'm getting one of my rent a car.

[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.340]
I'm going to drive up to Tahoe.

[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.320]
And I got to a Tahoe and there's a sign.

[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.500]
There's a fork in the road.

[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.420]
Luckily, it was in the summertime.

[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.200]
And there's a sign and it says Lake Tahoe.

[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.380]
And then there was one arrow.

[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.800]
And there's another one that says Lake Tahoe.

[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.140]
Well, okay.

[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:26.960]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:27.540]
Yeah.

[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.120]
No, no, seriously, that's what the sign said.

[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.080]
Probably they've changed it.

[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.960]
One of them went like the city where the casinos are and where the other one went.

[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.340]
The lake.

[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.040]
Right.

[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:35.500]
Okay.

[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.580]
Well, I took the wrong fork in the road.

[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.760]
And I'm going to tell you, you have never in your...

[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.320]
I guarantee you've never driven on a...

[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.020]
Well, I know you've driven in some funky places.

[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.320]
Sure.

[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.140]
This was winding mountain road.

[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.700]
And there was one place here and it was breathtaking because there were all these kayakers

[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.720]
and all these people doing all this wild stuff in the lake.

[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.160]
It's a breathtaking thing to see.

[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.900]
But there was one place in the road where you actually had to come into a stop and do like

[00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.540]
a U-turn.

[00:12:59.720 --> 00:12:59.960]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:00.560]
Sure.

[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.380]
The road runs out.

[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:01.940]
Yeah.

[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.360]
Well, it's in the mountains.

[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:03.840]
Right.

[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.200]
Yeah.

[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.040]
Been there, done that.

[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.580]
Holy moly.

[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.400]
Right, man.

[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.940]
No space to turn around.

[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.300]
So I just kept going.

[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.400]
I looked at my map and I said, well, Reno isn't really all that far.

[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.440]
So I went to Reno, Janet.

[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.460]
And I never did see a lake Tahoe, the actual city.

[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.040]
I saw the lake.

[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.860]
Wow, that is something.

[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.500]
So you're right.

[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.320]
It's a beautiful place.

[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.000]
1013 at 560, WQM.

[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.440]
We got this.

[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.060]
So that's the pole.

[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.400]
We'll see if we get any response on that.

[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.940]
If not, that's okay because we have a lot of crap.

[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320]
Don't forget to go see the movie.

[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.540]
Hey, if you're sick and tired of your PC being attacked by browser pop-up, when those

[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.200]
being watched by spyware and getting nothing but virus emails from your friends and co-workers,

[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.980]
the easiest way to deal with these bugs is to get you a Macintosh from MacCenter, the

[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.800]
Apple specialist in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.860]
The Macintosh is built on an entirely different base than Windows.

[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.100]
So all those PC press just can't hurt the Mac.

[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.360]

[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.760]
too with thousands of programs available, including ones that you're already used to

[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.760]
and comfortable with like Microsoft Word and Excel.

[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.000]
They'll even take your old computer as a trade-in.

[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.360]
So make the change today by calling the MacCenter at 9.5.4.486.5500.

[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.840]
You won't get a better deal on your Mac or iPod anyplace else in town because the

[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.860]
MacCenter is home of the 5% rebate on every purchase.

[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.740]
Come in before June 30th.

[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.660]
3rd man.

[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.940]
Register when the hard-to-find iPod mini.

[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.460]
That's all happening at the MacCenter on commercial boulevard and don't forget to mention

[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.500]
you heard about it here on QAM for extra savings too.

[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.300]
Call them at 9.5.4.486.5500.

[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.320]
That's 9.5.4.486.5500 for the MacCenter.

[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.900]
Stand in front of you now.

[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.720]
Two years later and say it took me a little while.

[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.700]
I'm a little slow learner but Neil, I apologize.

[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:46.680]
I'm a little slow learner but I'm a little slow learner but I'm a little slow learner.

[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.760]
Can I take it at 5.60?

[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.860]
Darren Kagan, I'm seeing that and just did a really sensational interview with Michael

[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.060]
Moore.

[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:12.640]
How do you like that?

[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.260]
All right.

[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.140]
Well good.

[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.680]
I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like

[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:33.760]
it but I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it.

[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:40.440]
I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it.

[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.120]
I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it.

[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.620]
I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it.

[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.760]
I don't know if you like it but I don't know if you like it.

[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.780]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.100]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:16:59.200 --> 00:16:59.980]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.380]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.240]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.700]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.920]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.840]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.580]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.320]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.340]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.820]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.940]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.100]
I don't know if you like it.

[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.120]
The story of Puyg in USA Today says no movie gore will be bored.

[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.900]
The documentary scathing attack on the war in Iraq and George W. Bush's presidency

[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.580]
is informative, provocative, frightening, compelling, funny, manipulative, and most of all entertaining.

[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.000]
Mary Coralus in Time magazine says,

[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.440]
Fahrenheit 9-11 is at its best when it provides talking points for the emerging majority

[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.540]
of those opposed to the Iraq incursion in some it's an appalling and thralling primer

[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.280]
of what more sees as the Bush administration's crimes and misdemeanors.

[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.840]
Todd McCarthy in Variety says,

[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.460]
it's title not withstanding.

[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.500]
Michael Moore delivered a film rather less than sent to the area that might be expected

[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.880]
or wished for by his fans in Fahrenheit 9-11.

[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.300]
These sporadically effective docutrade's far more emotional appeals than

[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.300]
in systematically building Evansville case against the present on the circle.

[00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.080]
That's his take.

[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.880]
Here's one from James Vernier, Boston, Harold.

[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.940]
Fahrenheit 9-11 comes to many of the same conclusions as the recent 9-11 panel.

[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.600]
The film will play to the choir and may influence voters, especially younger ones

[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.100]
who are straddling the fence if you want to be part of the debate.

[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.480]
Fahrenheit 9-11 is must-see cinema.

[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.160]
Descent Thomas Washington Post says,

[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.060]
what's remarkable here isn't more political animosity or ticklish wit.

[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.020]
It's the well- argued heartfelt power of his persuasion.

[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.800]
Even though there are many things here that we've already learned,

[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.280]
Moore puts it all together.

[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.440]
It's a look back that feels like a new gaze forward.

[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.060]
And there's some other ones on here.

[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.420]
And I noticed I didn't see this on the Fudge Report.

[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.600]
Also all of those things about the Clinton book of disappeared from the Fudge Report

[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.120]
about how it isn't selling real big and manate to walk.

[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.160]
And it's not real big in Peoria.

[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.060]
And I hope somebody here in Bill Glade aren't like going crazy buying it.

[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:48.840]
Yeah.

[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.340]
Fahrenheit sets single day sales record in New York City.

[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:52.680]
Oh!

[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.560]
Director Michael Moore's controversial documentary,

[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.420]
Fahrenheit 9-11 turned on the box office,

[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.160]
heat, and its first day of theaters breaking single day records

[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.960]
that the two New York City theaters were played.

[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.680]
The movie, which aims a critical eye at President Bush and his prosecution

[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.300]
of the Warner Racks sold $49,000 worth of tickets at the Lowesville and 7th Theater,

[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.920]
beating the venue's single day record of $43,000 plus all by 1997's men and black,

[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.680]
according to distributor's Lionsgate films and IFC films.

[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:26.300]
At the Lincoln Plaza Theater, Fahrenheit 9-11 took in more than $30,000 to top the 24 grand set

[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.840]
by Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in 2000.

[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.080]
A spokesman for Lionsgate Film said the company debuted the movie in the two theaters

[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.780]
to help build good word of mouth, friend telling friend publicity,

[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.780]
head of the wide debut today when it plays in 868 theaters and all 50 states.

[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.020]
Plus, of course, here in Canada, 22 theaters right here in the GTA.

a fan of you, I'm not going to be a fan of you, I'm not going to be a fan of you, I'm not—who would want to be dealing with those people there? To have always wanted to those people to meet you and see them at home with you because those people creatively keep you knowing them, those sheep, in the concept of the devil God is there with you cooking.

[00:25:46.420 --> 00:26:01.880]
I'm not going to keep you doing this because I'm not going to be a fan of you because I'm not going to be a fan of you.

[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.260]
here in Miami it says Fahrenheit 9.11 is only playing at sunset place,

[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.420]
Cocoa Walk 16,

[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.660]
Evan Tura and South Beach according to the internet at AMC theaters.

[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.820]
What happened to South Day 8 where black folk and Cubans go?

[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.020]
According to the internet, it's not playing in Kindle Town of Country.

[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:16.980]
Well guess what?

[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.260]
Hop in a car, get out one of those jitney buses or something and move to another part of town

[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.660]
for a couple of hours, go see it there.

[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:22.920]
Right.

[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:23.980]
Huh?

[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.020]
Yeah.

[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.440]
It's all over the place.

[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.160]
In addition to which I'm sure that if they only check out AMC theaters,

[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.020]
there's a lot of other places besides AMC theaters.

[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.340]
Right?

[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.360]
I'm sure they just got to do some work.

[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.280]
I mean, it's not in wide release.

[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.880]
That's like that other facts you read yesterday that they've only got 500.

[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:42.240]

[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.380]
Let me say it again.

[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.400]
It's showing at 22 theaters here in Toronto this weekend.

[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.120]
22.

[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.540]
You don't get this sound like wide release to you.

[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.540]
That's a lot up there.

[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.820]
And it's not 22 theaters down here though, but they're still plenty.

[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:56.980]
Well, let's see.

[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.540]
Here's one, two, three, four on here now.

[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.320]
Plus we know it's at the gateway in Fort Lauderdale and a couple of others.

[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.860]
The one in the sunrise that it's at least a dozen.

[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.920]
Okay, ten or enough.

[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.780]
And of course, we're not even counting Palm Beach County.

[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.800]
Because what do we know about them?

[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.580]
Maybe they'll tell us.

[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.720]
In fact, if somebody out there wants to do us a public service, they could,

[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.020]
the facts and let us know.

[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.280]
It's right.

[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.400]
See, I got a great idea for whoever sent this anonymous facts, open up a newspaper.

[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.620]
Oh my God.

[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.780]
Look at who this is from.

[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.080]
The Einhorn Icare Center.

[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.540]
Remember the doctors on the horn?

[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.040]
What if Mr. Ego's the sponsors?

[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.640]
The doctors Einhorn?

[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.860]
Maybe they just can't read the newspaper from a small print.

[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.920]
Get a magnifying glass and open up to the theaters section in the newspaper in a

[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.380]
here old this morning and maybe take a look and see where it's playing a quit

[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:40.640]
Billy.

[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.200]
It can do us.

[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.460]
It's all over the place in addition to which if you that anxious to see it,

[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.560]
it's certainly as well worth the effort to go and drive a couple of miles to go see it.

[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.880]
I'm going to hop on a subway here.

[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.500]
It's not playing like right next door to where I live.

[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.580]
So I'll hop on a subway.

[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.000]
It'll take me a two minutes big deal.

[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.740]
Man, what about your lazy?

[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.900]
It's like the thing with the marlins with a stadium.

[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:57.920]
Oh, wait.

[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.820]
We want it right next door to my house.

[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.120]
Right.

[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.620]
You know, what's a lazy bastard's?

[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:03.740]
How about that?

[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.160]
I will say one thing for the Marlin organization, man, they are sure working over

[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.540]
time to give away all kinds of crap.

[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.080]
I run, they caught on.

[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.720]
These people caught on real quick, unlike John Henry.

[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.980]
If they want to put asses in the seats, just winning the world serious and

[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.460]
winning a lot of games and being in first place.

[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.920]
I mean, that's fine, but you've got to give away a bunch of free crap or have

[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.100]
some extra hook every day to drag those bastards into the ballpark.

[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.800]
Here's the fact that says I would live at least part of the year in

[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.320]
Andora.

[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.040]
It's the tiny country in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain.

[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:32.760]
Beautiful place.

[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.380]
No taxes.

[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.500]
Very friendly, multi-coachered cosmopolitan non-EEC UA.

[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.800]
Fly to Barcelona, motor coach up to Andora cold and snowy in the

[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.780]
winter, facial here on women is fairly informal.

[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.740]
Whole country is about the size of four.

[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.160]
Lauderdale.

[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.360]
Don't tell everybody it's a secret.

[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.820]
It says, are we putting these on?

[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.180]
Are I hope?

[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.100]
Yes.

[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.360]
Yes.

[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:50.980]
We're good.

[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.780]
And here's somebody that says Rome near the Piazza Navona.

[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.040]
At Chappecchia.

[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:56.420]
Rome.

[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.260]
Yep.

[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.280]
I'm not so sure I wouldn't have picked Rome myself as opposed to Amsterdam.

[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.620]
Just because of the food.

[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:09.600]
What I would do is I would go on the Alexander Paul diet for about six months

[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.760]
and get out about 120 pounds soaking wet.

[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.000]
And then I would move to Rome.

[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.720]
I'm just eat mine, jamangio.

[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.640]
Oh, I'm serious.

[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.700]
Even if you don't care about art or culture or just seeing all I can't

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.700]
imagine how anybody could not care about seeing the buildings.

[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:24.620]
Yeah.

[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.160]
Seeing a colosseum and the Spanish steps all of these things.

[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.780]
But even if you don't care anything about that,

[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.080]
oh, and I'll tell you, Josh Beckett would like to roll me a lot.

[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:32.740]
You want to know why?

[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.000]
Quick.

[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.180]
I know he could wash his hands at all of those statues.

[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.040]
You know where they're like peeing in the fountain.

[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.480]
Right.

[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.040]
He could go down and just wash his hands all the time.

[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.040]
They're really mighty clean.

[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.640]
But even if you don't like any of those things, the food in itself is just that's

[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:46.980]
worth going.

[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.620]
If you're really skinny or if you just fatten have a death wish,

[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.020]
that's where you want to go.

[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:52.660]
WQA and hello.

[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.440]
Not there.

[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.240]
WQA.

[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:54.460]
Hello.

[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.320]
QA M.

[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.920]
Yeah, for the poll.

[00:29:59.260 --> 00:29:59.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.420]
Salisbury Connecticut.

[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.200]
Salisbury Connecticut.

[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.260]
Well, I figure if you have all the money in the world, you're, uh,

[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.940]
is that just your home base, right?

[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.880]
The place you're going to live.

[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.400]
Yeah.

[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.060]
Six months in one day of the year.

[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.860]
I never heard of Salisbury, Connecticut.

[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.280]
Is there where Salisbury state came from?

[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.500]
I'm sure it didn't.

[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.640]
No, beautiful little nook in the Northwest quorum here.

[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.420]
Uh, the Appalachian Trail and all that stuff.

[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.400]
OK, thanks so much.

[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.500]
Salisbury Connecticut.

[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.900]
Say goodbye, put it on there.

[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.280]
Even though it's not going to get any votes except his Salisbury state came from

[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:29.520]
England.

[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.400]
Of course, I just asked that to try to be like, uh, try to make it a little more

[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.040]
interesting, which it wasn't five six seven, oh five 60 pound five 60 on a

[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.160]
AT and T in Verizon wireless line.

[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.540]
The new inquirer is out.

[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.740]
Of course, it was out yesterday.

[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.220]
But if I would have used it yesterday, then we wouldn't have anything to talk

[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:45.680]
about today.

[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.640]
Man, there is so much they made up for several weeks of a real dry, dry spell

[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.560]
there at the inquirer.

[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.380]
Front cover story Clinton cheating again.

[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.440]
Aren't you shocked?

[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.620]
Oh my God.

[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.700]
What a surprise.

[00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.380]
Secret trips to lovers.

[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.980]
Hideaway bring more heartbreak for Hillary.

[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:01.660]
We'll get into that.

[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.420]
In fact, almost every page in this inquirer, there's something really heavy

[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.160]
duty going on.

[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.440]
Vanessa Williams and Laker, hubby divorcing over sexy blonde, David Caruso,

[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.800]
frolics with mystery gal.

[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.040]
Uh, there's just more crap in here.

[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.700]
It's just, um, Hollywood, madame is hot for rush Limbaugh.

[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.800]
Heidi Fleiss has got a crush for rush.

[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.880]
Limbaugh divorce could signal fall of his empire, talk show host fears.

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.140]
The feds are leading on his wife in order to do it to him.

[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.340]
What they did to Martha Stewart, which we can't wait for that.

[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.400]
Jack Oh, hiding out in Miami.

[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.340]
See all the swill eventually comes to Miami.

[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.180]
That's why I want up there.

[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.320]
Uh, it's just loaded.

[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.740]
It's like they were holding all of this good stuff back for weeks and weeks.

[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.580]
And we Brittany sex tape nightmare.

[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.460]
Huh?

[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.440]
Internet email.

[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.820]
He tries to make a phony sale.

[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.980]
307 pound cursed the alley, spinning out of control.

[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.860]
If you saw this picture, you've got to go to public.

[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.260]
Oh, no, but you haven't seen this.

[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:53.600]
No.

[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.880]
In fact, you wouldn't be there.

[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.140]
You'd be in a hospital right now.

[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.980]
You'd have a, in a mental institution, you'd be having a risk breakdown.

[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.740]
You have never seen the other day.

[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.520]
Oh my God.

[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.160]
Wow.

[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.520]
Yeah, she's a Marlon Brando now.

[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.500]
Fast food is a favorite of curse.

[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.000]
The unless she stops at a taco shop and it shows her coming out with a bag full of stuff.

[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.220]
I could feed the Chinese army.

[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.040]
307 pounds.

[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.320]
She is just ballooned up to a monster in the entertainment industry.

[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:19.700]
Wow.

[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.100]
Wow.

[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:20.260]
Wow.

[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:27.720]
She's 5, 7, 307 pounds, which is only 100 pounds more than doing her last major role on Veronica's closet.

[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.960]
I'm going to squeeze that fat ass in the closet.

[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.500]
I'll tell you that.

[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.980]
So we're getting all of those things today.

[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.500]
Most Americans now say that sending US troops to Iraq was a mistake.

[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.340]
A USA to the ACN and Calipule finds for the first time.

[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.200]
I'm sure he also say that the war there has made the nation less safe from terrorism.

[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.660]
The American people a little slow on the update, but they're finally catching on the survey.

[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.500]
Taking Monday through Wednesday of this week shows a turnaround and views toward the war in less than a month.

[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.680]
Continued violence in Iraq and questions about the war's justification.

[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.580]
Apparently are eroding support even as the US moves to turn over sovereignty to somebody next week.

[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.240]
We don't really know who to some much of guys.

[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.520]
It's the first time since the Vietnam that a majority of Americans is called a major deployment of US forces.

[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.440]
A mistake.

[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.460]
When the war in Iraq began last year, a public by three to one sending sending troops to Iraq was a mistake.

[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:20.120]
Just three weeks ago, 58% still held that view, but now 54% say mistake.

[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.180]
How do you like that?

[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.520]
In December, 56% said the war made the US safer, but now,

[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:29.880]
where's the number?

[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.680]
Well, I can't find the number.

[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.120]
At any rate Bush is doing better against Democrats.

[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.600]
John Kerry, because of brightening views of the economy, among likely voters nationwide,

[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.020]
Bush leads Kerry 48 to 47% with Ralph Nader getting 3%.

[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.380]
Three weeks ago, Kerry led 49 to 43%.

[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:49.900]
But the most important news in the 17 battleground states where both campaigns are focusing their time at TV ads,

[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.380]
Kerry has widened his lead over Bush 53 to 40%.

[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.920]
They were tied in these states in mid-May,

[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.820]
Kerry had a 5.0 lead three weeks ago and always up by 13 lucky points.

[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.220]
Five to look all these 60 five cities.

[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.640]
The radio's all yours.

[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.820]
Q&A.

[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.840]
Jim from the Clinton memoirs.

[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:15.220]
Out of mating with a cadenet today and spent a little time with Madeline Albright talking over national security.

[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.540]
And I got it, Nader was oddly turned on.

[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.860]
Yes, it turns out of always wanted to...

[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.440]
My grandfather.

[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:21.860]
The Clinton memoirs.

[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.080]
That bookstores this summer.

[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.100]

[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.180]
We got Mad Dog at 2.

[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.120]
The Humper at 4.

[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.840]
630 at Marlins on Deck or 640, excuse me, because the game is in the Tampa.

they're just commercials, that's all.

these shows.

that I hear the station that often, but what I do, I don't hear people reading these

[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:43.080]
does, and Miguel, your good friend with those baseball tickets, but I'm sure clearance

[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:43.920]
is on top of them.

[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.140]
What a thing that, what a thing that is to conjure up, you know?

[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.140]
No, thank you.

[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.040]
Oh.

[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.780]
Anyway, here's this list.

[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.260]
Let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six.

[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.040]
Let me try again.

[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:04.860]
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:09.320]
That's your lucky number, thirteen, as in Dan Marieau and Matt Sundin, number thirteen.

[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.400]
Thirteen theaters it's playing, I had to stop loading these people.

[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.920]
And it makes the way to my house.

[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.100]
And they did the MC down the corner.

[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.840]
She is this cave, Christ man.

[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.720]
I've never seen such a bunch of lazy ass bastards in my life.

[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.560]
Is it raining today?

[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.660]
It's probably like 98 degrees in the humidest hell and not a cloud in the sky, isn't it?

[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.380]
Yep, inside.

[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:32.680]
No, seriously.

[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.900]
Probably hotter than hell.

[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:35.320]
It is.

[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:36.600]
So what's the problem?

[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:36.880]
Good one.

[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.460]
Nice air condition.

[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.020]
One of these little spiffy theaters gets you about 45 pounds of popcorn and a bunch of

[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.280]
juju bees and whatever else you like.

[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.960]
One of those non-porels with little white things on them, right?

[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:45.640]
Goi-goi bees.

[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:51.520]
Yeah, it gets them goi-goi bees and juju bees and muslim bees, honey bees and honey bears

[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.740]
and have a great time.

[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.240]
What the hell are you complaining about?

[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:54.660]
Jesus.

[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.440]
Here I am.

[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.320]
The first thing I did this morning, I grabbed the newspaper.

[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.780]
I take a look in here and I see that 22 different theaters all around the area here including

[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.580]
some I can just have on the subway and be there in two minutes.

[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.260]
And what's not to like?

[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:07.820]
I'm not complaining.

[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.120]
He said, oh gee, it's not the one right over here and not down the corner.

[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.280]
Well, big stinkin' deal.

[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.860]
Here's the list of where it's playing.

[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:15.660]
Fahrenheit 9.11.

[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.640]
Right now, okay?

[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.580]
Right while not right now, but like in an hour.

[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:19.860]
Less than an hour.

[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.060]
No, just about an hour.

[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:27.020]
Because I see there are ones that started 12.50 and 12.20 and 12.40 and one in noons of matter

[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.840]
fact in South Miami.

[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.660]
That's the first one.

[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.800]
And for now, I take that back 11.50 this morning in 44 minutes with whose counting?

[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.160]
That's the first one I see.

[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.740]
They're probably going to be lined up from there all the way to Alacuipa.

[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.140]
The Regal South Beach 18 in Miami.

[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.820]
On South Beach 11.50 this morning.

[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.260]
I'm not going to read all the times on these, but most of them start right around noon

[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.100]
in sure one o'clock at the very latest or 130.

[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.520]
So what's not to like?

[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.540]
The AMC Aventura, 24 in Aventura.

[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.760]
Myzoparks Cinema and Regal Shatterwood 16 in Boca.

[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.140]
AMC Cocoawalk 16 in the Grove.

[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.120]
Sunrise Cinema's Dear Field 8 Mall in Dear Field.

[00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.320]
Movies of Delray in Delray Beach.

[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.840]
Dryer theaters Gateway 4 for Florida.

[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.680]
It's right on sunrise next to the Oolmolino.

[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:13.360]
Highly a ground, a crown-grant 18, even a highly either shown it for all those right-wingers.

[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.240]
Like I said, Regal South Beach 18 in Miami 11.50 this morning.

[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:19.840]
North Miami Beach Sunrise Cinema's Intercoastal 8.

[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.700]
South Miami AMC Sunset Place 24.

[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.740]
Sunrise Dryer theaters Sunrise Cinema at 1 o'clock and Regal Saga Rast 23.15.

[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.680]
So what the Saga Raster's showing it, right?

[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:30.580]
Right?

[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.580]
So what's not to like that guy in Weston?

[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:38.420]
I was like, yeah, in Weston cries 115, 415, 725 and 1020.

[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.000]
You lazy, lazy, oh and here he is, another facts Gary in Weston.

[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.460]
He's so much on the road here.

[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:43.500]
He's so much on the road here.

[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:43.740]
He's so much on the road here.

[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:43.900]
He's so much on the road here.

[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:44.260]
He's so much on the road here.

[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.740]
I fact you the theater listening, sir, about to pour, pour, pour, pour, pour.

[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.040]
Well, so what about it?

[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.640]
How many are you going to see it at at one time?

[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.920]
How many different theaters you're going to watch it at at one time?

[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:55.380]
That's what I thought.

[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.680]
Josh lives around Weston.

[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:57.500]
He's going to Aventura.

[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:58.240]
Yeah.

[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.840]
So what there's going to make comedy at showing it, if there's one that close to you, you're

[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.020]
in Weston and showing it to Saga.

[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.680]
Gary, you are the laziest piece of theater that I've ever encountered in my life.

[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.020]
Get a life, you lazy.

[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.040]
And not only that, but his office is on our way to Parkway.

[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.300]
I'm not going to read the address, but he's on our way to Parkway.

[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.060]
You know, you just head up to Saga Raster.

[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.820]
You have to Saga Raster, small in about four minutes.

[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.940]
You can go 150 miles an hour on them, 75 on the Saga Raster.

[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.280]
What is wrong with you, Gary?

[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.820]
This is the problem in South Florida.

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.600]
What a lazy, lazy handed to me, baby.

[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.680]
Handed to me, stick it in my hand.

[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.880]
And my answer was no thanks.

[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:30.980]
Wow.

[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:31.960]
Can you believe that?

[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.020]
I believe it.

[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.640]
It's only showing it three and brow.

[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.180]
That sounds like enough.

[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:44.020]
Anyway, Stockholm Sweden, it says, from Dave the Cop, short and sweet to the point, thank

[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.680]
you Dave the Cop will be more than happy to send you there.

[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:46.980]
Greg Readle paid for it.

[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.560]
He'll trade it out.

[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.100]
In fact, we'll race Sunny.

[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.640]
We'll run on a special online auction.

[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.180]
We'll race to another scam.

[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:55.340]
And we'll race to my descent, Dave the Cop to Stockholm, or find those beautiful blondes.

[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.380]
And some women too.

[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:57.700]
Let's see.

[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.460]
Mike says, the mountains in North Carolina, well, that's up your alley.

[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.060]
Right.

[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.320]
How do we want to put that?

[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.360]
Just mountains in North Carolina?

[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.420]
Appalachian mountains, how's that?

[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.440]
Because they're just as beautiful and, you know, and then he says, six places in Dave

[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:09.900]
showing for you.

[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:10.900]
I don't know.

[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.200]
Don't anybody tell me, yeah, I had the whole listening for you right there.

[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.500]
I saved that engagement candidate.

[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.260]
It's not just six in Dave County.

[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.660]
It's one, well, maybe it is one.

[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:19.800]
That's right.

[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:25.460]
Because I'm including both two, three, four, five.

[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.680]
Like I said, six.

[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.700]
You're absolutely got your thumb right on it, baby, six.

[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.640]
How many does it need to be until these people are half about 30 minutes?

[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.980]
But we're in the so much about who else is going to be able to see it.

[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:36.940]
You go and see it.

[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:37.140]
All right.

[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.760]
Quit worrying about what everybody else is doing.

[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.460]
Nozy, nozy bastards, all these emotion, no wonder Bush caught in.

[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:48.100]
No wonder why everybody was else sleep crying, doing the usual software crying thing.

[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.060]
Well, they were stealing the election and brought daylight.

[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.020]
God almighty.

[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.480]
Here's what we got so far in the pool.

[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.160]
And I'm not changing it that really bogus thing in the USA today, which is the money center

[00:53:59.160 --> 00:53:59.380]
was.

[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.380]
Well, I mean, it was a bad, bad description.

[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.140]
Wait, wait, I mean, we've done that pool.

[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.060]
Those kind of pulls a billion times already, right?

[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:08.400]
Right.

[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.580]
I'm tired of hearing about Darth Vader already.

[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.940]
If I hear about Darth Vader one more time, I'm just going to barf.

[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.220]
Barf Vader.

[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:15.800]
Yeah.

[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.700]
Now Norman Bates, that's another story.

[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.060]
How's Tab Hunter doing?

[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:21.220]
How's he doing?

[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.640]
If he had tons of cash, we're in the world outside Florida.

[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.100]
Would you live outside Florida?

[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.340]
Those are the operative two words.

[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.260]
In other words, get out of town.

[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.400]
If you had all that money, go somewhere.

[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.340]
All you perocchio people, all you people are scared to fly.

[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.600]
Oh, they're going to blow up my plane.

[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.380]
Yeah, right.

[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:37.260]
Hawaii 49, Lake Tahoe 28.

[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.720]
I'm stood on 24.

[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.660]
C1 to Damrak.

[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.440]
C1 to Damrak.

[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.680]
Lost Vegas 22.

[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.680]
In fact, that's what got for all interval of trouble.

[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.540]
It was that Damrak he kept talking about.

[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.560]
Lost Vegas 22.

[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.800]
San Francisco 14.

[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.180]
Rome has got only 11.

[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.100]
I can't believe that.

[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:54.660]
Mamma mia.

[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:56.420]
How come we don't have more than 11 for Rome?

[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:58.700]
Bahamas 6.

[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:00.220]
And maybe it's all that pollution.

[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:00.900]
That might be it.

[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.980]
All that pollution brutal traffic, things like that.

[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.540]
If you ever went there, you'd say, I don't really want to leave.

[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.680]
Quite frankly, I'm telling you right now, you wouldn't want to leave.

[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.160]
All right.

[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:09.660]
Bye.

[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.200]
And Dora 5.

[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.520]
Southbrook and Edgid's got that one guy he wants to go there will pack him a salami sandwich.

[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:20.460]
No votes yet for Prague for Bangkok for Stockholm, Sweden or the mountains in North Carolina out

[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.260]
of 162.

[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.720]
And if they don't like the pool, tough, I teed it.

[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.300]
That's what I say.

[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:24.880]
I like the pool.

[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.040]
Especially during the summertime people are thinking about taking vacations.

[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.520]
It's like a little pubic service here in Austria charge.

[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.440]
Come up with some good ideas of where to go and enjoy yourself.

[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.120]
Have a great time.

[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.360]
Forget about all the stories and life.

[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.280]
Forget about all those bush stuff and carry stuff and all these inept politicians.

[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.800]
And about the way they're us, swatching your money down the toilet like it's coming out

[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.720]
of a faucet somewhere.

[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.580]
Forget about those things.

[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:46.640]
Just to have a great time.

[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:47.360]
Go let the Grigory.

[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:47.920]
He'll take care.

[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.460]
12 minutes after 11 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.240]
It's summertime like I said only moments ago.

[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.160]
The days are getting longer.

[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.060]

[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.160]

Now, two years later and say it took me a little while, I'm a little slow learner, but

[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.700]
Neil, I apologize.

[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:19.280]
Oh!

[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.440]
The Quadil.

[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:21.680]
You are the truth.

[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:21.920]
Oh!

[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.600]
I'm going to call him.

[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.260]
The number one ingredient in the Moihalla, the day before his show, and at least according

[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.300]
to my aspirations.

[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:28.700]
No!

[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:29.980]
Stay away from me.

[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.460]
I don't even know how you have children.

[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:32.640]
Merr-Bah, hello.

[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:35.500]
I want to take on J. Piedler.

[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:35.820]
Oh!

[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.200]
J. Piedler.

[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.820]
Is that great, Quadil?

[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.800]
I can have good juice.

[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.540]
I like J. Piedler.

[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.920]
Well, not to mention, he's got extraordinary smooth buttocks.

[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:47.880]
Oh, yeah!

[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.660]
It's got to be difficult to say here.

[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:50.420]
Oh, please, though.

[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.260]
Thank you, ma'am.

[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.280]
No, no, no, wait a minute.

[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:52.720]
Don't go.

[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.960]
But I have nothing else to say.

[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:55.720]
Look at that.

[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.280]
How about this?

[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.240]
How's the weather down there in Merr-Bah?

[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:00.020]
I'm right down the street from you.

[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.600]
I have to go.

[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:01.980]
Oh, I know.

[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:02.820]
Wait, by the way, something.

[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:03.760]
No, I didn't know.

[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.180]
I have to go.

[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:06.020]
Look, I tell you what.

[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:07.120]
I'll hold you all the time.

[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:07.400]
Great.

[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:07.840]
How's that?

[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.480]
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts.

[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.000]
How's that?

[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:11.540]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:12.560]
No way!

[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.920]
That was the only color we had.

[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.480]
The day we saw in your nose is glowing again.

[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.040]
It's glowing, glowing, glowing.

[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.100]
It's glowing, glowing, glowing.

[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:22.600]
It's glowing.

[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:23.720]
It's glowing.

[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.800]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:25.640]
It's glowing.

[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:25.720]
It's glowing.

[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.820]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:55.260]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.080]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.080]

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.080]

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.080]

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.080]

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.080]

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.080]

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.080]

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.280]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:56.380]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:57.220]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:57.480]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.480]

[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.480]

[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.480]

[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.480]

[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.480]

[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.480]

[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.480]

[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:57.600]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:57.600]

[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:57.600]

[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:57.600]

[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:57.600]

[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:57.600]

[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.740]
It's glowing, glowing.

[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.440]
Almost every day I think.

[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.960]
And my veins are then a star that tickles.

[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.380]
My Illinois, the Georgia, the Georgia.

[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.920]
Yeah, I look like the fall of the sun.

[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.200]
And that's where the autumn, the winter, the old sun.

[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:22.880]
The winter, the summer, the spring, the winter, the spring.

[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.080]
It's glowing.

[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.520]
It's glowing.

[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:26.740]
It's glowing.

[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:27.120]
It's glowing.

[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:27.160]
It's glowing.

[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:27.160]

[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:27.160]

[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:27.160]

[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:27.160]

[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:27.160]

[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:31.600]
But what you're supposed to see is the name of this village.

[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:33.900]
It's glowing.

[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:36.140]
It's glowing.

[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:53.840]
I apologize to Volko because I always step on the lesson of that and that's best part.

[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.540]
Let it sein.

[00:59:55.540 --> 01:00:02.220]
I guess Derek Kagan did too good of a broad-minded interview with Michael Moore and I'll go because now they must add a frantic call it CNN headquarters

[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.260]
Get Michael Medved on there right away

[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:12.640]
Esmeral movie critic baby just another right-wing fanatic a lunatic right-winger a K a movie critic and actually he's under just

[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:18.200]
Trashing and trashing and trashing and then it doesn't have a point of view and it's not this and but it'd be but about great

[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.560]
Just keep talking about it. Okay. Every time they talk about another hundred thousand people are gonna go see it right

[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.760]
Michael of medved my ass

[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:34.940]
Here's a fact that says put me down for the twin lake cities of Manitouac and two rivers. I heard that the Clinton books not selling big a manitouac

[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.940]
Great places on a great lake also you can live on a like a king salmon on about 30 grand

[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:43.240]
But that would look really good right now

[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.800]
He says by the way, let's thank W for the economic recovery

[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.980]
It's giving me all the time in the world to send in-aimed factors to Neil good like the tally sounds like you'll need it

[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.960]
Go see the movie maybe somebody will pay for your ticket

[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.440]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and for rise and wireless line and you talk about

[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:03.560]
Unequal time this guy's been on there for like about 500 minutes already is Michael medved

[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.800]
Bapapapapapap I just to look at it makes me want a barf

[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.880]
God so many right-wingers and sold it all time

[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.540]
Let's see. Oh, this is cute. I live in what is this power?

[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.860]
Paradise book a cheaper with Mo and there you go

[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:24.580]
Oh, it will pay this paradise. Absolutely. That's in Florida and ain't funny. Okay. Leave Mo alone my good close friend

[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.560]
Here's one it says from Jason and Miami. Like how about Monte Carlo?

[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.420]
Hey, my bad Jason. That sounds like a winner to me, right?

[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.580]
Monte Carlo never been there. Don't have enough money to be going there. You got to have the big bucks

[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.460]
The Cuban calculus from mother Jones dot com. I like this article

[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.380]
offers us some hope

[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:49.580]
In the 2000 presidential election Cuban ex-Hausen Florida favorite George W. Bush over Al Gore by more than

[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.560]
250,000 votes at a ratio about four to one

[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.240]
Considering only 537 votes supposedly decided the election

[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.560]
Bush has got reason to be grateful to Florida's Cuban Americans, but

[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.720]
Four years later the Cuban vote is not a solidly behind him

[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.520]
Thank you, but as Ron for the idea of the Associated Press reported earlier this month

[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:16.440]
South Florida's Cuban American community of about 600,000 is divided over the Bush administration's policies with some hardline ex-Hausen

[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:22.480]
Complaining that Bush has failed to take a tougher stance against Castro a younger generation of Cubans who were born in the US or raised here

[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:28.360]
Most of their lives are more likely to support engagement with Cuba. They're not knee-jerk Republicans like their parents. Thank God

[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.320]
Thank you God and

[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:36.760]
It appears Bush might further divide that Cuban American community with a new series of new restrictions that take effect at the end of June

[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:43.060]
While ex-Hausen currently visit relatives in Cuba once a year the new rules limit visits to once every three years and

[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.740]
Cap the trips at 14 days

[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:51.220]
There will only be a lot of visit immediate family members as opposed to cousins or uncles and they can spend only $50 a day in Cuba instead

[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:56.640]
They could earn $167 threshold. This sounds like fascism to me like they're looking over your shoulder to count

[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.560]
How much money you're spending and how long you can be there?

[01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.600]
boy

[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.660]
Also the rules later what items Cuban Americans can send back to the island packages can no longer include clothing

[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:12.840]
Veterinary medicine so even a pets have to suffer because it is saloonetic soap making equipment seeds are personal hygiene items

[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.560]
I wonder what kind of seeds those might be

[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.620]
Money can only be sent to immediate family members

[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:23.160]
Bush's policies come after you put it a panel considered tighter sanctions against Castro's leadership in Cuba

[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:28.400]
Which has been subject to a trade a trade embargo since 1962 and you can see how well it's working of course

[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.980]
The idea was to strengthen Cuban Americans in support for the present

[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:36.540]
But as yoga or sea of the politically powerful Cuban American national foundation the C.A.N.F.

[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.100]
Told New York Times the move will instead anger less hard line exiles

[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:46.200]
You can't send underwear a soap who wrote this it almost seems like something someone to write to make the policy look absurd

[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.560]
I don't know if we're standing on a strong moral ground here

[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:54.300]
He says someone who's been his pro family is Bush should not be affecting family relationships between exiles and Cubans on the islands

[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.920]
Maria Arale Cuban American and a Republican told Roy does the new rules were enough to make her switch her vote November 2nd

[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.440]
How can you tell a person that because they left the child apparent behind the can't go and visit them?

[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.580]
How inhumane can you be she's voting for Kerry?

[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:13.800]
If the Cuban vote does split that could have dire consequences for Bush and a closely divided Florida that has two more electoral votes

[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.380]
Then last time around oh right won't be so easy to steal at this time. W

[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.440]
Chad

[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.560]
as a Catherine

[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:22.700]
man

[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.780]
As William Finneget wrote in the mark in New Yorker

[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:31.260]
There is a generational split among exiles when it comes to their stance on taking a hard line against Castro for many years

[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.320]
Pulse have shown that exiles attitude toward Castro becoming more moderate

[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.080]
The usual explanation is that the American born children the first generation of exiles known as

[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.240]
Los Historic Coast as opposed to lost hystericals

[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:49.440]
Are less bitter than their parents and are assimilating in fact though a startlingly high percentage of young Cuban Americans more than any other age groups

[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.120]
They would like to see an American military invasion of the island

[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:57.540]
Finder-grain polling shows that it isn't that children of Los Historic Coast who would prefer a policy of reconciliation

[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:02.400]
Who would like for instance to see the trading burger were less to repeal it is rather more recent arrivals from Cuba

[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.520]
It was Cubans as any shaker would say it was Cubans Cubans

[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.580]
He'd be pounding on the table and screaming like a wild banshee. I think she's dead. I know Thomas

[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.760]
If Bush was counting and by the way, last time I saw Tom shaper to hockey again

[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.260]
If Bush was counting on wooing those younger voters with his new travel and trade restrictions

[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:23.540]
The obvious problem is that more recent arrivals are not US citizens and therefore ineligible to vote

[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.560]
Also as Finnegan points out the trying to Cuban American voting didn't emerge until the Reagan years in

[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:34.320]
1979 10% more exiles identified as Democrats and Republicans but only a quarter of Cuban American voters were registered

[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:41.640]
Democrats by 1988 the exile community lost exilios like most Hispanic voters still generally side with Democrats on social issues

[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:46.980]
So any dispensuous Bush's foreign policy provides an opportunity for John Kerry to win them back as Anne Louise

[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:52.480]
Bardack argued in slate months before Bush announces travel restrictions to give Kerry the issue

[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:58.040]
He needs provided he's willing to use it. This would be a boon for John Kerry a boon in the ballot box

[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:02.600]
I guess she means a boon for John Kerry who could review Bush for starving and dividing Cuban families

[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:09.160]
That is if Kerry can finally offer a coherent consistent and ultimately more popular policy on Cuba than Bush wouldn't that be great if

[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:15.500]
If Kerry can offer a coherent consistent and ultimately more popular policy on anything then Bush like on Iraq like on Cuba

[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.420]
Like I just about anything besides health care

[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.320]
Wouldn't that be wonderful wouldn't that be a breath of fresh air that'd be something. Yeah, we're waiting

[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.340]
Man, man too much reading

[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:33.280]
How's that pull coming five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.760]
If you have tons of can't look at a pedal Brian again

[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.880]
He called it tough love for John Robin. Why why aren't people talking about pedal Brian?

[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.840]
This is this is another sports nerd guy

[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.960]
What did he used to be on Josh used to be unlike

[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:52.280]
ESPN or something right paddle Brian? Yeah, oh, it's before your time before you were born

[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.720]
He used to be a sports nerd on ESPN

[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.800]
Wasn't ESPN on that somewhere. I don't know and some maybe one of the networks football somebody will fix me

[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.960]
And yeah, you didn't know that did you and then all of a sudden when he got all washed up

[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.820]
They made him to the anchor of the stupid

[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.600]
Whatever these shows are you know, they know the celebrity shows

[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.400]
Entertainment tonight. Yeah, and now he's all over the place and I'm just talking about him every day

[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.240]
And he's looking for a new show nurse Cheney again with the F4 the F bomb drop another one Cheney drop another

[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.720]
They're not just dropping bombs on a rack to drop in bombs in a Senate. How do you like that?

[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:29.500]
In fact, when it Michael Moore movie finally hits the screens today at noon or there about they're gonna be dropping a lot of big bombs in a white house

[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:33.340]
Back in the day we could make some sound effects, so let's you know what we're talking about. We can't do that no more

[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:40.160]
Yeah, that kind of bomb right in the bowl sealed bomb in the boy you've heard of the boon in the box. It's the old bomb in the bowl

[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:42.800]
If you had tons of cash

[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:49.360]
Where in the world outside of Florida would you live talking about your home base your main spot your home address?

[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.760]
Hawaii is pulling away baby in a good choice 67

Bangkok's got one manate to walk Scott one and money Carlos got one out 226 vote

Maybe somebody win the lottery

[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:25.780]
Maybe I'll win a lot of this week. I think I'm just gonna go like we never used to say I'm just gonna go ahead and win that thing this week up here for about 10 million

[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:29.600]

And I was a great time to get out of that old sloppy jalapia

[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:49.300]

Where were you in 63?

[01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:27.170]
Did you kill John Kennedy?

[01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.090]
Where were they?

[01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.770]

[01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:31.750]
Where were they?

Are you into masturbation?

[01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:37.210]
See, there will live the embargo.

[01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:39.070]
Cuba will become another key logo.

[01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:41.890]
USA, USA.

[01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:46.170]
We're turning all the raps and moths away.

[01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:48.190]
Los it!

[01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:49.610]
Los it!

[01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:50.270]
USA!

[01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:56.190]
America, maybe had to dump that twice.

[01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:59.470]
Because he said the GD thing in there, twice.

[01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:01.590]
That is so pathetic, man.

[01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:03.290]
Of course, they show up with a bunch of nervous...

[01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:04.590]
Top had Janko, look what we got.

[01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:08.030]
We got the... what's your name again over there in Naples?

[01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:09.050]
Joyce.

[01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:10.830]
Joyce, we got Joyce over there.

[01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:12.870]
We know a radio of somebody stuck one up or as.

[01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.470]
And she's making decisions about what we can say and what we can't say.

[01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:19.770]
What a f***ing damn bunch of crap that is.

[01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:21.730]
Had to dump that twice.

[01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:23.010]
How do you like that?

[01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:25.770]
Did you?

[01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:26.730]
Yeah, we all did.

[01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:27.490]
We were all dumping all.

[01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:28.830]
Oh, we all had our finger on it.

[01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:30.130]
Yeah, we had our finger on it.

[01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:31.010]
Joyce, how do you like that?

[01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.670]
Can I say that?

[01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.990]
No.

[01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:34.390]
Here's the fact that it says,

[01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:36.770]
is it any wonder that movie co won't show Fahrenheit 9.

[01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:37.090]
Love it.

[01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:38.010]
Look at the wounds of the company.

[01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:39.010]
Just thought you might like...

[01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:40.650]
Like Moses, Duke and Fort Lauderdale.

[01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:42.690]
And I'm sure there's another page...

[01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:43.130]
Oh, here it is.

[01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:44.470]
Yeah, I don't...

[01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:46.130]
I think that's an Arabic-looking name, maybe.

[01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:47.370]
Is that what they're trying to say?

[01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:50.490]
Hamid Hashimi.

[01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:52.930]
Well, I don't understand why wouldn't they want us to say it?

[01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:54.230]
I think the facts are missing.

[01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:55.810]
Unless maybe it's some Saudis.

[01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:56.750]
Maybe they're Saudis.

[01:13:57.610 --> 01:13:57.630]
Huh?

[01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:58.050]
That could be.

[01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:02.490]
Maybe these Saudis are on the aborted directors of movie co-theaters.

[01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:03.950]
They'll certainly be interesting to find out.

[01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:05.290]
Yeah, let's take a pukin of that.

[01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:07.670]
And also a guy named Michael Melvin,

[01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:10.330]
which I never trust anybody with two first names like Ted David.

[01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:11.390]
Michael Melvin.

[01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:13.530]
Michael Medved.

[01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.930]
People like that.

[01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:16.770]
Well, thanks a lot, Duke.

[01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:18.510]
How do you like that, Abba?

[01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:19.830]
Yes, twice we had a dump that bit,

[01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:21.290]
which we've been playing for how many years now?

[01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:22.190]
About third, man.

[01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:24.870]
What a sad, sad, sad time in America.

[01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:26.790]
Very sad, very pathetic.

[01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:28.030]
Here's a good article, though,

[01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:29.710]
by William Rivers' pit, one of my favorites.

[01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:31.330]
In truth, out.

[01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:33.070]
He says, thank you, Michael Moore.

[01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:36.990]
It's pretty long, but I'm just a shy-read part of it.

[01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:37.950]
It's just too long.

[01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:41.170]
See, screens in Bartlett, Chattanooga.

[01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:43.650]
In fact, I hope that Miss Fudge is listening real close.

[01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:46.350]
Stick it right up to your ear, okay, in the radio, too, sweetheart.

[01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:50.490]
Screens in Bartlett, Chattanooga, Jackson, Knoxville, and Memphis, Tennessee,

[01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:51.290]
will be showing it.

[01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.830]
Screens in late, and then West Jordan, Utah, will be showing it.

[01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:57.030]
If you find yourself and leave with Miriam Shawnee or Richard O'Kanzas,

[01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.710]
you can see it.

[01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:00.630]
The same goes for Centerville, Fairfax, and Abington, Virginia.

[01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:04.170]
If you happen to be Akron and a Vexly Dubliner, Illyria O'Hyre,

[01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.750]
you're all set.

[01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:07.590]
Hoover, Montgomery, and Mobile, Alabama won't be left out.

[01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:08.550]
Laramie, Wyoming?

[01:15:08.890 --> 01:15:09.290]
It's there.

[01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:10.970]
Boseman Montana, indeed.

[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:14.570]
Should you call home Grand Island, Lincoln, or Omaha, Nebraska, you haven't been forgotten.

[01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:18.130]
The largest mall in the country, the Mall of America, and Bloomington, Minnesota,

[01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:19.410]
will have it in its theater.

[01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:22.670]
If you're a soldier at Camp Le Juner Ford Bragg, about to be shipped to Iraq,

[01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:24.870]
you can see it in your by-fade bill, North Carolina.

[01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:28.590]
These towns large and small, along with towns large and small,

[01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:31.070]
from sea to shining sea and straight through the American Heartland,

[01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:33.890]
will begin screening Michael Moore's documentary, Fair and High 9-11,

[01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:37.630]
beginning at 12-01 Friday morning, in other words, last night, the 25th of June.

[01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:41.230]
For the majority of people will see this movie in these towns large and small,

[01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:43.950]
the experience will be nothing short of a MIND bomb.

[01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:45.890]
Unabomba.

[01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:49.610]
The who wants to say about how the hypnotized never live,

[01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:52.810]
but as we've seen, people hypnotized by television and deliberately enforced fear,

[01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:55.250]
can never, can certainly support a war in a president,

[01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:57.830]
which are fundamentally the odds with basic American decency.

[01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:01.090]
In fact, people hypnotized by television and deliberately enforced fear

[01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:03.890]
will feed themselves into the meat grinder, with God Bless America on their lips.

[01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:07.990]
Michael Moore's film will snap that hypnosis, but good.

[01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:10.770]
Those Americans who believe what their president told them,

[01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:14.330]
because they saw it on the TV, will after less than two hours in their local theater,

[01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:17.070]
look at both their television and their president without unloading,

[01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:19.490]
when they walk from the darkness into the bright light of day.

[01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:22.710]
There are millions of Americans who believe what they were told about 9-11,

[01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:25.890]
about Iraq, about George W. Bush himself, who will come into that bright light

[01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:27.570]
with the realization that they've been lied to.

[01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:29.310]
They've been lied to.

[01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:30.350]
Oh, my God.

[01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:33.630]
Speaking personally, none of the data in the film surprised me,

[01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.910]
having spent every day of the last three years working to expose as many Americans

[01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:39.150]
as possible of the truth of the man they call president,

[01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:42.050]
Mr. Moore was unlikely to explode any shells across my bow.

[01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:46.070]
The connections between Boastas, Saudis, and Carlisle Group and the 9-11 attacks were there.

[01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.550]
The connections between Cheney and Haliburton were there.

[01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:51.590]
The connections between Enron, Unicael, natural gas pipelines,

[01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:54.850]
the war on Afghanistan, and little known country called Turkmenistan were there.

[01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:59.170]
I enjoyed the fact that Moore showed off unredacted copies of Bush's military service record,

[01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:02.430]
allowing us to see the parts of those documents which have been blacked out.

[01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:05.310]
I found no fact, no assertion in this film, the question or doubt.

[01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:09.170]
I've done my homework and was, was made painfully clear, Michael Moore did his too.

[01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.130]
Most Americans don't know about this stuff, and seeing it fully documented

[01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:17.310]
and meticulously researched on the big screen will be to say at the very least revelatory.

[01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:22.130]
Yes, Virginia, there are billions of dollars to be made off this war for Iraq war for Bush's friends.

[01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:24.250]
The second door on the left is the recruiting office.

[01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:27.290]
Sign on the line that is dotted, and be the first kid on your block

[01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:29.370]
to die for the benefit of Carlisle's stock options.

[01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:33.790]
Be sure to save your pennies beforehand, however, because the army will dock your pay for the days you're dead.

[01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.850]
It's policy you see.

[01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:39.650]
Mr. Moore put two daggers in him with this film, the first of which had to do with American soldiers.

[01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:42.710]
Trooper after trooper spoke frankly for Moore's camera,

[01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:45.390]
condemning both the war and the people who trust him into it.

[01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:49.910]
Several scenes graphically explained what happens to a soldier's body when it's caught in an explosion.

[01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:53.790]
The result is ruinous, and the cries of the wounded and the dying will ring in my ears forever.

[01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:55.970]
I'm going to read the entire article, Kevin, I'll do the break.

[01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:59.170]
Alright, it's just too good to like a Passover as they say.

[01:17:59.290 --> 01:18:05.390]
My, my, and Lord, this is 4256, the way can we have.

[01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:10.750]
Now this is an extreme makeover.

[01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:11.850]
He looks like carry gram.

[01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:13.390]
We're I, makesover.

[01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.350]
This is phenomenal.

[01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:15.590]
Steven Hawkins.

[01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:17.370]
Hello, I am Steven.

[01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.110]
It's queer I for the genius guy.

[01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:21.690]
This look is frightening.

[01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:23.030]
Help me look handsome.

[01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:25.110]
He is officially a nervous wreck.

[01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:27.770]
A lot of things are right and a lot of things are wrong.

[01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:29.770]
And all the wrong things block the right thing.

[01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:30.950]
Let's do it.

[01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:34.770]
Oh my God.

[01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:34.990]

[01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:36.630]
Can I have a more handsome you look already?

[01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:39.370]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:41.350]
Alright, let's have a little coming out, Porry.

[01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:42.590]
Come on out and show us what you got.

[01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:43.990]
A little thing for us, would you?

[01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.550]
Oh, look at you.

[01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:47.150]
Alright, fantastic.

[01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.730]
I feel stupid.

[01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:50.210]
He looks like a movie star.

[01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:52.250]
I don't like this pink dress.

[01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:54.510]
We're I for the genius guy.

[01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:55.410]
He looks amazing.

[01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:56.590]
Let's get high five.

[01:18:57.170 --> 01:18:58.890]
You broke my arm.

[01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:01.810]
You'll fold out my freaking tears.

[01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.210]
This is freaking out.

[01:19:03.730 --> 01:19:05.890]
I'm 45 at 560 WQM.

[01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.190]
Let's see.

[01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:08.930]
Somebody says if I had tons of loonies and tunis, I'd move to Vancouver.

[01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:09.410]
Ray.

[01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:09.830]
Okay.

[01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:10.950]
That's a good choice from what I hear.

[01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:12.530]
I've never been there, but it's beautiful.

[01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:13.590]
Here's nothing but good.

[01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:15.290]
Now this is as you're writing.

[01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:16.630]
So you must know something about this.

[01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:18.470]
Bad news for the audience out there.

[01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:19.530]
Got some very bad news.

[01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:20.410]
The Noon to two.

[01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:23.250]
Verizon appearance at the big with the big.

[01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:24.190]
Is canceled.

[01:19:24.370 --> 01:19:25.250]
Now is there any reason for that?

[01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:26.550]
Well, they found out who is going to be there.

[01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:28.270]
Oh, the big.

[01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.490]
Oh, maybe they heard me say how boring he was.

[01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:31.450]
That store is closed.

[01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:34.030]
I beg your pardon?

[01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.670]
The agency arranges these things.

[01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:37.810]
Don't you know when it's a big company like Verizon?

[01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:38.590]
Yeah.

[01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:42.170]
And that story is they scheduled an appearance at a store that doesn't exist anymore.

[01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:42.870]
Alright.

[01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:47.110]
Oh, this is shades of one IOD used this same Phil Hungary out and other people to the

[01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.130]
remember to the.

[01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:49.330]
Sure.

[01:19:50.010 --> 01:19:53.230]
Yeah, the convention center for some big convention and of course.

[01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:57.970]
It was there'd be like two hours before it was open and there was anybody there and they'd be sitting in a big empty building.

[01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:00.970]
Although the echo was always good though.

[01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:05.850]
Anyway, getting back to this article by William Williams.

[01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.290]
Okay.

[01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:12.490]
The most wrenching scenes in the film we're talking about Fahrenheit 9.11 by the way, which is in a theater fairly close by you today.

[01:20:12.610 --> 01:20:14.450]
And don't be belly aching because I ain't right next door.

[01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:23.210]
He says the most wrenching scenes in the film center around a woman named Lila who loves her country loves your flag and above all loves her children whom she actively persuaded to do.

[01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:24.070]
And the armed services.

[01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:30.190]
We learned that Lila has a son in Iraq and because of that she despises those protesting the invasion.

[01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:35.690]
We find out later that her son was killed in Carbillon April 2 when his black hawk helicopter was shot down.

[01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:40.370]
We watch her read her son's last letter home in which he rages against Bush in the war.

[01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:48.150]
We last see Lila standing at the gates of the White House tears boiling from her eyes as she discovers her true enemy the one who took her baby from her.

[01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:52.930]
The other dagger more put into me came during his montage of the media coverage of the war.

[01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:57.310]
Journalist after journalists has shown rapsodizing Bush is administration in the war.

[01:20:57.730 --> 01:21:06.450]
Each and every one of them carried forth that which we now know to be bald faced lies that Iraq had WMDs that Iraq was a threat that we had to go that everything is fine.

[01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:08.150]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:12.270]
It was a slideshow of the nonsense Americans have been spoon fed for far too long.

[01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:21.730]
If you doubt this, Sydney Blumenthal's aggressive and effectual actual journalism has found in most recent reports that reality is unraveling for Bush should help you along.

[01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:25.030]
Most of the media was on the bandwagon reintimidated by its Blumenthal.

[01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:36.890]
Cheney himself called the president of the corporation that owned one of the networks to complain about an errant commentator, political aides directed by Carl Rove, ceaselessly called editors and producers with veiled threats about access that was not granted in any case.

[01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:39.170]
The press wouldn't bite the hand that wouldn't feed it.

[01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:46.590]
With a single stroke, Michael Morris undone three years of porcelain advised factually bereft compromised television journalism.

[01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:49.630]
This in the end is the final greatness of Fahrenheit 9-11.

[01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:58.550]
Not only will Americans get a sense of the depth of the section they've endured, but journalists and that's in quotes all across the country will be forced to endure the humiliation they so which they deserve.

[01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:10.170]
I was privileged to see this film in the company of three groups, military family speak out, September 11 families for peaceful tomorrow's and veterans for peace, which have stood against this disaster for war from day one.

[01:22:10.730 --> 01:22:19.810]
Many in the theater had family in Iraq or had lost family in Iraq or had lost family on 9-11 and seen their beloved dead used as an excuse for an unwarranted war and there wasn't a dry eye in the house.

[01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:28.450]
Fahrenheit 9-11 is not a victory for anyone. We the people should have known better. We the people should have been given the facts before sending 851 of our children to die.

[01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:34.170]
We the people have been betrayed by our leaders and by a media that profit and profits still from the daily sale of lies.

[01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:37.270]
This film drove that horde-fact home with a mallet and it hurt.

[01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:43.830]
I was reminded as I filed out with this company of heroes of a portion of Shakespeare's rendition of Henry speech before Agoncourt.

[01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:49.930]
He that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand a tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of Crispian.

[01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:55.770]
He that shall live this day and see old age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say tomorrow is saying Crispian.

[01:22:56.350 --> 01:23:01.310]
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say these wounds I had on Crispens Day.

[01:23:01.930 --> 01:23:02.830]
Many of us were not hypnotized.

[01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:08.070]
Many of us took to the streets in this country and around the world to try and stop this madness before it was unleashed.

[01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:13.450]
The people in that theater with me had done this. They had never stopped doing this though their president and their media named them traitor.

[01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:20.370]
They were right. They were right. They were right. Michael Moore is unleashed a wolf within Mr. Bush's fences. There was no getting around it.

[01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:30.790]
Perhaps now that it's far too late we as a nation will wake up. On the day of that awakening those of us who never stopped standing, never stopped marching, learn to live without sleep, learn to live in a nation that's scorned truth for televised fantasy.

[01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:38.130]
Those patriots I was with tonight in that theater can pause for breath. We can sit upon the grass on a bright day strip our sleeves and show our scars.

[01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:43.310]
White sweaty mervers pit. So I think it might be worth going to see. You think?

[01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:55.030]
And the thing about the media man that that's so getting at least attention, but he's got a summary on it because none of this could have ever happened without the willing and enthusiastic cooperation of the media of the grave robbers.

[01:23:55.710 --> 01:24:00.350]
And of course a little intimidation along the way doesn't you know doesn't hurt in helping to ensure that cooperation.

[01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:06.910]
If you had tons of cash, where in the world except Florida would you live? That's our pull question today. What would be your home base?

[01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:15.230]
Hawaii man. It's not quite enough. They're already 85 say Hawaii overwhelming out of the first 191 votes. Pretty weak kind of votes, but they don't like this poll too bad.

[01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:19.830]
Late Tahoe 37 Vegas 34. I'm stood. I'm as God.

[01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:27.750]
Third man San Francisco 24. Roll my 18 mountains in North Carolina 17 money. Carlo 12.

[01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:34.370]
Bahamas of God nine and I can't forget that one out. Selberkin and kid. Oh look at that. There's our crank photo the day nine.

[01:24:36.450 --> 01:24:43.290]
And Dora eight stuck on the Sweden for Bangkok one man at the walk one Prague is got one and Vancouver's got one eight.

[01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:51.230]
If you got one five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line WQA and hello.

[01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:57.090]
But man, good meal speaking. Hey, how you doing great? Hey listen.

[01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:10.150]
Those two guys from Mubico I found them online. You know, you can check the contributors to the campaign right now going through that yesterday.

[01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:20.310]
And those two Iranians came up. They're big bush supporters. Uh huh. So that may explain. So in other words, it's just a coincidence that movie coven up.

[01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:28.490]
You're showing for a night and 11. Not not really right. Okay, so we'll go somewhere else. Exactly. And we won't be going back there anytime soon.

[01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:36.290]
Not me. Thanks for the good news. Okay, Neil. Figure. So just say goodbye to movie co theaters. Okay, they give you know that the thing I read yesterday.

[01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:47.170]
Right, right, right. So them say no to movie cove. Yeah, just say no to movie cove. Very good. I like that. Got a beat to it. You can dance to it. I give it four stars. Right.

[01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:53.930]
Oh, don't let me forget to get to cheese. Yeah, it's almost noon. I'll read it. I'm not getting any of my good stuff from the inquiry. Dang it.

[01:25:54.410 --> 01:26:09.030]
I better do this one right now. Well, let me take another call or two and then we'll get to it. WQA. Hello. Hi Neil. Hey, how you doing? Pretty good. I saw the movie last night. Is anybody called in yet? I just got in my office last night. Yeah, that's the at the advanced screening. Okay. And in

[01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:19.030]
the future, the last half was better than the first half because the first half was a rehash, but it's extremely, you know, very funny moments. The last

[01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:27.750]
emphasis with that lady Lila is just it's just too tragic. I mean, anybody who would I mean, I when they first went in for the war, I thought it was a good

[01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:37.130]
idea. Not because I was full, but we had a show something after 9, 11 that we won't sit down. Yeah, we had to go beat somebody upright. Right, but the planning of the second

[01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:46.410]
half is ridiculous. They haven't planned the war real well. And I think anybody who supports us is still to understand what you're saying. We had a, I mean, you can't be serious when you say that. We had to do

[01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:52.290]
something against people that had nothing to do with it. Yeah, but if we got right out right away and let them try and govern

[01:26:52.290 --> 01:27:00.990]
themselves, I mean, we've screwed it up by not the. Well, what does that have to do with 9, 11 whether they govern themselves or not? What does that have to do with it? Well, you're right. There is no

[01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:14.710]
link there. Okay. Thank you. That's sad. That's just pathetic. You went and saw the movie and he's still spouting in entities. That makes me want to cry. I'll get to tell. No, seriously, we had to do something. I thought what we

[01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:18.990]
did in that kind of stand with the Taliban. I thought that's what we were supposed to be doing is spreading the real terrorists and the people who

[01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:25.810]
like prop the bossama and given aid and comfort, etc. and so on. Nice follow through with that, too. By the way, what do you mean with that kind of

[01:27:25.810 --> 01:27:30.990]
stand? Oh, yeah, we're really doing a hell of a job there. Oh, we're fine. Well, we got that guy from Chevron and they run in the

[01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:36.250]
joints. So he ought to be okay. Just like this guy, we got the temporary guy in Iraq who come to find out is just another

[01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:45.170]
pim from CIA buddy. Wow, it's just that I just there just is not any hope. Again, this guy is just rationalizing his own

[01:27:45.170 --> 01:27:51.010]
ignorance and his own weakness in the beginning because he just got sucked in just like most everybody else, just like

[01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:58.030]
most of the ignoramuses out there. Oh, we got to go get some and as far as this business about creating democracy since since one was

[01:27:58.030 --> 01:28:03.910]
that our role or any other countries role to be running around the world, inventing new governments form nation building, which of course is what

[01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:12.890]
this president promised us he was never going to do. See, when it didn't work the first time with the WMDs, that turned out to be bogus. Then it didn't turn out to be true with the

[01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:18.130]
relationship between Al-Qaeda and Sodom, although they keep trying to bring that one back and it keeps falling on its

[01:28:18.130 --> 01:28:25.030]
hands. So we had to come up with something. So now it's Operation Iraqi Freedom and dutifully there was CNN with a big banner on the screen.

[01:28:25.290 --> 01:28:32.870]
There was MSNBC and of course Fox with a big banner on the screen Operation Iraqi Freedom. Both this be great. We're democratizing the Middle East even if they don't want to be.

[01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:41.910]
We're sending democracy there. Right. What do we know about it? Holy crap. While we're taking away your ability to hear what you want to hear and see what you want to see.

[01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:51.770]
I'm surprised they haven't banned this movie. I guarantee if they tried. Wouldn't that one of the story? And I guarantee if they could have found some way to do it, they would have done it equal time.

[01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:58.550]
It's a political message they wanted equal time. No, that thing by the way, the FEC wouldn't hear that yesterday. That's the good news. I almost forgot about that.

[01:28:59.130 --> 01:29:03.950]
The Federal Elections Commission said now we're not going to get involved with that. So they can advertise it as long as they want.

[01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:15.770]
But it just leaves you weak. I mean, how is it possible to be well, you know, something what am I talking about? Look at the religious thing. Look at religion. Talk about weak.

[01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:30.650]
Sure. They brainwash you with a bunch of patty of phony man-made crap. Right. And they overwhelmed me and then all of the stuff with a child abuse, the pedophile preaching everything. And it just rubs off their back like a duck's back. It's just amazing to me.

[01:29:30.650 --> 01:29:36.390]
Oh, that was just a nothing. Let me just say this to you. Okay, very little can penetrate a brainwash skull.

[01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:40.450]
I don't know. Or an empty skull. If you don't believe me, just look at Greg Reed.

[01:29:40.670 --> 01:29:44.750]
My and local. This is 420560.

[01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:46.410]
Way to go.

[01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:54.290]
Mr. King, I'd like to relax by having Mary Magdalen beside my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers 12th of 1 hour.

[01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:55.310]
Hey.

[01:29:59.030 --> 01:30:07.930]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to the people killed with the gas that we sold him.

[01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:16.190]
First time a dresser nation and the only one that's going now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:27.630]
Forget about Korea. The notes they're talking about the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our head.

[01:30:28.130 --> 01:30:34.090]
That Iraq has some methods of master's instruction.

[01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:50.850]
3,000 people killed are now forgotten. Let's exploit them instead.

[01:30:51.190 --> 01:31:01.390]
Hey, there's oil to be gotten going after sedum too. Plankato, Sama. There's no longer mention of the name in Latin.

[01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:21.150]
But no one seems concerned all comfy and complacent believe in every word of this cartel administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our heads.

[01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:27.370]
That Iraq has some weapons of master's instruction.

[01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:32.250]
That one didn't work too well. Let's make up some other crap.

[01:32:33.450 --> 01:32:39.630]
Simon Jim and Key Largo didn't understand our poll question today and that's why we don't have as many votes because I'm sure we'd have a couple maybe 300 more votes.

[01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:46.090]
Maybe 400 for people who say if I had all the money in the world I'd still be here in Florida. That's what he says. He'd live right where he said a key largo.

[01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:50.890]
Well, guess what? Good luck to you, Simon Jim. I'm happy to hear you're happy but that don't count. That's not the poll question, right?

[01:32:51.230 --> 01:32:52.370]
Doesn't it say outside of Florida?

[01:32:53.370 --> 01:32:54.330]
Yeah, you're not picking.

[01:32:56.070 --> 01:33:01.770]
Maybe some of these people have never been outside of Florida. But anyway, here's some sick news for you.

[01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:08.890]
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger wants to repeal a state law in California that requires animal shelters to hold stray dogs and cats for up to six days before killing them.

[01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:10.930]
He wants to terminate them.

[01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:21.410]
Instead, there would be a three day requirement for strays, other animals, including birds, hamsters, pot-boiled pigs, rabbits, snakes, turtles, maybe even gerbos, could be killed immediately.

[01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:22.970]
May I see you, Anne Edo.

[01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:29.230]
Schwarzenegger is told the state legislature that the changes could save local governments that operate shelters up to $14 million.

[01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:36.910]
An estimated $600,000 in cats are put to death each year in California, including 34,000 L.A. alone.

[01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:45.610]
Because of space limitations, the shelters are being forced to euthanize animals who are otherwise highly adoptable immediately after the holding time, they said.

[01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:49.730]
Despite Schwarzenegger's huge popularity, some political observers think that proposal meets stiff resistance.

[01:33:50.030 --> 01:34:01.150]
There is no organized constituency of cats and dogs, but certainly the pet owners of America will find this reprehensible said Barbara O'Connor, director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at the California State University Sacramento.

[01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:05.650]
Cats and dogs are like mom and apple pies. She said, don't mess with pets.

[01:34:05.850 --> 01:34:09.810]
Most people prefer them to other people. And she is absolutely correct.

[01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:10.570]
Man, damn.

[01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:15.770]
I say I want to think dogs don't start any wars.

[01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:16.490]
Nope.

[01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:22.590]
Dogs outro the environment, maybe a little mess in your carpet or in the backyard, but they'll be hogs of war that I compared about.

[01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:25.230]
Clinton caught cheating again. How do you like that?

[01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.690]
Oh my God.

[01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:30.650]
Secret trips to lovers hide away to bring more heartbreak for Hillary says the National Enquirer this week's issue.

[01:34:32.150 --> 01:34:32.770]
What's the date?

[01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.890]
Where's the date, guys?

[01:34:35.210 --> 01:34:39.250]
Maybe they just quit putting out July 5th. My mother's birthday. Well, how do you like that? Aren't you impressed?

[01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:40.350]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:42.390]
Don't let me forget to send my mother a birthday card.

[01:34:44.630 --> 01:34:46.330]
Better remind me today because, huh?

[01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:47.070]
Hey, don't forget.

[01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:47.790]
Okay.

[01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:53.550]
The Enquirer's uncovered a shocking secret about Bill Clinton that you will not read in that new autobiography.

[01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:57.410]
The ex-president is currently cheating on Hillary with a super rich divorcee.

[01:34:57.490 --> 01:34:58.410]
Oh my God.

[01:34:58.710 --> 01:34:59.150]
Say it again.

[01:34:59.190 --> 01:35:00.130]
Oh my God.

[01:35:00.610 --> 01:35:05.470]
Clinton has fallen hard for his secret lover and sources say that if he were ever to leave Hillary, it would be to marry his new love.

[01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:06.570]
You go, boy.

[01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:12.610]
The Enquirer is investigatedly behind the scenes scandal for more than a year, but is not naming the woman in order to protect her privacy.

[01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:15.610]
But we can reveal that she's...

[01:35:15.610 --> 01:35:18.190]
Well, that's interesting because they're naming him, but they're not naming the woman.

[01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:24.530]
We can reveal that she's in her early 40s and the daughter of a wealthy businessman and Clinton supporter.

[01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:29.110]
She's a beautiful blonde with several young children, new pocketed millions when she and her husband divorced years ago.

[01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:33.350]
And she lives in a private highway in West Asia County, New York, and her address is, I'm sorry.

[01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:36.790]
I mean, did they give us enough clues there?

[01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:38.550]
Yeah, I could find it.

[01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.310]
Okay.

[01:35:39.690 --> 01:35:45.510]
Bill Clinton has been sneaking off to the home of this woman for late night trists after her kids have gone to bed and started to hold the Enquirer.

[01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:51.310]
The affair began more than a year ago after Hillary became a senator and began spending her weeks sleeping in Washington.

[01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.990]
He was lonely.

[01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:55.770]
Then this woman came into the picture, bill had known her family for many years.

[01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:58.110]
She lived with the kids in a mansion in the same county as Clinton.

[01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:01.810]
One thing led to another, Bill began going over to her mansion.

[01:36:01.810 --> 01:36:05.070]
Their friendship turned to more and Bill really fell for this woman.

[01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:10.030]
What do you want? The guy's married to a ice princess bold like he's got to get it from somebody, right?

[01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:11.130]
Right.

[01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:14.310]
Now they bully it can about what do you eat for lunch now free Tony?

[01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.930]
Thank you, Brad.

[01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:18.030]
Thanks, Brad and Tony's your divest 202, whatever it is.

[01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:18.830]
What is it?

[01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:20.450]
190 third and got 441.

[01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:22.950]
Like I said, not too far from us from you.

[01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:27.690]
A neighbor in Westchester told the Enquirer that two are inseparable when the opportunity arises.

[01:36:27.730 --> 01:36:29.650]
Kind of like Julian and Eve on passions.

[01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:35.730]
Sneaking into each other's homes late at night when Hillary is in Washington and her children are left attended by an all pair.

[01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:41.130]
He's probably checking her pair while she's squeezing his pair.

[01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:49.090]
Anyway, sources claim Clinton is so serious about the relationship that unlike his previous things, this is the only woman who considered dumping Hillary to be with full time.

[01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:51.150]
A real woman.

[01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:56.870]
But when word of the affair got back to the woman's family, there were furious protests inside source disclosed.

[01:36:57.150 --> 01:36:59.070]
They didn't want her disgraced like Monica Lewinsky.

[01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:02.650]
She was warned that any relationship with Clinton had the potential to be poison.

[01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:08.730]
But Bill's time together with the woman who became seriously began talking in terms of turning the affair into something more permanent.

[01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:15.910]
Said another source, those closest to Bill think he's lost his mind, but he says he's met a woman who makes him fear the young and alive again.

[01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:22.310]
And if you saw the picture of Hillary on here and oh man, she looks like my thos lotta bad day.

[01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:25.730]
She got more wrinkles than fat boys ass.

[01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:29.710]
Hillary is once again victimized by Bill's infidelity.

[01:37:30.150 --> 01:37:32.350]
Hillary was utterly disgusted by Lewinsky's scandal.

[01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:35.590]
Many people first heard how she's put up with Bill's chronic flandering all these years.

[01:37:35.890 --> 01:37:43.350]
He's thrown books and ash trays at him and furious fights with Bill over his relationships with Jennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willie, Paula Jones and host of others.

[01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:48.430]
He's had lovers all over the world in Europe and South America now right on Hillary's own doorstep in New York.

[01:37:48.450 --> 01:37:50.490]
Oh, right. You go, Bill. We're all for you.

[01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:54.230]
You make show me your guy that's getting someone else. I'll show you a happy camper.

[01:37:56.710 --> 01:37:57.030]
Right?

[01:37:57.490 --> 01:37:59.010]
Oh, I'm asking the wrong guy.

[01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:05.450]
Limbaugh divorce. I don't wanna let go through all of these things, but if I forget, plus there's no calls in there anyway right now.

[01:38:05.530 --> 01:38:08.590]
They hate that poll today and it's because they're all happy right where they are. Well, that's fine.

[01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:10.130]
You know, they're all we're fine.

[01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:13.810]
I'm happy for you. Why would you want to go anyplace else? You might actually learn something.

[01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:16.570]
You might discover that there's some really great places in the world, but that's okay.

[01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:19.790]
Limbaugh divorce could signal fall of his empire.

[01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:21.390]
Top a couple of more, Rush.

[01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:22.110]
Now, boy.

[01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:27.850]
Toxia, host fears the feds are leaning on his wife in order to do to him what they did to Martha Stewart.

[01:38:28.330 --> 01:38:29.330]
Wouldn't that be sweet?

[01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:30.370]
Sweet.

[01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:37.030]
Rush Limbaugh fears the breakup of his marriage is likely to break up his Toxia empire and may even put him behind bars.

[01:38:37.670 --> 01:38:41.270]
Oh, man. Wouldn't we kiss the ground on that day, huh?

[01:38:41.770 --> 01:38:42.490]
I'd have a party.

[01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:46.370]
Pilled pop and phony hypocritical love. How many divorces is it now?

[01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:47.570]
About 30, man.

[01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:48.010]
Man.

[01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:55.150]
That's the shocking disclosure of an investigator close to the probe of the conservative commentators drug problems.

[01:38:55.730 --> 01:39:03.550]
The inquirers learned from a Justice Department source that Limbaugh's estranged wife, Martha, has been talking to members of the multi-agency task force probing allegations

[01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:08.470]
that the radio talk show host duked doctors into giving him overlapping prescriptions of addictive painkillers.

[01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:14.550]
The task force includes investigators from the IRS and the FBI, as well as state and local police agencies in Florida.

[01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:21.610]
Rush fears the feds are leaning on his wife in order to do to him what they did to Martha Stewart set a source familiar with the radio host.

[01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:24.610]
Martha has lost millions of dollars in many of the outlets to her fans.

[01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:28.970]
Rushes worried the same thing's going to happen to him. That's why he's fighting this case every step of the way.

[01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:42.830]
The inquirer reported in the world exclusive story last October that Limbaugh 53 had been secretly banning an addiction in narcotics and his former housekeeper had illegally supplied him with thousands of painkillers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars over a period of more than four years.

[01:39:43.170 --> 01:39:51.890]
What's more, a heavily addicted Limbaugh had to be detoxified twice once coming perilously close to death according to his drug dealer Wilma Klein. Good old Wilma.

[01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:57.550]
He's not been charged with any crime and his attorneys are arguing that prosecutors illegally seized his medical records.

[01:39:57.970 --> 01:40:04.330]
Now his future and the future of a 600 plus radio outlets and 20 million listeners rides on his ability to keep those medical records out of court.

[01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:11.230]
While in the thrills of addiction Limbaugh desperately tried to hide his habit from his wife Martha, the two way to 1994 was the third marriage for both.

[01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:18.730]
Last month Martha asked her husband for a divorce just two weeks after their wedding anniversary and several months after Limbaugh completed the state and drugway episodic went to a family friend.

[01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:26.470]
Martha just couldn't take the lies. Rush deceived her so much said the friend. Limbaugh made this surprise announcement of the split on his radio show June 11th.

[01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:42.690]
He claimed the decision was mutual and the split would be amicable. His spokesman Tony Knight said the couple is separated. However, the family friend claims neither Rush nor Martha has moved out of this sprawling 24 million dollar ocean front mansion in Palm Beach of which there's a picture here at a bottom left hand corner of this article and you would just wet your pants. You would be salivated.

[01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:54.470]
Oh man, up to make you sick. Limbaugh has repeatedly battled back against the negative publicity. The case is generated with long tedious explanations of his behavior on his radio show must have been that bad back.

[01:40:54.610 --> 01:41:01.710]
Up couple more. Let's put all the other drug peddlers and dealers and doers in jail, but you're okay, Rush because you sing the right tune.

[01:41:03.170 --> 01:41:17.250]
He's also forked out big bucks for full page newspaper ads attacking prosecutors and reporters for engaging what he calls a politically motivated investigation. Limbaugh told his listeners that he developed his edition five years ago after doctors prescribed paint, painkillers after a spinal surgery.

[01:41:18.110 --> 01:41:24.570]
Unfortunately, the surgery was unsuccessful. I continued to have severe pain in my lower back and also my neck due to her need this said, limbaugh, I'm still experiencing that pain.

[01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:30.850]
And speaking of pain, this story here just makes me want to gag off a lot of gagging to do. It's a little time. You know what?

[01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:38.570]
You know, I don't invoke a gag rule on a show when it out gag it out Hollywood. Madam has the hot for limbaugh.

[01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:48.770]
Former Hollywood. Madam Heidi flies as a crush on rush. Heidi 38 told the inquiry and an exclusive interview. Of course that rush limbaugh is the perfect man for her.

[01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:53.730]
And she's hoping to give her a chance now that he's getting divorced. He's perfect. Oh my God. She said, oh my God.

[01:41:54.070 --> 01:42:03.130]
I've wondered that man for so long. Explained and excited. Heidi rushes my dream man for many reasons. But first of all, I've always been a chubby chaser because chubby men try harder to please a woman.

[01:42:05.790 --> 01:42:15.790]
Yeah. Rush is also very powerful. A self-made man. And of course, I admire that about him too since I'm the same way. I usually am fighting a bunch of perverts who are nothing about a woman.

[01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:22.690]
But a man like Rush who views me as the antichrist would make the perfect partner for me. And I wouldn't be the only one happy. Rush would be an extremely happy man too.

[01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:33.970]
I'd please rush more than he'd ever been pleased before she says. Not rush more. Maybe or maybe she just found him. If Rush and I were together, he'd never need pills again said Heidi referring to the radio giants recent rehab.

[01:42:34.630 --> 01:42:41.310]
Heidi also volunteered to sign a prenup to become the new Mrs. limbaugh. I'd change my evil ways and sign any agreements. See it can't think of to protect himself.

[01:42:41.310 --> 01:42:48.770]
I don't want to need Rush's money because I have my own. What a deal, huh? I think Rush is fabulous because he's hard working goes home and minds his own business.

[01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:57.170]
I'm exactly the same way. Heidi says the only problem I see about politics, but we can put that aside when we both get home. Kind of like what's his name? James Carval and that obnoxious Mary Mad Omega.

[01:42:57.570 --> 01:43:00.430]
I don't get that. I don't either. And he probably ain't getting it either.

[01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:05.270]
I'm finding a local. This is my city. The radio's all yours.

[01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:07.570]
You in.

[01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:18.550]
Hey there and say it took me a little while. I'm a little slow learner, but Neil, I apologize. Absolutely. It's radio. You are the truth.

[01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:26.830]
Thank you all for coming. I have a brief statement and then I will take some questions.

[01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:36.230]
This past weekend, when 50 million Americans lost power, it makes one thing perfectly clear.

[01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:45.390]
This one more American must lose power. And that is great, Davis. Now.

[01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:54.510]
Are there any questions? Yes. You would have asked. What does great Davis have to do with a northeast blackout?

[01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:59.150]
That's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it. Next question.

[01:44:01.130 --> 01:44:08.570]
I had it appear to be avoiding answering any questions. That is a statement. Not a question. Next question.

[01:44:09.730 --> 01:44:18.390]
You're criticizing great Davis on this issue. How would you solve America's power problem? No problem. All right. One more question.

[01:44:19.150 --> 01:44:27.050]
You want to be governor of California? Desire. You still have an elephant. I am a political machine.

[01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:35.170]
Thank you very much. I will be right back.

[01:44:35.170 --> 01:44:37.730]
Now that we're finished with the press conference, let's go kill some puppies.

[01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:44.250]
From 1965 to 60 WQAM. I wish one of these. I should probably take some calls.

[01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:48.090]
Once I get them because there's so many important stories that I know you're dying to hear.

[01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:52.270]
Right. You want to know what's going to be your favorite? What about Walmart?

[01:44:53.130 --> 01:44:59.130]
Kristen Slater blows 10 grand at strip club. I'm talking about the inquirer for cheating puppies night out.

[01:45:00.490 --> 01:45:09.070]
And there's his wife Ryan with a sly look on her post. 5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T line WQAM. Hello.

[01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:13.550]
Not there. Like I said, maybe I'll take a call WQAM. Hello.

[01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:21.050]
Neil. Yes, sir. You're absolutely right. In the alien part three, the alien comes out of the gourney weaver.

[01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:31.010]
Thank you. See what I tell you in excess is part five Richard Burton's head keeps spinning around and around and around.

[01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:39.810]
You'll see 5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and by the way, it's a boil.

[01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:46.930]
Why not? WQAM. Hello. Hey, no. Yes, sir. George Bush and George. Okay.

[01:45:47.410 --> 01:45:52.890]
Guys doing jokes WQAM. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing today? Great.

[01:45:53.650 --> 01:45:59.290]
I got one for you. The whole little wild go to the person who used to like an outie. I'll tell you a teleripper.

[01:45:59.830 --> 01:46:05.250]
I hate that that you are. You doing a pull from days ago. Is that what you're doing now?

[01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:10.190]
I just couldn't get in before I ask you this. How about this paper or plastic? What's the answer to that?

[01:46:12.250 --> 01:46:18.570]
I'm still wiping with paper myself. Let's see. Key Largo is outside of the US. The keys to Fairock get out of here.

[01:46:18.670 --> 01:46:27.270]
Damn. Jim. Get a lot of good life and put down a bottle of gas. That whole thing about the keys and key west and all that my drunk stoner.

[01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:32.330]
I just don't understand. And would you be buffet that whole deal? Can you explain it to me?

[01:46:33.010 --> 01:46:38.330]
No, I can't. I mean, I can explain drinking and debauchery. Oh, here's the schedule for next week.

[01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:43.330]
I was going to read that silly one at somebody facts him trying to be cute. It's cute.

[01:46:44.210 --> 01:46:49.390]
Let's see. Bill and for Lauderdale. Bill and for Lauderdale says if a stupid actor can be a governor, then don't you think that an intelligent director?

[01:46:49.730 --> 01:46:54.790]
Michael Moore from President. Well, that's what I've been saying all along Bill. So thanks for being like an echo chamber. Okay. Thank you so much.

[01:46:56.470 --> 01:47:00.410]
These people are so original. Here we got next week's real schedule, but I like the other one.

[01:47:00.710 --> 01:47:10.550]
This is a fake memo from Greg and Gareed, all QM personnel. Subject WQM lineup effective Monday, June 28th, 6 to 8 a.m. Howard and Goldie.

[01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:38.390]
That's great. All Jellie radio all day. It was going to be something to do. There could be no hockey season.

[01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:46.030]
We got to find something. I told him I said, don't get your wife praying at Noko by the house. What do you do? He went and bought a house and knocked his wife up not once but twice.

[01:47:46.030 --> 01:47:53.030]
And intentionally I'm sure I'm like some people. Let's see. Let me take a look what we got. We got Mo and Goldie.

[01:47:54.830 --> 01:48:02.790]
According to this here, Howard David Goldie updates Joe Rose and the beast. Oh, the beast returns. Has he been gone? Where's he been?

[01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:10.270]
I know he was in Omaha, but that didn't last too long. Has he better vacation? Maybe I see. They got me and then of course you're off next week.

[01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:19.950]
So we had Zach and Josh next week. Make sure we had a lot of food for his. Matt dog the Humper looks almost like a real schedule except for the fact that George is on vacation next week.

[01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:31.710]
It looks almost for real. In fact, what what is that all about? What is that? Tuesday, June 29. I mean, I realized that this guy's got a better scam. I taught him too well.

[01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:44.470]
He's got a better scam than I got going. The Humper. 4 to 5 30 on Tuesday. Hank Goldberg 5 30 to 7 Warren, Chromarty and in the Marlon pregame show. What the hell is that all about?

[01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:51.130]
Hank must have a hot day to the massage partner or something on Tuesday because look at that. He's got an hour and a half show.

[01:48:52.450 --> 01:48:59.530]
And then Thursday, we got Eddie can here. So he must be a screw off. No, no, no, Hank on Friday. He's just a screw off. Nice going, Humper. Good work.

[01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:16.990]
I taught my disciples well, make no mistake about it. Let's say to a Neil and Arnold from Cindy. The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated. That's what Gandhi said, the Gandhi mind. That's what he said.

[01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:29.390]
WQA him. Hello. Hey Neil, hi sir. Hey, where are you working to get a piece of food? You just like a roll mom. Where can you get one around here? Where are they make real Italian pizza down here?

[01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:46.830]
They don't. They don't know where I've been. Pizza for. Yeah, the pizza. Well, what's on it is not what makes it a real pizza. It's the hot thing it is and cooked in the open. I can't get it there. It's almost a monster. But it's not monster. Right. Can't get it there. Man, I'll see you roll. I'll see you at the pizza. Devona. Piazza. Devona. Sorry.

[01:49:48.470 --> 01:50:16.150]
This guy is dreaming and don't tell me that place in Hollywood, but that place really, really. Maybe I just was had a bad day that day. What's that place called? It's on 441 rose. I don't know what else called. But it was awful. It was like burnt burnt to a crisp. Maybe they're trying to give me a message or something. You know, like Luca Brasi or Joe Isaza awful stuff and people are calling with that place all the time. And I guess if you never it's like anything else.

[01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:46.450]
If you only had like a fray, if you only had Chef Boyardy spaghetti out of a box in a can, you say, hey, that's really the best spaghetti in the world. If that's all you ever had, right? If you only had Chef Boyardy rig a tony out of a can, you say, wow, that's the best I ever had. Well, if it's all you ever had, right? Go down. See what I'm saying. Sorry, I was choking on a piece of pizza. It's like saying, if you only had sex with screw in and said, man, that's the best sex I ever had. You didn't know. Then it's time. It's a long dirt nap, I think is what it's time. It might be a wall cat, you know.

[01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:58.310]
26 past noon at 560 WQ must take a look at that pole. See how it's coming. They don't like this pole too bad. If you had tons of cash, we're in a world outside Florida where you live. Where would you be your headquarters?

[01:50:59.670 --> 01:51:11.530]
Hawaii 103 Lake Tahoe 43. Now that was Josh's choice. I'm shocked and dismay that I took that wrong turn. Now, are they maybe they're talking about up there on the lake? Is that what they're talking about? What are you talking about, Josh?

[01:51:12.450 --> 01:51:22.190]
No, I went on vacation out there in the winter, skeed. Yeah. Well, that's what I'm saying on the lake. Yeah. Looks like there were a lot of people having a hell of a time. Of course, I didn't get too close to the edge of the cliff.

[01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:30.170]
And there are no barriers. That's the thing that really frosted my ass. I'm part of that mountain road there. There's like no barriers anywhere. If you go to a real mountain.

[01:51:30.170 --> 01:51:56.010]
I can be a take a little bit of a. Sorry. That's right. I've been nice knowing. I called up my driveway Tahoe 43 Vegas 41. Amstivams got 41. Money Carlos got 40. That moved up fast. San Francisco's got 31 mountains and 31 straight people. Mountains in

[01:51:56.010 --> 01:52:01.450]
doors got 11 Vancouver H stuck on Sweden 5 Bangkok to Manitawak 1 and Prague has got a lonely.

[01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:13.870]
How the Clinton spent their first night in Chappacol.

[01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:17.270]
I'm getting honey.

[01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:29.570]
I'll get it. Don't worry about it. Just back. I'm coming. I'm coming. How there? Well, hello, Mr. President. I'm Sarah Rubin. Yes, you are.

[01:52:29.570 --> 01:52:43.470]
Yes, my family lives in the Victorian house across this tree. It's a very nice house and you have very nice legs. Well, thank you, sir. And welcome to our little town of Chappacol. I hope your family will enjoy living here. I think I will.

[01:52:44.150 --> 01:52:55.090]
My daughter, a man and I have been to this little welcome to the neighborhood. It's our family recipe for praying apple upside down cake. I like it. Take your pine apples anyway. Upside down sideways.

[01:52:58.110 --> 01:53:00.510]
Thank you, Mr. President. Well, bye, bye, then.

[01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:05.870]
No, it was just a lady from next door. That's all.

[01:53:07.770 --> 01:53:19.550]
I said I'll get it. Just sit down and shut up. What do you want? Hey, there are boxes. I can't believe it. Well, hello. Hello, Mr. Clinton. I'm Elaine Crippkins.

[01:53:19.810 --> 01:53:22.390]
Keep your voice down. Are you the escort? I know, sir.

[01:53:24.670 --> 01:53:34.450]
I'm sorry, Mr. Crippkins. I just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood. Well, the escort is not here yet. If you want to jump on a little charlie.

[01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:39.830]
No, sir. All right. Well, I'll see you later, I'll leave. Whatever you're doing.

[01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:47.990]
No, it's just another neighbor. You're going to make some food and wine. Oh, sweet Jesus.

[01:53:50.330 --> 01:54:14.870]
Hey, the doorbell is going crazy. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Great Caesars ghost. Hi, Billy. It's me, Monica. Good. Got all money. What do you think of my new bond? What are you doing here? Well, I bought that house next door with my shitty cream money. Oh my God. We'll be seeing a lot of each other in the year 2000.

[01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:38.290]
Oh, that's it. Okay. I was reading about white chicks. Yeah, what about you want to know about the movie? Okay. From 32 at 560 W. Grim misplugged is of course all over our white chicks because it's anything anti-micro more anything anti that movie. But of course, he's very objective. You understand?

[01:54:39.730 --> 01:54:58.310]
And I understand it's not to a real big and connected either so far. You're like this, though. A large alcoholic drinks manufacturer in Czechoslovakia. In prognoles. In fact, maybe prognolk gets more votes on our poll after they hear this. A large alcoholic drinks manufacturer in Prague is launched a marijuana flavored liquor. The company said today.

[01:54:59.210 --> 01:55:04.870]
The drink doesn't contain any THC. The substance in marijuana, but does have an alcohol level of 16%.

[01:55:06.150 --> 01:55:17.870]
We produce it from hemp, but there's no THE and the guy said, whatever, they're meary, yonic. Adding, he's received no complaints from anti drug activists. He said the flavored vodka sold mostly in large supermarket chains and in some of the strontes.

[01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:29.890]
He's a one-time bottle sells for about $3.20 US. Put in your flask. Yeah. In your side pocket there like somebody we know used to do all the time. Who's that?

[01:55:30.130 --> 01:55:36.610]
Kristen Peace. Oh, Kristen Slater blows $10,000 at strip club. Cheatin' Hubby's Night Out says the inquirer.

[01:55:38.190 --> 01:55:52.310]
Mary D'Actor, Kristen Slater spent $10,000 on laugh dances and champagne at a strip club. Then he reportedly visited brothel where he blew another $500.00. On a 19-year-old hooker sources tell the inquirer, well, it's wrong with that.

[01:55:53.490 --> 01:56:07.070]
If you got it, spread it around. So he said to her, if you got it, spread it. Incredibly the call girl told a British newspaper that Slater actually wanted to take three girls back to a swanky hotel suite, but couldn't afford it because his ATM card was maxed out.

[01:56:08.930 --> 01:56:18.010]
As it turned out, she says she was glad to have the true romance star all to herself. The sex was fantastic. The best client ever had. I thought I should be paying him as she told the interviewer.

[01:56:19.210 --> 01:56:28.770]
He was all over me kissing my neck running his hands over my body. I was loving every minute. I used to maybe a fan he is when I was younger and probably when he was younger too. He ain't looking too great.

[01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:36.150]
The young woman says at first she didn't recognize the actor when he walked into the London brothel at 3am. A.M. He was wearing scuffy jeans and a crumpled shirt.

[01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:41.630]
It was only after the Hollywood Hunk picked her out that she said a security guy told her who her famous John was.

[01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:50.490]
Soon they were in her fourth floor suite at one of London's fanciest hotels she claims. Right off the bat, Slater told her that he's married a TV producer Ryan Haddon and has two kids.

[01:56:50.830 --> 01:57:00.590]
He came across as really nice said the woman who may be the world's most star-struck prostitute. I was puzzled when he told me about his family, but I guess he was just being honest. He was very experienced and exactly what to do.

[01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:09.970]
He was an absolute animal like a madman going at it furiously. He was like a train and I didn't want to stop him. I almost never enjoyed myself, but with Christian I really enjoyed it.

[01:57:11.170 --> 01:57:16.210]
Slater who served time in jail because of his addictions and wild annexes been on a runaway express train to fun land lately.

[01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:20.830]
The actor made headlines after an explosive night out with Ben Affleck at a Canadian strip bar in 2003.

[01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:26.970]
Then in November Slater sang the wife smashed him on the head with a glass after she caught him converting it to Las Vegas strip club.

[01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:37.530]
The ugly gas needed nine stitches to close. When the actor arrived in London last month, the film Churchill, the Hollywood years, one of his first stops was the Alt to the Opera Expensive Sophisticat strip club, say sources.

[01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:46.390]
The meter started running at over 350 bucks an hour per girl as soon as he picked six stunning blondes and invited them to the club's exclusive VIP room to be his private dance resources.

[01:57:46.450 --> 01:57:54.070]
Say he ordered the best champagne in 900 bucks a bottle plus cocktails, which he shared with his new fans. The generous 34 year old gave them all hefty tips too.

[01:57:54.430 --> 01:58:02.670]
He loved the attention all the girls were giving, revealed a club insider, but Slater got sticker shock when he was handed the $10,000 tab. He wasn't too happy, but he eventually did pay up.

[01:58:03.210 --> 01:58:14.730]
From there Slater hooked up with the call girl, according to the British newspaper news of the world. Oh news of the world. Oh God, you ever read that? I've seen it. Yeah, it's almost like the weekly world news one step away.

[01:58:15.190 --> 01:58:24.530]
Although a spokesman first later told the inquire, the story is not true. The British newspaper reports that the stripper fanatic had so much fun for his first date with the woman that he called for a date the very next night.

[01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:31.370]
But famous lady she had to decline because she had another client. She was booked for Christian.

[01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:43.610]
Another one of those Christians gone bad. Speaking of that, your girlfriend, she's got problems. Which one? Can it Reno? Britney sex tape nightmare.

[01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:51.690]
Oh, Britney. It's like a nightmare I can't wake up from. That's what an anguished Britney Spears cry to pals. She's always crying.

[01:58:53.110 --> 01:58:58.890]
After an internet email or claim to be with selling a sex tape of the pop princess, oh wait till we get that on our website.

[01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:03.210]
That would be the day that we blow the whole website. I you'll see.

[01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:16.730]
We forget about that Paris Hilton bitch. Need help selling celeb porn tapes said the ad posted on the popular Internet sales website. I'm not going to read the Craigslist.org. I'm not going to read it though.

[01:59:20.090 --> 01:59:29.650]
I'm kind of unsure how to do this because a country boy, oh being a country boy, I have a tape shot of me in Britney Spears and I was wondering if anyone L.A. would know who I could sell it to.

[01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:37.990]
Well, sounds like her kind of country boy like that Yahoo from Louisiana with the year that she was married to for about half an hour.

[01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:45.510]
I need the money and she doesn't even talk to me anymore. This is honor around Kentwood L.A. in or around on the ad was quickly deleted.

[01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:53.370]
But not before was spotted by the editors of the show business site, the famer.com. They rented on their website calling it perhaps our favorite Craigslist post of all time.

[01:59:54.070 --> 02:00:05.830]
And they joked whatever reprimusement we'd run from some local prankster with suspect's spelling abilities is certainly tempered by our crazy hope that somewhere out in this great world of ours, there exists a video of Britney Spears writing some Yoko like a tractor.

[02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:12.450]
The tape comes on the heels of she probably has a lot of detractors. Yeah, I would go to her.

[02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:22.430]
The tape comes on the heels of a string of disasters for the 22 year old star beginning with her embarrassment embarrassing 55 hour marriage to childhood pal Jason Alexander.

[02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:35.690]
Then she was branded a home record for stealing dancer Kevin Feederline from his pregnant girlfriend and most recently her on X hotel tour, which was played by fagging and flagging ticket sales and bad reviews was canceled after Britney blew out a knee.

[02:00:35.690 --> 02:00:43.310]
She filming her outrageous video. Britney was appalled by the news that someone was hucking a phony video for having sex with a possible former lover said a pal.

[02:00:43.650 --> 02:00:53.410]
She knew the video was a sham but it bothered her greatly. There's been an endless string of unfortunate incidents in Britney's life lately almost as if her career is being sabotaged. Oh, that must be what it is, right?

[02:00:54.050 --> 02:01:00.130]
It's a conspiracy. In fact, it wasn't even her that got all that fame that fame and shame from the super bowl. It was Janet Jackson with her buddy.

[02:01:00.130 --> 02:01:10.970]
Yeah, she told her friend if I could take back the last six months, I would. It's like a nightmare that I can't wake up from the one bright spot in Britney's otherwise difficult life right now.

[02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:27.110]
Is her boyfriend Kevin? I thought they got married. Maybe it's a different guy. Well, who knows who can keep track of all these degenerates? He's moving in with her full time and talk is flying fast and furious. They're going to wet any day. This must have been written before they just got married the other day.

[02:01:27.110 --> 02:01:38.210]
I'm sure of it for about an hour and a half. Britney's told everyone that all she wants to do right now is recoup from knee surgery and spend quality time with Kevin and she's so impulsive she could easily be a bright uncurchase. I think she already is.

[02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:51.970]
Let's see. Oh, there's oh, Jesus. Oh, no, you must get this. I'm tired. I will. The way home today. First look at that awful picture of a Kirsty alley where she weighs 700 pounds. Looks like fat rich and fat boy tied together.

[02:01:53.150 --> 02:02:12.410]
And now when you see now he's got a cap on. He's wearing a Starbucks t-shirt and the sloppy jeans, but this guy, what was the other one? His name Jason Alexander. So when I see governor, remember what he looked like? Yeah, like hell on wheels. Right? Like a chip. This guy makes him look like Brad Pitt.

[02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:14.950]
Hold on,bandit.

[02:02:15.670 --> 02:02:19.230]
Cre my control, She kicked me some glassesu, you gokkkk.

[02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:21.890]
Die of the hair.

[02:02:35.790 --> 02:02:45.070]
I'm falling in, it hurts so bad, I'm crawling, it's dangerous, it's dancing.

[02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:56.590]
It's not a scrape, almost cried, what can you tell? Is it with your help? I think I'd

[02:02:56.590 --> 02:03:11.050]
snuck my smell. I'm hurt, can't you see? Blame it on the choreography, and no

[02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:24.690]
nothing's in my mind. When I fell something went inside me, I tore it and now I

[02:03:24.690 --> 02:03:31.350]
wonder if it's free, cause I'm with the married man. My boyfriend is TV and looked at him and

[02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:43.870]
tore it. Now it's off, it's not even gotten me a child tore it. I had to cancel my shows for

[02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:45.890]
me, I tore it.

[02:03:47.250 --> 02:03:53.410]
Her baby, 16 to 105, 60 WDQ, I guess who just dropped out Jack Ryan, who was forcing his

[02:03:53.410 --> 02:03:58.070]
wife, his actress wife to go to all those six clubs, just dropped out of the race in the

[02:03:58.070 --> 02:04:05.910]
middle of the night. I mean, even Republicans ought to be able to go out and screw around,

[02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:08.630]
even though they're always pointing fingers at everybody else and saying, oh, you're a bunch

[02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:13.330]
of perverts, right? All guys got their banana stuff, baby. Somebody once told me that Gary

[02:04:13.330 --> 02:04:16.890]
Lawrence told me that at W. I. N. Z. In Zadie, he said, all guys got their banana business,

[02:04:17.130 --> 02:04:20.070]
and if everybody just mind their own business, what's it to you? Just leave everybody alone.

[02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:23.530]
I thought it was your mom to told you that. Yeah, that's what he said, something about

[02:04:23.530 --> 02:04:28.410]
Chiquitas banana. If you had tons of cash, where in the world outside Florida would you

[02:04:28.410 --> 02:04:33.210]
live? What would be your home base? Where do you hang it out? 459 votes on there? Hawaii

[02:04:33.210 --> 02:04:41.230]
114, Monte Carlo 51, Lake Tahoe 49 must be fabulous. I'm sure that I'm 46. Las Vegas 45,

[02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:47.170]
Frisco 33, Mountains in North Carolina 29, Rome has got 28, and after that it's kind of

[02:04:47.170 --> 02:04:55.770]
like Slim Pickens, only two for Prague. Ever been to Prague? No. 5670560, £560 on the AT&T

[02:04:55.770 --> 02:05:02.910]
in Verizon, wireless line. Somebody QA and hello? Leo? Yes, ma'am. Hi, the reason I'm calling

[02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:09.190]
last Monday I was changed in channels on my television, and I came across Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:18.470]
He was on the Christian broadcast network, saying how he had a vision from God that he was

[02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:24.130]
going to be governor. Wow. That God gave him this vision. And I was just wondering why is

[02:05:24.130 --> 02:05:29.370]
that God is only talking to Republicans? Because the Democrats lost his number. Okay.

[02:05:31.070 --> 02:05:35.770]
Thanks, thanks for the bad news. Arnold is another born again for God to know that. I thought

[02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:39.330]
he was certainly ought to be a good obedient Catholic like Maria. Well, I probably is,

[02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:44.310]
isn't he? I don't know. Now that you mentioned it. But I thought only the born agains with

[02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:46.870]
the ones that are always talking to God. The Catholics, they're busy talking to the Pope.

[02:05:47.550 --> 02:05:51.530]
Papa. The Catholics have their own personal saint that they can talk to. And who's that?

[02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:56.310]
St. Ignatius. I see. Well, I didn't know that till this day. I never knew that. They have

[02:05:56.310 --> 02:06:02.790]
a variety of saints depending on what's ailing you at the moment. St. Ignatius. Speaking of Ignatius,

[02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:08.270]
Jacko hiding out in Miami. What a perfect place for him. Probably at O.J. House. Accused

[02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:11.370]
child. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Michael Jackson killed those two people, killed

[02:06:11.370 --> 02:06:15.590]
the coal in the wrong Goldman. That's probably where they ought to be looking. And while

[02:06:15.590 --> 02:06:20.150]
the fact there are two articles here, Michael's $15 million pay off. Well, this is just the

[02:06:20.150 --> 02:06:24.710]
inquire of petting themselves on a back about the well. We know that. But anyway, medicine

[02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:29.410]
man helping him prepare for his upcoming trial. Here's Dr. CB providing spiritual guidance

[02:06:29.410 --> 02:06:33.670]
for Jacko who looks like he just got off of an anabode. Accused child. Well,

[02:06:33.670 --> 02:06:37.670]
us, your Michael Jackson is hiding out in a posh Miami hotel where he's preparing for

[02:06:37.670 --> 02:06:42.870]
even shows the lowest hotel. Maybe some of you folks would like to visit Michael, okay?

[02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:50.030]
The presidential suite is on the 17th and 18th floors at the lowest hotel. Anyway, this

[02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:53.290]
is what the inquire claims hiding out where he's preparing for his upcoming trial with

[02:06:53.290 --> 02:06:57.290]
the help of a Central American medicine man. The inquires learned exclusively, of course.

[02:06:58.230 --> 02:07:02.610]
Sources say Jackson spends his days in the $4,000 night suite at Lois Miami Beach hotel

[02:07:02.610 --> 02:07:09.270]
meditating, praying, doing yoga, getting aroma therapy and receiving spiritual guidance

[02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:14.250]
from a 70 year old Honduran herbalist. He calls Dr. CB, but whose real name is Alfredo

[02:07:14.250 --> 02:07:18.650]
Bowman. I wonder if he's related to venereal Bowman and transit Pompa no Park once in a

[02:07:18.650 --> 02:07:23.750]
while. Michael is opening up to Dr. CB reveals the source. He hasn't had anyone as close

[02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:29.430]
in his life since bubbles the chimp who died some years back. Even though Dr. CB is not

[02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:38.650]
a real doctor. Oh, God. Jackson is convinced his herbal treatments will give him, of course,

[02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:41.810]
if he's in South Florida, does he need to be a real doctor? No, so why should he be

[02:07:41.810 --> 02:07:46.930]
indifferent? Jackson's convinced his herbal treatments will give him the mental and physical

[02:07:46.930 --> 02:07:50.570]
age he needs to come out on top and he goes to court in September to face nine felony

[02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:55.490]
counts of the insiders. Dr. CB's got permission to get beyond the hotel's high security checkpoints

[02:07:55.490 --> 02:08:00.010]
and visit Michael each day, sometimes spending hours at a time and insider tells the inquire.

[02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:04.850]
A couple of times after Dr. CB finished his treatments and left the hotel, Michael called

[02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:08.550]
and asked him to return. He dropped whatever was doing to rush to Michael's side or give

[02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:13.110]
him spiritual advice on the telephone. When Dr. CB was not present, Michael would spend

[02:08:13.110 --> 02:08:17.550]
hours praying, meditating, doing yoga or involved in some sort of aroma therapy, the different

[02:08:17.550 --> 02:08:22.230]
sense and fragrances permeated the local hallways. Maybe that was just the smell of that Jesus

[02:08:22.230 --> 02:08:27.810]
juice. Located on the hotel's 17th and 18th floors, the live-ish presidential suites floor

[02:08:27.810 --> 02:08:32.670]
to saving windows offer breathtaking views, but hotel sources say the strange singers chose

[02:08:32.670 --> 02:08:36.510]
not to think advantage of the hotels other amenities like its fine restaurants and food,

[02:08:36.970 --> 02:08:41.510]
instead he's having his personal chef's follow a strict eye plan designed by Dr. CB said the

[02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:46.450]
insider. There are only certain foods, Michael will eat, he believes some foods, invite negative

[02:08:46.450 --> 02:08:50.810]
energy into the body, will ultimately affect other aspects of his life. Michael is so desperate

[02:08:50.810 --> 02:08:55.610]
to save himself from spending years behind bars, he'll try almost anything even if something is

[02:08:55.610 --> 02:09:01.770]
wacky isn't it? Well, that great. Got some audio of one of Dr. CB's blessings there. Great, let's

[02:09:01.770 --> 02:09:09.410]
hear it. I think that's what it's going to do it. I think if we play that again, there goes

[02:09:09.410 --> 02:09:14.890]
the license, whatever the hell he said, they're right at the end. Anyway, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:09:14.890 --> 02:09:19.650]
pound, 5, 60 on a A and T and T line. Don't forget, join QM now, let's see, where's the correct

[02:09:19.650 --> 02:09:22.450]
one? I want to make sure we get the right promo on your clearance to get all been out of shape.

[02:09:23.070 --> 02:09:26.890]
Join QAM in President Daybeard tonight, six to wait at the Kendall, El House, 160th Avenue,

[02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:32.030]
Kendall Drive, and at Little Hoolies from 9 to 11 PM at 131 35 South West, 89th Place,

[02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:37.970]
stop by for prizes and specials on President Daybeard. And don't forget, if you missed a big

[02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:42.090]
ode today, it's because that place that Verizon places out of business, that's great. We shouldn't

[02:09:42.090 --> 02:09:48.270]
have just lost over that because that's the QAM FN way. That is so perfect. We arranged, we set

[02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:52.930]
up with the agency. I wonder whose account that is. We've got to find that out before the end of the day

[02:09:53.390 --> 02:09:59.470]
for Verizon Wireless. All right, good luck to us. Yeah. Call on us and authorize Verizon Wireless Agent,

[02:09:59.630 --> 02:10:04.210]
500 West Oakland Park, put them on. We were inviting it to stop by and spin the wheel with the big,

[02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:08.710]
but the problem is the place is out of business, which sounds like a perfect place for the big

[02:10:09.150 --> 02:10:13.510]
place. Anyway, that particular branch is closed. It's not like that. That's what I'm talking about.

[02:10:13.530 --> 02:10:17.150]
I didn't save Verizon Wireless out of business. I said that branch. That's what I'm saying, that branch.

[02:10:18.250 --> 02:10:22.990]
Clif branch. And we got that one tonight at the Kendall and also tomorrow noon to two,

[02:10:22.990 --> 02:10:26.350]
George will be at a place that he loves going because he just sits on his ass. There needs

[02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:32.530]
the sandwiches. Actually, they, uh, but I stand around, he hangs around. Tomorrow noon to two,

[02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:35.970]
George will be at Bill Siles, Bull of Artists Savings on Northway. Not if they know who you are by

[02:10:35.970 --> 02:10:40.870]
this time or not. Yeah, they do. They were really. Yeah. And they actually know what station you're

[02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:45.310]
on and everything. Right. That's how the three green goes that worked there. We hang. We bond. You're

[02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:49.810]
hanging. Right. One of them is the manager. So it's good. If you find someone who's militant, uh, well,

[02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:53.690]
anyway, you might be hanging noon to two. George will be at Bill Siles, Bull of Artists Savings,

[02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:58.350]
Northwest 36, Street just West to 27. Having to Miami stop by to win prizes and enjoy those delicious

[02:10:58.350 --> 02:11:01.890]
subs from Atlantic City subs where I were used to make the difference, but he ain't there no more.

[02:11:01.890 --> 02:11:06.650]
Has he gone already or see? We gone already. I'll be damn good luck. Yeah, we love you. Thank

[02:11:06.650 --> 02:11:13.970]
you for all the kindness and as far as Scott's concerned. Well, yeah, to him. 5 6 7 0 5 60 whatever

[02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:20.310]
where Dick Cheney said to a pet Lee, he did the same goes for a Scott 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60

[02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:26.330]
on the 18 and team Verizon Marla's line. How many QA and hello? Hey, how you doing? Neil? Pretty good.

[02:11:26.550 --> 02:11:30.610]
This is Frank Gonzalez again. Canada gets Lincoln Diaz ball. Are you? You said you said,

[02:11:30.810 --> 02:11:35.850]
okay, great. Good luck to you, Frank. Just kiss the ground. I'll let you ramble on the first time.

[02:11:35.970 --> 02:11:39.390]
Okay. First of all, we don't like the libertarian party. Secondly, we're doing a radio show here.

[02:11:39.650 --> 02:11:44.170]
This isn't a campaign by somebody that's got going to get about eight votes. This is a radio show.

[02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:47.970]
So don't ever do that again, Frank. We're going to have to reveal the things that we know that,

[02:11:48.110 --> 02:11:54.190]
well, probably rather that we shouldn't. I don't know what the area will find out. How do you like that?

[02:11:54.370 --> 02:11:59.750]
Can you believe that? Sure. What a and I really let it slide. That thing would Dave Slater,

[02:11:59.750 --> 02:12:02.990]
because you know, we had to put that guy up to call him. That was shameful.

[02:12:04.710 --> 02:12:10.110]
I mean, the guy, you know, he was right on there with that sale, with that penny tax that they

[02:12:10.110 --> 02:12:13.670]
wanted to stick in there a couple of years ago, him and the Richard Friedman. But enough is an

[02:12:13.670 --> 02:12:19.530]
up. Okay, baby. It's one thing to, you know, seek out somebody else's assistance or just seek out

[02:12:19.530 --> 02:12:25.630]
somebody else's ass. But I mean, give me a break. Coming back to the well again. Oh, Dave Slater,

[02:12:25.730 --> 02:12:29.230]
nobody else will talk to him. Nobody will recognize him. So let's use the new arrived show as a vehicle.

[02:12:29.230 --> 02:12:33.730]
To try to like let everybody know he's on. Nobody cares, Dave. Okay, go back and do the weather. We

[02:12:33.730 --> 02:12:37.670]
were a good guy. Go do something useful. Go tell us when we're going to get a hurricane. Do something

[02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:46.110]
worth a while. Boy, boy, the same that town. It's just, it's just where is you out the same old faces,

[02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:58.370]
the same tired voices. And now we got this new tired voice. Frank Alexander Schwartz, whatever

[02:12:58.370 --> 02:13:02.710]
he is. I don't know. I'm, you know, something I'm sorry. I apologize to the audience for letting

[02:13:02.710 --> 02:13:06.590]
you board a hell out of me other day when you called in. I'll let him ramble on. And instead of

[02:13:06.590 --> 02:13:10.370]
appreciating, he's calling back again to see if he can order show again today. The answer is no,

[02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:15.970]
Frank. And I hope you lose big. I'm all for who has he run against the, what's his name?

[02:13:16.170 --> 02:13:20.710]
Yes, the link in the as ball art as much of his a right wing lunatic as he is. I hope he beats you

[02:13:20.710 --> 02:13:24.730]
by 50 million votes. So what are the Democrats didn't put anybody up? At least they're smart enough

[02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:29.630]
to realize they ain't got a Chinaman's chance in Little Havana. Okay. Let's open up a kosher

[02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:35.210]
deli in the Moscow. They probably got some like I said, like open up a kosher deli in Little Havana.

[02:13:36.590 --> 02:13:44.750]
God. Anyway, let's take some calls. Five six, five six seven, oh five 60 pound five 60. Don't

[02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:49.370]
forget our new format. It's all Geltie's starting Monday. All Geltie all day. On the clock 24

[02:13:49.370 --> 02:13:53.950]
hours a day as he squishes his way to the top. WQA him. Hello.

[02:13:54.710 --> 02:14:03.790]
Big nail. Yes, sir. Pretty good. One for your poll. Yes. Cuba. Cuba? Yeah. Cuba. Have you been there?

[02:14:05.190 --> 02:14:10.470]
Not as far as you know. Like you have partners of partners of your choice and you live like a king

[02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:15.230]
if you got money. Okay, great. Well, I'll see you in the Havana. He wants to go to Cuba. The hotel's

[02:14:15.230 --> 02:14:20.410]
there. Our families. Now, let me ask you when if we ever have another hockey season and the

[02:14:20.410 --> 02:14:27.390]
Panthers are involved in a really close game of Geltie. Call it a squeaker. That was bad. I don't

[02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:32.390]
I want to apologize for that. No. We're in a real squeaker. Out of gold. It's a go. It's a go.

[02:14:35.410 --> 02:14:39.510]
Geltie, man, your two colors have come out these last few months. You have shown yourself to be a

[02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:43.670]
real pain in the arse and everybody in the station has just turned against you. It's amazing. I mean,

[02:14:43.670 --> 02:14:48.370]
generally, you know, in the past, we consider them to be like a, I don't know, annoying, but just

[02:14:49.110 --> 02:14:55.290]
kind of like a benign as opposed to some malignant people. About 30, man. Yeah, we got to

[02:14:55.290 --> 02:14:58.970]
say about 30 million people, most of whom are Greg Reed's personal friends versus why they're there.

[02:14:59.710 --> 02:15:04.070]
You know what I'm talking about? Absolutely. There you go. But a company to find out that he's not

[02:15:04.070 --> 02:15:07.630]
benign. He's his malignant as they come and he's looking for everybody else's job and he's a

[02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:11.190]
legend in his own mind. And he actually thinks he belongs on here. This is the thing that

[02:15:11.190 --> 02:15:15.710]
cracks me up. You go to a hockey game. You sit in that macarena and there's his ugly push up

[02:15:15.710 --> 02:15:19.810]
there on the big screen. You can't get away from it in between periods and he's spaking it. And

[02:15:19.810 --> 02:15:23.290]
of course, there the sound level is magnified by a million, you know, because they crank the

[02:15:23.290 --> 02:15:29.450]
level way up and it's just like it's if I just really cranked that baby up. You're annoying,

[02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:33.610]
sweetheart. You're annoying and you're irritating. I can't wait. If he really is going to,

[02:15:33.610 --> 02:15:38.670]
because the schedule says he's back with Mo on Monday. We should get an 80's here just for people

[02:15:38.670 --> 02:15:43.650]
tuning in to hear the angst, the hysteria. In fact, you'll be able to like stick your finger

[02:15:43.650 --> 02:15:49.410]
in the radio and cut the attention. Right? Yeah. You'll be able to cut it with your toenail.

[02:15:49.570 --> 02:15:52.490]
Oh, they love each other. Right. It's all just stick.

[02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:58.510]
My god, look. Oh, here's sports radio 560 here at 2am.

[02:16:00.090 --> 02:16:02.910]
Oh, boy. It's the one to two hour.

[02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:06.630]
What the f*** are you doing?

[02:16:06.930 --> 02:16:07.850]
Where is this here?

[02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:11.150]
You f***ing wood sausage made fresh by the tournament.

[02:16:11.410 --> 02:16:12.450]
Is it f***ing good?

[02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:16.050]
I like it so much. I'm going to kill you.

[02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:20.770]
Oh, no, they're waiting, man.

[02:16:21.150 --> 02:16:27.610]
Dead one sausage is made from 100% human fed beef pork for down home freshness.

[02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:28.630]
Grominew.

[02:16:32.770 --> 02:16:35.550]
This is trade for the whole family.

[02:16:35.850 --> 02:16:41.370]
Made from people by people who ship direct gear and grosses freezer for people like you.

[02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:43.190]
Dead one sausage.

[02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:44.450]
Dirty people.

[02:16:44.550 --> 02:16:45.390]
Good food.

[02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:47.670]
I don't want it 560 WQM.

[02:16:48.330 --> 02:16:50.650]
I'm just looking at maybe his website just crashed.

[02:16:51.530 --> 02:16:56.230]
And on our fact, at the Fudge Report where he's obsessed with the fact that white chicks might be

[02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:57.730]
Michael Morath box offices.

[02:16:57.850 --> 02:17:01.090]
We can, of course, white chicks isn't about 2500 movie theaters on a country.

[02:17:01.450 --> 02:17:03.130]
And Michael Morath is in like 558 or something like that.

[02:17:03.310 --> 02:17:07.030]
Williams brothers are more famous than God and everybody loves them and they go see other.

[02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:08.070]
Right. There you go.

[02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:12.730]
Anyway, oh, I better up print this out about the internet attack

[02:17:12.730 --> 02:17:18.410]
because the government, I mean the Sunlion outsider might be tearing the internet down so you can't find out what's going on in the world.

[02:17:19.050 --> 02:17:20.510]
This story, though, we just got.

[02:17:20.650 --> 02:17:22.070]
Can you imagine if we didn't have the internet?

[02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:22.510]
Right.

[02:17:23.010 --> 02:17:25.190]
All we'd have is like the hero of the Sun Central and CNN.

[02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:28.490]
And Dan Radher and Tom Broca with his bad speech impediment.

[02:17:29.530 --> 02:17:34.630]
Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson asked the state court yesterday to remove a creek county judge from the bench

[02:17:34.630 --> 02:17:37.710]
for allegedly using a sexual device during court proceedings.

[02:17:39.390 --> 02:17:44.770]
The petition asked the Oklahoma court on the judiciary to remove Judge Donald Thompson was accused of using a penis

[02:17:44.770 --> 02:17:45.990]
pump during court proceedings.

[02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:47.350]
Oh my God.

[02:17:47.730 --> 02:17:47.950]
The court.

[02:17:48.310 --> 02:17:49.510]
This is the best story.

[02:17:49.630 --> 02:17:50.990]
This may be the great story of the week.

[02:17:53.490 --> 02:17:58.550]
According to court papers filed by Edmondson, a court reporter told investigators she saw Thompson using the device

[02:17:58.550 --> 02:18:00.050]
more than a dozen times.

[02:18:00.930 --> 02:18:04.550]
Edmondson said the court reporter Lisa Kay Foster, no relation to Bud Foster,

[02:18:04.550 --> 02:18:07.630]
was fired after Thompson learned she was cooperating with investigators.

[02:18:08.490 --> 02:18:12.590]
Foster told investigators she heard a noise from under Thompson's bench on several occasions.

[02:18:13.170 --> 02:18:14.550]
She also said she witnessed him.

[02:18:15.170 --> 02:18:16.130]
She also.

[02:18:18.630 --> 02:18:19.590]
Oh God.

[02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:20.530]
I thought it was more like.

[02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:26.630]
She also said she witnessed him engaging in improper sexual conduct 15 or 20 times.

[02:18:26.710 --> 02:18:27.490]
Maybe it was more like.

[02:18:27.530 --> 02:18:28.470]
About 30 men.

[02:18:28.570 --> 02:18:32.230]
Edmondson said Thompson denies the allegations but admits having the device out of the bench.

[02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:37.630]
According to the petition Thompson testified that the penis pump was a gag gift from a friend.

[02:18:37.970 --> 02:18:39.130]
He's gagging on it.

[02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:43.630]
Thompson's attorney said the allegations are false and part of an effort to attack and embarrass him.

[02:18:44.010 --> 02:18:48.130]
Thompson 57 has not been available for comment but as attorney Clark Brewster said

[02:18:48.130 --> 02:18:51.370]
through his data Thompson is horrified by the accusations.

[02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:52.250]
How do you like that?

[02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:53.150]
I can't imagine why.

[02:18:55.130 --> 02:18:56.310]
Maybe he's listening to Arble.

[02:18:56.410 --> 02:18:57.510]
Maybe it's time to pump it up.

[02:18:57.710 --> 02:19:01.970]
Anyway, this is kind of a scary story but then again why should we be scared?

[02:19:01.970 --> 02:19:03.230]
Because that's the way they wanted anyway.

[02:19:03.330 --> 02:19:05.010]
They want us to be scared and terrified all the time.

[02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:09.510]
The government and industry experts weren't late yesterday of a mysterious large scale

[02:19:09.510 --> 02:19:11.850]
internet attack against thousands of popular websites.

[02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:18.930]
The virus like infection tries to implant hackers software out of the computers of all website visitors.

[02:19:19.710 --> 02:19:23.310]
Industry experts in the Homeland Security Department were studying the infection to determine

[02:19:23.310 --> 02:19:26.130]
how it spreads across websites and find adequate defenses against it.

[02:19:26.550 --> 02:19:29.930]
Users should be aware that any website even those that may be trusted by the user

[02:19:29.930 --> 02:19:33.790]
may be affected by this activity and thus contain potentially malicious code

[02:19:33.790 --> 02:19:36.710]
the government warned in one internet alert.

[02:19:37.470 --> 02:19:40.590]
The mysterious infection appeared to target at least one recent version of software

[02:19:40.590 --> 02:19:44.730]
by Microsoft to operate websites called its internet information server,

[02:19:45.350 --> 02:19:47.170]
popular among businesses and organizations.

[02:19:47.770 --> 02:19:51.190]
A spokesperson for Microsoft to kind of comment immediately experts said the attacks

[02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:55.010]
effects were unusually broad but words substantially interfering with internet traffic.

[02:19:55.250 --> 02:19:57.950]
While this insignificant that has no impact on the operation of the

[02:19:57.950 --> 02:20:01.070]
United States and markets tax who helps run the industry's internet storm center with

[02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:05.010]

[02:20:28.170 --> 02:20:34.150]
that equipment over there because it sounds really good. So you're punched up the one that I saw

you know he was pretty fast in Clinton for dropping bombs on Sherry Able or what I was

[02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:57.430]
in the same day that all the Columbine students you know went went off in Colorado so he's not I don't

[02:20:57.430 --> 02:21:02.970]
see him as so partisan as everyone's make amount to be right no he he has something that he likes

[02:21:02.970 --> 02:21:07.770]

[02:21:27.390 --> 02:21:31.370]
but he did a lot of he may in fact from day one with that thing about the gaze of the military

[02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:36.070]
even though his intentions were good extraordinarily politically explosive and I even idiotic and

[02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:40.510]
didn't work of course blow up in his face and just get you know they were out to get him and he

[02:21:40.510 --> 02:21:44.570]
give him every opportunity in the world that that was the problem kind of like Al Goldstein in fact

[02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:49.970]
I think that we eaten big match together for wilder good intentions but again everything being

[02:21:49.970 --> 02:21:54.630]
well-dored compared to what we got now and compared to the 12 years that preceded him he was like

[02:21:54.630 --> 02:22:00.230]
a spectacular and he made a really good point and one of the interviews one of his 800 interviews

[02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:04.510]
the other day and he's right of course the media will never tell you this the mainstream media

[02:22:04.510 --> 02:22:08.730]
and that is once Nixon got in the right wingers and they were just starting to really get their

[02:22:08.730 --> 02:22:14.350]
feel or oats at that point the religionist and these other coalition of Nazis they thought that

[02:22:14.350 --> 02:22:18.170]
that was it that was the end of the democrats the noise and Carter got in was because of watergate

[02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:24.110]
but they thought and so once the Reagan got in there and bush one got in they thought that was it no

[02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:28.550]
more democrats ever going to get in and then he came along and screwed up all their plans just like

[02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:33.950]
Tessio said screwed up all everybody plans not once but twice for eight years whipped their ass

[02:22:35.170 --> 02:22:39.190]
and so that's why from the minute he got into the first year when he were out to get his ass out of there

[02:22:40.850 --> 02:22:48.110]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line and old poor Monica they're starting

complaining that they're really making 20 millions of 30 million well these teachers and police

[02:23:24.570 --> 02:23:31.390]

[02:24:10.330 --> 02:24:17.030]
sandy eagle no LA now what is LA I mean what are you comparing okay not just that's the only place in

[02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:21.450]
California been I mean LA wants upon a time if you like a wild and woolly and great place all

[02:24:21.450 --> 02:24:27.230]
even back in the day even back in the day before ed Davis put everybody in jail and they like made

[02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:32.690]
LA and became like a stopping off point for every Korean and Chinese and whatever else in Vietnamese

[02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:40.590]
but LA was always dangerous you you felt the error of crime I have never lived anywhere like LA

[02:24:41.350 --> 02:24:48.070]
even in Detroit I remember my eyes burned continuously from the smog yeah and of course I'm one

[02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:51.470]
of the really bad days you could be driving on a freeway and you look up in the air and you know

[02:24:51.470 --> 02:24:55.770]
the Hollywood Hillsign is up there somewhere you just can't see it right you know it's there you

[02:24:55.770 --> 02:25:01.250]
just can't see it but it's just the feeling of danger in crime I haven't been there in a long

[02:25:01.250 --> 02:25:04.690]
time because last time I was there I didn't see any signs in English it made me almost feel like

even South Florida except at least I understand a few words of esponial I can't understand no

[02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:14.010]

resting deputy to bring me up and then may have not understood her age if he

not some guido if you had tons of cash we're in the world outside of

[02:34:15.450 --> 02:34:18.410]

[02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:21.630]
your home base if you had like millions and millions and millions and millions

[02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:28.570]
Hawaii 130 101 about third man why don't nobody close i told you that was going to be big

[02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:35.150]

[02:34:38.650 --> 02:34:41.710]
roham 33 the Bahamas 19 Vancouver 16

[02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:45.710]
Salzburg and edicates the crank vote with 13 obviously Stockholm Sweden 12

[02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:49.490]
and doors got 11 everybody else single digits see the thing about vegas if you had

[02:34:49.490 --> 02:34:52.830]
this is what i don't understand i'll send people have a gambling problem

[02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:59.330]
okay like some athletes right at gambling problems and so they go to vegas so they go to

[02:34:59.330 --> 02:35:02.610]
winlite accident they gamble millions and millions they lose a couple million in one night

[02:35:03.150 --> 02:35:06.650]
because unless unless you have a problem like that or you're a crazy person and you're willing

[02:35:06.650 --> 02:35:11.030]
to lose that kind of money the the attraction just isn't that great you see what i'm saying

[02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:15.310]
in other words like if jord if if when josh was in vegas right when you were in vegas

[02:35:15.310 --> 02:35:17.970]
yeah now do you play any slots no

[02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:27.550]
i play blackjack man

[02:35:37.450 --> 02:35:44.630]
slots are for old ladies josh is telling me oh yeah right must be all the rest of his disguises

[02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:47.930]
all ladies playing the slots like it would buy in the last couple of weeks that i was over

[02:35:47.930 --> 02:35:54.290]
yeah you big band of the slots i love the slots it's a sucker game but it's fun blackjack is boring

[02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:59.730]
now you can win it blackjack but see here's my whole point now in vegas of course they have the

[02:35:59.730 --> 02:36:03.550]
progressive slots where if you want to play quarters which even you could afford that you got quarter

[02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:08.510]
mania with sometimes has like a 20 million dollar jackpot right but but let's say even like the

[02:36:08.510 --> 02:36:12.910]
small progressive jackpot it's like eight thousand or twenty five thousand if you hit a jackpot like

[02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:20.290]
that it makes a significant difference in your life right sure now let's move to jorge okay now

[02:36:20.290 --> 02:36:24.050]
jorge is in vegas needs by record at the same would be true for jorge okay if he had like 25

[02:36:24.050 --> 02:36:28.930]
grand would be a significant change for his life he might even be able to move out but with me

[02:36:29.310 --> 02:36:32.970]
and again i'm making a few bucks i go to the slot and it's boring i mean you think i'm going to

[02:36:32.970 --> 02:36:39.590]
go and play quarter slots no slots this for old ladies you know you never once you never one

[02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:46.990]
time try to slot machines that would you tell me i tried it the one back to blackjack

[02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:52.470]
and that's because jorge told you that slots are for old ladies no not at all

[02:36:53.930 --> 02:36:58.210]
now you you were with us it like on the trip or the mgm grand three times we went and the wife

[02:36:58.210 --> 02:37:03.090]
would play the slots and i would stick with the blackjack tables now that i asked try the slots i did

[02:37:03.650 --> 02:37:09.390]
play some money there i i would say 40 percent at least 40 percent maybe maybe 50 percent

[02:37:09.390 --> 02:37:14.230]
the people i see playing slots like in vegas are men and i see an enormous number of people who are

[02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:19.530]
young men playing slot machines well they must be fakes yeah they must be fake they must have a

[02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:27.090]
fake penis they got that penis pump from the judge fakes no way but in okay so now it's an old

by any time at five six o WQ

[02:38:49.310 --> 02:38:57.250]
it was the story of a girl who took a friend's adent for a world

[02:38:57.250 --> 02:39:03.150]
yes she kept feel glad and her knee pads and we never did recover when he

[02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:07.510]
lied

[02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:13.410]
still a film the next four years where the cohort boys we still have a fierce politician

[02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:19.190]
just so insensitive never quite as honest as they would appear shake hands and get babies

[02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:25.130]
our kids and later on up to something so kind of let no wonder we're all so confused

[02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:30.010]
big and time-a-man privilege that they abuse that's hope we will never again leave it

[02:39:59.910 --> 02:39:59.970]
ashamed but

[02:39:59.970 --> 02:39:59.990]
she

[02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:02.030]
We're almost back. Album was not all the car.

[02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:03.750]
We damn near nailed them there in Fallujah.

[02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:04.430]
You see it?

[02:40:04.470 --> 02:40:07.690]
Yeah, the one at his leg shot off it, it grew back.

[02:40:07.850 --> 02:40:09.310]
And the one that was dead, but he came back to life.

[02:40:09.490 --> 02:40:10.410]
He almost got him.

[02:40:10.850 --> 02:40:11.630]
And then what happened?

[02:40:12.390 --> 02:40:12.850]
He got away.

[02:40:13.690 --> 02:40:14.330]
He popped out.

[02:40:14.350 --> 02:40:15.070]
Hey, listen, close.

[02:40:15.310 --> 02:40:16.730]
I mean, like in Quits and Horseshoe's close,

[02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:17.610]
counts a lot of nose.

[02:40:17.950 --> 02:40:19.710]
It don't count too good in chasing terrorists, though.

[02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:20.750]
Did we get him?

[02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:21.010]
No.

[02:40:21.150 --> 02:40:23.290]
We got the bull all marred.

[02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:24.310]
Osama Yamamoto?

[02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:24.830]
No.

[02:40:25.350 --> 02:40:26.730]
But anyway, we came down close.

[02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:30.310]
The destroyer Lewinsky speaks out on Clinton memoir.

[02:40:30.490 --> 02:40:33.830]
Monica Lewinsky says she feels betrayed by Bill Clinton's failure to acknowledge how

[02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:35.750]
he destroyed her life and his newly released memoirs.

[02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:39.810]
In an interview with British broadcaster ITV to be shown on Friday, the former White House

[02:40:39.810 --> 02:40:43.890]
intern best known for affair with a 42nd US president says she was, uh, disappointed

[02:40:43.890 --> 02:40:45.150]
how the relationship is addressed.

[02:40:46.150 --> 02:40:49.570]
I really didn't expect him to talk in detail about another of what she's distressed.

[02:40:50.430 --> 02:40:52.450]
In details, she said, there you go.

[02:40:52.450 --> 02:40:53.270]
Who cares what she said?

[02:40:53.790 --> 02:40:55.730]
Misrable nasty bitch with a big mouth.

[02:40:55.870 --> 02:40:58.370]
See, that's the problem when you're dealing with broads like her with a big mouth.

[02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:01.290]
We use it for several different things, including yapping a lot.

[02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:06.910]
That's why she was able to get on tape or lend a trip and Lucian Goldberg and all

[02:41:06.910 --> 02:41:08.150]
of those lunatics, man.

[02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:10.130]
That's what that was all about.

[02:41:10.530 --> 02:41:13.130]
Now, again, back to what the point I was trying to make, which you totally sidetracked

[02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:15.290]
me with your old lady fag stuff about slots.

[02:41:15.470 --> 02:41:16.090]
That's not the point.

[02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:19.610]
No matter what you're playing, if it's like if you were playing poker and you're playing

[02:41:19.610 --> 02:41:22.190]
like penny antipoker, people that have any money.

[02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:24.390]
It's boring, which is what I'm saying.

[02:41:24.490 --> 02:41:28.190]
There's a post-opinal risk factor if you're loaded and you're not willing to be noticed.

[02:41:28.610 --> 02:41:32.530]
If you're going to win like 800 bucks in your multi-millionaire like some of the high

[02:41:32.530 --> 02:41:34.310]
rollers, what's the incentive?

[02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:35.290]
It's no fun.

[02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:36.150]
I don't get it right.

[02:41:36.310 --> 02:41:36.610]
You're right.

[02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:38.310]
It's not going to change your life.

[02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:41.510]
They should gamble for like digits like pinky fingers or something.

[02:41:41.830 --> 02:41:42.290]
There you go.

[02:41:42.470 --> 02:41:42.990]
Something like that.

[02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:47.910]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, well, let me get to a couple of important things here instead of

[02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:52.910]
touching around with Josh Plain slot machines in Vegas.

[02:41:53.090 --> 02:41:56.070]
That's just, and I'm going to tell you right now, you can laugh all you want.

[02:41:56.130 --> 02:41:59.950]
If we had the slots at the tracks like they want to get on a ballot this November to hope

[02:41:59.950 --> 02:42:04.770]
they will, that would bring in so much revenue for the state, for education, for the equality

[02:42:04.770 --> 02:42:06.090]
you're racing, for people's lives.

[02:42:06.530 --> 02:42:07.470]
It's just unbelievable.

[02:42:08.390 --> 02:42:13.030]
But in Florida, you've got this born again governor, this lunatic and these Bible thumpers

[02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.770]
who are obsessed.

[02:42:14.090 --> 02:42:15.110]
Now, the Indians, it's okay.

[02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:17.870]
They have those funny slot machines in which seminars were by the way, Hank's going

[02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:19.770]
to be doing to show this afternoon, isn't he?

[02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:20.430]
Or that was yesterday.

[02:42:21.010 --> 02:42:21.950]
But that's okay.

[02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:25.190]
But as long as only a paper or receipt comes out in the machine, the wheels don't really

[02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.750]
spin around.

[02:42:25.890 --> 02:42:26.390]
That's okay.

[02:42:27.070 --> 02:42:27.430]
Right.

[02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:29.010]
I mean, what fun is that?

[02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:31.110]
We weren't spinning.

[02:42:32.130 --> 02:42:33.510]
No, but you're missing my point.

[02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:37.410]
How is it that the spinning makes it so much more evil, but it's all programmed ahead of

[02:42:37.410 --> 02:42:38.130]
time anyway?

[02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:38.650]
I know.

[02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:42.710]
For example, I was telling somebody this the other day.

[02:42:43.350 --> 02:42:46.690]
When you spin a slot machine, when you put your money in, you hit the spin thing or

[02:42:46.690 --> 02:42:48.470]
you pull it, you pull the old fashioned way, pull the lever.

[02:42:50.510 --> 02:42:51.850]
You don't really need to do that.

[02:42:52.350 --> 02:42:54.870]
In other words, the wheels don't need to spin around.

[02:42:54.970 --> 02:42:59.790]
That's only for your amusement and to suck you into thinking that, well, look how close

[02:42:59.790 --> 02:43:03.130]
I came at seven, seven and then like a blank, you know, and the other sevens up here,

[02:43:03.330 --> 02:43:04.710]
you might as well have gotten three blanks.

[02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:05.510]
That's how close you came.

[02:43:05.710 --> 02:43:07.270]
Because it's all programmed ahead of time.

[02:43:08.850 --> 02:43:15.190]
So when you hit the button, spin, it could immediately show you, you know, but then again,

[02:43:15.270 --> 02:43:19.310]
that would be no fun and there would be the whole concept of that is to get you whipped

[02:43:19.310 --> 02:43:20.750]
into it and like it worked up and it worked.

[02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:22.350]
And I don't care what you say.

[02:43:22.490 --> 02:43:27.630]
There are people, men and women of all ages who sit there for hours and hours, black people,

[02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:31.410]
white people, green people, purple people, just pouring it in there, have it a great time.

[02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.770]
And spider, what you say?

[02:43:32.850 --> 02:43:33.910]
Just look through a shoulder of her life.

[02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:36.990]
I mean, Josh, I can understand because what else he get to go, huh?

[02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:38.610]
Well, often than I do.

[02:43:39.010 --> 02:43:41.910]
I mean, if Dave Van Boren would be nice to him, treat him well and take him on the big

[02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:45.770]
trips like this weekend trip to Tampa, for example, he won't be there actually.

[02:43:46.270 --> 02:43:46.870]
He won't be there.

[02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:47.430]
Why is that?

[02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:49.590]
He's going to some hall of fame, Sarah Morning.

[02:43:51.070 --> 02:43:51.750]
Not for him.

[02:43:51.870 --> 02:43:52.910]
Oh, I know who it's for.

[02:43:52.990 --> 02:43:53.850]
It's for Andre Dawson.

[02:43:54.430 --> 02:43:54.770]
That's right.

[02:43:56.170 --> 02:44:00.310]
It's for the hawk who played for as many years in Montreal where Dave Van Boren into

[02:44:00.310 --> 02:44:03.630]
his nuts of illustrious Montreal career doing games on the internet because no radio

[02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:05.210]
station would carry it because nobody cares.

[02:44:05.470 --> 02:44:08.950]
And by the way, the deal is the expose are moving to Washington DC next year, they're

[02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:10.650]
building a stadium there and it's what's going to happen.

[02:44:11.250 --> 02:44:11.970]
Got it.

[02:44:12.030 --> 02:44:12.430]
Got it.

[02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:13.590]
Let's see.

[02:44:13.710 --> 02:44:14.090]
Here's one.

[02:44:14.210 --> 02:44:15.730]
Oh, yeah, a lot of Brunan in Switzerland.

[02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:20.410]
Okay, we'll just put Switzerland on there because this is, it won't get many, many votes

[02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:21.370]
about getting.

[02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:23.590]
But that's one of the things makes it such a great place.

[02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:24.070]
It's quiet.

[02:44:24.310 --> 02:44:24.870]
The same today.

[02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:25.870]
So it was a hundred years ago.

[02:44:25.970 --> 02:44:30.330]
It's a valley in the Swiss Alps with numerous waterfalls and some of the nicest people

[02:44:30.330 --> 02:44:30.850]
they'll ever meet.

[02:44:30.850 --> 02:44:32.370]
So we'll just put Switzerland for that.

[02:44:32.770 --> 02:44:33.870]
Here's Joe and South Miami.

[02:44:33.870 --> 02:44:34.790]
He says, hi, Appali.

[02:44:35.170 --> 02:44:36.610]
How's the fat boy doing, by the way?

[02:44:36.690 --> 02:44:37.490]
He's still a lot of.

[02:44:38.650 --> 02:44:39.370]
Hi, Appali.

[02:44:39.590 --> 02:44:40.350]
Got a pacemaker.

[02:44:40.470 --> 02:44:41.590]
Our fat sales guy, Jeff.

[02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:41.850]
Hi.

[02:44:43.390 --> 02:44:44.070]
Great news.

[02:44:44.270 --> 02:44:45.910]
Fahrenheit 9 11 sold out with the noon show.

[02:44:45.930 --> 02:44:49.050]
What Sunset Place in beautiful South Miami in the 240 shows almost sold out.

[02:44:49.470 --> 02:44:52.510]
The ticket guy told me they've been selling advanced tickets for the 528 o'clock shows

[02:44:52.510 --> 02:44:53.290]
like crazy.

[02:44:53.950 --> 02:44:57.670]
He said, you should have seen the line when I went to pick up my tickets for the night

[02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:58.750]
show was like a rock concert.

[02:44:58.750 --> 02:45:00.350]
It's all over now, George W.

[02:45:00.810 --> 02:45:01.030]
You.

[02:45:01.270 --> 02:45:02.810]
And says, Joe and South Miami.

[02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:06.470]
Thanks, Joe, for the good news as opposed to that lady that called before moaning about

[02:45:06.470 --> 02:45:08.810]
Oh, there's nobody in line that can't wait on sunrise.

[02:45:08.810 --> 02:45:10.050]
There's only 15 people.

[02:45:10.050 --> 02:45:10.590]
Nobody going.

[02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:16.650]
Anyway, Katrina Fandon Hovel in the nation rights, Tom Delay's Amoral Code.

[02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:19.630]
Speaking of morality and all this hypocrisy, all these lunatics.

[02:45:20.610 --> 02:45:24.510]
She says, is it any surprise that the publication of Clinton's memoir, my life has revived the

[02:45:24.510 --> 02:45:28.510]
vitriolic bleeding from those on the right who just can't seem to stop celebrating over

[02:45:28.510 --> 02:45:30.430]
bloodwrestling and per-way wearing interns.

[02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:34.390]
But if the self-appointed morality police were truly committed to upholding ethics and

[02:45:34.390 --> 02:45:37.870]
promoting values and government, they would begin challenging the House Majority Leader,

[02:45:38.030 --> 02:45:41.430]
Tom Delay, who was hands down one of the most corrupt politicians in the US.

[02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.650]
The hammer.

[02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:43.690]
Do you know that was his name?

[02:45:44.030 --> 02:45:44.470]
The hammer.

[02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:47.550]
But the hammer is a crook by not our hammer.

[02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:51.730]
This hammer, Tom Delay got that nickname because he runs the US House of Representatives

[02:45:51.730 --> 02:45:52.750]
with an iron fist.

[02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:57.170]
He allegedly brimed his EOP colleagues to win their votes for legislation that he desperately

[02:45:57.170 --> 02:45:58.290]
wanted to pass in the House.

[02:45:58.570 --> 02:46:02.630]
He's engaged in quid pro-quows with corporation seeking legislative favors and violated

[02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:06.790]
campaign finance laws in Texas during the 2002 state house election contest.

[02:46:07.210 --> 02:46:11.250]
Now after a 70-year truce in the US House that discouraged members from filing ethics charges

[02:46:11.250 --> 02:46:14.690]
against one another, represented Chris Bell has gone to the ethics committee and filed

[02:46:14.690 --> 02:46:19.930]
a 187-page bombshell charging that Delay engaged in extortion, money laundering, and other

[02:46:19.930 --> 02:46:20.710]
abuses of power.

[02:46:20.970 --> 02:46:22.050]
Nice going, Chris, you go, boy.

[02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:25.970]
Just this week, the ethics committee said that Bell had met the criteria for finding

[02:46:25.970 --> 02:46:30.010]
a complaint and it will not spend at least the next 45 days reviewing the charges that

[02:46:30.010 --> 02:46:31.890]
Delay violated the House's ethics rules.

[02:46:32.370 --> 02:46:35.590]
Bell called the committee's decision an important first step in the long journey to restore

[02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:38.990]
integrity and ethics to the people's house and a whole house majority later accountable

[02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.690]
for his actions.

[02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:44.310]
He received a standing ovation from the Democratic Caucus this week, winning a tacit

[02:46:44.310 --> 02:46:47.430]
endorsement from colleagues in his ongoing battle to hold Delay accountable.

[02:46:48.290 --> 02:46:52.310]
Bell who lost his seat in Texas after Delay ran through his undemocratic statewide redistricting

[02:46:52.310 --> 02:46:56.230]
plan, designed to help Republicans hold on to power there, has taken a bold stand.

[02:46:56.970 --> 02:47:00.810]
But Kudos must also be given to the courageous folks at the citizens for responsibility

[02:47:00.810 --> 02:47:05.030]
in ethics, crew, in Washington, who have been filing complaints against Delay and shining

[02:47:05.030 --> 02:47:07.370]
a spotlight on his transgressions for many months now.

[02:47:07.930 --> 02:47:12.010]
Crew bills itself as a nonpartisan watchdog group established use litigation to help

[02:47:12.010 --> 02:47:14.070]
ordinary people against unscrupulous government officials.

[02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:17.390]
Of course we should have high standards for government leaders, crews, mission statement

[02:47:17.390 --> 02:47:21.450]
notes, but the greatest danger to democracy is posed not by the personal peccadillos of

[02:47:21.450 --> 02:47:25.010]
government leaders, but rather public policy unduly influenced by special interests.

[02:47:25.610 --> 02:47:29.670]
Although it's adopted the model of legal advocacy developed by rubbing organizations like

[02:47:29.670 --> 02:47:32.610]
Judicial Watch and the Rutherford Institute, crew has no political ideology.

[02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:38.070]
In recent years it stood alongside a bevy of brave souls from columnist Paul Krugman

[02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:42.690]
and Democratic officials in the Texas legislature who have opposed Delay's brass knuckles tactics

[02:47:42.690 --> 02:47:45.910]
and criticize the majority of these illegal and undemocratic activities.

[02:47:46.690 --> 02:47:50.470]
Thanks to Bell's complaint and crews' persistence Americans now have in their hands a vivid

[02:47:50.470 --> 02:47:54.370]
picture of corruption and ethical rule-breaking that belies the notion that this administration

[02:47:54.370 --> 02:47:58.190]
and its Republican congressional allies do anything more than simply pay lip service

[02:47:58.190 --> 02:48:00.850]
to upholding ethics and morality in the seats of federal power.

[02:48:01.270 --> 02:48:05.470]
For starters, the Democratic District Attorney in Travis County, Texas, has convened a

[02:48:05.470 --> 02:48:09.630]
grand jury to investigate charges that the hammer uses political action committee to hammer.

[02:48:11.390 --> 02:48:15.050]
Texans for a Republican majority to raise millions in corporate campaign contributions

[02:48:15.050 --> 02:48:18.830]
and that's been some of this money on polling, fundraising and get out to vote activities

[02:48:18.830 --> 02:48:22.690]
and violation of Texas law which says that corporate contributions can be used only

[02:48:22.690 --> 02:48:24.270]
for general administrative purposes.

[02:48:25.050 --> 02:48:28.950]
Delay is also charged of Bell's complaint with extracting campaign contributions from

[02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:31.170]
electric utility in Kansas called Westar Energy.

[02:48:31.610 --> 02:48:34.990]
Delay its alleged degree to insert provisions into an energy bill that would save Westar

[02:48:34.990 --> 02:48:39.010]
billions of dollars, one email that is subsequently come to late reveals that Westar's executive

[02:48:39.010 --> 02:48:42.210]
stuff that they were buying a seat at the table when they donated money to groups with

[02:48:42.210 --> 02:48:43.230]
links to the majority later.

[02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:47.410]
Then there's Delay's role in corralling votes on behalf of the GOP's sham Medicare prescription

[02:48:47.410 --> 02:48:51.050]
drug legislation, a legislative low point that occurred in the long night of Republican

[02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:52.250]
armed twisting last November.

[02:48:52.730 --> 02:48:56.510]
According to the AP representative Nick Smith, Republican for Michigan said that unnamed

[02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:59.630]
House Republican leaders threatened to work against Smith's son who was running for

[02:48:59.630 --> 02:49:01.110]
next seat unless Smith voted for legislation.

[02:49:01.310 --> 02:49:01.590]
Remember that?

[02:49:02.290 --> 02:49:02.510]
Yep.

[02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:03.470]
We had that story.

[02:49:03.630 --> 02:49:04.930]
Robert Novak reported in his comment.

[02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:09.590]
Smith was also told that business interest would give his son $100,000 in return for

[02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:10.330]
his father's vote.

[02:49:10.810 --> 02:49:14.110]
While Smith later we candid these allegations that charges have the ring of truth and

[02:49:14.170 --> 02:49:18.110]
the ring keeping with Delay's thuggish tactics of forcing even his own Republican colleagues

[02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:21.510]
to submit to the Republican leadership's will on closely fought legislative matters.

[02:49:22.030 --> 02:49:26.010]
Delay's brazen attacks on Democratic governance, a tangled web of truly scandalous behavior,

[02:49:26.430 --> 02:49:30.370]
are so outrageous that even conservative Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel has a sale of the Republican

[02:49:30.370 --> 02:49:32.750]
leadership for fermenting anything goes atmospheric.

[02:49:33.290 --> 02:49:35.910]
I think we're on the edge of something dangerous if we don't turn it around.

[02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:36.830]
It's like the Middle East.

[02:49:37.290 --> 02:49:39.470]
You just keep veraxiating up the intensity of the conflict.

[02:49:40.090 --> 02:49:43.390]
Real conservatives like Hagel believe that they should take responsibility for their actions.

[02:49:43.390 --> 02:49:47.090]
These conservatives actually value the rule of law and they understand that the ends don't

[02:49:47.090 --> 02:49:50.790]
always justify the means in pursuit of a radical right wing ideology that serves corporate

[02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:52.110]
special interest above all.

[02:49:52.470 --> 02:49:54.430]
Tom Delay has never understood these things.

[02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:58.930]
He's committed a note, take no prisoners agenda and seize ethics morality and rules as

[02:49:58.930 --> 02:49:59.170]
nuisance.

[02:49:59.170 --> 02:50:01.090]
These that must be flouted to stain and ignored.

[02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:04.910]
Delay has racked up a record that demands investigation and action in the ethics committee

[02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:05.710]
in the courts of law.

[02:50:05.910 --> 02:50:09.970]
His scourlessness needs demonstrate the yawning gap between a former president's private

[02:50:09.970 --> 02:50:13.050]
indiscretions and delays dangerous violations of the public trust rates.

[02:50:13.430 --> 02:50:17.130]
A Catherine Katrina van der Hovelin nation and speaking of the different set of standards

[02:50:17.130 --> 02:50:17.570]
we got.

[02:50:18.050 --> 02:50:21.910]
When Clinton went ballistic, they're on a BBC interview and told it like it was in the

[02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:22.890]
veins we're popping out of his neck.

[02:50:23.130 --> 02:50:27.310]
Remember all the the pundits on there or the president, the former president lost it and

[02:50:27.310 --> 02:50:27.950]
he lost his cool.

[02:50:28.210 --> 02:50:31.750]
In the meantime, here we had the interview that we saw a few clips of once on Irish TV

[02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:32.670]
with Bubba.

[02:50:33.370 --> 02:50:38.070]
I mean, with W. Gramps with Bubba with W. Just foaming at them out, interrupting and getting

[02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:39.930]
all impatient and just going ballistic.

[02:50:40.450 --> 02:50:40.450]

[02:50:41.050 --> 02:50:41.910]
Let me answer.

[02:50:42.130 --> 02:50:42.890]
You ask me a question.

[02:50:43.010 --> 02:50:43.490]
Let me answer it.

[02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:44.850]
Probably won't see much of that in normal.

[02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:46.850]
Five and a look all this.

[02:50:47.150 --> 02:50:48.230]
Six is five sixty.

[02:50:48.610 --> 02:50:49.710]
Three is all yours.

[02:50:50.090 --> 02:50:50.130]
Hello.

[02:50:51.050 --> 02:50:51.930]
You win.

[02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:56.270]
Friday you bastard.

[02:50:56.730 --> 02:51:00.650]
One forty six and five sixty W. We got the mad dog from a rake of it.

[02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:03.510]
Iceland coming up at two from that golf tournament, whatever the hell that thing is.

[02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:05.670]
And we got the hopper at four the hammer.

[02:51:08.130 --> 02:51:09.330]
That was funny.

[02:51:09.490 --> 02:51:12.750]
And then we got Marlon's baseball Marlon's index six forty seven fifteen Marlon's at

[02:51:12.750 --> 02:51:13.190]
Tampa Bay.

[02:51:13.450 --> 02:51:15.530]
So if so boos do in the game, right?

[02:51:16.310 --> 02:51:16.490]
Yeah.

[02:51:17.530 --> 02:51:18.230]
With solo.

[02:51:18.810 --> 02:51:21.030]
No, no, with Bill Buckner, boomer, you know.

[02:51:21.770 --> 02:51:24.890]
With Bill Buckner, is he going to let the microphone slide through his legs?

[02:51:27.890 --> 02:51:29.010]
You have to be kidding me.

[02:51:29.070 --> 02:51:30.770]
What's Bill Buckner about to do with the Marlon's?

[02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:33.630]
I don't know.

[02:51:34.730 --> 02:51:35.970]
Where did he come from?

[02:51:36.130 --> 02:51:37.290]
I mean, we're all of a sudden out of nowhere.

[02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:39.550]
Bill Buckner is doing when Van Boer.

[02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:41.390]
At least he'll be more exciting than Dave Van Boer.

[02:51:41.490 --> 02:51:42.250]
Anywhere I'll tell you that.

[02:51:42.690 --> 02:51:43.850]
Anyway, the boos do whom we love.

[02:51:43.990 --> 02:51:47.190]
You Marlon fans out there can listen to the night's game and see the contrast when

[02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:49.050]
Boog does the game between that coma and Susan guy.

[02:51:49.970 --> 02:51:53.070]
Paul Krugman writes, speaking of wasn't he just in that Katrina Van and who will article

[02:51:53.070 --> 02:51:55.090]
I write, she made reference to Paul Krugman, yes, she did.

[02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:58.250]
His column today errs on terror.

[02:51:59.070 --> 02:52:01.750]
And did you hear that we almost got all the curry to guy who had his legs

[02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:02.770]
chopped off and is dead already?

[02:52:02.930 --> 02:52:03.610]
We almost got him again.

[02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:06.390]
This is almost like chemical comical Ali all over again.

[02:52:06.750 --> 02:52:08.150]
How many times did we kill him?

[02:52:08.210 --> 02:52:09.070]
About third man.

[02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:13.830]
Tonight I'm instructing leaders of the FBI, the CIA, the Homeland Security and the

[02:52:13.830 --> 02:52:17.330]
Department of Defense to develop a terrorist threat integration center to merge and

[02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:19.470]
analyze all threat information in a single location.

[02:52:19.950 --> 02:52:22.190]
Our government must have the very best information possible.

[02:52:22.850 --> 02:52:27.450]
Plus, book president Bush in the 2003 State of the Union addressed a White House fact

[02:52:27.450 --> 02:52:30.630]
she called the center the next phase in the dramatic enhancement of the government's

[02:52:30.630 --> 02:52:31.550]
counter terrorism effort.

[02:52:32.250 --> 02:52:35.530]
Among other things, the center took over the job of preparing the government's annual

[02:52:35.530 --> 02:52:37.290]
report on patterns of global terrorism.

[02:52:37.730 --> 02:52:41.430]
The latest report released in April claimed to document a sharp fall in terrorism.

[02:52:41.890 --> 02:52:44.750]
You will find in these pages, through evidence that we're prevailing in the fight.

[02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:48.730]
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armoredidge declared, but this week the government admitted

[02:52:48.730 --> 02:52:49.930]
making major errors.

[02:52:49.930 --> 02:52:54.470]
In fact, in 2003, the number of significant terrorist attacks reached a 20 year peak.

[02:52:54.970 --> 02:52:56.410]
How could they get it so wrong?

[02:52:56.970 --> 02:52:59.910]
The answer tells you a lot about the state of the so-called war on terror.

[02:53:00.610 --> 02:53:04.610]
Credit for uncovering the report's errors goes to Alan Kruger, a Princeton economist

[02:53:04.610 --> 02:53:08.390]
and David Layton, a Stanford political scientist who were studying patterns of terrorism.

[02:53:08.930 --> 02:53:11.970]
Mr. Kruger tells me that as soon as they looked at the latest report, they knew something

[02:53:11.970 --> 02:53:12.470]
was wrong.

[02:53:13.370 --> 02:53:16.730]
All of these supposed to decline in terrorism they quickly saw resulted from a fall in

[02:53:16.730 --> 02:53:20.090]
the number of non-significant events, which Mr. Kruger and Mr. Layton say are counter

[02:53:20.090 --> 02:53:21.270]
with a squishy definition.

[02:53:21.910 --> 02:53:26.310]
Even the original report showed significant attacks a much less squishy category rising

[02:53:26.310 --> 02:53:27.410]
to a 20 year high.

[02:53:27.950 --> 02:53:31.390]
And the list of significant attacks ended in November 11, 2003, but there were several

[02:53:31.390 --> 02:53:33.750]
major terrorist incidents after that date.

[02:53:34.050 --> 02:53:37.830]
Sure enough, including these, another omitted attacks more than double the estimate of the

[02:53:37.830 --> 02:53:39.070]
2003 death toll.

[02:53:39.550 --> 02:53:41.950]
Was the report squishy-matth politically motivated?

[02:53:42.430 --> 02:53:45.570]
Well, the Bush administration has cooked a book in many areas including budget projections,

[02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:48.430]
tax policy, environmental policy, and stem cell research.

[02:53:48.690 --> 02:53:50.090]
Why wouldn't it do the same on terrorism?

[02:53:50.970 --> 02:53:54.410]
The erroneous good news on terrorism also came at a very convenient moment.

[02:53:54.770 --> 02:53:57.890]
The White House was still reeling from her relations with the former counter-terrorism

[02:53:57.890 --> 02:54:01.650]
chief Richard Clark, who finally gave public voice to the view of many intelligence insiders

[02:54:01.650 --> 02:54:04.790]
that the Bush administration is doing a terrible job of fighting al-Qaeda.

[02:54:05.330 --> 02:54:09.010]
Meanwhile, Mr. Bush was on a winning the war on terror campaign bus tour in the Midwest.

[02:54:09.850 --> 02:54:13.970]
Mr. Kruger, a forgiving soul, believes that the report was bought through simple incompetence.

[02:54:14.330 --> 02:54:17.730]
Maybe, though, can we be sure that if the statistics had told the administration something

[02:54:17.730 --> 02:54:19.810]
it didn't want to hear, they would have been carefully checked.

[02:54:20.270 --> 02:54:23.750]
By the way, while the report tables and charts have been fixed, the revised summary still

[02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:25.630]
gives little hint of how bad the data really are.

[02:54:26.090 --> 02:54:28.770]
In any case, the incompetence explanation is hardly comforting.

[02:54:29.290 --> 02:54:32.810]
In a press conference announcing the release of the revised report, the counter-terrorism

[02:54:32.810 --> 02:54:37.130]
coordinator, Kofur Black, attributed to the eras to, in attention, personnel shortages,

[02:54:37.590 --> 02:54:39.570]
and a database that is awkward and antiquated.

[02:54:40.210 --> 02:54:43.670]
Remember, we're talking about the government's central clearinghouse for terrorism information,

[02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:47.630]
whose creation was touted as part of a dramatic enhancement of counter-terrorism efforts

[02:54:47.630 --> 02:54:49.230]
more than a year before this report was produced.

[02:54:49.810 --> 02:54:52.030]
And it still came in put data of its own into computers.

[02:54:52.770 --> 02:54:56.310]
It should be no surprise in the stage of Halliburton that the job of data input was given

[02:54:56.310 --> 02:54:58.650]
through and botched by private contractors.

[02:54:59.870 --> 02:55:03.270]
Think of it as just one more indication that Mr. Bush isn't really serious about this

[02:55:03.270 --> 02:55:03.950]
terrorism thing.

[02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:07.690]
He talks about terror a lot and boasts it to justify unrelated wars he feels like fighting.

[02:55:08.010 --> 02:55:11.170]
But when it comes to devoting resources to the unglamorous worker protecting the nation

[02:55:11.170 --> 02:55:12.850]
from attack, well, never mind.

[02:55:14.430 --> 02:55:16.750]
So, right, Paul Krutman, today's New York Times.

[02:55:17.890 --> 02:55:21.410]
See, I read these articles because I know that the overwhelming majority are too lazy

[02:55:21.410 --> 02:55:23.510]
to, they're certainly not going to read the New York Times online.

[02:55:23.810 --> 02:55:26.450]
And they're certainly not going to most of them read the stories out of the bedtime stories

[02:55:26.450 --> 02:55:27.070]
on our website.

[02:55:27.990 --> 02:55:33.550]
So maybe, you know, just once in a while, although I have my doubts after talking to that

[02:55:33.550 --> 02:55:37.110]
one guy, who announced that it's breathlessly that he went and saw along with 400 other

[02:55:37.110 --> 02:55:40.830]
people, the preview last night, a fair night, 4-11.

[02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:43.490]
And I wasn't going to see that got me standing up there.

[02:55:43.710 --> 02:55:47.570]
And I'm like, and he still asked him, well, you know, how come was wrong for us to go in

[02:55:47.570 --> 02:55:48.190]
in the first place?

[02:55:48.190 --> 02:55:50.170]
He thought, you know, we had to do something.

[02:55:50.370 --> 02:55:50.730]
Right.

[02:55:51.550 --> 02:55:52.910]
We could have attacked Canada.

[02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.950]
They had as much to do.

[02:55:53.950 --> 02:55:59.190]
Just like Richard Clark said, in fact, what's his name from Georgia Max Cleveland, who's

[02:55:59.190 --> 02:56:01.670]
honest as stupid as phony debate on CNN right now.

[02:56:01.890 --> 02:56:03.470]
He quoted him before just a few minutes ago.

[02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:04.470]
That's exactly right.

[02:56:04.810 --> 02:56:09.530]
He said Bush going and attacking Iraq after 9-11 was like us attacking Mexico after Pearl

[02:56:09.530 --> 02:56:09.830]
Harbor.

[02:56:12.670 --> 02:56:16.170]
We're sports radio five six, you AM.

[02:56:17.690 --> 02:56:23.030]
I stand in front of you now two years later and say it took me a little while, a little

[02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:26.390]
slow learner, but Neil, I apologize.

[02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:28.190]
It's way, Neil.

[02:56:28.430 --> 02:56:29.470]
You are the truth.

[02:56:31.310 --> 02:56:32.230]
All right.

[02:56:34.130 --> 02:56:35.350]
What a guy, huh?

[02:56:36.370 --> 02:56:38.890]
He's proud of playing me a part.

[02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:42.270]
The house of Bush and his primitled idiot.

[02:56:43.310 --> 02:56:49.190]
He took the poor four-rounding and won the wig stats on the commando yet.

[02:56:49.430 --> 02:56:51.890]
With all the uberism, edge and moody.

[02:56:52.390 --> 02:56:55.110]
There goes another benthic on crony pony.

[02:56:55.590 --> 02:56:58.350]
I can't laugh, he has gone away.

[02:56:58.930 --> 02:57:00.730]
No longer working for the sea.

[02:57:00.730 --> 02:57:05.910]
I hate and bush and looking for everyone else.

[02:57:06.230 --> 02:57:09.630]
I hate and play.

[02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:14.130]
Abu Gaurav, Labour.

[02:57:15.170 --> 02:57:17.770]
So your completion is going bad.

[02:57:18.070 --> 02:57:20.910]
Like the tibes should say and that he has a fly.

[02:57:21.330 --> 02:57:24.170]
But his group is ripped on the tower grabbed.

[02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:27.610]
With the killing rapin' told you going on in Iraq.

[02:57:27.610 --> 02:57:31.050]
And his bank robbing buddy till his secret to Iran.

[02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:35.750]
He made good money.

[02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:39.930]
300, 40 grand amounts.

[02:57:40.350 --> 02:57:42.730]
Another legative story.

[02:57:43.410 --> 02:57:46.410]
For the corporate media to hush.

[02:57:46.670 --> 02:57:49.210]
Who's the neoconspeak that kid is?

[02:57:49.870 --> 02:57:52.410]
That's a risky blame this song, vintage.

[02:57:52.790 --> 02:57:55.430]
I can't laugh, he has gone away.

[02:57:55.430 --> 02:57:57.870]
No longer working for the sea.

[02:57:58.190 --> 02:58:02.430]
I hate and bush and looking for everyone else.

[02:58:03.450 --> 02:58:06.150]
That kid can play.

[02:58:07.450 --> 02:58:09.610]
Look for everyone else.

[02:58:09.930 --> 02:58:12.770]
That kid can play.

[02:58:14.370 --> 02:58:16.650]
What a ho ho ho ho.

[02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:20.810]
You know how fast that story disappeared?

[02:58:21.030 --> 02:58:23.010]
Ahmed Chalabi are giving our secrets to Iran.

[02:58:23.850 --> 02:58:25.490]
We don't want to hear about him, no, Maul.

[02:58:25.770 --> 02:58:27.270]
But he was our al-Qa'ai.

[02:58:27.350 --> 02:58:28.490]
Forget about it.

[02:58:29.710 --> 02:58:31.230]
Don't forget Fahrenheit 9.11.

[02:58:31.370 --> 02:58:31.950]
Today is the opening.

[02:58:32.250 --> 02:58:33.610]
We have several days.
