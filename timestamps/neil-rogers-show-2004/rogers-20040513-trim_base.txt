[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.280]
That's your special Joe.

[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.880]
Such a Joe.

[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.840]
Visible bitches.

[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.560]
Not you Joe.

[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.460]
I'm here to say when Joe walks into the room and mows

[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.260]
leaving in the morning to drop some of them.

[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.260]
When a bombah is on day.

[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.640]
It puts the large in the basket.

[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.780]
What's that?

[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.200]
Oh, anders, focus me, woman or a man.

[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780]
Now that the bombah probably comes in,

[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.400]
you reclaim the fortune.

[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.600]
I put things up on the ground.

[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.740]
If the better way to remain, torture is there.

[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560]
I'm carrying Iraq because we hate them.

[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.420]
For something that we know they did not do.

[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.280]
Push up our advanced occupation.

[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.560]
Now we're all screwed.

[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.140]
Anders, focus me, let's have freedom, bring.

[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.700]
And pile up your life bar wire to their names.

[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.720]
In those they get in vain.

[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.900]
Stack them in a pile.

[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.220]
There's a code that opens to say Jesus, smile.

[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.900]
We'll burn free in all that's great, but far it's hers.

[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.760]
In risk there's no atrocities for us.

[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.220]
Push up like well first you only follow orders.

[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.360]
Move with wings, be cold.

[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.420]
Acher is coming to me, now make that full die.

[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.320]
Like this hurt like rubber on a modern age.

[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.980]
I hate this place, nothing works here.

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.960]
The medications don't work.

[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.020]
I've been here for seven years.

[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.820]
Nothing works here.

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.400]
I hate this place.

[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.320]
Nothing works here.

[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.360]
The medications don't work.

[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.360]
I've been here for seven years.

[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.100]
I hate this place.

[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.080]
Nothing works here.

[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.340]
Happy Thursday to you.

[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.120]
1003 at 560 WQM, the home of technical insanity.

[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.000]
Now what was that again?

[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.060]
The death pot was open?

[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.000]
Yeah, it was just the way to get the audience as attention right there at the beginning of the show.

[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.060]
No, seriously why?

[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.720]
Why was it open?

[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.520]
The death pot was open and we started recording on that as we record on that.

[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.160]
Why?

[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.600]
Why?

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.780]
Why?

[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.600]
The melodia sounds of the people.

[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.260]
Why?

[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.200]
Why?

[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.980]
The worst part of it is that it actually went off.

[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.860]
I was sitting here thinking, oh this is going to be great.

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.560]
We're going to have the whole line dropped out and I can go back to bed for a couple of hours.

[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.600]
I can even skip out and avoid having lunch with the rumors today.

[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.400]
Oh god.

[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.000]
No.

[00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.540]
Oh brother.

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.260]
Anyway, let's get to the serious stuff.

[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.280]
Okay, we asked yesterday on our pool on neo-rangers.com.

[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.760]
This was our second pool of A.

[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.320]
After our first pool, there's Ramesfeld as in Iraq.

[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.220]
No, it's Harry Potter.

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.960]
Oh brother.

[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.260]
Now he doesn't want anybody to think he's just trying to put out some water on those fires and put out all this hysteria.

[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.120]
Or that this is some kind of a PR campaign or a dog in a pony show.

[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.500]
Nobody believes that, do they?

[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.740]
No.

[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.060]
Good.

[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.680]
Because that would only a real cynic would believe crap like that.

[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.920]
Now what is this best of Miami?

[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.840]
Yeah, the best of issues out.

[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.000]
In what city link?

[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.820]
What are the times?

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.260]
Well, what is this from?

[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.760]
That would be a real hell.

[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.000]
Which one of these rags it's from?

[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.120]
New times.

[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.820]
Best sportscaster, Bukshambi.

[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.040]
All right, let's hear it.

[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.620]
All right.

[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.320]
The Tom Hanks megahead movie big connected with audiences thanks to the actors on Kenley Gailess portrayal of youthful joy.

[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.580]
Listening to Bukshambi broadcast Florida Marlins games on WQMAM including the teams unlikely ascent away World Series Championship this past season.

[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.740]
They won by the way last night.

[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.240]
Brought that same feeling to mind.

[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.400]
Shambi an old school announcer with an eager to please voice.

[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.260]
Yeah, he's really eager to please.

[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.680]
Sounded so damn glad to be there.

[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.740]
It was impossible not to be infected with this enthusiasm.

[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.300]
How do you like that?

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.380]
A lot.

[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.860]
The opportunity for Shambi to broadcast high profile games must have been a big chance for career enhancement.

[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.440]
But what made him list what made listening to him such a joy with an underneath the announcer you can hear the kid whose dreams were coming true.

[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.660]
They like to rely.

[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.340]
New times.

[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.780]
They've directed a lesson about.

[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.840]
About his partner Dave Van Boring and how terminal he is and how grateful we are when Bukhambzon and we hear his voice as opposed to Dave.

[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.640]
Chroma inducing Van Boring even Joshua Taita that he could have even have to work with him.

[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.920]
What?

[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.040]
Reader's Choice with Jimmy Cifilis.

[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.100]
Jimmy Cifilis best sportscaster.

[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.180]
Well, what does that mean Jimmy Cifilis on Channel 10?

[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.260]
What games does he broadcast?

[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.900]
Best TV news anchor.

[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.520]
Oh, see that you can see the way this whole thing is a condom.

[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.380]
Of course, as if.

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.980]
Cross-eyed Christie Kruger.

[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.620]
He spells cross-eyed with a case.

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.940]
So it's like a triple K-range.

[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:28.340]
Filling the oxfords of late local broadcast legend and bishop of WPLGT was a challenge accepted by Christie Kruger who has proved herself up to the job at 5, 6, and 11.

[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:38.720]
Maybe her 11 year tenure as health reporter helped her become sufficiently in inured to calmly deal with my knees, demoralizing daily news cycle which brims with shootings, child of E.C. Adi Adi Adi.

[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.600]
How do you like that?

[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.940]
I can't read what it says in the bottom of this because you chopped it off.

[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.960]
It's trying to send it in chunks.

[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.300]
We got a ton of scientists trying to parcel it off.

[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.740]
What does it say at the bottom? Who is the readers to it?

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.240]
They're all in the facts machine.

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.940]
What does that mean?

[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.580]
They're all spewing out here. Here we go.

[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.740]
I don't know. I don't know where I left off. They're all mixed up.

[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.520]
Best TV news anchor. It's right under the booster there.

[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.060]
Christie Kruger. That's their pick now.

[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.500]

[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.920]
Oh, that lorch.

[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.160]
Who?

[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.940]
Matt Lorch.

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.700]
Who the hell is that?

[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.120]
Ever watched the Adam's family? He's the butler.

[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.080]
Lorch? Yes.

[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.000]
You're right.

[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.800]
Best TV station.

[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.700]
You know, that's why New Times is such a pile.

[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.680]
Sudo and intellectual pile of duty, man.

[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.940]
Miami-Dade County Cable Television Access Project.

[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.620]
That's picked as the best TV station.

[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.380]
It says you won't find localized renditions of these sopranos the law and order on cable tap.

[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.780]
But you'll be inundated with half-hour vignettes about the people and organizations

[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.420]
that make this sub-tropical multi-ethnic frying pan their home.

[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.660]
A droning commissioner may be a cultural lightweight for sure, maybe even a Wayne's World Level ego-fest.

[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.660]
And it goes on, oh my God.

[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.060]
Haitian Forum.

[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.860]
Paso's a la libertad.

[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.700]
Parastitodne Puerto Rico.

[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.100]
Ways of Israel.

[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.100]
Oye, vay.

[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.760]
It says, wow, a TV station that literally can save your ass.

[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.280]
Readers' Choice was Channel 7, which says a lot about South Florida, doesn't it?

[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.180]
Absolutely.

[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.960]
Correct.

[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.940]
Channel 7.

[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.740]
Okay, well let me just put this stuff aside.

[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.520]
Here's my pomp and a park copy.

[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.740]
Nice go and draw you idiot.

[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.560]
Did I mention that our sales department are like functionally challenged today?

[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.720]
Hope they all enjoy that big party tonight.

[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.900]
They're having a ratings party tonight.

[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.340]
Folks, I can't tell you where because then a lot of you know lives will crash the party.

[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.940]
I have no life.

[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.320]
But they're having a ratings party celebrate what a great job they did.

[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.360]
The sales department.

[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.580]
All the other people had sit around and pick it in those all day.

[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.700]
Eat in the free food, coming in and steaming our free sodas and whatever else we got laying around.

[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.180]
Okay, let's just do the poll result yesterday first.

[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.960]
Which of these best describes why you listen to the neo-roggio show?

[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.560]
Neal tells it like it is that was a late edition and it zoomed by everybody else.

[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.480]
733 people wanted to kiss me right in the end.

[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:54.900]
Correct them.

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.120]
733.

[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.560]
For a few laughs, 576.

[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.880]
To hear the stories neo-raids, 172 just 9.8%.

[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.620]
That's not really a good omen, you know what?

[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.780]
That's not a good sign.

[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.760]
Less than 10% tuned in to hear those very important bedtime stories.

[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.620]
But you know what, too bad.

[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.960]
It kills four hours of my boring life.

[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.700]
I have no life.

[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.300]
133 people honest enough to say that and we can relate.

[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.100]
At least when you're in Florida.

[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.540]
To hear the crazy and crank calls, 65, only 3.7%.

[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.140]
That desperate.

[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.860]
I hate neo but I can't turn it off 46.

[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.060]
And to hear the callers opinions, only 18.1%.

[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:39.240]
I don't want to say that most of the audience out there doesn't give a frying crap or a flying monitor.

[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.200]
Oh, nothing like frying crap.

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.920]
They don't just don't care about your opinions.

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.580]
And of course, that may have something to do with the quality of the calls over the year, but nevertheless.

[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.260]
Okay, so that's yesterday's poll.

[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.060]
We got Gabrielle Reese.

[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.740]
She's a beach volleyball player in the model.

[00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.520]
She is.

[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.000]
Well, I kind of looked there.

[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.180]
I didn't really look too hard for a biographer because when I realized that she was a volleyball player, I figured, well, why does it really make any difference?

[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.180]
She's a cross trainer.

[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.720]
She's on our behind-the-beaten curtain today.

[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.780]
If you're over the age of 75, you got both grandparents around to say, okay, son, you can take a quick look, then take a look real fast.

[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:32.580]
And by the way, just breaks our heart that we find out that there are people, especially punks, really desperate punks who couldn't get laid in the red light district in Amsterdam, who are looking at those pictures and not looking at the rest of our prestigious website, like that spit call we had yesterday,

[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.860]
that little child that overgrown infant.

[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.900]
Could you be more specific?

[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:36.620]
Yeah.

[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:37.900]
Any of many.

[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:45.940]
This local sports tournament, the NASDAQ 100, this local sports tournament, oh, man, you talk about desperate for categories.

[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.460]
Hurley, mowley, the NASDAQ 100.

[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.740]
Here's today's poll question.

[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.180]
And I think it's a perfect day for it too.

[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.800]
Although, let me see what else they got in here.

[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.380]
Readers, oh, I see.

[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.820]
Your faction is all out of what?

[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.880]
Because you know how it is.

[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.400]
It's wide.

[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.140]
It's long and wide.

[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.600]
And we're trying to get it broken down into factable chunks.

[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.560]
Readers choice.

[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.420]
Howard Stern.

[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.640]
Best AM.

[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.360]
Oh, here you go.

[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:16.900]
Yes.

[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.920]
Best AM radio.

[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.420]
I guess that was best FM.

[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.200]
And I can't figure out who it is that they picked because the first part of that didn't show up yet.

[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.620]
It's there.

[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.860]
Best AM radio personality.

[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.300]
This is, this has got to be a comedy.

[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.500]
It must be because nobody's ever heard of this person.

[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.960]
Because anybody is just, how many people watch that local access TV station if they're raven about it?

[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:39.580]
Third, man.

[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.320]
See, this is part of the pseudo intellectual approach of new times.

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.800]
Best AM radio personality.

[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.740]
Jacqueline Hazel, the forgiveness forecast on WMBM 1490 AM.

[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:58.400]
Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoon, after you've finished a full day of terrorizing everyone in your office or shop, you don't have to hate yourself.

[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.600]
Sure, you've made your secretary's job living.

[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.940]
How you've termited your codependent girlfriend.

[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.520]
You've statistically tortured your wife.

[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.060]
Radio host Jacqueline Hazel has a place in her heart for you.

[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.420]
Interacted in broadcast, he forgave this forecast.

[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.920]
Hazel touts the power of saying, sorry, sorry, mister.

[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.940]
Listen to Hazel on your drive home and you'll feel redeemed and ready to face that deep dark truthful mirror about your bathroom sink.

[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.720]
You regain the strength to continue the next day doing the awful things you do and then apologize for.

[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.500]
I apologize.

[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.460]
Nice way to beat this system, Hazel.

[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.180]
Well, seriously, it's like the fallacies do whatever you want.

[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.100]
Just make sure you get yourself absolved and what better way to make amends than to apologize.

[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.400]
After you've finished listening to this, upload things show.

[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.680]
Readers choice, Neil Rogers, do the Q&A.

[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:39.380]
Of course.

[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.360]
How do you like that?

[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.880]
What do you mean, of course?

[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:43.900]
They always pick you.

[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.460]
Yeah, what haven't they?

[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.280]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.460]
Well, once every 10 years, new times, they'll pick me just to...

[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.960]
Yeah, the old man still got it, boy.

[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.820]
Well, that was CityLink, though.

[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.980]
Wasn't it that glowing ass-look?

[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.900]
I do think about what would this town be without the Neil Rogers show and where will we be and what will we do in any Audi Audi on it?

[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.600]
New times, of course.

[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.000]
Isn't the hero published that?

[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.060]
Yes.

[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.580]
So they're much less likely to say anything positive about me.

[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.640]
By the way, Howard Cohn, you're still a, a class hole, okay?

[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.080]
You idiot.

[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.760]
Big 106 doesn't suffer from loss of shock shock.

[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.220]
Right.

[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:20.820]
Right.

[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.060]
And Tom Jekyll still hasn't written anything about it.

[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.740]
See, in a real market, where there was real competition and real writers, they'd be ripping the herald and ask for that.

[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.060]
Because they really rip each other the competition.

[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.520]
Saying, man, oh man, did they make a bonehead mistake?

[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:34.920]
But not Tom.

[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.060]
He's too busy telling us about Fraser in the last episode again.

[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.760]
How many times has he written about this?

[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.740]
Stop kidding, man!

[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.800]
Yeah, by the way, Troy already got the copy, okay?

[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.320]
I want copy was enough, please.

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.060]

[00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.350]
Let's face it, we've been talking about fast rain for a coons age on this program now.

[00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.550]

It's really that easy.

[00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.530]

American Girls

In American Gods who only listen to the message from the Uber Brot will have their tables hogged line.

[00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:31.130]
As the troops come home dead, they find the comfort of the night, hiding under the bed.

[00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.230]
I never served in armament, I'm too afraid to fight.

[00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:42.910]
So I sit right here near the DB far from liberalized under the covers you'll discover.

[00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:49.470]
Tomah thinks this year, they would prefer to have some mother do the fighting for play.

[00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:58.390]
Now this country I love is occupying Iraq and all the suckers like me, whose nicks are bred in the back.

[00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.170]
Have our tongues all placed firmly in bushes big ground.

[00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.330]
I, the big mouth cowards of the world who gladly follow.

[00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:19.450]
Hey, you'll go sand up to a braid, keep firing lists, but you can count on me to watch TV and shake my fist and my flag will fly.

[00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:25.270]
From the back of my truck, knocking at idiotic pseudo patriotic.

[00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:31.990]
And my view of the old ride world is what I see on Fox News.

[00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:40.410]
Yeah, I'm an armchair warrior, who knows better than you.

[00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.270]
I'm an inbred jerk, who parrots anything they say.

[00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:11.910]
Don't have to read or research it's so much easier this way to watch TV or looking pictures.

[00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:23.970]
You wish a today with my I need to stop what I think as I tickle my brain to not go sand up to a braid.

[00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:33.930]
You battle your list, but you can count on me to watch TV and shake my fist as I know my flag so I can pull on my.

[00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.230]
As long as I do proudly show the swathe the cuts I've killed on my.

[00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.830]
That's not right.

[00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:44.310]
The Saudis are our best friends in the world, not those I rackish or choose.

[00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:52.850]
Oi, yeah, I'm an armchair warrior, who knows better than you.

[00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.150]
I'm a bastard, I'm a bastard, I'm a bitch.

[00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.550]
I'm a bastard, I'm a bitch, I'm a bastard, I'm a bitch.

[00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:06.750]
Oh, wow, all the Nazis all the time, 10, 20 at 5, 60 WQM, here's our poll today.

[00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:07.890]
What's your number one complaint?

[00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.390]
And we got list of five to start, we already got some votes on there.

[00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.430]
In fact, let's take a peek and see what it is so far.

[00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.290]
What's your number one complaint? Bush is destroying America 35.

[00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.790]
My wife isn't bisexual, that was Georgia's choice, seven.

[00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.810]
I'm not getting enough sex, six, six, sex.

[00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:30.810]
I was saying as a cow and can't lose weight, that was my choice, six.

[00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:36.690]
And my boss is a pull, one, I'm the first 66 votes.

[00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.330]
My boss is a pull.

[00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:43.830]
Just odd on me and plan a bit that we can still say brown eye, oh thank the Lord for that.

[00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.290]
Otherwise we couldn't play that Van Morrison song, right?

[00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.630]
This thank you for faxing this depressing piece of news whoever sent this in.

[00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.250]
It says, won't this bitch ever go away and the answer is no.

[00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.790]
Miriam elephant is expected when I was plans today she's seeking re-election as

[00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.350]
Bowered County's election supervisor during a rally against her suspension last year by Governor

[00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.030]
Jeb Bush.

[00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.190]
Protest organizers said yesterday they Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Justice

[00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.970]
for all in Broward, a group of local black ministers will rally today at the governmental

[00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.490]
center of downtown Fort Lauderdale.

[00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.010]
Maybe they're doing it right now as part of their campaign to persuade the US Civil Rights

[00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.010]
Commission to investigate Bush's actions.

[00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:25.330]
Bush's suspended elephant without pay over accusations that she was incompetent and

[00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.690]
had mismanaged the election's office.

[00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.070]
Very few things I could agree with Jeb Bush about but when it comes to Miriam elephant,

[00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.310]
she is incompetent as absolutely correct as they come.

[00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.490]
But nevertheless she just refuses to go away.

[00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.670]
She want that job now.

[00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.090]
Maybe she can get her sister out there too, Marchin.

[00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.790]
Oh yeah, she's a pit.

[00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:48.230]
Now, going back to this best FM personality, I don't know who it is but I guess the back of

[00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.470]
boys, I don't know what they're on.

[00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.310]
Because it says, Hordes of Young Women showed up at the, because you chopped off the first

[00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.830]
part of this.

[00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.250]
Sorry.

[00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.190]
Hordes of Young Women showed up at the desegregation spot only received complimentary chicken

[00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.610]
breast injected with saline.

[00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.970]
Most morning shows are a poor man's version of Howard Stern, which the back of boys easily

[00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.590]
outshined as could have drawn parrot into mines.

[00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.850]
Already far beyond that in quality they do all are setting a new standard marking their

[00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.590]
own territory, probably to be copied soon by other morning shows.

[00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.930]
The readers chose Howard Stern, of course, no longer on the market.

[00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.930]
But the new times chose the back of boys.

[00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.870]
Do we have any idea what station they're on, who they are, what it's all about?

[00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.430]
N.I.B.

[00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.050]
Oh, the black of boys.

[00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:28.330]
Apparently.

[00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.290]
Maybe they left a, they'll come no blacker than the back of boys.

[00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.310]
Best Spanish language personality and Rique Santos in Joe Ferreto, El Sol.

[00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.550]
And it's too bad that we don't have the rest of this because you just, oh this is just so

[00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.050]
choppy.

[00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.550]
It's crappy.

[00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.610]
I got it choppy and that's how I fact it.

[00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:50.430]
It says actually make that personalities with their El Vasolo and de la maniana show

[00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.950]
and El Sol.

[00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.030]
These two get away with stuff Howard Stern types can only dream about.

[00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:59.370]
Maybe no one at the FCC speak Spanish despite the recent brujaha over in decency.

[00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.490]
Anybody who regularly listens to radio knows the real shocks.

[00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:06.130]
Jocks are celebrated on the seemingly unregulated Hispanic stations.

[00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:06.850]
How do you like that?

[00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.410]
I can't read the rest of it or figure out who the right, I don't have any.

[00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.070]
Oh, best trade.

[00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:22.190]
Oh, that's the best weathercaster Jackie Johnson doesn't say who the, uh, look, see that's the thing that they do about this.

[00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.190]
They, the reader's choice sometimes they put it on there.

[00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.010]
Sometimes they write.

[00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.230]
Maybe there isn't one.

[00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:27.790]
Jackie Johnson.

[00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.450]
Best radio station.

[00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.870]
W-P-Y-M-R-M-I-G-D.

[00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.450]
Are you, you, you, me, party radio?

[00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.410]
Oh, the party's over.

[00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.170]
That's my opinion.

[00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.070]
I'm like Disney.

[00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:39.550]
Party.

[00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:46.690]
Feverish world of dance music is populated by numerous and fluid subgenres from the chaffell of Superpature

[00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:51.290]
to the dark new beat of the lords of acid and each school has its fanatic acid tractors.

[00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.970]
True you may not hear Carlos D. Spind the deep forest remix of A Forest,

[00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.690]
unless you upass your lazy boy and head down to revolver.

[00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.650]
But for avoid, what?

[00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:07.630]
But for avoiding rush during rush hour, general car, uh, but car bumping or any crews you choose,

[00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.010]
perhaps must be given to W-P-Y-M colloquial known as party 93.1.

[00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:12.930]
The party's over.

[00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:13.710]
That's my opinion.

[00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:14.610]
I'm like Disney.

[00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.530]
The dance format cleared the dials of classical music with W-T-M-I-F-M till shortened.

[00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.930]
P-Y-M, uh, P-Y-M stirs stepped up.

[00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.090]
Oh, this is so.

[00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:30.010]
It says, uh, I remember, uh, a, a series of, uh, pluses any carbon-based unit

[00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.410]
who's living in the market lacking a dance music station will tell you,

[00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:37.030]
simply having these smoking hip-shakers of 90 to P-Y-M on the ear moves the cultural needle

[00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.710]
from the now of hip hop to the future of synthesizers.

[00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.570]
Even, well, you talk about pseudo-inluctual crab man.

[00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.230]
Reader's choice was Zeta.

[00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:46.450]
Oh, here it is.

[00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.390]
Here's the first part of that.

[00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.430]
The back of boys on W-M-I-B, the beat.

[00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.670]
Since if you're one of the few hundred thousand souls who lived through the daily purgatory of sitting in morning hour,

[00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.810]
or rush hour traffic, finding and entertaining distractions of priority on your FM dial,

[00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.590]
so forget the monotone chitchat provided by NPR and WLRN.

[00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.290]
Since the arrival of the beat last year, Mexican-American brothers Eric,

[00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.590]
and then there's more to it that's also not here, which I don't know how.

[00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:11.570]
Well, it's just ain't there.

[00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.170]
Tell me the other part.

[00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.430]
The back of boys, the blackout there, the backer, and the whatever.

[00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.310]
Maybe they chewed the backer.

[00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.750]
I don't know.

[00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.210]
So, okay, that's our poll question today.

[00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.230]
What's your number one complaint?

[00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.490]
Oh, wait, look at that.

[00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.230]
We got to do the break.

[00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.030]
I can't believe it.

[00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:25.890]
It's your fault.

[00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.270]
You got me bogged down first with the way we started with that loud feedback.

[00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.190]
I'll never do that again.

[00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.470]
Josh.

[00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.690]
And then number two with this damn new timescrap.

[00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:41.570]
Apparently, CityLink must have theirs out because I'm getting faxes from someone with other things that aren't from this.

[00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.250]
Really?

[00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.410]
Well, it's good.

[00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.170]
Bring them on, baby.

[00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.650]
All the faxes all the time.

[00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.210]
It'll kill some really good time here today.

[00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.630]
Twenty-six faxes tended five.

[00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.950]
Oh, listen, join QAmin to build yellow pages from Bell Sound today, new to one.

[00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.150]
And card tronics.

[00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.590]
139.81 saftix, Johanway.

[00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.650]
Stop by, pick up Marlon's Astros tickets and Keynes baseball tickets.

[00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.790]
New to one at card tronics in Miami.

[00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.350]
And join the big O.

[00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.470]
Today, four to six at the new Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood.

[00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.190]
Stop by the Spinnerville for prizes.

[00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.770]
And that's the new Seminole Hard Rock Casino where the big O will be there at four o'clock.

[00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.730]
Let me tell you right now about something big financial group.

[00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.190]
You know, you've heard us talk about financial group and they're incredible.

[00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.070]
Only one mortgage program.

[00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.570]
With an unbeatable one and a quarter percent rate for the purchase or refinancing of your home, one and a quarter percent.

[00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.970]
That's just $334 a month on a hundred thousand dollar loan.

[00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.710]
Six-sixth the eight a month on eight two hundred thousand dollar loan.

[00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.030]
Now they're advertising on TV.

[00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:36.210]
They're all over the radio.

[00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.890]
They're inside the Todd Rex Brain.

[00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.690]
This program's got everybody talking.

[00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.550]
Only one mortgage makes it possible and only the financial group makes it available.

[00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.190]
Refinance your current home.

[00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.370]
Give money for renovations.

[00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.890]
Move to another home and never ever pay fees or closing costs again.

[00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:56.350]
Zero closing costs, zero credit bureau fees, zero application fees, zero discounted points, zero everything.

[00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.150]
Just like Todd's IQ.

[00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:59.030]
This is for real.

[00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.590]
Just call financial group toll free.

[00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.310]
One eight six six three nine five lend to find out more.

[00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.170]
That's one eight six six three nine five LED.

[00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.690]
The only one mortgage.

[00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.590]
Trust me when I tell you it's the only mortgage you'll ever need.

[00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:17.810]
The Renekville Housing Lender, Credit Restrictions Apply, 4.25 APR, rates, subject to change monthly.

[00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.810]
This is for twenty-one five six.

[00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.370]
You way here.

[00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:32.810]
A mad dog is out of control and you'll find out why when you hear the latest release from Blackpuster Entertainment.

[00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.170]
Humanity sings duet.

[00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.010]
Run, I'll ride.

[00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.430]
Run the round in the breeze.

[00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.530]
Run the business.

[00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:43.810]
I'll ride.

[00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.930]
Here's a mad dog.

[00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:49.310]
Humanity sings classic raw.

[00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.190]
Run the business.

[00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.190]

[00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:54.930]
Here's a ride.

[00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.830]
I'll ride.

[00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.590]
I'll ride.

[00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.310]
Here's a ride.

[00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.890]
I'll ride.

[00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:07.110]
I'll ride.

[00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:07.170]

[00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.590]
I'll ride.

[00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:09.430]
I'll ride.

[00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:10.490]
I'll ride.

[00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.450]
I'll ride.

[00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.270]
I'll ride.

[00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.370]
I'll ride.

[00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.010]
I'll ride.

[00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.910]
I'll ride.

[00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:28.350]
I'll ride.

[00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.550]
I'll ride.

[00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:30.610]
I'll ride.

[00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.770]
At first Jim said he built a little bit of it's moves.

[00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:36.510]
I don't like that.

[00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.050]
You're making a heart.

[00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.750]
But now he says.

[00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.310]
I like it. I like it.

[00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.990]
The mad dog just can't piss it up with that cottage cheese bun.

[00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.610]
If he wants to sing God Bless the Mararchy and paste these in the G-string up here, I'll do it.

[00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:56.010]
You got food and everybody knows that it's alright.

[00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.750]
Alright! Listen to the mad dog sing them self-happy.

[00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:07.070]
Oh, friend! Oh, friend! Oh, friend! Oh, friend! Oh, friend! Oh, friend!

[00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:11.590]
Oh, demand it! Sing duet! Available now at all blocks us this story.

[00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:12.250]
Alright!

[00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.990]
By 7 before 11 a reason I played that is because this must be the city link, right?

[00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:17.510]
I can only assume.

[00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.070]
Best radio personality, they pick Jim Mandage, WDQAM. It says you don't so much listen to

[00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:27.930]
Jim Mandage, says you rubber neck him. He's a lot obnoxious full of himself, loudish,

[00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:31.710]
off and wrong, boar. In other words, he's perfect for that abrasive medium-called radio.

[00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.670]
What's more, Mandage is perfect for sports, especially since he's a former jock himself,

[00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.830]
having played several seasons as a mediocre Ted M for the Dolphins.

[00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:44.170]
He's got two Super Bowl rings by the way you idiots. Those are mediocre Super Bowl

[00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:44.390]
rings.

[00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:48.630]
Oh, with his sports pedigree, Mandage has a special insider quality that somewhat tones

[00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.610]
down the repulsive nature of his character. Well, this is quite a compliment. Then we

[00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.210]
could never touch the small level of his WPLG channel 10 TV partner Jimmy Cifilis, another

[00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.630]
former dolphin receiver. Mandage doesn't just talk about sports. He's labeled a rambulant

[00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.370]
about the hangover he has from pre-beacock tales he drank the night before, or provide an

[00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:09.450]
anecdote that reveals his lacherous nature. You never know what is this train wreck of a

[00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.250]
man is going to say next, and that's what really makes him hard to ignore, says city link

[00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:14.770]
readers choice Neil Rogers.

[00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:15.510]
Neil God.

[00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.110]
See, all I care about is that's good, because the mad dog gets one, I get the other one.

[00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.010]
Right. I want to care about what the listeners have to say, the readers, because they're the

[00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.850]
ones that get the Arbatron diaries. The people that write this swill in city link in

[00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.170]
new times, they don't get no diaries. Okay. So, you can think of whatever the line

[00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.650]
stuff, and I can only present the city link stuff is also on the internet. Right.

[00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.310]
You want to go and find the whole thing. All right.

[00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.110]
Why should I do that?

[00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.670]
I'm mentioning that.

[00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.990]
When you can fax it to me like, oh, I have a page here in a quarter of a page over

[00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.650]
there, and I can paste it all together with a page is glue and tape. Right. This

[00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.890]
unscrupulous writer Michael Mayo. Oh my God. What does that say about that newspaper? Right?

[00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.790]
Holy cow.

[00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.270]
Absolutely correct.

[00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.530]
Michael hold a male. And I don't know who the readers picked, because you only faxed

[00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:54.870]
me this one.

[00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.270]
That's all I got. That's all I came through the fax.

[00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.090]
Oh, that's all I came through was just that one page. When you folks can do better than

[00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.970]
that, don't give us like that little tease there.

[00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.730]
Nanner.

[00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:09.170]
That's a little tease. What's your number one complaint? That's our pull question. I'm

[00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.150]
sure that we got a lot of people out there with big complaints that aren't on here.

[00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:18.310]

[00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:19.830]
a given 164 votes. I'm not getting enough sex 24. I'm fat as a cow. I can't lose weight

[00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:36.350]
sir. Neil, I don't understand. I got a question. How exactly do all these garbage on

[00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.970]
the road? Maybe that's new work. Hold them out of a hat. Some folks they pull them out

[00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:46.190]

[00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:05.130]
Hey, um, definitely nice show today. Is it the Clueless? Call it? Clueless call us. Yeah.

[00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:10.890]
Well, anyway, let's listen to the pantless. I'm at work in my day off. So I think I have

[00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:16.470]
no doubt about up sex. Not up sex. Okay. Okay. Thanks. So in other words, now what they're

[00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:22.490]
going to do is call in and read the ones that we have. That's great. I told you I love

[00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.570]
these calls. You people that don't like the phone calls, man. You don't know where you just

[00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:32.030]
don't know where it's at. That's your problem. WQM Hello. How you doing, Uncle Neil? My

[00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:37.170]
big beef is that I live in Florida. Living in Florida. That's an excellent choice. Now,

[00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.070]
I'll go Neil. I'll be seeing you soon. I'm getting my butt out of here. I'm going to

[00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:46.630]
stand for Cisco Lake Tahoe and Reno. All right. Have a great time, Valley. Thank you. See

[00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:54.810]
you. He's going. This story just to drives me up the wall. Counselor gets house arrest for

[00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.950]
not eating hanging teen. This is just enough to make you want to spank somebody real bad.

[00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:02.490]
Well, she thought he was already dead. So what's the rush? A former, no, she didn't.

[00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.270]
The former youth counselor who snapped photos of a hanging teenager rather than try to

[00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:10.710]
free him from his makeshift news was sentenced to a year of house arrest yesterday for child neglect.

[00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:16.690]
A former youth counselor. Sandra Trotter, 41, stared ahead his bowed circuit judge,

[00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.970]
Michael Jates pronounce sentence, which also included four years probation, 500 hours of

[00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.830]
community service, and the stipulation that she never worked as a caretaker for children

[00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:29.070]
or disabled adults again. The victim, 15-year-old Anthony Dumas,

[00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.370]
had been sent to the Lippen Center, 221 Northwest, 43rd Court,

[00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:36.450]
Nockland Park, and a shelter for one-aways and troubled youths. Lutheran family services runs

[00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.770]
the center under contract with the Florida Department of juvenile justice. Her mother and father

[00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:44.350]
let a judge send him there for attacking his mother because they had no money to pay for his

[00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:49.470]
counseling, which they knew he needed. In June 2000, sometime after 9 p.m. Anthony hanged

[00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:55.170]
himself from a top bunk bed in his room using his black woven leather belt. Prosecutor Dennis Seagal

[00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.930]
said it would have been simple to let Anthony about a foot under the bunk first bunk to relieve the

[00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:03.470]
news's pressure. After the incident Trotter told police another investigators she was afraid to

[00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:07.930]
touch the teenager because she feared she would hurt him further. The photos were to keep her

[00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:12.310]
records so she wouldn't be sued. She later said she tried to cut the belt but had no access to

[00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:18.330]
scissors and no help from fellow employees. Wow, talk about lame. But now she's saying she thought

[00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.810]
he was already dead and was taking the documentation because she's understand. And we spent the day

[00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:29.330]
talking to people and seeing the steps that have been taken to see that those types of abuses to

[00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:33.930]
people for whom we have rubber. Yes, see it's all about those pictures you know what I'm saying?

[00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:38.190]
Now we know why Casey Kason was screaming about those pictures he was supposed to see. That's

[00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:42.790]
what it's all about is those damning pictures that always seem to be around. Who you kidding,

[00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:48.950]
Rummy? Times up. It's time to retire. That's the deal for Rumsfeld. Time to retire. Idiot.

[00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:20.930]
to big 106 and believe you me their numbers ain't going to be so big. Trust me when I tell you.

Oh, our morning show problems are solved. There you go. Here's one that says my suggestion for the

[00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:30.510]
Paul is I'm getting old and it sucks. Everything hurts. I like that. I'm getting old and it sucks.

[00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:37.410]
Got that Josh. Got it. He's getting older too. He just celebrated his 10th birthday and they brought

[00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:46.270]
my birthday cake made from duck and donuts. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:53.050]
WQN. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. How about on your poll all of the above?

[00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:00.730]
You know, it's your it said before we were like going over this pool this morning. He said what

[00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.670]
about all the above? You know, just making fun of people like this guy there. No, no.

[00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.390]
No, not all of the above. Okay. He a little bit more creative. I realized that it's quite a

[00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:14.530]
demand that we put on the audience. It's a lot of stress. You can actually pick one. You know,

[00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:18.530]
it's like sticking your finger in your nose when you got a bad cold. Just picking only one can be

[00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:23.790]
difficult choice. But that's what we're asking you to do right now. Yeah. Just pick one. Nero it down please.

[00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:33.990]
God. WQAM. Hello. QAM. Not there. WQAM. Hello.

[00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.150]
Iraq. You love her. WQAM. Hello.

[00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:44.990]
WQAM. Hello. The meal. Yes, sir. Yeah, hi. Did you hear that general Boykin is partly responsible

[00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.270]
for the second abuse at the Iraqi prison? Remember that guy who said last year, Staten was the

[00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:53.190]
problem that Osama? Yeah, I know. Because I found on the internet I saw a scroll on the bottom

[00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.010]
and see it in. He's responsible. He's probably responsible. He thinks this good Christian thing

[00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:02.490]
sex abuses how you get information. But I'm not sure. WQAM. Hello. Hey, no, I don't. Okay.

[00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:06.010]
I hate the fact that your show's become a soapbox. I'm sorry.

[00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:15.130]
Hi, Valley. WQAM. Hello. Hey, I have a little information. Maybe a little joke to move

[00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.750]
the pole. No, no, no, no, so we don't need information. We don't need jokes. We just want to

[00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.790]
suggest you're going to pull this. I thought this would be easy. What's your name? Maybe we have no

[00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:29.050]
complaints in South Florida. Life is paradise. It's a new year. What's not to like? It's paradise. So

[00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:33.250]
there's a lot of liar general Myers, Richard Myers, another little compulsive, chronic liar.

[00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:40.050]
WQAM line nine. A very favorite. Hello. Hey, Neal. How about nobody in Miami speaks English?

[00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.170]
Nobody speaks English in Miami. An excellent choice, which will get many, many votes. I like it.

[00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:52.910]
Nobody speaks English here. Got it, Josh? Good. Got it. Okay. What? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:57.010]
pound, 5, 60. Now let me get to some of my stuff here because obviously these people are thinking

[00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:01.530]
about this. Got a million calls, but I don't want to like overdo it right at, especially since we got

[00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:06.390]
all of our people today, obviously, gathered around the radio. Oh, yeah. They're all gathered around.

[00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:12.730]
Well, your girlfriend, leash gal, gal sex picks. This is in the York Post today. Can't wait.

[00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:18.030]
Shocking shots of sex campaigns involving PFC, Lindy England were among the hundreds of

[00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:22.590]
ex-rated photos and videos from the Abu-Grey prison scandal, shown to lawmakers in that top secret

[00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:27.070]
capital conference. You missed it. There were over 1,600 photos and videos, by the way, if you're

[00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:32.450]
counting. I am. She was having sex with numerous partners that appeared to be consensual

[00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:36.350]
Settelamek who saw the photos. She's a gal with you. The video showed that when you stop,

[00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:41.230]
she's trailer trash. What do you expect? Video showed that this great soldier making

[00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:45.330]
made notorious in a photo showing her holding a leash looped around in Iraqi prisoners neck,

[00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:50.410]
engaged in graphic sex acts with other soldiers in front of Iraqi prisoners. Pentagon official

[00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:58.110]
told NBC nightly news. Almost everybody. This is my favorite line. Almost everybody was naked all

[00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:03.150]
the time. Another lawmaker said, well, maybe it was hot in there. You know, right. It's a rack.

[00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.790]
Many members of Congress left a 45 minute viewing session early there by missing the

[00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:11.530]
porno performance by England, but there were enough other images of torture, humiliation,

[00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:15.890]
and intimidation to sick and anyone. Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota said it was pretty

[00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:20.390]
disgusting. Not what you'd expect from Americans, he said. There was lots of sexual stuff,

[00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.710]
not of the Iraqis, but of our troops. Not what you'd expect from Americans like sex and stuff.

[00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:30.550]
Yeah. Senator Diane Feinstein, who also characterized the photos as disgusting,

[00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:35.610]
agreed, noting it's hard to believe that this actually is taking place in a military facility.

[00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:41.310]
The shocking photos and videos provided on computer disk by Pentagon official showed a

[00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.410]
tacked dog snarling at cowering prisoners. Iraqi women forced to expose their breasts,

[00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.790]
and naked prisoners tied together on the floor. Senators revealed as they merged from the heavily

[00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:54.610]
guarded conference room, it was significantly worse than I expected. Said Senator Ron Widen of

[00:40:54.610 --> 00:41:00.350]
Oregon, take the worst case and multiply it several times and then you get close. I don't know how

[00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:04.250]
these people got into our armies. Said Senator Ben Nighthorse, Campbell of Colorado, who reported

[00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:08.690]
saying several pictures of Iraqi women who were disturbed or put in putting their shirts up.

[00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.830]
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York described the images as more detailed and more graphic than the

[00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.550]
pictures that have been released publicly referring to the disturbing photos of Iraqi's being abused

[00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:23.370]
with Al-Baghrae prison that surfaced two weeks ago. Normally I side my dislocations and openness,

[00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:27.630]
but in this case these photos are evidence Schumer said, indicating he favors keeping the lid on

[00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:31.910]
the alarming pictures as Vice President Cheney and John Warner have urged. Representative Jane

[00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:36.210]
Harmon of California, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said she was most

[00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:40.390]
appalled by a video of a handcuffed prisoner beating his head against the wall with an apparent

[00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:45.030]
bid to knock himself unconscious to escape the abuse. In another video clip she said,

[00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:50.030]
a group of men were shown masturbating. Before the pictures of England's sex roms were shown to

[00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:54.190]
Congress, the 21-year-old reservist from West Virginia tried to portray herself as a reluctant

[00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:58.750]
participant who was just following orders. Before we saw all this orgy going on with this bitch,

[00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.830]
I didn't really, I mean, want to be in any pictures England told Identity V Station,

[00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.750]
I was instructed by persons at higher rank to stand there, hold this lease, look at the camera,

[00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:12.370]
and they took pictures for siaops she told KCNC. She acknowledged it was kind of weird to him when

[00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:16.310]
she was photographed smiling with a cigarette in her mouth as she leaned forward and pointed at the

[00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:21.210]
genitals of a naked hooded Iraqi at Abu Ghrae prison, England was refused to identify who gave her

[00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:25.630]
the order, saying that they only came from persons in my chain of command. Don't ever give an order

[00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:31.210]
like that again. That's what Al-Puccino said. England faces a military court martial that includes

[00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.290]
charges such as conspiracy to military prisoners, assault consummated by a battery, I didn't

[00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:39.830]
realize she had batteries in there. She could face punishment raging from a reprimandum more than

[00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:45.670]
15 years in prison. You're a close, personal good buddy, Linda England. Wow, I won't be long

[00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:53.330]
before she'll be on a jury of spingers, you'll get her in damn T of that. Can't wait. 567-0560-050560 on the AT&T

WQA, hello. She was smoking? WQA, evidently. WQA, hello.

[00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:50.690]
The number of companies, if you don't speak either Spanish or English, you can't get anywhere in Miami.

[00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.430]
There you go. There's a guy that's got to stomach right on. Very well said.

[00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.110]
That was the best call we've had in at least five, ten years. I would say maybe.

[00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.250]
My third man. Yes.

[00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:04.070]
Fine. What do you see? I told you this was going to be great. You didn't believe it.

[00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:08.870]
I could already, I could feel it. I could smell it. Right. I took three years in the

[00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:14.070]
Egrishin High School. WQA, hello. Good morning. Good morning, sir.

[00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:21.630]
My complaint is being told that I live under the best political system and the best medical system

[00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:29.530]
in the world. I'm not buying it. Okay. He's not buying it. We're not selling it and he ain't buying it.

[00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:33.910]
I don't know what we, what do we want to put down? I think for him? No, no, just get some help.

[00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:42.150]
Bad. WQA, hello. Hello. Yes. Yes. My biggest complaint is you hang up on what

[00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:46.470]
is the matter? WQA, hello. Oh, good morning, Neil. Good morning, sir.

[00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:54.450]
I got something for your poll. Yeah. Corruptus cops and traffic. Corruptus cops and traffic.

[00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:58.550]
Okay. There's no stop and think about that one. Okay. Corruptus cops. Right.

[00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:04.210]
The Roman Emperor there. Corruptus copus. Corruptus and his brother, biggest,

[00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:08.630]
niggas. Careful. He needs to be the sheriff in Brown, biggest niggas.

[00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:17.570]
Hello. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. My biggest complaint is that the election fairy shows coming.

[00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:25.850]
Do you know who they are? Yeah. They're up in West Palm Beach on 94.3.

[00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:33.530]
In. They suck. Oh, I know. I think. Yes. What happened? Have any go away? You still there?

[00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:38.910]
I get some. What in that drink and get some drunk. Okay.

[00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.290]
I have no idea what he said, but I'm sure it was great.

[00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.750]
Lexington, they're already on in Palm Beach and evidently they really blow.

[00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:50.870]
Ice going to our chief channel is once again, they continue put on all these pre-fabricated

[00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:55.510]
shows that are on 85,000 different markets, amusing and entertaining. Absolutely nobody.

[00:45:56.050 --> 00:46:00.490]
That's their response. That's their fill in the gap is just shuffling from this point over to

[00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:05.050]
another point. Roll, ball and young Ron with everybody else's material, but all that stale crap

[00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:09.210]
they put on a year. They're shuffling them over there to big and put this syndicated bunch of

[00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:14.270]
losers on here on Zeta. Nice going, Petty Bulger. Nice going, David Ross. And by the way,

[00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:18.170]
too bad about that Lower Amazing at the thing that popped in his head. You know, it's you that?

[00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:22.270]
No, what thing? Oh yeah, he had like a, uh, aneurysm or something. He's got to live though,

[00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:27.150]
unfortunately. Yeah, damn it. Law remade is from Clear Channel from the real Nazis of the radio.

[00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:32.790]

I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands and I'm on my hands

[00:48:41.530 --> 00:49:05.310]
and I'm on my hands and I'm up and down my head and on my head look down my head look down my head look down my head look down my head

[00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.910]
Quick you're an American now, stop making mistakes.

[00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.210]
You know about us, be English.

[00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.750]
Remember.

[00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.950]

[00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.130]
Lebanon could have 560 W.D.

[00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.150]
Come on, why wouldn't they put Bob and Tom on in the morning

[00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.890]
on one of those stations?

[00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.610]
I don't know.

[00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:20.250]
It would make sense.

[00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:20.990]
They make too much sense.

[00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.790]
They're too entertaining.

[00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:22.890]
They do too bit of a show.

[00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:23.950]
I mean, I don't get that.

[00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.450]
Anyway, number one complaint says J.R.

[00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:28.530]
Traffic in Miami.

[00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.390]
Yeah.

[00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:30.690]
Traffic.

[00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:32.530]
South Florida drivers.

[00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:33.390]
Let's put it that way.

[00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:34.230]
South Florida drivers.

[00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.810]
Got a charge?

[00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:35.090]
Good.

[00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:36.090]
Good job.

[00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.170]
Here's the fact that says, good morning, Neil.

[00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:42.330]
Did you get a chance to watch the curl burn out show yesterday?

[00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.790]
No.

[00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:43.430]
No, I did not.

[00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.290]
I thought it was great and brought back a lot of memories.

[00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:47.370]
Thank you and have a great day.

[00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.230]
And then it says, oh, right, right.

[00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:53.330]
I don't watch the curl burn out show last night for probably one reason

[00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:56.190]
in particular is when it was on originally like 100 years ago.

[00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:57.330]
I didn't watch it then either.

[00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.070]
I didn't like to watch the curl burn out show yesterday.

[00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:01.510]
No.

[00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.150]
No, I did not.

[00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:05.010]
I thought it was great and brought back a lot of memories.

[00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:06.090]
Thank you and have a great day.

[00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.190]
And then it says, oh, right, right.

[00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.050]
I didn't watch the curl burn out show last night for probably one reason

[00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.910]
in particular is when it was on originally like 100 years ago.

[00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:16.050]
I didn't watch it then either.

[00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.130]
I didn't like the curl burn out show.

[00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:20.490]
Oh, no, you can't say that.

[00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.350]
You can't say that.

[00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.250]
I mean, I don't know.

[00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:25.090]
She's okay.

[00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.250]
And she does that thing with a Harvey Corman, not a big fan.

[00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:28.550]
I can't stand Vicky Lawrence.

[00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:30.470]
So why would I watch it last night?

[00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:33.170]
In addition to it was even if I did watch it many, many years ago.

[00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.610]
Why would I want to turn it on last night?

[00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.370]
And then see all these people who just celebrated their 88th birthday.

[00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:41.070]
You know, we're eating wheatina and like dribbling down their chin.

[00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:42.470]
I don't want to see that.

[00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:45.770]
It's like when a wheelbarke Kate Smith and that wheel chair is here.

[00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:48.350]
It's like a little vegetable in a wheelchair that one time.

[00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.450]
Oh, it was so sad.

[00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:50.510]
Why did they do that?

[00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.190]

[00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.210]
Is that what it is?

[00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:55.930]
So I didn't watch curl burn out, but I sure hope you enjoyed it.

[00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:58.130]
And I'm glad it helped improve your life.

[00:50:58.850 --> 00:50:59.130]
Let's see.

[00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:01.290]
Rumsfeld's over there along with these other fakers.

[00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:02.650]
They're lying through their teeth general.

[00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:03.530]
Myers only said this.

[00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:04.010]
Buh, buh, buh.

[00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.210]
Trying to say a big dog and pony show to try to cover up all of this crap.

[00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:10.690]
And speaking of that, it's really interesting.

[00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:11.610]
Now, who do you believe?

[00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:12.230]
Okay.

[00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:16.230]
You've got two directly conflicting reports about the Nick Berg,

[00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.630]
who was beheaded by the barbarian al-Qaeda.

[00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:19.950]
I thought we got rid of al-Qaeda.

[00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:20.870]
It's never where we've been told.

[00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:22.410]
It didn't get into the job though.

[00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.070]
They should have accomplished.

[00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:26.790]
And I thought also they said that Al-Zakari,

[00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:28.710]
that it wasn't his voice on the tape yesterday,

[00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.270]
and then it come to, oh yeah, it was him.

[00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.970]
That's not.

[00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:31.710]
Yes, it is.

[00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:32.270]
Yeah, that's not.

[00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:33.610]
Yes, maybe.

[00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:36.750]
Oh, here's the very disturbing fact.

[00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.330]
Is where can I get spinning on the axis of evil?

[00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:40.650]
I went to Barnes and nobody yesterday.

[00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:41.370]
They don't have it.

[00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:42.550]
You think borders might.

[00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:43.270]
Well, they might.

[00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.110]
I know Amazon probably might.

[00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.190]
Well, that's definitely where you'll find it.

[00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:48.830]
Amazon.com or what's the other one?

[00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:50.570]
Amazon.com.

[00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:51.070]
Yeah.

[00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:52.530]
And you'll have it in a couple of days.

[00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:54.910]
I would go online and get it instead of running all over town.

[00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:56.870]
When you got gas, it's 20 bucks a gallon.

[00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:57.930]
I wouldn't be wasting all that money.

[00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.510]
It's a great book.

[00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:00.230]
You definitely must read it,

[00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:01.430]
spinning on the axis of evil.

[00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:04.830]
The author is Scott Taylor.

[00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.310]
Anyway, getting back to Nick Berg,

[00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:12.070]
says the killing of Nick Berg,

[00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:13.250]
the American telephone engineer,

[00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:14.710]
be hit by Islamic Brawlistan Center,

[00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.550]
a Ractrigger, a political storm last night,

[00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:17.810]
as the murdered man's father

[00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:19.630]
blamed the Bush administration

[00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:21.450]
for the circumstances that led to his death.

[00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:23.890]
I should point out right up front that Nick Berg voted for,

[00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.890]
but who's a Bush supporter?

[00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.530]
Okay.

[00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.310]
Okay.

[00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:27.370]
The kid.

[00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:28.090]
Right.

[00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.510]
Michael Berg, and about a opponent of the war in Iraq,

[00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.010]
said his son might still be alive

[00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.930]
if the US military had not taken him into custody

[00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:35.790]
for 13 days in late March.

[00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:37.610]
And the brother, Nick Berg's brother,

[00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:39.030]
says he's got a whole series of emails

[00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:40.270]
that they emailed back and forth.

[00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.710]
So they've got evidence.

[00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:44.030]
I mean, there's no question about it

[00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:46.350]
that the US military had him in custody.

[00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:48.850]
Mr. Berg said he believed that if the 26-year-old

[00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:50.130]
had not been detained so long,

[00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:51.590]
he might have been able to leave the country

[00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:52.970]
about conditions were more stable.

[00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.410]
Nick Berg had traveled to Iraq as a freelance telecommunications

[00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.890]
on a Pernour intending to help rebuild communications antennas,

[00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:02.970]
but was detained by Iraqi police at a checkpoint in Mosul

[00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:05.650]
and made confusion as to what he was doing in the area.

[00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:07.590]
He was later passed on to the US military,

[00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:10.690]
who finally, now here's the most important part of this,

[00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:13.230]
who finally freed him after his parents sued

[00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:15.130]
the federal government for his release on April 5th.

[00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:17.830]
Mr. Berg said his son had been held without an attorney

[00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:19.570]
was not allowed to make telephone calls.

[00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:22.390]
You ready for that?

[00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:22.690]
Yeah.

[00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:24.210]
Typical.

[00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:25.150]
Part of the course.

[00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.630]
Oh, no.

[00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:28.470]
Of course, the government, oh no, we offered him a plane ride home.

[00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:30.070]
We offered him a nice board home.

[00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:30.590]
Right.

[00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.010]
We didn't have him in custody.

[00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:33.670]
We didn't have him.

[00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:34.890]
We didn't force him to stay there.

[00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:35.950]
I didn't know no guy, Fada.

[00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:38.630]
Now, if that's the case, then how come they sued the federal government

[00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:41.030]
and Rumsfeld himself for his release on April 5th?

[00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:42.890]
They had to go to court to get them to release him.

[00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:43.250]
Shut up.

[00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:44.690]
They were just hanging on to him,

[00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:45.790]
just like they do everybody else.

[00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:48.290]
So, don't ask any questions and forget about the Geneva Convention

[00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:50.690]
and forget about attorneys and all this other crap, okay?

[00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.730]
And this is an American citizen, no less, who's now dead.

[00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:58.150]
Not even a raghead American citizen or a spick American citizen.

[00:53:59.570 --> 00:53:59.970]
Exactly.

[00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:03.650]
Kind of a no-head American citizen.

[00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:05.550]
Well, I mean, you said it.

[00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:06.210]
I mean, I was bad.

[00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:08.130]
You're responsible for that.

[00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:09.250]
I saw where you were going with that.

[00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.790]
That's bad.

[00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.590]
This is going to be making Iqabad crane jokes.

[00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:14.710]
I mean, this is not a joking matter, okay?

[00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.330]
Although I do notice that when Daniel Pearl did the same thing with him.

[00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:18.810]
Mm-hmm.

[00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:21.210]
And how come they didn't make a big tennis about it as much?

[00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:22.570]
They didn't care about it all that much.

[00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.150]
Because it wasn't at the time when all these other revelations were coming out when people could say,

[00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:28.650]
Oh, you see how much more barbaric they are than we are?

[00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:29.990]
It wasn't a convenient comeback.

[00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:30.630]
Right.

[00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:32.670]
Oh, look at this.

[00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:33.950]
See, they're much more barbaric.

[00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:37.790]
But the bottom line is when somebody kills innocent people, they're still dead.

[00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:40.930]
In fact, the father said that he was, if anything,

[00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:44.830]
a rather would have had him die the way he did because it's quick and relatively painless

[00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.950]
as opposed to long and excruciating torture in all this other crap.

[00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:51.870]
Not to mention, of course, all the thousands and thousands of innocent men,

[00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:55.650]
who were in children over there, who have been dying since we started all the bombing in the shock and awe,

[00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:59.610]
in the hospitals a long torture was painful death with all the strep-nell in their brain,

[00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:04.550]
and of course, little Ali who's got the four artificial limbs, etc., and so on,

[00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:08.610]
and chemical Ali who he killed not only once, but twice, etc., and so on.

[00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:09.810]
Well, that'll teach them to attack.

[00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:14.570]
I mean, they just keep lying and lying and lying and the public is the...

[00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:15.770]
But I don't like that.

[00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:21.190]
Although, the latest CBS poll shows that El Presidente is approval rating now,

[00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:24.790]
keeps dropping like a rock. It's down to 44 percent, like a rock.

[00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:29.010]
So you don't think maybe that's why they're putting on this dog and pony showing back that, do you?

[00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:30.270]
You think that might be it? Yeah.

[00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:33.390]
Or it might just be a coincidence.

[00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:35.570]
WQM, hello.

[00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.630]
Yes, hello. My complaint is I have a really small hack.

[00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:41.610]
WQM, hello.

[00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:43.050]
Yeah, I know it's Lou.

[00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:44.210]
Yes, Lou.

[00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:46.370]
I wanted to put something on the poll.

[00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:47.270]
Go ahead.

[00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.750]
Okay, I don't know if it's fine.

[00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:49.510]
Do you want to know you Lou?

[00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:50.750]
No, you don't.

[00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:52.970]
Oh, just funny the way you said that.

[00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:54.890]
Like we know you want to show it.

[00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:56.470]
Well, because everybody calls, nobody says hi.

[00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:58.010]
People just want to give you something for the poll.

[00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:00.550]
Right, well, at least you're being sociable. That's good.

[00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.870]
Okay, although unacceptable in South Florida.

[00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:03.630]
Exactly.

[00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:06.770]
But what you bring to the next point, which is the herald.

[00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:08.010]
The herald should be on that poll.

[00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:08.630]
Okay.

[00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:09.470]
The crappy herald.

[00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:10.330]
The good point.

[00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.990]
Excellent choice.

[00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.970]
And one more thing.

[00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:14.510]
You know, what's funny is the hypocrisy of all these people they're saying.

[00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:16.470]
Or the Americans don't act like that.

[00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:17.750]
That's not the Americans we know.

[00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:19.750]
You know, I think they're wrong.

[00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:21.870]
And I think they should watch Jerry Spurn who's now a Stern.

[00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:23.030]
Or what's the...

[00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:26.230]
Well, I think what they should do is next time there's a documentary on the Vietnam War.

[00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:27.430]
And look at what we did in the line.

[00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:33.030]
All the innocent people that we not only put you in, but I mean took body parts of souvenirs.

[00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:34.650]
They ought to take a look at that.

[00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:35.050]
Exactly.

[00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:36.310]
Thanks, Sally.

[00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.870]
God bless you.

[00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:37.290]
Bye.

[00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:38.610]
Got it?

[00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:39.890]
My my herald.

[00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:40.290]
Got it.

[00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:44.350]
Even the fish jump right out of your hand when you try to wrap them in the herald.

[00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:46.070]
Piece of crap.

[00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:47.510]
And let me say it again, Howard Cohen.

[00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:48.810]
You made me fool in somebody else.

[00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:51.330]
And we know you won't make any correction or retraction.

[00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:53.230]
But who the hell are you people kidding?

[00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.390]
Okay, big 106.

[00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:58.530]
Doesn't lose any listers with the loss of the shock-jock and all this other crap.

[00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.510]
You would know a shock-jock of he stuck his foot right up your ass.

[00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:01.950]
Correct him.

[00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:03.790]
Okay, Howard Cohen at the Miami herald.

[00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:04.270]
You idiot.

[00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.270]
You simple to knew.

[00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:08.210]
He's probably like, you know, it's another 17 year old stringer.

[00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:10.770]
You won't think it is discovered with these newspapers.

[00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:12.470]
And they don't like having like real adults.

[00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:14.570]
And they may have like three or four months to have.

[00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:15.210]
They cost money.

[00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:19.430]
Yeah, they had like a bunch of kids that worked like they get paid per piece.

[00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:20.770]
You know, kind of like Kathy Willards.

[00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:22.030]
They get paid per piece.

[00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:24.930]
They're like they're just stringers.

[00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:25.490]
That's all.

[00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:28.650]
And you'll notice that one day they're like, who is it the other guy?

[00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:29.930]
The Glenn not Glenn Garvin.

[00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:31.110]
Who is it that preceded him?

[00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:32.330]
Ken Kevin Bastard.

[00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:33.130]
What happened to him?

[00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:34.070]
Well, that's right.

[00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:35.370]
Now he's a sports flunky.

[00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:36.790]
Now he writes about baseball.

[00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:41.950]
He was the previous herald TV radio guy before this Glenn Garvin guy.

[00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:45.890]
And he didn't know his ass from the speaker in his radio either.

[00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:47.210]
Kevin Bastard.

[00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:51.970]
So all of a sudden, just like the broad day years ago, what that was her name that turned to the religion writer?

[00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:53.750]
Oh, Linda.

[00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.570]
No, no, no, no.

[00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:55.870]
Not Linda.

[00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:56.330]
No.

[00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:56.610]

[00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:58.390]
That one day she was the radio.

[00:57:58.530 --> 00:57:59.210]
Pat Curry.

[00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:01.650]
Pat Curry.

[00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:06.090]
In fact, I think somewhere wouldn't surprise me if I had that call on here.

[00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:06.490]
Yeah.

[00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:07.310]
Here we go.

[00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:08.730]
Here's a lady in plantation.

[00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:09.290]
Hello.

[00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:10.130]
Hi, Neil.

[00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:11.770]
This is Pat Curry with a son sentinel.

[00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:12.550]
Hi, Pat.

[00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.410]
How are you?

[00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:14.490]
Okay, Pat.

[00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:15.130]
It's Pat.

[00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:16.070]
I was calling to invite you.

[00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:17.610]
How come you sound so friendly, Pat?

[00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:19.310]
I'm a friendly kind of person.

[00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:20.850]
I thought you had to return my phone.

[00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:23.230]
I thought you had never get any messages to return your calls.

[00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.770]
How come you-

[00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:24.530]
No, no, no, no.

[00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:29.210]
Now, my family told me that you had my message in your hand and you threw it in his face.

[00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:30.630]
What in the hell was that?

[00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:33.390]
That was about the last lawsuit.

[00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:36.910]
What do you mean, last lawsuit?

[00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:38.290]
Yeah, the one that's in federal court.

[00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:40.210]
You mean that crap about that-

[00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:41.870]
The boys with that P.W. record?

[00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:42.770]
Yeah, that's-

[00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:43.250]
That's-

[00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:44.550]
Much to do about nothing crap.

[00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:48.610]
I've spent a whole article about that nobody gives a crap about that's embarrassing and stupid.

[00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:52.550]
Listen, I was calling to invite you to the Yellow Fathers Show tomorrow night.

[00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:53.050]
To what?

[00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:54.910]
You don't know what the Yellow Fathers show?

[00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:56.390]
I have no idea what that is.

[00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:59.050]
No, any attention since I'll be at Poplar Park tomorrow night.

[00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:04.650]
The press corps in Broward County puts the show on every year to lamp in local politicians.

[00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.110]
Yeah.

[00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:06.710]
And Maronite Bailey Hall and Dave-

[00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:07.330]
Well, who cares?

[00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:09.790]
Well, we're seeing-

[00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:10.570]
I don't understand-

[00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:16.670]
I don't understand why somebody who's so bald facetly erips this radio station every opportunity she gets.

[00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:24.390]
And even when we had the hurricane had to go out of your way to write a little extra shot in about how great it was that the Chuck Meyer was on with the hurricane coverage.

[00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:29.610]
And we got a rest from Neil Rogers and Rick and Suds and now calls and sucking around acting like a friend of ours.

[00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:38.450]
Well, you wouldn't know a radio if it crawled up inside your filthy disgusting body pad and you write a column about radio in the newspaper.

[00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:45.250]
And you're calling here sucking around with me like a friend and you wonder why wouldn't we turn your calls?

[00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.430]
Hmm.

[00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:49.310]
You know, I detect some negative energy.

[00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:51.410]
No, you don't detect negative energy.

[00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:54.930]
You detect a hatred, a disgust, a nausea, a-

[00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:56.850]
I was feeling so great when I came in today.

[00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:02.650]
I hear this Pat Curry calling from the Sun Sentinel that hates me like poison and is sucking around on a year.

[01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.930]
Well, listen, if you'd like to come to the show, I'll hold you back.

[01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:06.190]
I'm not coming to the show.

[01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:08.790]
I wouldn't come to the show if you paid me a million dollars a minute.

[01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:09.590]
How do you like that?

[01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.430]
Well, it was an invitation.

[01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:12.590]
It was offered and good.

[01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:13.690]
Call up the light bulb.

[01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:18.010]
Okay, that'll probably invite you on the air again to fill some of that empty time you disgusting bitch.

[01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.450]
I think it was Pat Curry.

[01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:13.070]
but a qm hello hello nioh yes how do i learn to you buddy beautiful sunny and uh about eighty two today

[01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:20.310]
oh nice hey um real quick you guys talk about lexandteri i personally don't listen to them because

[01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:25.490]
they're up against bob and tom up here are they related to like dysentery no but you know

[01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:30.250]
what that better the guy was wrong they you know they they they have a decent show they're very

[01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:36.530]
funny they're very popular and they're going to be a hell of a lot better than uh run and uh

[01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:45.910]
oh cool yeah i mean it run show is his whole show was dedicated to the women and the setting up

[01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:51.010]
of the dates and you know it just it got so lame after the years i haven't listened to him in a long

[01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:59.130]
long time uh you know you was talking about uh john terry and you know saying where is he and he's

[01:08:59.130 --> 01:09:05.770]
not a very strong candidate and i actually have a theory as to why it is that you're not hearing

[01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:13.830]
a lot first of all i think that he realizes that there's so much going on today uh with the

[01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:19.390]
bush administration that why not just sit back and let them hang themselves more and more

[01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:24.730]
and second of all it now you see that that's not the way it works like in a boxing room when your

[01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:28.610]
pawn starts staggering that's when you got to move in for the kill and he's not doing it

[01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:32.870]
you know i have to stay in the lima and when you let somebody back up off the ropes you know what very

[01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:37.510]
often happens don't you true but you're you're also talking about that the election is still

[01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:43.250]
considerably a long ways off it's in november it's months and exactly now in six months you

[01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:47.890]
got to look at how much money each candidate has the conference that bush has is pretty much

[01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:55.310]
stowing over with money terry has to be very precise with the money that he spends because he

[01:09:55.310 --> 01:10:00.530]
only has a fraction of what bush bush has so for him to come out and spend it all now

[01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:04.990]
i'm not expecting to spend all the money on advertising right now i'm just saying when he gets

[01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:09.790]
the photo ops and when he's making these speeches he's been to me very very weak very

[01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:13.670]
indecisive he's not laying out an alternative for iraq and he's going to have to do that

[01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:18.350]
okay they were talking last one of the shows about the fact that natu is drawn five to seven

[01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:22.650]
percent in a lot of these states because he's the only real anti-war candidate right now and

[01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:27.270]
carry's gonna have to like start sucking around to his position a little bit more because he's

[01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:33.150]
just the two two meamy mouth i i really think that he'll probably start to pick it in high gear

designed by a local anti-war demonstrator one man's political statement is

[01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:54.710]
another man's pornography says the gainsville sun

[01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:58.990]

[01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:30.170]
when decided to create the poster he said it was simply exercising his right

[01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:33.170]
to free speech free speech what's that you nuts

[01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:37.670]

considerate of senior pornographic sick here to a local activist in Vietnam

[01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:46.910]
veteran but gainsville police sergeant robber coder thought differently when he

[01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.650]
saw the poster raised toothy afternoon a busy intersection of university

[01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:52.450]
app and northwest thirteenth street in gainsville

[01:15:53.190 --> 01:15:56.470]
cova said he had spoken with ciotto about his sign on previous occasion about two

[01:15:56.470 --> 01:16:00.530]
months ago warned him that the poster was obscene and illegal when coder

[01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:03.530]
approach ciotto on toothy had get warned him that his sign was illegal and he

[01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:07.190]
would have to lower it or go to jail he didn't even have to walk away he just had

[01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:11.090]
to put the sign away coder said but coder said ciotto refused several times

[01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:14.130]
to put his sign away and so he arrested him and transported him to the

[01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:17.550]
elantua county jail coder said he saw children

[01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:21.230]
passing cars glance at the poster leading him to charge ciotto with exposing

[01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:24.590]
minors to obscene material according to the police report what a bunch of red

[01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:28.930]
necks as you know we don't have a problem with people exercising their

[01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:30.110]
constitutional rights

[01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:35.090]
corporal art actin said but if there's a festive material that can be viewed by

[01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:39.130]
child we're going to take action on it ciotto's lawyer gainsville criminal

[01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:42.510]
offensive attorney Jeffrey Mason no kind of peri said he's competent to poster

[01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:46.470]
was solely a political statement will not be ruled obscene

[01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:50.030]
though no one of the state attorney's office could be breached for common Mason said he doesn't

[01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:54.270]
expect ciotto to be prosecuted he has a first to remember right to do what he did and it wasn't

[01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:56.330]
obscene said Mason who's defending ciotto on behalf of the

[01:16:56.330 --> 01:17:00.310]
gainsville chapter the national lawyers guild members the local chapter the aclu

[01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:04.210]
are not pleased with ciotto's arrest and said they'll discuss the case that they're meeting

[01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:08.350]
which was yesterday and hopefully they're on it we would most likely see this as an

[01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:11.710]
infringement on the right to speak freely and criticize the government the way that this

[01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:16.650]
person saw fit said mark me feel no relation to Curtis vice chairman of the local aclu

obscene on a personal level here the cities received a few complaints about his somebody said

this article too well we'll see we'll see how much i can fumble and bumble through it she says

testifying before the senate yesterday general Richard Myers admitted that were checkmated in a

[01:37:52.170 --> 01:37:56.550]
there's no way to militarily lose in a rack he said describing the general consensus there's

[01:37:56.550 --> 01:38:01.470]
also no way to militarily win in a rack talk about the sound of one hand clapping and i say john

[01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:06.430]
curious on both sides of issues sounding like mr. carry general Myers summed up this process has

[01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:10.450]
to be internationalized the uon has to play the governance rule that's how we're in my view

[01:38:10.450 --> 01:38:15.430]
eventually going to win the administration's the minted quest to conquer error parts in mind has

[01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:20.590]
dissolved in a torrid of pornography denigrating other parts of the araban enemy George Bush who

swept into office on a cloud of moral umbridge now has his own side scandal one with far greater

[01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:30.770]
implications than titillating cigar jokes the bush hawks so fixated on making the middle east

[01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:34.650]
look more like america have made america look un-american should we really be reduced to

[01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:39.010]
defending ourselves by saying at least we don't be head people gripped in a i can't look at

[01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:43.470]

their disgusting centered die and finestein told me if somebody wanted to plan a clashes

[01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:57.930]
civilizations this is how they do it these pictures play into every stereotype of america that

[01:38:57.930 --> 01:39:03.630]
erbs have america has debouched america's hypocrites chinyan rumsfeld and muffle it's act like they

[01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:07.550]
know all the answers almost like a divine right she said they don't have a divine right and they are

[01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:13.010]
wrong after nine eleven america had the support and sympathy of the world now a wash in digital

[01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:18.790]
evidence of uncivilized behavior america has careered into a war civilizations the pictures were

[01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:23.150]
clearly meant to use the code book of muslim anxieties about nudity and sexual engender humiliation

[01:39:23.150 --> 01:39:28.090]
to break down the prisoners senator bennyd horse Campbell said some photographs seem to show a

[01:39:28.090 --> 01:39:32.810]
raki women being commanded to expose their breasts such debasement after a war that president

[01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:37.830]
bush partly based on women's rights the problem of course is that the war in Iraq started with lies

[01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:42.830]
that sawdems w md were endangering our security and that sawdems length of al-Qaeda and nine eleven

[01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:47.130]
in a public relations move that cheapens the heroism of soldiers the pentagon merge the

[01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:52.170]
metals for the wars in afghanistan and iraq giving the gwot medal for global war on terrorism in

[01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:57.010]
both wars to reinforce the idea that we had to invade iraq to quell terrorism the truth is our

[01:39:57.010 --> 01:40:02.090]
invasion of iraq spurred terrorism there and around the world that initial deception had long

[01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:06.410]
rushed to throw off international conventions and old alliances and nambi pambi institutions

[01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:11.370]
like the uin and the red cross led straight to the abuses of abu grave now the question is whether

[01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:17.050]
the cia tortured al-cat operatives officials blurred the lines to justify ideological decisions

[01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:21.850]
calling every iraq who opposed us a terrorist conducting rough interrogations perhaps to find

[01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:26.270]
the nine existent w md so they wouldn't look foolish rolling all opposition into one scary

[01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:31.070]
terrorist ball that did not require sensitivity to the Geneva conventions or humanitarian dogoaters

[01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:37.350]
to use the phrase of gender senator james inhofe republican from oklahoma senator fritz homies

[01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:42.270]
made it clear yesterday that rame has left us underman and untrained in iraq another factor in

[01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:47.190]
the tortures scandal now in a country of twenty five million trying to secure with 135,000

[01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:50.790]
school to mr. rumsfeld adding we're trying to win the hearts and minds as we're killing them

[01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:55.210]
and torturing them at least he sets our castically general William Westmoreland never asked

[01:40:55.210 --> 01:40:59.110]
of yet called general to take the town like we have for fallujah we asked the end we've asked

[01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:03.510]
the enemy general to take the town the hawks who promised his garlands in iraq should have

[01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:07.550]
recalled the words of history in daniel borschton who warned that planning for the future without a

[01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:13.810]
sense of history is like planting cut flowers marine down the new york time today it's on our website

[01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:29.650]
later exporting america's prison problems by dan frosh about what are the slime balls that

[01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:37.190]

the president everything they have touched has gone bad right they got the minus touch and reverse

[01:42:21.190 --> 01:42:26.270]
everything they touched turns to that and if everything they do everything they say is all in the

[01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:31.030]
up and up and good for us why are they so secretive about everything you know what they remind me

[01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:39.350]
everything wrong and at the end of the day they come out smelling like a rose i just don't get it

[01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:49.090]
part of it if you were watching the cnn the uh uh cable nazi network right now if you could see

[01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:52.410]
the way that they're going on about the great risk that the bushing administration took

and sending rumsfeld and general mires to a bagdad and uh this uh very uh uh i mean just

[01:42:58.050 --> 01:43:02.730]

[01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:21.210]
crusade out of that but aside from that he's been a real bushlicker all along and i can't give

[01:43:21.210 --> 01:43:26.490]
a complaint to the poll yes sir that commercial about the flyer drives me absolutely crazy the

[01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:34.590]

[01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:50.470]
a AT&T and for rising wireless line yeah you should hear the way that they were carrying

[01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:55.850]
on them oh my gosh the bush administration taking great risk and really uh you know the balls he

[01:43:55.850 --> 01:44:01.350]
move all they're trying to do is just cover their ass after this unbelievable eight or nine days

[01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:04.830]
of embarrassment and of course they're sending people like right wingers like in a half another

[01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:09.410]
surrounded all were outraged by the outrage and the media has covered this too much why shouldn't

[01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:16.250]
the media cover it so much why not sure yeah exactly why now shouldn't they be covering it what

[01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:19.710]
would be the only supposed to show all the parades and waving the flag next thing you know

[01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:24.650]
that we show those damn great coffins again see those of us who live through Vietnam we know how

[01:44:24.650 --> 01:44:28.350]
the media are using them and impulated and what about your ass liquors they are we know all about

[01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:33.770]
that they're not fooling me and then finally when push covers the show then finally when the

[01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:37.710]
things come out that are really going on and the motives come out of what this was really all about

[01:44:37.710 --> 01:44:43.230]
and they have no more excuse to keep defending the indefensible then they say oh well wait a minute

[01:44:43.230 --> 01:44:51.010]
hold on now this is bad just like Vietnam one fifty eight thousand kids came home and body bags

[01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:55.150]
I mean what and all this business about the humiliation and torture what kind of a society

[01:44:55.150 --> 01:44:59.710]
as America become when we have so little regard for human life including our own that's the

[01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:04.590]
thing that frost my ass all these kids were sent over there they're they're just numbers on a

[01:45:04.590 --> 01:45:09.010]
sheet of paper somewhere and then we got morons like Tom jicker writing a thing in his question

[01:45:09.010 --> 01:45:12.330]
answer I think what should be out on Sunday it's on the website in the Sun Sentinel

[01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:17.110]
ripping ABC and Ted Coppel for reading names are what why didn't they do you know they had the right

[01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:20.090]
to do it why didn't they just tell us what they were doing yeah it was just exploitation

[01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:23.670]
they were just exploiting all those dead kids by reading their names on there

[01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:29.510]
Tom I'm gonna tell you man I really ruled the day that I emailed him and got him involved and

[01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:33.270]
actually tied a couple conversations with Tom jicker I regret that day

[01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:39.830]
because you man are an idiot and your true colors really show there oh yeah maybe they were

[01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:42.930]
trying to get people to tune in and watch well isn't that what everybody is doing is that what

[01:45:42.930 --> 01:45:46.910]
you doing you're right you're stupid ass columns about phrasier for going off the year after 800

[01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:52.170]
years the 85th column about phrasier you were trying to get people to open up the paper and read it

[01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:57.450]
you idiot but there always has to be some sinister motor behind it so they're trying to make

[01:45:57.450 --> 01:46:01.210]
the bush people look bad they're trying to point out something the American people as long

[01:46:01.210 --> 01:46:06.230]
over do that these are real living and reading people with a face in a name with mothers and

[01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:11.050]
fathers and wives and husbands and sisters and the sons and daughters real living and

[01:46:11.050 --> 01:46:18.130]
reading people not just a name on a piece of paper somewhere man oh man what a melee moth freaking

[01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:22.270]
media we got in America and that's the only reason that this continues going on it's pathetic it's

[01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:27.590]
tragic and it comes as no surprise to me that most of your boosters probably aren't even carrying

[01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:33.010]
this book because it's it's published by a Canadian publisher it's free to core books

[01:46:34.710 --> 01:46:38.510]

alright 5 6 7 0 5 6 0 here's some good news the Walt Disney Company and the co-chiefs of Miramax

[01:52:32.670 --> 01:52:35.850]
films are near a deal that would allow director Michael mortified a new distributor for his

[01:52:35.850 --> 01:52:40.610]
controversial documentary Fahrenheit 9 11 comedy official say yesterday i totally it's going

[01:52:40.610 --> 01:52:45.990]
to get done. Disney Miramax's parent company had refused to release the film that chronicles

[01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:50.510]
America's react to the September over the tax and links US president George W. Bush's family

[01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:56.130]
and prominent Saudis that include the family of Osama Yamama bin Laden. The film is set to

[01:52:56.130 --> 01:52:59.550]
premiere at the Cannes Film Festival which began yesterday in the French Riviera City.

[01:52:59.970 --> 01:53:04.510]
Miramax spokesman Matthew Hilsick said Disney had agreed to sell rights to Moritz Film to

[01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:10.210]
Miramax Cochie for executives Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein who could then go out

[01:53:10.210 --> 01:53:13.070]
and fight a new distributor so we don't know how to pronounce it in their two brothers he just

[01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:16.670]
pronounced it both ways it could be Weinstein could be Weinstein but it's probably Weinstein

[01:53:17.770 --> 01:53:22.150]
Frankenstein. A Disney spokeswoman characterized the parties there still be a negotiations but

[01:53:22.150 --> 01:53:25.630]
they're going to get it done we're very happy that Disney's agreed to sell Fahrenheit 9 11 to

[01:53:25.630 --> 01:53:29.250]
Bob and Harvey Hilsick said the statement Bob and Harvey look forward to promptly completing this

[01:53:29.250 --> 01:53:36.890]
transaction. Yaudiode and it also talks about the fact that in 1999 the Weinstein's made a deal

[01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:42.050]
similar for the movie dogma in which director Kevin Smith challenged Catholic doctrines raising

[01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:45.730]
the eye of some church groups you see you can't offend the church you can't offend the

[01:53:45.730 --> 01:53:49.250]
administration you can't offend anybody by telling the truth in movie where it's a hell of a thing

[01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:53.370]
to get it made which is why Michael Moore had to make bowling for Columbine here in Canada.

[01:53:54.150 --> 01:53:58.450]
Right can't do that can't do that in America because too much truth ain't a good thing.

[01:53:58.590 --> 01:54:03.070]
You know what you can do what's that? Kill some people. Do worry we're doing a good job of that.

[01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:08.090]
In that arrangement the Weinstein's brought the rights to dogma from Miramax with Disney's

[01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:12.030]
agreement then signed their own deal to have independent film company Lionsgate Entertainment

[01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:17.190]
Group released the movie to theaters dogma which was worthwhile that was before Ben Affleck

[01:54:17.190 --> 01:54:21.650]
became such a puss and of course he was still hanging around with his boyfriend Matt Damon and

[01:54:21.650 --> 01:54:27.350]
there so he was in a better frame of mind. And of course George Carlin was an airhead the great

[01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:32.230]
lion's about. But Emma Damon was bitching about the church if they would have just let us

[01:54:32.230 --> 01:54:37.550]
emasperate why can't use the terms he used he didn't say that. But at any rate it's a word

[01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:44.290]
saying dogma it's not great but it's okay. No? It's okay it's just got stuff it doesn't need.

[01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:48.510]
Yeah too much of a wasted time in there too much crap. I mean Chris Rock we did not need to be in that

[01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:56.070]
movie. No you think neither did I even though I like him a lot neither did Salma they didn't add

[01:54:56.070 --> 01:55:01.010]

pill popping talk show host Rush Limbaugh has purchased full page ads and two florida newspapers to

[02:02:18.810 --> 02:02:23.090]
charge that local prosecutors are politically motivated investigating him for doctor shopping

Limbaugh's company EIB the obesity and broadcasting network said the ads which would run today

[02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:33.470]
in the Palm Beach post in the Sun Central reprint a main item at a tour from the conservative

[02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:37.950]
Washington Times that accuses West Palm Beach state attorney Barry Krischer of political opportunism

[02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:43.090]
Limbaugh one of America's most influential conservative nut jobs last October publicly admitted

[02:02:43.090 --> 02:02:48.390]

stated policy against prosecuting those with addictions so that he could focus on dealers the paper

[02:02:58.110 --> 02:03:02.850]

[02:04:06.410 --> 02:04:11.890]
the world's biggest retailer would set an example for smaller companies Walmart which is also

[02:04:11.890 --> 02:04:15.950]
the nation's largest retail construction developer agreed to institute better control measures

[02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:20.050]
to reduce their water runoff for construction sites the retailer was fired a million dollars

[02:04:20.050 --> 02:04:25.690]
over similar violations in 2001 obviously didn't learn their lesson and don't give a flying crab

[02:04:26.590 --> 02:04:31.210]
the complaint against Walmart leds violations at 24 sites in nine states that it concluded

[02:04:31.210 --> 02:04:35.650]
charges that the company failed to get a permit before beginning construction and didn't develop a

[02:04:35.650 --> 02:04:40.510]
plan to control polluted runoff water runoff from construction sites as a primary contributor

[02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:45.370]
to the impairment of water quality in the nation said Thomas Skinner acting assistant administrator

[02:04:45.370 --> 02:04:51.110]
of the EPA's office of enforcement and compliance a stormwater runoff carries high levels of

[02:04:51.110 --> 02:04:55.610]
mud sediment oil grease heavy metals toxins other lovely pollutants in the storm sewers ultimately

[02:04:55.610 --> 02:05:01.050]
in the rivers wetlands oceans and ultimately into your body deep inside your ass

[02:05:01.630 --> 02:05:05.710]
Walmart has agreed to hold programs to train contractors about stormwater control requirement

[02:05:05.710 --> 02:05:09.850]
a must-submit written documentation of compliance efforts official set and a partridge in a

[02:05:09.850 --> 02:05:14.370]

[02:07:36.650 --> 02:07:41.150]
telling them like it is and I am because it's all coming true it's like petty try ski with network

[02:07:41.150 --> 02:07:47.090]
you're a lot on on on biography channel last night they had Robert DuVal who I obviously like him a lot

[02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:52.090]
and they didn't even put network in there they didn't put Godfather too they didn't I mean

[02:07:52.090 --> 02:07:59.290]
realize it's only an hour show but how could you not put network right right I don't know you

[02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:03.310]
don't think he was great in network absolutely I mean the cast forget about the message which

[02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:07.890]
of course was so incredibly on target at over their heads and over the heads of the public right

[02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:15.770]
but the cast in that movie um huh all right I'm holding Peter Finch fade done away Robert DuVal

[02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:23.650]
Ned Beatty who is unbelievably great Mr. Bale that that scene in the he didn't need to do it

[02:08:23.650 --> 02:08:28.310]
with IT and T he didn't even squeal in a movie he said be over the hidden squeal but he didn't make

[02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:34.790]

the purchase or refinancing your home one and a quarter percent how do you like that you should

[02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:07.190]
that means if you have a hundred thousand out of loan your payments are merely three thirty four

[02:09:07.190 --> 02:09:11.410]
a month if you have a two hundred thousand out of loan you pay a measly six sixty eight a month now

[02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:15.350]
they're advertising on TV they're all over the radio they're on dust ask the programs everywhere

[02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:19.470]

[02:09:53.690 --> 02:09:57.550]
my and look all this is for trade oh by 60

[02:09:57.550 --> 02:10:08.730]
way yeah there is never never a dull moment I love looking at Walmart we stay at Walmart way after

[02:10:08.730 --> 02:10:13.730]
our shifts are over partly because we love it but mostly cause they love the thing

[02:10:13.730 --> 02:10:19.170]
it's more than a story it's a fun place to be the best thing about being on the Walmart team is not

[02:10:19.170 --> 02:10:24.690]
having all those forms and papers and workers with health benefits have to worry about you never know

[02:10:24.690 --> 02:10:28.930]
what to go find it Walmart just come in for the fun of it the immigrants are the best at Walmart

[02:10:28.930 --> 02:10:35.370]
they clean our toilets practically for free and Walmart's I don't need no stinkin green card we don't

[02:10:35.370 --> 02:10:40.370]
need no like this I don't have to shy on it's thinking vices it's like my morning regime

[02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:47.530]
something wake up at Walmart of publishing basically repeat pictures I saw today virtually

[02:10:47.530 --> 02:10:52.490]
the same soldiers who we've seen over and over again until we can recognize them individually

[02:10:53.130 --> 02:10:57.670]
simply doing more of the same all right let me get a different perspective Dennis Gussinich please

[02:10:57.670 --> 02:11:04.210]
is joining us as well uh familiar face to a lot of our viewers he was maybe still is a democratic

[02:11:04.210 --> 02:11:08.710]
presidential candidate but go ahead and respond to what the chairman just said well I think it's

[02:11:08.710 --> 02:11:13.770]
absolutely chilling to assert that somehow the media is to blame here I mean I heard secretary

[02:11:13.770 --> 02:11:20.750]
rumsfeld a moment ago tried the media for the images the pictures the video clips I mean this war

[02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:27.290]
was a lie from the beginning secretary rumsfeld appeared before mr. hunters committee and basically

[02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:31.570]
lie to the congress about saying there are weapons of mass destruction which are the reason why

[02:11:31.570 --> 02:11:36.930]
we're there I mean when are you going to call the secretary to an accounting for the for the

[02:11:36.930 --> 02:11:40.630]
lies that he told in front of your committee this this whole thing has been about a pattern of

[02:11:40.630 --> 02:11:45.550]
deception and right now what they're doing they're trying to blame the media get that I mean the

[02:11:45.550 --> 02:11:49.750]
media just carried the information forward when the administration said no there were weapons of

[02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:54.510]
mass destruction now to try to do what you want me to respond to that we're blaming we're blaming

[02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:58.670]
the media for putting out pictures when they were asked on this specific occasion with Americans

[02:11:58.670 --> 02:12:04.870]
in danger not to put pictures out that could cause hostages to be harmed the media failed to

[02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:11.190]
uh to uh to refrain from doing that from restraining themselves and we had a bad result well let me

[02:12:11.190 --> 02:12:17.110]
let me interrupt for a second mr. chairman I think you're referring to the CBS they did delay

[02:12:17.110 --> 02:12:22.450]
that they're their program as they reviewed the request from the this is the way they play the game

[02:12:22.450 --> 02:12:26.170]
because in this is on a rule here he's ripping him and asked right and now we got to change the topic

[02:12:26.170 --> 02:12:31.310]
because we'll scut some stupid ass questions when it came out the people who killed uh mr.

[02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:38.410]
berg in this very brutal fashion uh laid at least part of the cause uh as a result of of uh

[02:12:38.410 --> 02:12:43.370]
seeing those pictures and responding to the pictures that the media did put out listen I think

[02:12:43.370 --> 02:12:47.130]
they should have delayed those pictures from going out forever and I think the other part of

[02:12:47.130 --> 02:12:52.270]
this story here is that they should have deleted forever the politicians didn't get involved in fact

[02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:57.330]
the us army as you now know wolf uh with no politician how come we're not hearing anything from

[02:12:57.330 --> 02:13:02.810]
Dennis Kassinich investigated themselves starting on January 16th and walked down through this

[02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:08.010]
series of six investigations to the point where court marshals are now starting for criminal

[02:13:08.010 --> 02:13:15.630]
activities for this small handful of bad apples they have been there you know here's secretary

[02:13:15.630 --> 02:13:21.690]
rumsfeld going to a rack today why wasn't he in a rack when these reports first started to come out

[02:13:21.690 --> 02:13:25.990]
you know what's happening here it's the old story that they're going to go after the people at the

[02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:30.790]
service level and the uniform level when the guys at the top will responsible for the policy

[02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:36.170]
of sending the troops there to begin with are going to escape sky free he's not long and I think

[02:13:36.170 --> 02:13:41.890]
I think that every american is offended by this attempt to try to put the responsibility on the

[02:13:41.890 --> 02:13:46.930]
troops and not put it on the people are responsible right in the white house and at the secretary level

[02:13:46.930 --> 02:13:50.590]
congressman stand by we have a lot more to talk yeah we have a lot more a wolf here in the

[02:13:50.590 --> 02:13:54.590]
idiot okay in fact they ought to drag him off just like they dragged Howard Beagle off the screen

[02:13:54.590 --> 02:13:57.910]
in network although he was telling the truth they ought to come in here and drag both buscrowing

[02:13:57.910 --> 02:14:05.650]
off the set right now and let Kassinich go on until two o'clock and we carry it he is the only one

[02:14:05.650 --> 02:14:11.290]
the only one him in sharp then of course we know about sharp but of the of the relatively rational

[02:14:11.290 --> 02:14:16.290]
people he was the only one who really told it like it is no holds barred it all the lies all the

[02:14:16.290 --> 02:14:20.130]
BS looks this guy right in the face how come you're not investigating rumsfeld for making up

[02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:24.030]
the stories in line about weapons of mass destruction getting us into this bogus war in the first

[02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:28.030]
place yada yada yada yada yada he lays it right there on the line while john curious running around

[02:14:28.030 --> 02:14:35.210]
going like that and it's got how many votes did he get that's not just the one primary that's all

[02:14:35.210 --> 02:14:38.870]
the states put together that's how many votes Kassinich got about 30 because he had a bad hair

[02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:46.130]
piece now he's got a better hair piece I think it's too late he would be great yeah can you see him

[02:14:46.130 --> 02:14:53.370]
debating bush oh please he would slice him up man the just like you would never seen yeah but

[02:14:53.370 --> 02:14:59.610]
how is he going to respond to push that but the the the the the five six seven oh five sixty

[02:14:59.610 --> 02:15:03.570]
pound five sixty on the 18 t and for eyes and wireless love what's your number one complaint

[02:15:03.570 --> 02:15:07.670]
I'll tell you what my number one complaint is I want to add this on here right now you know

[02:15:07.670 --> 02:15:15.350]
what it is the media is sick and he's got the media sucks American media sucks put that on

[02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:19.050]
there right away Josh you're not going to make it to Vegas the American media sucks

[02:15:20.130 --> 02:15:25.050]
god are they pathetic and here's a classic example he left this right wing Republican

[02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:28.850]
goofball from California on there the chairman of that committee he let him who by the way was

[02:15:28.850 --> 02:15:34.630]
making all those glorious speeches the other day just kissing rumsfeld's ass he let him go on for

[02:15:34.630 --> 02:15:38.070]
like about 90 percent of that time and as soon as the senate started telling them like it was

[02:15:38.070 --> 02:15:42.790]
all right away but I mean but I'm open I'm open how about CBS did delay it you know we're changing

[02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:46.870]
the question changes subject anything you take away time from consent it who's telling too much

[02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:54.810]
truth and making too much sense you grave robbers you at the cable Nazi network there's a reason they

[02:15:54.810 --> 02:16:01.970]
are the problem because they're the enablers just like that thing about christian amon port I'm

[02:16:01.970 --> 02:16:08.270]
so motivated I'm going to read that one page again from uh Scott Taylor's book about christian

[02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:16.570]
amon portnet that staged event that they did that made for tv event yeah never was the media truth

[02:16:16.570 --> 02:16:20.990]
more manipulated during the stage statue toppling scene on april 9th it was meant to symbolize

[02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:26.910]
the end of sottoms regime watching CNN senior correspondent christian amon port give a live

[02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:31.650]
report on these supposedly spontaneous incident I suspect that this would be one of the US's largest

[02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:37.190]
stage news events what a coincidence for amon portnet crew to be on hand in frito's square to

[02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:42.730]
capture on video amava veracuys that they'd try to bring down large statue of sottom unable to

[02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:47.210]
achieve this feat alone a detachment of US Marines just happened to be in the area to lend the hand

[02:16:47.210 --> 02:16:54.290]
I listened incredulously as amon port told CNN's viewers that this was bagged at central square

[02:16:54.290 --> 02:16:59.750]
and that this particular statue was deeply symbolic to the Iraqi people as frito's square sits

[02:16:59.750 --> 02:17:03.990]
between the sherdon and the palestine hotels I was very familiar with it contrary to her claims

[02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:08.870]
frito's square certainly was not the center of bagged that the real center revolution square

[02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:13.090]
was some two kilometers away and was still very much under the control of sottom loyalist further

[02:17:13.730 --> 02:17:18.890]
this particular statue was cast from a standard mold and identical copies could be found all over

[02:17:18.890 --> 02:17:22.730]
Iraq in fact up till the previous october when the statue had been erected frito's square

[02:17:22.730 --> 02:17:27.850]
had been nothing more than an empty traffic circle when other media outlets housed in the palestine

[02:17:27.850 --> 02:17:32.030]
hotel began broadcasting images of these statues toppling they actually provided a different

[02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:36.450]
perspective by pulling back from the action it became obvious that the Iraqi mob was in fact

[02:17:36.450 --> 02:17:41.030]
just a tiny crowd american tanks completely surrounded the square so the irakis

[02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:45.370]
were operating inside a protected perimeter one Iraqi who camped up for the cameras by banging

[02:17:45.370 --> 02:17:50.730]
issue on the toppled sottom was later recognized to be one of okhmit Shalabi's i NC body guards

[02:17:50.730 --> 02:17:55.190]
two days earlier the same individual wearing the same sherd had appeared beside the Iraqi

[02:17:55.190 --> 02:18:01.050]
national congress president when he returned to the town of nasorea as became clearly evident the

[02:18:01.050 --> 02:18:06.410]
incident at frito's square been orchestrated by the u.s military in conjunction with CNN the cable

[02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:11.110]
Nazi network water would certainly not fool Iraq citizens that effectively convinced North American

[02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:16.610]
audiences that the war was over during that evening's news cast global television actor Kevin

[02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:20.390]
Newman interviewed correspondent Packard Graham one of the few Canadian reporters who would

[02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:24.510]
stuck it out and bagged that from the palestine hotel's rooftop Graham explained how this

[02:18:24.510 --> 02:18:28.930]
particular incident had involved only a handful of Iraqis he went on to say that in reality

[02:18:28.930 --> 02:18:33.890]
the fedaean fighters still control most of bagged that nevertheless the following morning virtually

[02:18:33.890 --> 02:18:39.410]
every North American headline read sottom toppled and CNN had switched its war in Iraq logo to a new

[02:18:39.410 --> 02:18:44.590]
Iraqi bills instead of waiting for the Iraqis to rise up on mass to celebrate their so-called

[02:18:44.590 --> 02:18:49.410]
liberation the bushing administration to decide the time was right to start celebrating for them

[02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:55.410]
a stage TV event to brainwash and manipulate the American public opinion and very successfully

[02:18:55.410 --> 02:19:00.530]
and easily done you ask them any questions you want and we had and when i said i don't want to

[02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:05.970]
just have one city and i want to have multiple cities we had multiple briefings where members could

[02:19:05.970 --> 02:19:09.890]
ask you to be like uh... what's your name linda england have multiple organisms when they made a

[02:19:09.890 --> 02:19:15.970]
decision to go to our rock they did it uh... as as uh... members of congress who understood and who had

[02:19:15.970 --> 02:19:20.710]
been informed and we had vast turnout with a majority of the house come down and they got their

[02:19:20.710 --> 02:19:25.690]
own information so the idea that somehow uh... they came in and uh... don rumsfeld told him to

[02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:30.930]
all go vote for the war and they did that is that is not accurate let me just say uh... uh... this

[02:19:30.930 --> 02:19:34.570]
about the secretary the secretary i think he's stuck in this under the chair

[02:19:35.570 --> 02:19:40.110]
sanchez has done this by the book three days after the soldier came forward now he's

[02:19:40.110 --> 02:19:44.370]
raven about the great job that rich sanchez is doing the patient you now know that that they

[02:19:44.370 --> 02:19:49.810]
announced that to the combined audiences of cnn inverse mbc and fox so outside of fifty million

[02:19:49.810 --> 02:19:54.330]
people they kept a secret they walked down through these investigations and they have criminal

[02:19:54.330 --> 02:19:57.710]
prosecution starting right now but once again wolf the number is

[02:19:58.330 --> 02:20:03.350]
six and not now i think it's been expanded to seven and most members who have seen these pictures

[02:20:03.350 --> 02:20:08.490]
say how come we see that same little group of people in almost every picture and there hasn't been a

[02:20:08.490 --> 02:20:13.890]
link where between the white house or the pentagon or something i don't know how i'm making this happen

[02:20:13.890 --> 02:20:18.130]
if i could respond go ahead and i think it's important chairman may have forgotten what mr. rumsfeld said

[02:20:18.130 --> 02:20:23.490]
because maybe it's not six maybe it's one listen to this quote and this is right to his testimony to your

[02:20:23.490 --> 02:20:29.510]
committee he said talking about his saying that his saying has at this moment stockpiles of chemical

[02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:35.170]
and biological weapons and is pursuing nuclear weapons his regime has an active program to acquire

[02:20:35.170 --> 02:20:40.630]
and develop nuclear weapons very likely all they need to complete a weapon is fissile material and

[02:20:40.630 --> 02:20:46.030]
they are at this moment seeking that material both from four sources and a capability to produce it

[02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:52.390]
indigenously now if that's not a lie what is it i think that's largely accurate and my statement

[02:20:52.390 --> 02:20:57.830]
at the same time if you saw that if you saw if you saw that dentist my statement at the same time was

[02:20:57.830 --> 02:21:06.270]
you could put the entire 8500 liters of anthrax material in one pickup truck and the idea that

[02:21:06.270 --> 02:21:11.290]
that was going to be sitting on on a in a parking lot waiting for us to come pick it up was i told

[02:21:11.290 --> 02:21:17.010]
people a year ago not gonna have to understand unfortunately we got to do a commercial breaking

[02:21:17.010 --> 02:21:26.290]
around a time and the music swells up in the background this is CNN wow to see you see how many words

[02:21:26.290 --> 02:21:31.550]
you let them say their cassinets because every time somebody starts blurting the truth out we got

[02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:34.910]
to cut them off we got interrupted time for commercial it will just got to go take a crap

[02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:40.550]
something's going on man we got interrupt truth is interrupt is that the American fn way make no

[02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:46.710]
mistake about it i got kind of sidetracked every wrong glad i did it was fun no because

[02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:50.810]
cassinets is great he doesn't mince his words he may mince a little bit but he don't mince his words

[02:21:50.810 --> 02:21:54.530]
and he doesn't that beat around a bush and he just tells it exactly the way it is he does beat

[02:21:54.530 --> 02:22:03.430]
around on the bush i scroll on dentist who might didn't get to say anything 1256 at 560 WQM is

[02:24:05.650 --> 02:24:08.390]
something that we know they did not do.

[02:24:10.130 --> 02:24:12.750]
Pusha Maratati occupation.

[02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:17.810]
Now we're all screwed.

[02:24:18.610 --> 02:24:22.190]
Nanners, garbage, beans, let's entry the frame.

[02:24:22.730 --> 02:24:26.570]
And I'll have to fight for wine to their fate.

[02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:28.670]
In those they give it may.

[02:24:29.230 --> 02:24:30.910]
Back then in the pile,

[02:24:30.910 --> 02:24:34.110]
there's a code that opens in to say Jesus,

[02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:35.170]
smile,

[02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:39.030]
whisper in all that's great this far as hers.

[02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:42.550]
In wrestling, your atrocities are more strong.

[02:24:43.470 --> 02:24:47.090]
Like we're first, you only fall in corner.

[02:24:48.350 --> 02:24:50.990]
Look what we've become.

[02:24:52.930 --> 02:24:54.490]
Candidates come and see,

[02:24:55.090 --> 02:24:56.610]
now like that full-dice.

[02:24:56.610 --> 02:24:59.850]
I've been hurt like rubber on a battery.

[02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:10.890]
103 at 560 WQM mad dog at 2,

[02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:13.730]
the Humper from Baltimore in the prequence at 4.

[02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:15.350]
Wait till you hear this.

[02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:19.070]
Sit on the edge of your seat, hold your breath.

[02:25:20.610 --> 02:25:23.510]
The family firm of beheaded American Nick Berg

[02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:25.130]
was named by a conservative website

[02:25:25.130 --> 02:25:27.450]
in a list of enemies of the Iraqi occupation

[02:25:28.130 --> 02:25:30.170]
that could explain as arrest by Iraqi police

[02:25:30.170 --> 02:25:31.990]
at attention which fatally delayed his plan

[02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:34.750]
returned from Iraq and may have led directly to his death.

[02:25:36.250 --> 02:25:39.370]
Nick Berg 26 disappeared into in-communicado detention

[02:25:39.370 --> 02:25:42.110]
after as arrest by Iraqi police in March 2004.

[02:25:42.730 --> 02:25:44.990]
He vanished again after as released 13 days later.

[02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:47.470]
His body was found last Saturday in Baghdad

[02:25:47.470 --> 02:25:49.070]
and the video of his beheadings supposedly

[02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:52.130]
by a radical Islamic group was posted on the Internet Tuesday.

[02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:54.870]
The official story of his gruesome murder

[02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:56.130]
has many dubious aspects,

[02:25:56.130 --> 02:25:58.490]
not the least the real reason why Iraqi police

[02:25:58.490 --> 02:26:00.470]
detain the young man at a checkpoint.

[02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:03.350]
New research by Break4News is uncovered

[02:26:03.350 --> 02:26:04.550]
a plausible explanation.

[02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:07.210]
The free republic.com website

[02:26:07.210 --> 02:26:09.450]
informs a reputation for right-wing views,

[02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:12.350]
fanatical republicanism and relentless pro-war activism.

[02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:16.390]
On March 7, 2004, just three weeks before

[02:26:16.390 --> 02:26:18.070]
the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq,

[02:26:18.530 --> 02:26:20.690]
an enemies list of anti-war groups and individuals

[02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:22.330]
was posted on the free republic forum.

[02:26:22.330 --> 02:26:24.870]
It began, here you are, freepers, here is the enemy.

[02:26:25.690 --> 02:26:28.070]
The list had been copied from publicly available endorsements

[02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:29.910]
of a call to action for an imminent anniversary

[02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:32.570]
anti-war protest on March 20, 2004.

[02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:35.370]
The protest was being organized under the banner of

[02:26:35.370 --> 02:26:38.190]
the answer coalition act now to stop foreign racism.

[02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:42.150]
Among those listed as having endorsed the call to action

[02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:45.450]
was this entry, Michael S. Berg, teacher,

[02:26:45.970 --> 02:26:47.810]
Prometheus Methods Tower Service Inc.

[02:26:48.430 --> 02:26:49.450]
That's Nick Berg's father.

[02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:52.050]
Michael O'Wax is a business manager for a son

[02:26:52.050 --> 02:26:53.830]
and their family radio communications firm,

[02:26:54.250 --> 02:26:55.670]
Prometheus Methods Tower Service.

[02:26:56.970 --> 02:26:59.170]
Both father and son cared deeply about Iraq,

[02:26:59.350 --> 02:27:01.650]
but they were on opposite sides of opinion on the occupation,

[02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:03.950]
though you would never know that from meeting the New York Times.

[02:27:04.530 --> 02:27:06.130]
Michael was ardently anti-war,

[02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:09.270]
where his voice supporting son was in favor of the word of the extent

[02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:10.490]
that he had already visited Iraq,

[02:27:10.650 --> 02:27:12.250]
seeking to help with rebuilding efforts.

[02:27:13.170 --> 02:27:14.950]
Just seven days after Michael Berg

[02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:17.210]
and Prometheus Methods Tower Service had come up

[02:27:17.210 --> 02:27:19.810]
on that Iraq war enemies list his son, Nick Berg,

[02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:23.230]
returned to Iraq under the business name of Prometheus Methods Tower Service.

[02:27:24.050 --> 02:27:27.150]
The scene was set for tragically mistaken suspicions,

[02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:30.430]
which were to end in the horrifying death of an honorable and blaneless American.

[02:27:31.170 --> 02:27:33.990]
A humanitarian who had traveled several times to third world countries,

[02:27:33.990 --> 02:27:36.750]
such as Ghana, to teach villagers construction techniques.

[02:27:37.470 --> 02:27:40.630]
The web traffic to the Free Republic Forum and its forum membership

[02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:43.250]
includes significant numbers of serving and former US military.

[02:27:43.770 --> 02:27:46.250]
Many members take their online activism very seriously.

[02:27:46.250 --> 02:27:50.090]
Some delight in causing mischief for those they think are identified as enemies.

[02:27:50.810 --> 02:27:53.110]
Within minutes of getting their hands on the anti-war names,

[02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:55.390]
one was both in having contact with the military about

[02:27:55.390 --> 02:27:57.690]
active service personnel who were on the list.

[02:27:58.310 --> 02:28:00.110]
I forwarded the list to the IFC,

[02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:01.910]
the commanduelist, the district officer,

[02:28:02.350 --> 02:28:03.190]
the district legal officer,

[02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:04.890]
and the investigative services office.

[02:28:05.350 --> 02:28:08.170]
The response, the poor moron is not going to know what hit him.

[02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:09.550]
Is this being mean spirited?

[02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:12.610]
No, someone against our military does not belong in the military.

[02:28:13.390 --> 02:28:16.330]
Another was already investigating a member of the Coast Guard on the list.

[02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:20.650]
I took a look at this Yahoo and he has a site

[02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:23.790]
which is not real fond of the war on drugs or the war on terrorism.

[02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:26.690]
That particular coastie needs some serious trouble to come his way.

[02:28:27.470 --> 02:28:30.230]
Another one I spoke on the phone with senior chief yesterday in Virginia

[02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:31.770]
who could not believe what the guy was doing.

[02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:33.330]
It was both astounded and angry.

[02:28:33.430 --> 02:28:35.010]
I think he's in for some big, big trouble.

[02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:37.990]
If that list could end up on an internet forum,

[02:28:38.130 --> 02:28:39.850]
there could just as readily end up with the FBI

[02:28:39.850 --> 02:28:41.910]
and eventually in the hands of those in Iraq who are keen

[02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:45.030]
to track or harass anti-war activists entering the country.

[02:28:46.030 --> 02:28:48.050]
Alternatively, the enthusiast on free republic

[02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:49.770]
had the contacts in the clear determination

[02:28:49.770 --> 02:28:52.290]
to have insured the list quickly got to the right places.

[02:28:53.430 --> 02:28:54.770]
At the time the list was posted,

[02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:59.190]
Nick Berge just come back from an Iraq trip lasting from late December to February 1st.

[02:28:59.190 --> 02:29:00.910]
He had reported no problems whatsoever

[02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:02.530]
with the Iraqi police during that visit.

[02:29:03.250 --> 02:29:05.070]
Here within the two weeks of the list being posted,

[02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:06.790]
Nick Berge, back on Iraq,

[02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:09.870]
on his final fatal trip, was reportedly detained in Mosul

[02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:11.450]
at an Iraqi police checkpoint.

[02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:13.910]
The official explanation is that authority started

[02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:15.450]
as identification might have been forged

[02:29:15.450 --> 02:29:17.010]
and were checking his authenticity.

[02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:19.870]
But a more likely reason is that by then,

[02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:21.930]
the authorities in Iraq had discovered that a burge

[02:29:21.930 --> 02:29:24.350]
of Prometheus Methods' tower service was in the country,

[02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:26.450]
and issued a detention instruction to Iraqi police

[02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:29.810]
because they misidentified Nick Berge as an anti-war activist entering Iraq

[02:29:29.810 --> 02:29:31.090]
to work for the enemy.

[02:29:32.130 --> 02:29:34.910]
That could explain why he was held in Communicado for 13 days

[02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:36.090]
without recourse to a lawyer,

[02:29:36.510 --> 02:29:39.410]
why US officials, then, were singularly on heating of his mother's pleas,

[02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:42.050]
why the FBI visited his family to question them,

[02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:45.190]
why it took a US court order secured by the family to pressure his release,

[02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:47.790]
and why he was cruelly murdered soon after that release,

[02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:49.550]
like many others around the world of suffrage

[02:29:49.550 --> 02:29:52.070]
that have faded the hands of state-candone death squads,

[02:29:52.330 --> 02:29:54.750]
sometimes just hours after the release from official detention.

[02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:57.690]
That's the final sort of twist in this grizzly story.

[02:29:59.150 --> 02:30:01.130]
If the world was an uncomplicated place,

[02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:03.990]
then this tale would end with a mistake in arrest of Nick Berge.

[02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:05.530]
We could finish by noting that Nick's father

[02:30:05.530 --> 02:30:08.890]
is reportedly accusing the US government of contributing to his son's death.

[02:30:09.390 --> 02:30:10.710]
Unable to find work in Iraq,

[02:30:10.970 --> 02:30:12.570]
Nick Berge's last trip was said to be a short one.

[02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:14.670]
He planned to return to the US on the 30th of March.

[02:30:15.390 --> 02:30:17.630]
Michael Berg charges that his son's detention to April 5

[02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:18.910]
was a violation of civil rights,

[02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:21.330]
which fatally delayed his exit from Iraq

[02:30:21.330 --> 02:30:23.010]
and instead left him dangerfully stranded

[02:30:23.010 --> 02:30:25.210]
in the middle of the explosion of violence

[02:30:25.210 --> 02:30:27.010]
which erupted early April 2004.

[02:30:28.930 --> 02:30:31.430]
But there are much graver aspects to all of this.

[02:30:31.770 --> 02:30:33.770]
Another chilling perspective is best summarized

[02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:35.410]
by the war cynicism of Michael Rivera

[02:30:35.410 --> 02:30:37.450]
at what really happened.com.

[02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:41.810]
In a commentary on the beheading of Nick Berge,

[02:30:41.890 --> 02:30:42.450]
Rivera writes,

[02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:44.830]
how wonderfully lucky for Bush and the Neocons

[02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:46.450]
that such a great piece of pro-war distract

[02:30:46.450 --> 02:30:49.630]
from the torture scandal event happens at this particular moment.

[02:30:50.450 --> 02:30:51.810]
Rivera's world-wary realism

[02:30:51.810 --> 02:30:53.950]
strikes a chord with his popular website's visitors

[02:30:53.950 --> 02:30:56.410]
who will undoubtedly shock unseasoned observers.

[02:30:56.990 --> 02:30:59.650]
However, he is far from alone in questioning the official line,

[02:31:00.050 --> 02:31:01.630]
others have noted the two white hands

[02:31:01.630 --> 02:31:04.450]
and military eddies' stance of the hood of captors in the video.

[02:31:04.450 --> 02:31:05.870]
The killing is certainly

[02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:07.830]
eased the international discomfort of the U.S.

[02:31:08.210 --> 02:31:10.370]
The problem with assumptions that Al Qaeda's responsible

[02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:12.710]
for Berge's beheading is that Musab al-Zakari

[02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:15.310]
has mentioned a caption on the videotape of the killing.

[02:31:16.090 --> 02:31:18.690]
Al Zarkawi came to our attention in January 2004

[02:31:18.690 --> 02:31:20.750]
when the U.S. military claimed to have intercepted

[02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:22.330]
a letter of his written to the Al Qaeda leadership

[02:31:22.330 --> 02:31:23.650]
but the content of the letter

[02:31:23.650 --> 02:31:25.490]
read like a U.S. military propaganda statement

[02:31:25.490 --> 02:31:26.510]
on the situation in Iraq.

[02:31:27.390 --> 02:31:29.070]
In the letter, Al Zarkawi wrote of Iraq

[02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:30.910]
he's coming to welcome the U.S. presence in Iraq

[02:31:30.910 --> 02:31:33.090]
and how about how Al Qaeda was losing ground

[02:31:33.090 --> 02:31:34.230]
and its war against the U.S.

[02:31:35.050 --> 02:31:38.130]
In February 2004, an article titled these are

[02:31:38.130 --> 02:31:40.310]
Qawi-Gandit by Greg Weihar on counterpunch

[02:31:40.310 --> 02:31:41.650]
was deeply skeptical of the letter.

[02:31:42.390 --> 02:31:43.290]
If you were Carl Roe,

[02:31:43.330 --> 02:31:45.070]
you couldn't design a better scenario to validate

[02:31:45.070 --> 02:31:46.790]
the administration's slant on the war than this.

[02:31:47.230 --> 02:31:49.330]
That's a good reason to maintain a healthy skepticism.

[02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:51.630]
In fact, there are a number of good reasons to take this story

[02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:53.570]
with a grain of salt, maybe three or four-pounder.

[02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:57.490]
The U.S. has been keen to paint the opposition to the occupations

[02:31:57.490 --> 02:31:59.630]
composed of many foreign fighters tied to Al Qaeda.

[02:32:00.050 --> 02:32:01.350]
The letter was clearly fabricated

[02:32:01.350 --> 02:32:03.490]
from propaganda purposes with Al Zarkawi

[02:32:03.490 --> 02:32:04.690]
as its new Al Qaeda star.

[02:32:05.130 --> 02:32:08.030]
But if Al Zarkawi is merely a flimsy propaganda creation,

[02:32:08.370 --> 02:32:10.530]
then what confidence can we have in the official line

[02:32:10.530 --> 02:32:12.210]
that Al Zarkawi and Al Qaeda murdered bird?

[02:32:13.090 --> 02:32:16.050]
The only plausible alternative is a covert black operation

[02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:19.190]
orchestrated as part of the senior arm of U.S. foreign policy,

[02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:21.550]
which generally only come to light when candid photographs,

[02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:23.370]
for example, reach the public domain.

[02:32:24.090 --> 02:32:26.670]
But that's an explanation which many would reject on the grounds

[02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:28.170]
that no force allowed to the U.S.

[02:32:28.170 --> 02:32:31.450]
no matter how black its operations would have members so calluses

[02:32:31.450 --> 02:32:34.290]
to even countenance the cold blood and beheading of a U.S. citizen.

[02:32:34.770 --> 02:32:37.010]
However, there's a mindset amplified by war passions

[02:32:37.010 --> 02:32:39.930]
and found among the gung-hole broots who beat Iraqis to death.

[02:32:40.410 --> 02:32:43.350]
Found among the thuggish mercenary dead squads who roam the sleigh at will,

[02:32:43.770 --> 02:32:46.290]
and found among the cold blooded sociopaths who planted bombs

[02:32:46.290 --> 02:32:48.110]
for political strategic reasons.

[02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:50.770]
Its war and war begins a wartime mindset.

[02:32:51.690 --> 02:32:53.630]
Nick Bergs' detention indicates that the authorities

[02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:55.210]
regarded him as an anti-war activist

[02:32:55.210 --> 02:32:58.370]
and possibly also an enemy that original post on a free republic

[02:32:58.370 --> 02:33:01.750]
contains a telling indication of a mindset which in the heat of work

[02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:03.850]
could well kill an American regardless of the enemy.

[02:33:04.330 --> 02:33:07.590]
A mindset which is now reacted to Michael Bergs' loss of his son like this.

[02:33:08.170 --> 02:33:10.430]
I wonder what he thinks about his Muslim buddies now.

[02:33:11.430 --> 02:33:14.290]
A mindset displayed by such keywords used on a free republic

[02:33:14.290 --> 02:33:16.730]
to categorize the list of anti-war supporters.

[02:33:16.930 --> 02:33:20.410]
The keywords are of Peasnix, Dan Commies, Enemy Within,

[02:33:20.890 --> 02:33:24.550]
Lettists, Peasnix, rats, scumbags, traitors,

[02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:27.690]
treasinus.com, use the idiots and war on terror.

[02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:30.610]
And yes, we did use the one word because it's in a news story

[02:33:30.610 --> 02:33:32.410]
and you better not have dumped it.

[02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:33.130]
I waited a month.

[02:33:34.210 --> 02:33:35.050]
He was reaching for it.

[02:33:35.490 --> 02:33:36.730]
It was a news story.

[02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:37.530]
Okay, it's a month.

[02:33:38.470 --> 02:33:39.830]
So there you go, that's so that,

[02:33:39.970 --> 02:33:42.230]
and you can take that with the, like I said, two or three grains of salt

[02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:43.490]
or not believe it or whatever you want.

[02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:46.670]
But certainly the first part about the company.

[02:33:46.990 --> 02:33:47.210]
Sure.

[02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:50.070]
And about the confusion about the father and the son,

[02:33:50.170 --> 02:33:51.830]
their political opinions and their position on the wall,

[02:33:51.970 --> 02:33:52.430]
all these things.

[02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:54.550]
Hey, presidents and senators don't have people.

[02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:54.930]

[02:33:55.470 --> 02:33:55.550]
Right.

[02:33:55.690 --> 02:33:56.670]
Who's being naive now?

[02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.490]
Schmuck.

[02:33:58.750 --> 02:34:01.330]

[02:34:06.970 --> 02:34:07.710]
and H.D. receiver.

[02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:11.030]
The picture is so absolutely unfailable.

[02:34:11.170 --> 02:34:11.870]
You won't believe it.

[02:34:12.030 --> 02:34:15.190]

And Vum's got over 30 channels.

[02:34:29.890 --> 02:34:30.890]

Of HD programming, you can watch ESPN and high definition.

[02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:35.330]

UAM.

[02:35:21.430 --> 02:35:24.130]
A poll show the American people are concerned

[02:35:24.130 --> 02:35:25.730]
about the gigantic budget deficit.

[02:35:26.010 --> 02:35:27.330]
Yeah, I understand.

[02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:28.510]
Hey, I got an idea.

[02:35:28.890 --> 02:35:29.730]
Let's cut taxes.

[02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:34.790]
This man suffers from a serious affliction called DADD.

[02:35:35.090 --> 02:35:37.170]
Deposit Attention Deposit Disorder.

[02:35:37.570 --> 02:35:38.670]
But he's not alone.

[02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:42.710]
Senator Perry, what will you do about the budget deficit?

[02:35:42.910 --> 02:35:48.490]
We need to increase taxes, but not quite as much as we increase spending.

[02:35:48.770 --> 02:35:53.230]
Virtually every politician suffers from deficit attention deficit disorder.

[02:35:53.550 --> 02:35:57.910]
Those affected are enabled to stop spending more money than they're bringing in.

[02:35:58.390 --> 02:36:02.810]
And now, alarmingly, DADD has spread to the general population.

[02:36:03.130 --> 02:36:04.970]
Honey, look at this credit card bill.

[02:36:05.290 --> 02:36:07.350]
You're right. We've got to do something.

[02:36:07.350 --> 02:36:10.850]
Oh, look! It's green TV, that's sales.

[02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:12.390]
Let's go!

[02:36:13.310 --> 02:36:17.030]
Please, get generously to the DADD fund.

[02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:20.150]
And we'll spend more on research than we get in donations,

[02:36:20.210 --> 02:36:23.890]
because we too suffer from deficit attention deficit disorder.

[02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:27.690]
Until we find a cure for spending the money you can't afford to send us,

[02:36:27.890 --> 02:36:29.650]
we'll be forever in your debt.

What's your number one complaint?

[02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:34.570]
Bush is destroying America.

[02:36:34.570 --> 02:36:36.930]

I live in Florida 18 and pretty peered about it.

[02:36:56.170 --> 02:36:58.730]
Lots of heart sounds on the Eurodger show 18.

[02:36:59.310 --> 02:37:01.050]
Moe Howard David had still on year 16.

[02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:11.410]
The child supports system 3.

[02:37:11.770 --> 02:37:13.490]
It's too human with 1.0.

[02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:15.090]
It's too human 1.

[02:37:15.790 --> 02:37:18.950]
Giant mosquito is 1 and the Miami Herald's only got 1 out of 841.

[02:37:19.650 --> 02:37:21.350]
He's only got 1 in 2.

[02:37:23.430 --> 02:37:24.930]
8, 2, brute.

[02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:29.510]
How come we don't have homeless people on every street corner like this facts

[02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:30.870]
that we got that's an excellent one.

[02:37:32.390 --> 02:37:33.330]
What do you mean we don't?

[02:37:33.890 --> 02:37:35.190]
Do we have the homeless voice?

[02:37:36.830 --> 02:37:38.470]
Oh, on the... on the pole there?

[02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:39.110]
Right.

[02:37:39.810 --> 02:37:40.830]
Did we mention it yet?

[02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:44.910]
Well, no, I just got the facts you sent me here from this is very creative from our friend Jean.

[02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:45.410]
Yeah, no, no.

[02:37:45.410 --> 02:37:47.330]
And the homeless says homeless people on every street corner.

[02:37:47.470 --> 02:37:48.930]
We want to be more specific than that.

[02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:53.050]
We want to talk about Sean Canoney and the homeless voice, Josh.

[02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:54.750]
Homeless voice. Got it? Good.

[02:37:54.970 --> 02:37:55.890]
Yeah, it's on the...

[02:37:55.890 --> 02:37:58.110]
People I hate it can't stand it.

[02:37:58.110 --> 02:37:59.570]
They're tattivates to be against the law.

[02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:02.710]
Now, see you got me started now.

[02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:03.990]
I don't know what really got sent me off.

[02:38:04.010 --> 02:38:07.730]
I think it was that debate between that right when I lunatic from California Dennis Cassinich.

[02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:12.910]
It was that the so-called debate in which they let Dennis say about 10 words.

[02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:14.430]
Thought third man.

[02:38:15.370 --> 02:38:19.390]
And then of course the net story that I just breathlessly found on the drudgery tort.

[02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:20.730]
That's with two T's.

[02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:26.290]
And this one from the nation exporting America's prison problems by Dan Frosh.

[02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:33.990]
In 1997 a 29 year old schizophrenic inmate named Michael Valent was stripped naked and strapped to a restraining chair by Utah prison staff

[02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:36.570]
because he refused to take a pillowcase office head.

[02:38:36.970 --> 02:38:42.510]
Shortly after he was released some 16 hours later, Valent collapsed and died from a blood clot that blocked an artery to his heart.

[02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:51.890]
The chilling incident made national news not only because it happened to be videotape but also because Valent's family successfully sued the state of Utah and forced it to stop using the device.

[02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:59.350]
Directed the Utah Department of Corrections Lane Maccorder who was named in the suit and defeated the chair resigned in the ensuing firestorm.

[02:38:59.790 --> 02:39:13.150]
Some six years later Lane Maccorder was working in Abu Ghraib prison, part of a former anti-movic congressional adviser sent by the Justice Department and charged with a sensitive mission of reconstructing or vaccinate notorious prisons ravaged by decades of human rights abuse.

[02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:20.850]
While Maccorder left her back shortly before the current scandal, double-grave began and says he had nothing to do with the MPs of committee of atrocities,

[02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:25.690]
is very presence there raises serious questions about US handling of the Iraqi prison system.

[02:39:26.650 --> 02:39:32.210]
It's bad enough that the Justice Department pick Maccorder, who's reputation in Utah was at best controversial and a worth disturbing,

[02:39:32.610 --> 02:39:41.970]
but further the Justice Department hired him less than three months after its own civil rights division released a shocking 36 page report documenting inhumane conditions adding to Mexico jail,

[02:39:41.970 --> 02:39:44.510]
run by the company where Maccorder is an executive.

[02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:49.970]
Here was a man whose prisons have been played by reports of inmate mistreatment for nearly a decade,

[02:39:50.430 --> 02:39:56.710]
Lane Maccorder's administration here had a horrifying record on human rights, said Carol Canade in 2002.

[02:39:58.870 --> 02:40:05.510]
Indeed, around the same time Michael Vellant died, Gen. C. Anderson, then a lawyer for the group interviewed close to 40 Middle East inmates,

[02:40:06.410 --> 02:40:07.770]
who had also been restrained in the chair.

[02:40:07.770 --> 02:40:11.370]
We found out they were being kept there for far longer than necessary, says Anderson.

[02:40:12.390 --> 02:40:16.190]
There were cases where inmates ended up sitting in their own feces, they were being tortured.

[02:40:16.970 --> 02:40:23.910]
Shortly after Vellant's family went to court, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against three Utah DOC doctors this time for vinding a mentally ill man,

[02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:28.590]
Nick had saved his underwear to a stainless steel pallet called the board for 85 straight days.

[02:40:29.310 --> 02:40:31.890]
That case was settled out according to newspaper reports.

[02:40:31.890 --> 02:40:37.770]
Generally under Maccorder's rule, human rights were not respected, no, Anderson, after he left things improved a great deal.

[02:40:38.470 --> 02:40:43.730]
But there were soon to become more since Santa Fe, New Mexico, where county officials decided to hire management and training corporation,

[02:40:44.290 --> 02:40:46.850]
a private Utah based corrections company to run its jail.

[02:40:47.210 --> 02:40:50.910]
Maccorder was at habit now worked as MTC's director of corrections business development.

[02:40:51.610 --> 02:40:56.170]
In August 2001, Maccorder won secretariat corrections in New Mexico, traveled to Santa Fe,

[02:40:56.170 --> 02:41:01.330]
to finalize MTC's three-year contract to operate the Santa Fe County Detention Center.

[02:41:01.770 --> 02:41:08.130]
Less than a year later, a team of justice department correctional experts was inside the Santa Fe jail investigating civil rights violations.

[02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:13.790]
In March 2003, the report concluded that certain conditions violated inmates' constitutional rights,

[02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:17.570]
and that inmates suffered harm at the risk of serious harm from among other things,

[02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:20.310]
wolf-filled efficiencies in healthcare and basic living conditions.

[02:41:20.310 --> 02:41:25.690]
The report documented numerous and horrifying examples, and threatened to lawsuit if things didn't get better.

[02:41:25.790 --> 02:41:30.450]
Amid the fallout, the justice department pulled its approximately 100 federal prisoners out of Santa Fe,

[02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:37.230]
an MTC fired its warden and pressured its medical subcrime tractor, positions network association to acts one of its medical administrators.

[02:41:37.810 --> 02:41:42.550]
Then on May 20th, in a case of unfathomable irony, it's really a general John Ascroft announced,

[02:41:42.970 --> 02:41:45.710]
that Maccorder along with three other corrections experts had gone to Iraq.

[02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:51.450]
The very same day, Justice Department lawyers began their first negotiations with Santa County officials

[02:41:51.450 --> 02:41:55.230]
over the extensive changes needed at the jail to avoid legal action.

[02:41:56.830 --> 02:42:03.390]
The Justice Department will comment on why it chose Maccorder, whose company has been hounded by well-publicized and ongoing healthcare security

[02:42:03.390 --> 02:42:07.450]
and personnel problems at many of the 13 persons that operates in the U.S. Australian Canada.

[02:42:07.890 --> 02:42:11.290]
Meanwhile, the Ontario Provincial Government is currently investigating an inmate death,

[02:42:11.290 --> 02:42:16.430]
an MTC's Canadian prison on May 5th, and inquest into three other mysterious deaths over the past year expected,

[02:42:16.730 --> 02:42:18.570]
according to an article in the very examiner.

[02:42:19.410 --> 02:42:25.010]
In a May 7 statement, Maccorder emphasized that he was mainly in Iraq to oversee the structural renovation of Iraqi prisons,

[02:42:25.390 --> 02:42:29.950]
and to train Iraqi citizens for correctional duties, he stated that there were no inmates at Abu Ghraib,

[02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:32.290]
while he was therein that he never supervised military personnel.

[02:42:32.970 --> 02:42:37.710]
According to Gary Delaand, also a member of the correctional team in Maccorder's predecessor at the Utah DOC,

[02:42:37.710 --> 02:42:41.390]
the two of them worked along with the Battle Brigadier General Janis Karpinski,

[02:42:41.950 --> 02:42:45.330]
an MP's from various battalions, but that none of the faces on television looked familiar.

[02:42:46.530 --> 02:42:51.910]
Delaand says the Justice Department paid him $8,500 a month while he was in Iraq before bumping his salary up to 12 grand a month

[02:42:51.910 --> 02:42:53.470]
toward the end of the four-month trip.

[02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:57.010]
He defends Maccorder as one of the very best correction administrators I've ever met.

[02:42:57.770 --> 02:43:00.310]
Judy Greene, a prison-reformed consultant, disagrees.

[02:43:00.890 --> 02:43:04.330]
There are any number of correctional administrators active or retired that had good records,

[02:43:04.330 --> 02:43:07.690]
in whom I would rather see in tap by the Justice Department for this kind of assignment,

[02:43:08.130 --> 02:43:11.710]
Maccorder was no expert in how prisoners should be treated or how prison staff should be trained.

[02:43:12.350 --> 02:43:16.270]
Interestingly, Chase Rievelin, former secretary of corrections both in Washington and Colorado,

[02:43:16.730 --> 02:43:20.070]
who green says his respected both by prison reformists and correction administrators,

[02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:22.390]
turned out an offer to join the Justice Department's team,

[02:43:22.830 --> 02:43:26.710]
the philosophies of the individuals that were going did not match mine, Rievelin told the nation.

[02:43:27.770 --> 02:43:32.370]
While it seems unlikely Lane Maccorder was involved in the unfolding abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib,

[02:43:32.370 --> 02:43:36.410]
his hiring given his troubled history and current employment at the equally troubled MTCs,

[02:43:36.410 --> 02:43:40.550]
and another example of the unending and unabashed bumping of the occupation.

[02:43:40.890 --> 02:43:45.430]
Perhaps most important, if this is the type of personnel decision we can expect from critical agencies

[02:43:45.430 --> 02:43:48.750]
like the Justice Department, there's probably more scandal to come.

[02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:51.070]
And I would say absolutely correct.

[02:43:51.570 --> 02:43:52.250]
I do like that.

[02:43:52.770 --> 02:43:55.430]
Just like this general Jean Miller,

[02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:58.670]
that was transferred from a Gitmo over to Iraq,

[02:43:59.790 --> 02:44:02.490]
known as the lunatic of Gitmo.

[02:44:02.890 --> 02:44:08.070]
How can you say that if he wanted to give Mo at Gitmo, more punishment, more abuse.

[02:44:09.130 --> 02:44:10.830]
And so when the heat became real great there,

[02:44:10.970 --> 02:44:13.570]
what do they do? They transfer them over to Iraq where he can really straight things out.

[02:44:13.650 --> 02:44:14.630]
Like the Catholic Church.

[02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:18.390]
Exactly. Move them around a little bit. Sounds good to me.

[02:44:20.590 --> 02:44:24.790]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. WDQAM, hello.

[02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:27.130]
QAM.

[02:44:27.130 --> 02:44:28.170]
Hello. Yes, sir.

[02:44:29.010 --> 02:44:30.470]
Neil. Yes, I am.

[02:44:32.750 --> 02:44:35.310]
Neil, regarding your whole foot today.

[02:44:35.810 --> 02:44:36.870]
That's Reverend Jones again.

[02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:38.250]
How sad.

[02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:46.530]
5670560, well see he's only one of the few crazy people that we read through all that reading I did there all the time.

[02:44:47.050 --> 02:44:50.310]
He'd be one of the very few people. He's valuable enough. He's patient.

[02:44:50.810 --> 02:44:53.390]
Plus. I have no life. WDQAM, hello.

[02:44:54.470 --> 02:44:55.130]
Hi, view.

[02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:56.170]
Yes, sir.

[02:44:56.890 --> 02:45:02.130]
I just like to say that I've come out with the seminar on the game.

[02:45:02.270 --> 02:45:05.770]
Okay, great. I can't wait. Reverend Jones and his boyfriend that you're beside by each.

[02:45:06.650 --> 02:45:11.570]
A perfect and exacta seminar on on that. We can't wait.

[02:45:12.410 --> 02:45:15.190]
26 after one at 560. Don't forget to join the big O.

[02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:18.550]
4 to 6 this afternoon at the new Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood.

[02:45:18.730 --> 02:45:20.010]
Stop by the spin the wheel for prizes.

[02:45:20.010 --> 02:45:24.750]
That's if they brand new Seminole Hard Rock Casino with the big 4 this afternoon 4 to 6.

[02:45:25.970 --> 02:45:30.250]
When you got your hair fallen out in chunks when you got like a cue ball on your head instead of like a real good head of hair.

[02:45:30.430 --> 02:45:33.970]
If you were one of those mousey looking pieces people will laugh their ass off at you.

[02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:34.410]
I bet you.

[02:45:35.330 --> 02:45:38.830]
If Dennis Gassini would have gotten with it a long time ago he'd have had some votes, you know.

[02:45:39.730 --> 02:45:41.810]
He waited too long to get himself a good head of hair.

[02:45:41.890 --> 02:45:47.550]
Well, you guys out there don't have to wait long. All you have to do is call our good buddy Charles Alfieri because he's designed and supplied hair systems.

[02:45:47.550 --> 02:45:52.610]
The big guys, the little guys, important guys, slappers, everybody in between for more than 35 years.

[02:45:52.910 --> 02:45:54.630]
He's appeared as a guest on Good Morning America.

[02:45:54.750 --> 02:45:57.930]
They today show in CBS Morning News introducing his panted hair system.

[02:45:58.070 --> 02:46:01.150]
They'll pursue the most amazing natural hairline system anywhere.

[02:46:01.690 --> 02:46:07.250]
Now keep in mind the most critical area of any hair system is the hairline and Charlie's new skin like hair system is so great looking.

[02:46:07.350 --> 02:46:11.350]
It's 100% on detectable and Charlie gives you a 30 day guarantee.

[02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:14.430]
What's not to like if you don't after a month love the way listen feels and smells.

[02:46:14.430 --> 02:46:24.470]
Return it for a full refund so I'd have to lose his that glaring shiny vault spot or that mousey looking piece and keep in mind Charlie also services and repairs existing hair systems including shampoo and trim.

[02:46:24.750 --> 02:46:27.090]
So don't delay call Charlie today and change your life forever.

[02:46:27.530 --> 02:46:32.490]
Look better and younger than you ever dreamed you could call 1-800-321-2413.

[02:46:32.830 --> 02:46:34.070]
Say goodbye to that muskrat.

[02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.530]
Absolutely.

[02:46:34.810 --> 02:46:41.090]
It gets yourself a great looking head of hair. 1-800-321-2413 or go online, Charles Alfieri.com.

[02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:47.390]
This is your twin life signal. 2 AM.

[02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:52.150]
From the Vatican introducing new Catholic life.

[02:46:52.390 --> 02:46:54.930]
The religion with one third the guilt of your regular fate.

[02:46:55.490 --> 02:47:00.190]
New Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity but it doesn't fill you up with a lot of doctrine.

[02:47:00.750 --> 02:47:02.830]
More of a million! More of a million!

[02:47:02.830 --> 02:47:07.270]
But Catholic right there's no confessions no sermons and no lingering afterlife.

[02:47:07.450 --> 02:47:11.570]
It's the perfect alternative for modern agnostics who don't want to take any chances.

[02:47:11.890 --> 02:47:15.330]
Our services are held three times a year and they're only 15 minutes long.

[02:47:15.650 --> 02:47:19.450]
Plus there's no added guilt for sneaking out during communion. We've dropped that too.

[02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:21.930]
Look for our churchma beel in your neighborhood.

[02:47:22.370 --> 02:47:29.270]
Hey hey you might be in the front pew for ye of little faith try Catholic right because a little faith is all you need.

[02:47:30.850 --> 02:47:36.650]
131 and 560s by the way Spain of the Catholic Church. Mexico City you must have just made this up.

[02:47:36.870 --> 02:47:38.150]
Yeah that's right up.

[02:47:38.770 --> 02:47:47.970]
A Catholic priest shot to death the mayor of Attana in Western Mexico City early yesterday after the pier got drunk and began punching each other during a religious festival state official sin.

[02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:52.210]
Oh a drunken priest how unusual how religious festivals I don't believe you.

[02:47:52.630 --> 02:47:53.730]
After exchanging blows.

[02:47:56.530 --> 02:48:01.190]
Just walk away the priest whipped out.

[02:48:02.830 --> 02:48:05.950]
A nine millimeter pistol in quiet four bullets.

[02:48:07.290 --> 02:48:11.850]
Into Lorenzo Ruiz I wonder he's related to conchita Ruiz.

[02:48:12.010 --> 02:48:12.410]
Not anymore.

[02:48:12.790 --> 02:48:15.650]
Mayor of Chalpat the act.

[02:48:18.390 --> 02:48:21.310]
You do your clean it up and indigenous town.

[02:48:22.830 --> 02:48:27.590]
Nessled in the mountains 220 kilometers west of the Guerrero State Capitol of Chilpancingo.

[02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:28.430]
Authority said.

[02:48:28.850 --> 02:48:33.950]
It seems that they were arguing these two men they were they get together they had words in the pre shot the mayor.

[02:48:34.010 --> 02:48:37.310]
They're apparently were both in the state of drunkenness of Guerrero State spokesman.

[02:48:37.570 --> 02:48:45.110]
Jesus Nava local newspaper said the priest and they identified as Lorenzo Quayar was arrested after he also shot the mayor's son injuring him.

[02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:50.330]
The priest was in town to celebrate the local religious festival which started to the evening and lasted into Wednesday morning.

[02:48:50.810 --> 02:48:54.130]
Guerrero was one of the poorest and most violent states in Mexico.

[02:48:55.230 --> 02:49:01.490]
Thank goodness that the Catholic Church is such a calming and rational interest all over Latin America.

[02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:07.070]
And we have all these great democracies and people are living a very high standard living in all of these things.

[02:49:08.730 --> 02:49:11.510]
Fabulous not to mention of course the great job the pope did in Cuba.

[02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:16.670]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:49:17.450 --> 02:49:18.610]
WQ a hello.

[02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:32.650]
Hi I was wondering where the Catholic Church is denying democratic politicians that approach toys to receive a communion but they allow a child molesting priestess to receive communion.

[02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:34.590]
Because there are a bunch of liars and hypocrites.

[02:49:35.770 --> 02:49:36.470]
Love your show.

[02:49:37.470 --> 02:49:38.970]
Thanks we have a great day.

[02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:40.730]
She is coming with the mouthful of soda.

[02:49:41.650 --> 02:49:46.350]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:49:46.730 --> 02:49:50.230]
Oh I was pleased to see even though of course it only made a little blip for there too.

[02:49:50.610 --> 02:49:55.430]
Remember the story I had a couple of days ago about the school for the deaf in Boston.

[02:49:56.230 --> 02:50:04.090]
And the big scandal about that about the nuns that abused and molested and tortured and just horrendous things to all those poor kids and now.

[02:50:04.090 --> 02:50:09.390]
They sued a lot of these people sued and they actually headed on the end of the cable news networks there for a little while.

[02:50:09.390 --> 02:50:15.090]
You know how many times did we see it about one or two as opposed to everything else that we see at least 20 or a third of times.

[02:50:16.210 --> 02:50:17.170]
But it was on there.

[02:50:18.190 --> 02:50:21.030]
Just another example of one of these many isolated incidents.

[02:50:21.250 --> 02:50:27.990]
See when you are dealing with these sexually frustrated neurotic people priest non all of these people trying to live this very unnatural life.

[02:50:28.370 --> 02:50:31.030]
They wind up doing a lot of very unnatural grotesque things.

[02:50:31.030 --> 02:50:31.610]
What a shock.

[02:50:32.750 --> 02:50:42.350]
It's just like during war all of these grotesque horrendous things happen because generally the whole concept of war and killing other people especially when they didn't attack you in the first place is sick and twisted to begin with.

[02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:44.550]
Well I ran those planes into the middle.

[02:50:44.610 --> 02:50:47.250]
So it's amazing really when you come right down to it.

[02:50:47.930 --> 02:50:54.310]
And let me also just point out that the same rumsfeld when they asked him this morning if that dog and pony show they put on whether all the pictures should be released.

[02:50:54.570 --> 02:50:58.890]
He said yes if we're up to him but then again the legal eagles have to look through what he had yet.

[02:50:58.890 --> 02:51:09.910]
But for work to him that our shall also be released and then here we have that debated with Kucinich another there a wacko and he's going on about well you know they shouldn't permanently be put away somewhere nobody should be able to see him.

[02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:16.530]
Because that's the excuse now for a Nick Berg getting his head shot dog and it's the excuse for anything else that's going to happen.

[02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:20.810]
Of course they didn't need an excuse to chop off Daniel Pearl's head but don't confuse people with the facts.

[02:51:20.810 --> 02:51:37.770]
So they've already said that all the pictures ought to be released but isn't it something that there's all of this moral outrage about the torture and the humiliation and degradation of the Iraqi person is most of whom 79% and 90% of more arrested by mistake.

[02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:40.710]
Didn't do a damn thing and then of course they all there but they're terrorists.

[02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:41.350]
Yeah right.

[02:51:42.930 --> 02:51:50.830]
But the 16,000 civilians who have been named and killed and who's all these things nobody's even talking about them.

[02:51:51.090 --> 02:51:52.270]
You have to get one of the Brit newspapers.

[02:51:52.650 --> 02:52:10.450]
I think it's the daily mirror or the independent that changes the stats every week and shows you the latest up to the both the so called US and Brit what we call the coalition forces which is over 1200 now and then the Iraqis which is over 16,000 who knows what it is by now.

[02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:15.410]
I saw that last week because we don't care about those things.

[02:52:15.650 --> 02:52:17.870]
We don't want to be told we don't want to be bothered with that.

[02:52:18.050 --> 02:52:19.890]
It's just collateral damage of war.

[02:52:20.170 --> 02:52:22.210]
Well what kind of a war is this?

[02:52:23.290 --> 02:52:26.070]
Can you explain that to me where when did the war start?

[02:52:27.210 --> 02:52:29.890]
When they flew them planes into the building.

[02:52:30.190 --> 02:52:30.710]
Yeah right.

[02:52:31.350 --> 02:52:32.670]
When did Iraq start a war?

[02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:33.970]
When did they attack anybody?

[02:52:35.650 --> 02:52:37.210]
And I read it to you off the air.

[02:52:37.350 --> 02:52:38.170]
I think I hear how to read.

[02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:39.850]
I've got a whole bunch of crap.

[02:52:40.050 --> 02:52:40.750]
Oh that's okay.

[02:52:42.570 --> 02:52:49.510]
No I don't read that part about the invitation to Saddam to invade Iraq.

[02:52:49.890 --> 02:52:51.010]
I would to invade the Kuwait.

[02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:52.350]
Yodder.

[02:52:56.410 --> 02:52:58.750]
With these law or I'm just I'm looking by.

[02:52:58.850 --> 02:53:02.590]
By slant drilling into a shared Iraq Kuwait oilfields the Kuwaitis were able to flood the world market.

[02:53:02.590 --> 02:53:04.950]
They're by keeping the price per barrel with the US expectations.

[02:53:05.470 --> 02:53:11.770]
With these lower oil prices, Saddam's oil industry even in maximum production could barely generate enough money to pay the interest on the national debt.

[02:53:12.370 --> 02:53:15.590]
Despite repeated warnings to the system, Kuwaitis continued to provoke Saddam.

[02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:18.050]
Meanwhile the US was sending Iraq mixed signals.

[02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:24.730]
In January 1990, Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly met with Saddam and assured him that the US wanted to improve relations.

[02:53:25.390 --> 02:53:30.310]
By July 25th with the Kuwaitis crisis coming to a head, Iraqi troops massed along the border.

[02:53:30.310 --> 02:53:34.570]
Before acting however, Saddam deliberately sought clarification of the United States position.

[02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:38.790]
Ambassador April Glassbe met with Iraqi President Baghdad and said,

[02:53:39.270 --> 02:53:44.170]
We the USA have no opinion on Arab versus Arab conflicts like your border disagreement with Kuwait.

[02:53:44.570 --> 02:53:49.250]
Secretary of State James Baker has directed our official spokesman to emphasize this instruction.

[02:53:49.890 --> 02:53:53.450]
Taking this to be a green light, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait August 2nd 1990.

[02:53:54.190 --> 02:53:57.770]
It didn't take long for the West to develop a position on Arab Arab affairs.

[02:53:57.770 --> 02:54:03.710]
By August 6th, the US took the lead at the UN Security Council imposing full economic sanctions against Iraq.

[02:54:04.130 --> 02:54:07.970]
On the military, fraud general Schwartzkaw immediately began beefing up forces in the Persian Gulf.

[02:54:08.830 --> 02:54:12.610]
Selling the American people on the idea of going to world liberate Kuwait however would not prove easy.

[02:54:13.070 --> 02:54:20.350]
Since the 1973 oil crisis, the Gulf Arab's have been collectively vilified in the American media's rich fat cats who had crippled the US economy.

[02:54:20.730 --> 02:54:22.710]
It was therefore easier to demonize the Iraqis.

[02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:27.390]
This was accomplished in part through the gripping televised testimony of a young Kuwaiti girl.

[02:54:28.210 --> 02:54:36.650]
Claiming to have escaped following the Iraqi invasion, she described in excruciating detail how Saddam soldiers had entered the NEO NADLE ward at the Kuwaiti City Hospital,

[02:54:37.050 --> 02:54:39.410]
thrown sick babies out of their incubators and left them to die.

[02:54:40.110 --> 02:54:46.670]
Only after the war would be discovered this was a complete fabrication scripted and produced by the American public relations firm Rudr Finn.

[02:54:47.150 --> 02:54:51.890]
The young girl turned off the Kuwaiti ambassador's daughter who had been in Washington the whole time.

[02:54:52.150 --> 02:54:58.430]
No babies had ever been left to die but the deception had worked in the public support for military action in the Gulf, sword and yada yada yada.

[02:54:58.670 --> 02:55:00.930]
And as they say, the rest is crap.

[02:55:00.930 --> 02:55:03.190]
FLY IN AND LOCAL!

[02:55:03.490 --> 02:55:07.030]
Here's sports radio 560 she went to UAM.

[02:55:08.490 --> 02:55:09.250]
God.

[02:55:16.010 --> 02:55:24.930]
Turn around every time I drive my car into a gas station, the price is all in coming down around.

[02:55:24.930 --> 02:55:30.590]
Every now and then I try to make it to work with my gasket reading just to worry.

[02:55:32.010 --> 02:55:37.950]
Maybe I should call my boss and take a day off and go and drink all the beers I can buy.

[02:55:39.170 --> 02:55:44.890]
Every now and then I get to wondering how the gas prices have risen to high.

[02:55:44.890 --> 02:55:47.930]
Turn around my car.

[02:55:47.930 --> 02:55:53.270]
Do you feel it up? I have to get a load around my car.

[02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:56.010]
Why won't the swordy throw us a bomb?

[02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:59.230]
Nothing up cash in the bank.

[02:56:00.230 --> 02:56:03.050]
I am counting chains like a chum.

[02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:09.970]
What goods or water obtain to bother you go to the pump?

[02:56:10.810 --> 02:56:17.110]
If oil companies were in such homes, gas prices would slowly get better.

[02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:19.730]
There is the songies who are holding the line.

[02:56:20.190 --> 02:56:24.050]
Don't you remember what they did to us last time?

[02:56:25.090 --> 02:56:28.890]
I don't know what to do. We have to get some balls.

[02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:32.370]
We're running out of gas and on our costal.

[02:56:33.010 --> 02:56:35.010]
We have to get gas back.

[02:56:35.690 --> 02:56:38.570]
Not getting it from our rack.

[02:56:39.310 --> 02:56:41.610]
We're the waste of an attack.

[02:56:41.610 --> 02:56:44.310]
Once upon a time I could take the little.

[02:56:45.070 --> 02:56:47.210]
And now I take a bus like a chum.

[02:56:48.610 --> 02:56:52.490]
I don't know what to do. I total rip off out of power.

[02:56:53.590 --> 02:56:53.990]
Absolutely.

[02:56:56.930 --> 02:56:59.950]
I total rip off out of power.

[02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:06.890]
143 and I'm looking at Amazon.com. The good news is,

[02:57:06.890 --> 02:57:11.810]
the spinning on the axis of the evil America's war against Iraq is listed on there with five out of five stars.

[02:57:13.190 --> 02:57:13.990]
All right.

[02:57:14.750 --> 02:57:17.570]
And you can buy it in 1999, US, funds, 20 bucks.

[02:57:18.370 --> 02:57:20.770]
Paperback, but it's worth it to be the best 20 bucks you ever spent.

[02:57:20.910 --> 02:57:23.930]
The only bad news is it usually ships in three to four weeks,

[02:57:23.930 --> 02:57:25.890]
which is probably because it's a Canadian publisher.

[02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:33.350]
They write, in fact, during the next break I think I'm going to go on Amazon.ca.

[02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:36.210]
Okay. See what I'm saying?

[02:57:36.450 --> 02:57:40.110]
I do. By the way, they say that to cover their their asses,

[02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:43.590]
because I've ordered from Amazon and they ship right away no matter what they say.

[02:57:44.370 --> 02:57:45.170]
Really? Yeah.

[02:57:45.930 --> 02:57:48.070]
I mean, generally speaking within a couple days.

[02:57:49.610 --> 02:57:53.570]
Well, one moment, please. Let me do a, am I on? Am I on it now? I don't know.

[02:57:53.930 --> 02:57:54.790]
How do that happen?

[02:57:55.890 --> 02:57:59.110]
Let me just see. Spitting on the axis of evil. Here it is.

[02:57:59.210 --> 02:58:01.670]
And usually ship the same thing three to four weeks.

[02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:05.550]
But you'll have it no time at all. And what's the big rush anyway?

[02:58:05.870 --> 02:58:08.270]
We might all still be alive by then. Yeah, what's the big rush?

[02:58:08.450 --> 02:58:11.830]
Pop another one rush. WQAM, hello.

[02:58:12.310 --> 02:58:12.570]
Hello.

[02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:15.430]
WQAM, hello.

[02:58:17.850 --> 02:58:18.250]
QAM.

[02:58:19.070 --> 02:58:19.990]
Am I on it now?

[02:58:21.350 --> 02:58:24.170]
5, 6, 7, you're almost this entire hour.

[02:58:24.650 --> 02:58:27.670]
And I'm thinking to myself, why do I bother? Why do I waste time?

[02:58:27.870 --> 02:58:30.470]
I give myself all whipped up like I'm really, I'm impressed.

[02:58:30.470 --> 02:58:30.930]
Right.

[02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:35.790]
I'm amazed. I'm whipped up to a frenzy about all this stuff.

[02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:39.350]
And then we go to these calls, man, you could take your calls, folks,

[02:58:39.410 --> 02:58:42.090]
and you could stick up in a thimble and have room left over for the Chinese army

[02:58:42.090 --> 02:58:44.010]
for the number of meaningful crap.

[02:58:44.210 --> 02:58:45.650]
Even the cranks are bad.

[02:58:47.070 --> 02:58:48.090]
You don't want to say that?

[02:58:48.370 --> 02:58:49.190]
Low quality cranks.

[02:58:49.290 --> 02:58:51.630]
Low quality cranks. What are we talking about here?

[02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:53.330]
And again, prove it and be out of shadow of a doubt.

[02:58:53.610 --> 02:58:56.370]
They don't want to hear all of those bedtime stories, all that stuff that I read.

[02:58:56.610 --> 02:58:59.190]
The real story about Nick, whatever the hell is his name was,

[02:58:59.190 --> 02:59:01.390]
like I just had a drop dog, Berg. Berg.

[02:59:01.810 --> 02:59:03.150]
No relation to Oki Berg.

[02:59:03.810 --> 02:59:03.870]
Who?

[02:59:05.330 --> 02:59:06.010]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:08.510]
QAM.

[02:59:10.890 --> 02:59:11.530]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:59:12.450 --> 02:59:13.930]
Yeah, like, Niel?

[02:59:14.090 --> 02:59:14.430]
Speaking.

[02:59:16.430 --> 02:59:18.970]
Hey, this is your old buddy, the cradle Catholic.

[02:59:20.010 --> 02:59:22.990]
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions if I could.

[02:59:23.690 --> 02:59:24.130]
I'd love to.

[02:59:24.730 --> 02:59:25.750]
I love your show.

[02:59:26.030 --> 02:59:28.530]
I just want to ask you a couple of questions if I could.

[02:59:30.770 --> 02:59:34.110]
Do you think the Catholic Church, is there anything good about it?

[02:59:34.510 --> 02:59:34.770]
No.

[02:59:35.390 --> 02:59:35.990]
Not at all.

[02:59:36.450 --> 02:59:37.290]
No, any A religion.

[02:59:37.470 --> 02:59:38.010]
It's all crap.

[02:59:38.810 --> 02:59:39.130]
Okay.

[02:59:39.550 --> 02:59:39.750]
All right.

[02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:42.030]
Well, I do love your show.

[02:59:42.850 --> 02:59:44.970]
It just needs to be through the day every day.

[02:59:45.150 --> 02:59:45.450]
But I don't know.

[02:59:45.450 --> 02:59:47.110]
Well, did you just hear my answer to your question?

[02:59:47.230 --> 02:59:48.530]
Was that just a rhetorical question?

[02:59:49.170 --> 02:59:49.330]
No.

[02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:55.250]
You say that every religion is all sick and twisted and a bunch of lies in it for morons.

[02:59:55.250 --> 02:59:55.850]
Okay, sir.

[02:59:55.850 --> 02:59:57.170]
That's my answer to your question.

[02:59:57.250 --> 03:00:01.070]
It's for very, very weak, simple people who are stupid enough to believe a bunch of fairy tales,

[03:00:01.390 --> 03:00:05.430]
written by even more stupid people thousands of years ago and passed on word of mouth,

[03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:09.130]
generation to generation, and twisted and distorted and most of it made up anyway.

[03:00:10.210 --> 03:00:12.550]
To manipulate and control these stupid masses out there.

[03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:14.510]
And of course, for a great tax-free ride, too.

[03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:19.130]
Of course, in the Catholic Church, there are a lot of those priests like a tax-free ride.

[03:00:20.570 --> 03:00:21.250]
WDQAM, hello.

[03:00:21.930 --> 03:00:23.110]
Jesus, look at that.

[03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:24.390]
WDQAM, hello.

[03:00:24.890 --> 03:00:25.450]
Hey, Niel.

[03:00:34.210 --> 03:00:44.010]
Good afternoon, how are you doing?

[03:00:44.450 --> 03:00:44.710]
Okay, sir.

[03:00:44.990 --> 03:00:45.290]
Hey, man.

[03:00:45.410 --> 03:00:45.810]
Consonant.

[03:00:45.930 --> 03:00:47.550]
For president, man, I'm here.

[03:00:47.750 --> 03:00:48.190]
Okay, man.

[03:00:48.670 --> 03:00:49.350]
WDQAM, hello.

[03:00:49.910 --> 03:00:50.470]
Welcome, Niel.

[03:00:50.830 --> 03:00:50.970]
Yes.

[03:00:51.370 --> 03:00:52.330]
Good afternoon, sir.

[03:00:52.330 --> 03:00:52.970]
Good afternoon, sir.

[03:00:53.570 --> 03:00:54.150]
I'm sorry.

[03:00:54.250 --> 03:00:55.430]
Am I wrong?

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:55.430]

[03:00:55.430 --> 03:00:59.330]
read something earlier about nick burg and i didn't hear what any of it was about

[03:00:59.330 --> 03:01:00.710]
but was there anything

[03:01:01.210 --> 03:01:02.850]
familiar you know you know the claim in this

[03:01:03.570 --> 03:01:05.810]
these people were outkited with dandy purl

[03:01:05.810 --> 03:01:08.870]
what would they call them pack of standing extremists

[03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:11.850]
there uh... terrorists in the city right right

[03:01:11.850 --> 03:01:12.570]
but time-boss

[03:01:12.570 --> 03:01:14.450]
has a bit of a right

[03:01:15.170 --> 03:01:16.530]
but but with dandy purl

[03:01:16.530 --> 03:01:18.930]
one thing that the uh...

[03:01:18.930 --> 03:01:19.850]
the liberal media

[03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:21.990]
never uh...

[03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:24.510]
reported on was that they made him say

[03:01:24.510 --> 03:01:26.930]
my father that you my mother that you

[03:01:27.450 --> 03:01:31.470]

[03:01:31.470 --> 03:01:32.010]

[03:01:36.470 --> 03:01:37.510]
news shone had to be

[03:01:37.510 --> 03:01:40.070]
thirty seconds of audio on the air

[03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:43.190]
of uh... you know the actual whatever they were reading in the aerobic

[03:01:43.190 --> 03:01:46.190]
pop up a book and then the uh... slice off of his head and him screaming

[03:01:46.190 --> 03:01:47.290]
etc. and so on

[03:01:47.290 --> 03:01:50.350]
uh... he felt the compel to play that crap on the air

[03:01:50.350 --> 03:01:54.690]
you know they showed the father this guy put a sign out in front of his uh...

[03:01:54.690 --> 03:01:57.850]
of his house that said war is not the answer to just yet

[03:01:57.850 --> 03:02:00.950]

[03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:03.710]
going to put it on the story about nick bergen what really a may have happened

[03:02:03.710 --> 03:02:06.190]
over there in the fact that uh...

[03:02:06.190 --> 03:02:09.390]
right wing websites put his name on an enemy's list because they thought that he

[03:02:09.390 --> 03:02:11.030]
was opposed to the war which was his father

[03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:13.330]
and etc. so go on air and read it please

[03:02:16.850 --> 03:02:17.270]
uh...

[03:02:18.270 --> 03:02:20.830]
because you know i reckon he's right on top of it

[03:02:20.830 --> 03:02:22.290]
once he waits up man he's dangerous

[03:02:22.830 --> 03:02:26.390]
for some time on the weekend that until i two or three but once he waits up and

[03:02:26.390 --> 03:02:27.610]
gets going man is no stop

[03:02:29.530 --> 03:02:32.990]
let's see i just just take it a pic now to see if it's on her yet amma it's a

[03:02:32.990 --> 03:02:34.370]
little bit digested you know

[03:02:34.370 --> 03:02:35.530]
there's that cartoon

[03:02:35.530 --> 03:02:39.570]
there's classic civilizations by marine dot it's not under quite yet but i

[03:02:39.570 --> 03:02:41.730]
guarantee it will be any minute any moment

[03:02:41.730 --> 03:02:43.230]
specially if i mentioned again

[03:02:44.190 --> 03:02:48.170]
five six seven o five sixty pound five sixty on the eight t and t in for

[03:02:48.170 --> 03:02:48.590]
eyes and

[03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:49.750]
wireless line

[03:02:50.170 --> 03:02:50.870]
wqm hello

[03:02:51.890 --> 03:02:52.690]
yes sir

[03:02:52.690 --> 03:02:54.950]
you see the uh... new time vertical

[03:02:56.050 --> 03:02:56.450]
about

[03:02:57.030 --> 03:02:57.830]
demand it

[03:02:57.830 --> 03:03:01.190]
yeah we saw the i picked the readers uh... they picked your manager to

[03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:02.270]
speak to you thank you very much

[03:03:02.270 --> 03:03:05.050]
and that i was in the new times anyway that was in the city like

[03:03:06.150 --> 03:03:08.330]
rea you know really when you come right out of the show

[03:03:08.810 --> 03:03:10.610]
teaches you a lot

[03:03:10.610 --> 03:03:13.550]
yet because we know we keep sitting here lamenting the fact i mean

[03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:16.830]
how can the public be so stupid is that all of the stuff is going on and they

[03:03:16.830 --> 03:03:18.310]
believe it and they believe bush and

[03:03:18.310 --> 03:03:19.470]
and the poll show this

[03:03:19.470 --> 03:03:23.590]
the masses out there are so freaking dumb and it's unbelievable if you don't

[03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:26.390]
believe me especially sitting in that building just look around you

[03:03:26.390 --> 03:03:26.930]
my

[03:03:27.430 --> 03:03:28.190]
and look

[03:03:28.810 --> 03:03:30.430]
this is for trade-off i see

[03:03:31.070 --> 03:03:31.550]
way

[03:03:34.190 --> 03:03:36.670]
but got about it

[03:03:36.670 --> 03:03:37.590]
another thing

[03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:38.190]
we're

[03:03:38.190 --> 03:03:38.350]
that

[03:03:38.350 --> 03:03:39.090]
a bit

[03:03:41.070 --> 03:03:42.490]
voice

[03:03:42.490 --> 03:03:43.230]
and

[03:03:43.230 --> 03:03:44.010]
we

[03:03:44.010 --> 03:03:44.110]
and

[03:03:44.110 --> 03:03:44.390]
and

[03:03:46.510 --> 03:03:47.930]
and

[03:03:47.930 --> 03:03:48.710]
and

[03:03:48.710 --> 03:03:51.210]
and

[03:03:54.670 --> 03:03:54.830]
and

[03:03:59.610 --> 03:04:01.030]
and

[03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:01.270]
and

[03:04:01.270 --> 03:04:01.890]
and

[03:04:01.890 --> 03:04:01.890]

[03:04:01.890 --> 03:04:01.890]

[03:04:01.890 --> 03:04:01.890]

[03:04:01.890 --> 03:04:01.890]

[03:04:01.890 --> 03:04:02.570]
and

[03:04:14.190 --> 03:04:16.870]
and

[03:04:16.870 --> 03:04:17.030]
and

[03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:20.850]
and

[03:04:20.850 --> 03:04:21.070]
and

[03:04:21.070 --> 03:04:22.130]
and

[03:04:22.130 --> 03:04:23.750]
really

[03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.950]
and

[03:04:23.950 --> 03:04:23.950]

[03:04:23.950 --> 03:04:23.950]

[03:04:23.950 --> 03:04:23.950]

[03:04:23.950 --> 03:04:23.950]

[03:04:29.850 --> 03:04:32.530]
and

[03:04:32.530 --> 03:04:38.390]
Thank you! You still can't set yourself up.

[03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:44.570]
I feel just like that you are my little brother.

[03:04:46.430 --> 03:04:48.050]
And when you need to another.

[03:04:50.190 --> 03:04:52.710]
That's why you are still not by it.

[03:04:59.690 --> 03:05:01.350]
That's coach-black toy, toy?

[03:05:17.890 --> 03:05:20.910]
That's a losing exchange it's just over.

[03:05:21.750 --> 03:05:22.690]
So now, don't run

[03:05:22.690 --> 03:05:22.690]

[03:05:22.690 --> 03:05:22.690]

[03:05:22.690 --> 03:05:22.690]

[03:05:22.690 --> 03:05:23.970]
Alright, that's enough.

[03:05:25.090 --> 03:05:27.330]
156 at 560 WQAM.

[03:05:27.630 --> 03:05:30.630]
Yeah, I'm thinking of myself about this hour, you know?

[03:05:30.990 --> 03:05:31.250]
Yeah.

[03:05:31.430 --> 03:05:33.490]
Like a microcosm of my life in this market.

[03:05:33.610 --> 03:05:34.070]
Now, how are you?

[03:05:34.190 --> 03:05:35.470]
In these calls, these brilliant colors.

[03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:38.750]
And I'm thinking of myself about Ileon, for example.

[03:05:38.810 --> 03:05:39.870]
Just to use that as an example.

[03:05:40.030 --> 03:05:40.250]
Alright.

[03:05:40.770 --> 03:05:44.590]
To show you how easily the masses can be manipulated by the medium, by, you know,

[03:05:44.850 --> 03:05:48.110]
people will tell them that, oh, this is very important and you really ought to be very emotional about this.

[03:05:48.370 --> 03:05:50.950]
And you ought to go out the streets, you ought to be screaming and yelling and occurring on.

[03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:53.750]
Even though it didn't have a, it didn't have to do with anything.

[03:05:54.110 --> 03:05:54.290]
Right.

[03:05:55.230 --> 03:05:55.590]
Anything.

[03:05:56.310 --> 03:05:57.910]
Look, it was a child custody case.

[03:05:58.290 --> 03:05:58.450]
Right.

[03:05:58.790 --> 03:06:03.570]
It's like when we have one of these missing girls and they just decided to me to, oh well,

[03:06:04.010 --> 03:06:06.510]
there's some kind of an interesting story there, you know?

[03:06:06.610 --> 03:06:09.130]
There's some kind of a real, a folksy story behind that.

[03:06:09.290 --> 03:06:10.570]
So let's really get carried away.

[03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:13.590]
There might be 50,000 missing people on the same day.

[03:06:14.330 --> 03:06:14.690]
Right.

[03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:16.690]
But the meaning of this is, oh, this one's very important.

[03:06:16.770 --> 03:06:18.710]
You ought to be all whipped up into a frenzy about it.

[03:06:19.230 --> 03:06:20.910]
Just like Lacey Peterson.

[03:06:21.310 --> 03:06:24.950]
If I ever hear about Scott and Lacey Peterson again, it'll be so much too soon.

[03:06:25.070 --> 03:06:26.310]
I want to put my earplugs out.

[03:06:26.990 --> 03:06:27.530]
Too soon.

[03:06:27.810 --> 03:06:28.190]
Okay.

[03:06:28.730 --> 03:06:29.550]
You know, I'm saying.

[03:06:30.290 --> 03:06:30.430]
Yes.

[03:06:31.210 --> 03:06:33.450]
So this show really does a tremendous service.

[03:06:33.610 --> 03:06:36.430]
I would say there's a few people in South Florida with an intellect.

[03:06:36.530 --> 03:06:37.370]
But third man.

[03:06:37.550 --> 03:06:38.930]
I'm IQ larger than their thumbnail.

[03:06:39.230 --> 03:06:44.070]
And South Florida, other than that, is like a, it's like a dropping off point for the refuse of the human race.

[03:06:45.330 --> 03:06:46.510]
I'll be generous.

[03:06:46.690 --> 03:06:50.190]
I'll say maybe 15% of the people have an IQ larger than their thumbnail.

[03:06:50.230 --> 03:06:51.090]
You were too far.

[03:06:51.130 --> 03:06:51.830]
It's like a dropping.

[03:06:53.150 --> 03:06:53.670]
That's all.

[03:06:54.290 --> 03:06:55.050]
It's like what?

[03:06:55.430 --> 03:06:55.730]
A dropping.

[03:06:56.410 --> 03:06:57.250]
A dropping?

[03:06:57.570 --> 03:06:58.710]
You said a dropping off point.

[03:06:59.010 --> 03:06:59.870]
You could have stopped dropping.

[03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:00.230]

[03:07:00.430 --> 03:07:01.830]
I see like a pigeon, for example.

[03:07:01.890 --> 03:07:02.070]
Right.

[03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:05.270]
In other words, pigeon that we can't see on the ear.

[03:07:06.050 --> 03:07:07.470]
But I'm going to the call in line nine.

[03:07:07.470 --> 03:07:08.790]
We'll redeem this audience today.

[03:07:08.910 --> 03:07:09.510]
QAM, hello.

[03:07:09.870 --> 03:07:10.470]
A P.I.

[03:07:10.910 --> 03:07:11.970]
I told you.

[03:07:12.810 --> 03:07:13.830]
What an act there.

[03:07:13.830 --> 03:07:14.290]
Yeah, sure.

[03:07:14.830 --> 03:07:15.830]
I knew that would be the good one.

[03:07:16.490 --> 03:07:17.090]
WQM, hello.

[03:07:17.730 --> 03:07:18.090]
Retire.

[03:07:19.470 --> 03:07:21.850]
See, and they can't, you're so boring, sir.

[03:07:21.930 --> 03:07:23.190]
You can't even do it the right way.

[03:07:23.370 --> 03:07:25.150]
You know, like I said, even the crank calls are bad.

[03:07:25.530 --> 03:07:26.810]
Because you have nothing to say.

[03:07:27.290 --> 03:07:28.570]
The crank call imitators.

[03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:29.550]
Yeah, I'm right.

[03:07:30.030 --> 03:07:30.630]
WQM, hello.

[03:07:31.190 --> 03:07:32.610]
I'd like to ask you a challenge.

[03:07:32.790 --> 03:07:33.850]
Please don't hang on, Bill.

[03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:36.250]
WQM, hello.

[03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:38.050]
What a bunch of losers.

[03:07:38.650 --> 03:07:38.830]
Yes.

[03:07:39.410 --> 03:07:39.810]
Hi, Bailey.

[03:07:41.490 --> 03:07:42.450]
Oh, there you go.

[03:07:42.450 --> 03:07:46.770]
There's a fat boy's boyfriend and neighbor, fat boy's friend.

[03:07:47.390 --> 03:07:49.210]
Fat boys and probably a food pusher too.

[03:07:49.390 --> 03:07:50.090]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[03:07:50.250 --> 03:07:51.930]
Probably a concerted with many a meal.

[03:07:53.450 --> 03:07:54.110]
WQM, hello.

[03:07:55.010 --> 03:07:55.450]
Male.

[03:07:55.970 --> 03:07:56.390]
Yes, sir.

[03:07:57.050 --> 03:07:58.150]
That's not bread for Jones.

[03:07:58.430 --> 03:07:59.410]
No, okay, good.

[03:08:00.130 --> 03:08:01.010]
WQM, hello.

[03:08:01.390 --> 03:08:02.310]
Hey, how you doing?

[03:08:02.690 --> 03:08:03.090]
Okay, sir.

[03:08:05.190 --> 03:08:06.170]
Russian in workshop.

[03:08:08.470 --> 03:08:09.130]
WQM, hello.

[03:08:09.330 --> 03:08:09.690]
All right.

[03:08:11.050 --> 03:08:11.890]
See what I'm saying?

[03:08:11.890 --> 03:08:12.970]
This was the day.

[03:08:13.090 --> 03:08:14.490]
This way, I knew it was the...

[03:08:14.490 --> 03:08:15.310]
What did I tell you before?

[03:08:15.650 --> 03:08:16.710]
The everybody in the community.

[03:08:16.850 --> 03:08:17.210]
Crazy.

[03:08:17.890 --> 03:08:19.010]
Out of their minds.

[03:08:19.410 --> 03:08:20.390]
They're fairly rational.

[03:08:20.730 --> 03:08:21.390]
Some are rational.

[03:08:21.690 --> 03:08:23.010]
All of them, no matter what.

[03:08:23.450 --> 03:08:25.170]
They're all gathered around their radius today.

[03:08:25.290 --> 03:08:26.590]
It's the gathering of melting pot.

[03:08:28.010 --> 03:08:30.470]
What's your number one complaint that was our poll question today?

[03:08:31.210 --> 03:08:33.370]
Bush is destroying America 506.

[03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:35.430]
I'm not getting enough sex 115.

[03:08:36.110 --> 03:08:37.510]
I'm getting older and at suck 62.

[03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:40.890]
I'm as fat as a cow and can't lose any weight.

[03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:42.150]
56.

[03:08:43.470 --> 03:08:45.470]
Nobody's speaking English in Miami 46.

[03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:47.690]
My wife isn't bisexual 44.

[03:08:48.270 --> 03:08:49.370]
South Florida driver's 34.

[03:08:49.870 --> 03:08:52.730]
The loss of the fart sounds on the Elijah show 23 devastating.

[03:08:53.230 --> 03:08:54.370]
I live in Florida 21.

[03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:55.770]
And Mohawar Davided.

[03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:57.890]
19 is still on the air.

[03:08:58.250 --> 03:08:58.910]
Still on the air.

[03:08:59.050 --> 03:09:00.130]
But based on that last book.

[03:09:00.270 --> 03:09:00.570]
Absolutely.

[03:09:00.930 --> 03:09:01.270]
Who knows?

[03:09:01.350 --> 03:09:02.190]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:04.750]
Send the Elijah show on fly speaking.

[03:09:04.950 --> 03:09:05.570]
Kill you QA.

[03:09:05.810 --> 03:09:06.850]
Miami for marketing.

[03:09:06.850 --> 03:09:08.450]
Saga style with candle drip.
