[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]
Either you best do right!

[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.140]
My Emmy has the Marlins, a champion based Waltine, not won before the series.

[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.960]
No fans were ever seen.

[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.020]
Now that they're chance they have a fan surrounding them like rats.

[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.520]
Who wins this elevator?

[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.000]
One refunds for their has, but they're just front-running fondies.

[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.840]
Front-running fondies, children's support unless they won.

[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.360]
Yeah, they're just front-running fondies.

[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680]
Front-running fondies, don't give a crap about the one.

[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.560]
My Emmy branch sounds even above him, miles square.

[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.540]
Let all around the pouring can where no one really cares.

[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.560]
For all that they can interest in supporting their home team.

[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.300]
We'll call up for all radio to get their tickets free.

[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.920]
Because they're just front-running fondies.

[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.300]
Short on support unless they won.

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.640]
Yeah, they're just front-running fondies.

[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.000]
No way to hold now.

[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.000]
Thank God we're gonna be doing a Marlin poll the first poll of the day.

[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.060]
We got two polls for you.

[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300]
Ah! Well, we can talk.

[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.100]
Ah, whatever.

[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.580]
Well, the reason I'm doing a Marlin poll is because it's sports.

[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.940]
Right.

[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.000]
Sport?

[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.820]
Thank God we're all talking about sports.

[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.580]
Who imagined if we were to sports station?

[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.860]
No.

[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.820]
I think the way that we're gonna reform a clearance on that whole sports thing.

[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.260]
I think we need to take away his balls for a year.

[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.840]
Huh?

[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.520]
His golf balls?

[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.340]
No, he has to fall.

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.760]
His ball.

[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.460]
His football.

[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.300]
His basketball.

[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.980]
His basketball.

[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.680]
His tennis balls.

[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.580]
Oh, look at his fuzzy points.

[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.080]
He said he's already got him locked away in a drawer for safekeeping.

[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.400]
His mommy keeps the key.

[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.300]
Ball bearings.

[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.300]
But anyway, we'll talk about that later if I feel like it.

[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.220]
I just can't talk.

[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.860]
I feel okay.

[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.260]
Can I give a little story?

[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440]
I'm gonna tell a story about the guy at the track last night.

[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.640]
Positive story.

[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.820]
Nice guy.

[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.320]
Okay.

[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.200]
Sitting there.

[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.660]
Nice night at the track last night.

[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.820]
Nice going rich in Derek.

[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.400]
We had a good night.

[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.040]
One of few bucks.

[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.680]
Thank you, Dick Feinberg.

[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.180]
Steve Wolf.

[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.120]
Thank you, uh, Old Mike McDonald.

[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.800]
You know Mike McDonald?

[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.620]
No, I know Old McDonald.

[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.340]
That's him.

[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.740]
He's old.

[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.760]
And anyway, now he won a nice race for me.

[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.260]
Nice going Mike.

[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.840]
And I go on Old Sonny Patterson too.

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.700]
Sitting at the table, minding our business at the track, Pompa-Dopark.

[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.380]
And a guy comes, is waltzing down.

[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.980]
Now over the years, you know, every now and then somebody will come by to say hi.

[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.620]
And you're always very nice.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.360]
Sometimes a little linger a little bit too long, you know, or a little bit obnoxious.

[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.160]
And this guy, never saw it before in my life, he was, I would say, I don't know, 45 to 50-ish.

[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.640]
Just guessing.

[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.880]
So, can I just take a minute of your time?

[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.160]
Um, from New York, I've been out here seven years in the only rear of sunshine in my life every day.

[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.160]
And I just want to tell you how much I appreciate the free entertainment.

[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.020]
Oh nice.

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.580]
And I said, gee, thanks very much.

[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.940]
That's nice.

[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.020]
That was it.

[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.620]
That was short.

[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.560]
Sweet to the point.

[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.720]
And I thought to myself, God, if we had about 300,000 people, like, I'm not talking to, in relation to me, I'm just saying in general.

[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.120]
Right.

[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.700]
A bench.

[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.660]
You know what I mean?

[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.440]
Sure.

[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.020]
He didn't punch anybody in line in the face and knock them down and put them into a coma so that they died.

[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.740]
See that guy, you know, I, did you see the story actually on the news?

[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.140]
Yes.

[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.500]
About how the daughter of the guy that's being charged, the guy that murdered this other guy about punching, knocking him down.

[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.680]
She says, oh well, um, but it was an accident.

[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.180]
And both families are suffering terribly.

[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.340]
It wasn't an accident.

[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.340]
He punched the guy in the head.

[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.340]
He was a violent asshole.

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.640]
Right.

[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.140]
He said, I'm not just violent piece of crap.

[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.540]
And he turned out a plea deal.

[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.480]
You're in jail.

[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.640]
And I forget how long house arrest.

[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.240]
Turn it down.

[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.980]
I'd like to fry his ass.

[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.440]
Sure.

[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.320]
In butter.

[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.860]
Right.

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.580]
And I think most other people would like to do it too.

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.700]
Over, over movie tickets.

[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.280]
Over parking spaces.

[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.680]
Yeah.

[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.000]
This is the South Florida fukin' way, man.

[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.820]
Anger hostility.

[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.520]
See?

[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.060]
Just like, okay, here's the result of yesterday's pull.

[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.900]
By the way, thanks to that guy who came by last night.

[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.440]
He was a good guy.

[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.860]
Appreciate it.

[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.380]
Somebody nice.

[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.620]
Who didn't say, I hope you die.

[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.420]
And I like that.

[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.280]
We'll go on to those today.

[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.800]
Maybe a few.

[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.200]
1245 votes on the poll yesterday.

[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.880]
I would like to say this to you too.

[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.820]
Which I said to you this morning.

[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.600]
A lot of people are forgetting about the Howard Dean thing is that the explosion, the whole...

[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.940]
Rand.

[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.140]
It didn't come in the middle of, in a vacuum.

[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.700]
Right.

[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.920]
It came on the heels of him blowing a big lead in Iowa of his horrendous performances and at least two debates.

[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.300]
And of the public becoming more and more leery about what he was really all about.

[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.460]
It came on the heels of a dismal third place finish in Iowa.

[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.580]
I mean, I didn't even bet a horse last night that gagged and puked his bad as he didn't Iowa.

[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.860]
And as he's doing New Hampshire already.

[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:12.020]
So this is in other words an enormous number of people who have been very excited and motivated by him had already begun to sprout very serious doubts.

[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.880]
So you can say, well, the media and they are showing it every five minutes now.

[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.780]
I've seen just in the last half hour of seeing it.

[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.680]
About 30 man.

[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.140]
Times.

[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.460]
And of course, but you've got to know that.

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.960]
See, when you're going to play that game, you can't give the media fodder.

[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.180]
You know, for your father.

[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.000]
You can't do it.

[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.160]
Because they're going to bury it with it, no matter who you are.

[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.900]
And this doesn't even have to do with politics in terms of right or left.

[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.960]
It just has to do with the fact they like to make people look like assholes.

[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.980]
And that's exactly what he did.

[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.660]
And all of a sudden he trots out the wife.

[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.540]
I didn't I didn't see the thing because I was the track last night and see the Diane Sawyer interview.

[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.160]
But he trots his wife out now after all the criticism of the fact he's been keeping her in a broom closet somewhere.

[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.700]
And he says he doesn't want to schlepper around as a prop.

[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.140]
Well, he's just not a good campaigner.

[00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.900]
He doesn't get it.

[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.460]
He's a hard ass.

[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.980]
And it's okay to be a hard ass to a point, but you have to show a little bit of humanity.

[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.440]
People in general, I would agree with him.

[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.480]
I'm afraid of somebody that's that intense.

[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.200]
One thing to be intense, it's another thing to be, you see what I'm saying?

[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.540]
Yeah.

[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.560]
Like that.

[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.080]
I think he should move to Florida.

[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.900]
Get himself a condo.

[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.680]
Knock a few old people down.

[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.700]
Have a margarita.

[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.800]
Have a couple of margaritas at UnSouth Beach.

[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.080]
Learn to speak esponial.

[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.540]
And he'll feel like a rubber glove right up your anus.

[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.480]
Anyway, here's the result of the poll.

[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.560]
I know it's important to mention that because people also thought I was picking on him and I would not vote for him.

[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.240]
I mean, if he was in the general election, sure I would vote for him.

[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.500]
But I'm talking about it in the primary.

[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.740]
There was a chance I would vote for him because I know he's unelectable.

[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.740]
You know what I just said?

[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.840]
He is unelectable.

[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.300]
He's unelectable.

[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.960]
Period.

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.080]
Do you debate that?

[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.640]
No.

[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.380]
Yes.

[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.920]
No.

[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.040]
Unelectable.

[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.560]
Okay.

[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.860]
I don't think there are many places in this country right now.

[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.280]
He can be elected dog catcher.

[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.960]
Probably right.

[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.340]
Right.

[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.840]
Because he might scare the dog.

[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.760]
Yeah.

[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.300]
He might scare the dog.

[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.400]
I guess a nice cough drops for you.

[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.400]
Oh, what are they?

[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.140]
Sugar free?

[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.380]
Yes.

[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.240]
Oh boy.

[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.500]
There the hallway.

[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.740]
There the hallway.

[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.580]
I'll be right on the free pocket.

[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.120]
1245 votes.

[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.180]
What's your take on Howard Dean's famous wacky speech and I?

[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.960]
What we asked yesterday?

[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.060]
We're going to South Carolina.

[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.960]
And Oklahoma.

[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.540]
And then Oklahoma.

[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.540]

[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.140]
And then Arizona.

[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.260]
And North Dakota.

[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.280]
And New Mexico.

[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.740]
And we're going to California.

[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.740]
And Texas.

[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.660]
And New York.

[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.000]
And we're going to South Dakota.

[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.820]
And Oregon.

[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.680]
And Washington.

[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.700]
And Michigan.

[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.640]
And then we're going to Washington DC to take back the White House.

[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.620]
Yeah.

[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.720]
Yeah.

[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.520]
Yeah.

[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.540]

[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.140]
Yeah.

[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.440]
Yeah.

[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.540]
Even a crazy Dean is better than Bush.

[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.360]
473 people voted for that.

[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.520]
I'm still a forum.

[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.060]
He was just rallying his troops 200.

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.120]
So he said that's 54% positive still.

[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.840]
He's lost it 199.

[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.980]
I'm glad we found out about him now.

[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.480]
That was my vote 164.

[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.000]
I never liked him anyhow.

[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:01.680]
144.

[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.340]
And the doctor was self-medicating too much.

[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.980]
He's popping a few too many.

[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:06.880]
65.

[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.920]
Out of 1245 votes.

[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.940]
He's unelectable.

[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.480]
He will not win.

[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.920]
He will not be the candidate.

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.080]
He might be.

[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.040]
He would make Michael Duke caucus look like a champion vocator.

[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.960]
Tell me right now.

[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.340]
By the way, this guy.

[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.340]
This is the most chronic of the factors now.

[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.300]
I don't read the comics.

[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.560]
I don't, you know.

[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.560]
You can hack me and try to quit that fact.

[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.260]
I'm not interested.

[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.680]
Dan Labasterd, which I also never read.

[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.960]
I just happened to see it this morning.

[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.660]
I saw the headline.

[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.320]
And Dan Labasterd finally after all these years

[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.400]
wrote a column that made sense.

[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.480]
He didn't even talk about the fact that he's Cuban.

[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.860]
Very nice going, Dan.

[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.580]
It was absolutely incredible.

[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.020]
Yeah.

[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.700]
And that the, the Cubans won the World Series 97

[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.720]
and a bunch of Goyom won it in 2002.

[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:48.620]
Three.

[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.280]
Whatever you're what?

[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.800]
What must the Marlins do to win over the fickle fans?

[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.960]
This is one of the most alarming articles.

[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.780]
And it's very good.

[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.700]
Excellent going, Dan.

[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.520]
About five years right now.

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:58.860]
Another good one.

[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.640]
But, and it proves what I've said all along.

[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.220]
And it gets a lot of people pissed off.

[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.360]
Oh, Neil was so negative.

[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.480]
It's Neil's fault.

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.820]
The Marlins, you know, all that John Henry crap we used to get.

[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.360]
Like, what have I got to do with it?

[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.300]
Well, if you would just support it there.

[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.720]
Have I ever discouraged anybody from buying a ticket?

[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.980]
I'm not talking about the freebies.

[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.700]
A lot of you free loaders get like a deposit game.

[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.120]
I'm talking about buying a ticket.

[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.820]
Which I admit I don't have to do all along when I was going to the dolphin games years ago.

[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.880]
I bought my own tickets.

[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.120]
Me and a fat man.

[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.280]
But, you know, everybody can talk a good game.

[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.060]
Talk is cheap.

[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.460]
Just look at these calls we get every day.

[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.980]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.800]
But, you know, for those people who put out a few bucks

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.180]
and the Marlins tickets aren't expensive.

[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.320]
So we'll take our first poll on that.

[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.680]
We'll get into Dan LaBasterd.

[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.400]
All you people who are subscribers to Amovon.org.

[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.980]
Members, how to check out moveon.org today.

[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.780]
But, I'm not going to be talking to you all day.

[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.060]
I'll take.

[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.520]
And I just read the first paragraph or two of the latest newslighter.

[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.240]
They just blurbed that came on my website, my email.

[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.600]
Dear moveon member, during this year's Super Bowl,

[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.380]
you'll see ads sponsored by beer companies, tobacco companies, and the Bush White House.

[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.640]
But you won't see the winning ad on moveon.org,

[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.500]
voter funds, bush, and 30 seconds ad contest, CBSBFuses to Arid.

[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.380]
Meanwhile, the White House is on the verge of signing in a law deal

[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.080]
with Senator John McCain says, is custom tailored for CBS and Fox,

[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.220]
allowing the two networks to grow much bigger.

[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.660]
CBS lobbied hard for this rule change, moveon.org members across the country lobbied against it,

[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.760]
and our ad has been rejected while the White House ad will be played.

[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.740]
It looks an awful lot like CBS's playing politics with the right to free speech.

[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.820]
And they are...

[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.200]
Absolutely correct.

[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.020]
So read the whole thing, go to moveon.org.

[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.200]
We have a link to it on our website.

[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.500]
Read the whole thing in weep.

[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.500]
Because now, the right wing, you know, they're dangling all the carrots

[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.040]
in front of the big media conglomerates, as you know.

[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.180]
And pretty soon you'll only have one point of view.

[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.780]
That'll be it.

[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.680]
America Uber Alice.

[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.900]
Get that... start your step, baby.

[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.620]
Good for you. Good exercise.

[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.600]
12 minutes after 10 at 5, 60 W to QAM.

[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.420]
Well, I want to get the period recorded spot, but...

[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.960]
But what?

[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.300]
Are we playing period recorded today?

[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.640]
Oh, I don't know. I didn't think we were, so that's why I don't have a pizza lot.

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.700]
I can talk. I just sound awful squeaky.

[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.800]
At least I don't have a sore throat.

[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.880]
That's extra fun.

[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.460]
Like, squeaky from...

[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.840]
I'm not going to do that pizza lot copy from yesterday, because it's suck Jeff.

[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.740]
You know, you're a good guy.

[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.500]
Your food is great.

[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.960]
Your restaurant is fantastic.

[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.700]
But your spots...

[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.520]
It's almost like he could be hard to write copy here, because he writes garbage for copy.

[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.960]
Pizza lot is home of the world's best pizza.

[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.900]
They have three different kinds.

[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.020]
They've got great Italian goodies, a fabulous menu.

[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.700]
Everything is fresh, cooked just the way you love it.

[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.320]
And of course they give you a big fat portions that are enough for you, almost the entire family.

[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.940]
Joggianic portions, it'll be a miracle if you can finish.

[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.300]
Every Monday at the loft is La Zon United, Tuesday's Egg Plant Night.

[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.180]
Buy one of these dinners on these nights, get the second one for only five bucks.

[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.160]
I think these things are still going on, because I'm going back to the old copy, and I'm sure they might...

[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.400]
And if not, tell me...

[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.920]
Hey, you said it, it's still going on.

[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.960]
And every Wednesday, kids eat free with adults, they can see Jeff's famous magic show as they whip it out for you.

[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.940]
Every Thursday night is Bike Night at the loft.

[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.080]
Come on a motorcycle, buy one dinner, and get the second for a price, and Jeff will wipe it off for you.

[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.440]
They've got the best damn garlic rolls you've ever had in your life.

[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:20.000]
So if you want a really fantastic meal, big portions, fresh goodies, the best attendance stuff anywhere in town at amazingly modest prices.

[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.140]
The pizza lot is still unbeatable.

[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:28.860]
You'll find, among university drive between I-595 and Griffin Road, right behind Pierwinn and ports with tons of free parking for you too.

[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.300]
So take it home, have it delivered, or eat it right there at the pizza lot.

[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.060]
And they cater up parties, all kinds of functions, all kinds of affairs.

[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.520]
That's Jeff's favorite word.

[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.500]
K-Dring for his lowest five bucks per person.

[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.400]
Pizza lot, give him a call at 954-916-888.

[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.280]
954-916-8880.

[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.540]
Why in local?

[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.700]
We're sports radio 560-CUA-M.

[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.780]
Or David's a bitch.

[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.280]
Excuse me, sir.

[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.520]
I'm with 560-WQ-A-M.

[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.100]
We'd like to know, are you a sport home?

[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.000]
Yeah, damn right, I am.

[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.380]
What's your opinion?

[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.120]
I mean, what's your take?

[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.620]
On the recent changes at WQ-A-M.

[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.280]
Well, I'm glad that old Fag is gone, because I want to hear sports all day.

[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.340]
You know, just real men talking all day about men.

[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.160]
Now, I know they got that Cuban fella.

[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.340]
He's filling in with, he talks too much about women, you know.

[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.260]
He's a straight guy.

[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:33.980]
I mean, I want to hear other men, old-go-other men's firm butts and tighten on.

[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.520]
Well, that's what sports is all about, buddy.

[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:45.760]
Give me all sports radio, where they all go men all day.

[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.740]
Give me all sports radio.

[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.700]
I graph myself when I hear sports whole Saturday.

[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.600]
Look how fast he can run.

[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.620]
Look how fast he can joke.

[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.560]
That's the kind of man I'd like to hold.

[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:13.640]
Give me all sports radio for the man and man.

[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:15.640]
All right.

[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.240]
That's clearance.

[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.240]
1018-560-WQ-A-M.

[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.100]
I feel a little bit better now.

[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.760]
I didn't feel better, I just can talk a little.

[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.580]
Maybe I'm like, maybe it's the cough drops.

[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.800]
They are helpful, I love these.

[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.580]
Maybe it's these halls of mental liptus.

[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.360]
I think that's doing it.

[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:28.720]
I don't know.

[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.620]
I think everybody knew audience that almost everybody in the building is either has right now or is head in the last couple weeks this crud.

[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.280]
Yes.

[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.440]
So this cold that I got, this head cramp, as soon as I get out of this town, it'll be gone.

[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.240]
As soon as I get out of this sick building, it's a sick building.

[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.920]
Sounds like a lawsuit Greg.

[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.140]
Oh, Greg, it's a suit, it's a suit, Greg.

[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.900]
Oh my god.

[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.640]
Yeah, just calm down, though.

[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.700]
Just relax.

[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.560]
Everything's under control.

[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.220]
It's just one of the benefits of working here.

[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.200]
You get to breathe in all that free algae and mong and mildew.

[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.100]
Yes, it's old.

[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.740]
It's the same illness.

[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.920]
It's oldy moldies.

[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.220]
I mean, it worked for Magic Locati when up in his last book.

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.260]
So anyway, we were running some obnoxious promos on this radio station,

[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.100]
which I heard coming back from the track last night.

[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.080]
You played me one when I first came back,

[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.160]
and I thought, oh, they'll never put those on here.

[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.280]
Too embarrassing.

[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:17.780]
Yeah.

[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.760]
They're too friggin' embarrassed.

[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.380]
Guess again.

[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.500]
And so I'm hearing a whole bunch of these about, oh, can you imagine

[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.260]
if QM were all sports talk radio?

[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.220]
I often do.

[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:26.700]
Yeah.

[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.020]
We could only pray.

[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.720]
We could only pray for that.

[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.580]
Like, hallelujah.

[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:31.720]
Right.

[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.300]
Even he's excited about it.

[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.540]
And so I told Dick Feinberg at Pompo-no last night about the promos,

[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.240]
because I heard one go to the track last night,

[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.640]
and he stood there with his jaw down to his ankle.

[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.760]
He said, in other words, it's like taking a shot at you,

[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.320]
because anybody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail,

[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.160]
who isn't just a football squeezer,

[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.820]
knows the history of this radio station of the last six years anyway.

[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.780]
And before that.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.380]
Right.

[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.540]
I remember some asshole with a very short haircut

[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.620]
and a very expensive suit,

[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.900]
and as I came out of the tea room two years ago,

[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.080]
in a hallway, Santa May, oh, congratulations on another great book, Neil.

[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.660]
We never had any ratings to you came here.

[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.740]
Remember that exact quote?

[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.160]
Sure.

[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.760]
We never had any ratings to you came here.

[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.840]
No, they needed to say more real good book,

[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.960]
but other than that, the station didn't have any big numbers.

[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.140]
But can you imagine if we weren't all sports talking about you,

[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.800]
but the dolphins in the draft,

[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.340]
see, this isn't all sports radio.

[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.780]
It's all D.N.D., and it's not Danny and Dave anymore.

[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.280]
I am burstin' out of that.

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.840]
It's dolphins and draft.

[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.440]
Draft beer?

[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.720]
Dolphins and draft.

[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.460]
Draft beer.

[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.320]
Or Virgil and Wango, all-star team.

[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.420]
Anybody talkin' about that?

[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:36.820]
No.

[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.980]
No, maybe briefly, because nobody cares.

[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.280]
You think they're gonna have pudge unpacking?

[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:44.640]
Yeah.

[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.840]
They're packin' a pudge stuff again.

[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.920]
First of all, I just wanna make one comment about that.

[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.920]
Not that I give a crap, because I'm not gonna be a phony

[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.160]
and say I'm a Marlon fan, because I'm not.

[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.560]
If somebody slaps you in the face and says,

[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.580]
oh, I was insulted by your offer.

[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.960]
That seven million year plus the other three million,

[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.280]
ten million year for whatever was.

[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.460]
Yeah, I would say, well, guess what?

[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.260]
Don't let the door hit you in your big fat ass on a way out of town.

[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.580]
Right, he's got a big fat ass.

[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.940]
That's what I would say.

[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.080]
And the idea, oh, can we get him back?

[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.120]
It shows that these assholes have no shame.

[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.020]
What kind of a moron wants him back?

[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.260]
I say it's time to send pudge packing.

[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.140]
After he leaves the White House today,

[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.240]
send pudge packing.

[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.540]
Not that I care.

[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.800]
And obviously nobody else does either,

[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.060]
because this Dan La Bastard column today is so damn...

[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.680]
Now, I realize that the rush through is big.

[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.180]
We'll get to that.

[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.820]
The Halliburton employees accepting kickbacks is big, right?

[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.180]
But the only problem with that is it's just like the Marlins.

[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.340]
Nobody cares.

[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.080]
Yeah.

[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.640]
See, that's another thing.

[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.180]
I mean, this being a hotbed of activism, that it is.

[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:48.820]
Yeah.

[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.580]
It's a hotbed of hot animals is what it is.

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.300]
That's South Florida.

[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.480]
I mean, unless you're soaking your teeth in a glass,

[00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.340]
you don't belong here.

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.260]
That's why I'm getting it.

[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:00.680]
Huh?

[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.360]
And I'm soaking in it right now.

[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.980]
Poor Martha Ray rest in peace.

[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.920]
She would have loved it here.

[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.300]
Well, I'm telling you, the faxes are just pouring in today.

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.940]
Go Peter Ren.

[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.340]
Now where the hell did that come from?

[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.760]
In this day of correctness, why aren't we call a lobbying?

[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.580]
What it really is legalized bribery?

[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.620]
Says Captain Rick and go Peter Ren.

[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.560]
Ha ha ha ha!

[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.380]
Go Mike McDonald, baby.

[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.280]
Old Michael.

[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.840]
Old McDonald, Hado Horace.

[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.280]
Anyway, what must Marlins do to win over fickle fans?

[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.780]
I just want to read this because it sets up the first poll,

[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.340]
and they'll explain to you why we'll do that from Nautilneau.

[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.940]
The second poll, we got to build.

[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.680]
Should I do the second poll first?

[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:41.940]
Okay, whatever.

[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.860]
Well, because that's the only thing they'll call about.

[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.520]
The second poll that we'll do at noon and two to weekend.

[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.080]
And what inspired me to do this?

[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.920]
Remember I talked yesterday about seeing Rick Sanchez

[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.740]
and about two minutes of his awful, awful show on Channel 6.

[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.200]
Oh, full.

[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.300]
I mean brutal.

[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.640]
I think that he's a legend in his own mind.

[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.780]
I don't think he was ever, you know,

[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.220]
well, he's convinced someone else obviously.

[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.400]
The ratings on Channel 7 were big for the news

[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.300]
because it's Channel 7, because it's hysterical,

[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.260]
hyperventilating, melodramatic, crap.

[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.280]
Didn't he invent that?

[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.320]
Well, they distinct, no speaking English flavor.

[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.860]
Although now Channel 4 is our two in that category.

[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:19.240]
Right.

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.640]
All right, Rita's is all day.

[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.400]
But, sorry, I figured, who's your all-time favorite?

[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.400]
South Florida TV personality.

[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.640]
News or entertainment.

[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.420]
We've never done this.

[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.700]
We've done parts of it.

[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.440]
Right.

[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.280]
I mean, I realize this isn't negative.

[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.860]
It doesn't give you a chance to take a shot at anybody.

[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.700]
But if somebody doesn't do well, if they make it on the pole

[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.380]
and they don't do well at all, it'll be the same as taking a shot.

[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.340]
I got a short list I made.

[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.180]
First five.

[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.660]
Ralph Renek.

[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.400]
John Hambrick.

[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.060]
Skipper Chuck Sink.

[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.520]
Rick Sanchez.

[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:51.640]
And Bishop.

[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.480]
That's my short list.

[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.820]
I mean, there'll be a million others on here.

[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.720]
Well, you got mine on there.

[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.840]
Skipper Chuck.

[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.180]
Yep.

[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.720]
And mine is John Hambrick.

[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.140]
He's talking to Hambrick.

[00:19:59.380 --> 00:19:59.620]
He's talking to Hambrick.

[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.260]
Yes, he was.

[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.380]
And he's a good guy too.

[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.460]
So, what's the most important?

[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.540]
He's a professional for this town.

[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.620]
See, that's why people say, well, what do you do for a living?

[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.380]
And I say, well, I'm a bush league talk show host.

[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.360]
Because I got to be bush league to be, you know, in this town.

[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.180]
Oh, I do.

[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.320]
I don't mind saying that.

[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.960]
If you can make a lot of money being bush league,

[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.580]
my big professional for it, right?

[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.220]
So if anybody says, oh, he's just a bush leagueer.

[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.260]
Right.

[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.260]
The money still goes right in the bank.

[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.720]
I almost feel like taking my tea out of the thing there.

[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.960]
But I'll wait to liberate.

[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:30.780]
I can fetch it.

[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.460]
And I think you should play the spots.

[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.200]
Okay, I just didn't have the pizza lot thing.

[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.960]
No, because it's, and it runs again later.

[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.280]
I'll read that one later, because his copy.

[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.320]
I wouldn't want you to play that one from yesterday anyway.

[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.460]
Now, these other spots that are very slurry sounding,

[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.200]
they sound like I'm stroked out in all those spots.

[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:45.840]
Don't they?

[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:46.260]
Yeah.

[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.100]
Why?

[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.660]
Just one of those things.

[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.060]
It must have been the day that you recorded them all.

[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.680]
I sounded when it out, stroke it out.

[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.780]
We just took the freshest recording we had.

[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.960]
So, oh, in other words, I was here when I,

[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.520]
because that's the current I was here.

[00:20:59.720 --> 00:20:59.860]
Right.

[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.280]
Well, of course, I'm always really sick when I'm here.

[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.540]
It is. It's a sick building, man.

[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:06.960]
Yeah.

[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.580]
Didn't it year ago, in February?

[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.500]
A year ago, next month, I had a stroke right here.

[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.300]
Right in this town.

[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.620]
Yeah.

[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.360]
Right.

[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.820]
And then I came to work the next day.

[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.300]
And then I got on the treadmill there at Cleveland Clinic.

[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.440]
With my good friend, Dr. Bush.

[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.740]
Thanks for not quite killing me, Dr. Bush.

[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.540]
I put another stress test.

[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.340]
What do you say, huh?

[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:29.580]
No.

[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.380]
No, he's okay.

[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.180]
He means well.

[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.620]
He said he would do anything for me.

[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.320]
As long as I promised not to sue them.

[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.800]
What must Marlon's do to win over fickle fans?

[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.200]
Right, Stan LeBass.

[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.980]
I can't believe that I'm a glowing thing about this.

[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.260]
The essence of his article, I'm not going to read it,

[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.560]
because I don't have the voice to read anything.

[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.540]
The essence of the article is it's a Bush League town.

[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:48.980]
Wow.

[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.480]
Cano Vell.

[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.640]
But he points out that the Marlon's might be good enough to visit

[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.920]
the White House, which they are today,

[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.280]
but they're evidently still not quite good enough for you.

[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.060]
President David Samson said Thursday,

[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.960]
his team hasn't sold even 5,000 season tickets yet.

[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.780]
I'd hate to see what the Panther season ticket really honest total is.

[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:10.640]
Fuck, third man.

[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.160]
Yeah, I think that might be accurate.

[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:19.320]
It says this is the pressing unfathomable, inexplicable damning

[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.720]
and probably without President Major American sports,

[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.200]
right, Stan LeBassard.

[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.480]
And believe me, he knows his crap.

[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.340]
Isn't crap his middle name?

[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:28.720]
Yes.

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.380]
And he goes on at the end of the article and he says,

[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.840]
if a champion can appreciably increase in sustained interest,

[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.340]
why would a new stadium building?

[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.740]
Why would a new building do it?

[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.360]
It's not the stadium.

[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.760]
Stams in a great location.

[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.460]
And he shows the fan bases not only of other major league teams,

[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.620]
embarrassing teams like the Montreal Expose,

[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.280]
soon to be defunct.

[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.840]
The Buffalo Bisons, minor league team,

[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.060]
they've already sold 6,000 season tickets.

[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.140]
Sacramento Rivercats, minor league team, 7,000.

[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.280]
The Anxious Detroit Tigers,

[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.300]
in one of the most obnoxious cities in the face of the earth, 7,500.

[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.540]
And I'm Angels 21,000, Cubs 28,000.

[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.800]
He's got an interesting list here.

[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.080]
You ought to take a puke at an Harold.

[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.760]
Marlins, between 4,500 and 5,000.

[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.220]
Less than the Expose,

[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.200]
who sold close to 5,000.

[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.880]
Less than the Buffalo Bison, etc.

[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.560]
So the first pool today,

[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.960]
why do you think the World Champion Marlins have sold so few,

[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.980]
less than 5,000 season tickets?

[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.320]
Five choices.

[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.560]
South Florida's Bush League,

[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.900]
their fans are mostly front-running phonies.

[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.480]
They need a new stadium,

[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.520]
like me, most people don't give a shmit about them.

[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.960]
Or there are a few real sports fans here.

[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.700]
Dolphins in the draft.

[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.220]
Danny and Davey, Dolphins in the draft.

[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.020]
See, this is not a sports talk station.

[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.580]
It's a dolphin talk station,

[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.720]
with a little window dressing on a few other things,

[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.780]
a little smattering, a little sprinkle, you know?

[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:58.680]
And you know what?

[00:23:59.340 --> 00:23:59.980]
It's boring.

[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:02.820]
You can run all the pro,

[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.700]
while I talk to the parents,

[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.840]
get those eyes out and tell them,

[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.120]
but I suggested he might get them off.

[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.620]
And they were like,

[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.240]
okay.

[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:07.800]
It was easy.

[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.960]
He's easy. That's what the B said.

[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.080]
It's one thing he loves about him.

[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:11.780]
He's easy.

[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.120]
He says, you know,

[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.100]
get down on your hands and knees.

[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:14.660]
No problem.

[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:15.700]
Roll over.

[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.360]
No problem.

[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.920]
Over to your plan of spots.

[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.820]
Halley, Loya,

[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.060]
1028 at QIM.

[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.700]
Hey, let me tell you about getting a new mattress.

[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.460]
Slowing it away.

[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:23.960]
You can do it.

[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:24.820]
You can go in the locker.

[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.140]
Stoke that.

[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.320]

[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.060]

[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.060]

[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.180]

[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.180]

[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.180]

I love it.

[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:20.640]
I love it.

[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:20.780]
I love it.

[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.100]
I love it.

[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.100]

[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:22.200]

[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:22.660]
I love it.

[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:22.980]
I love it.

[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:22.980]

[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:22.980]

[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.740]
I love it.

[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:36.780]
I love it.

[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:45.000]
I love it.

[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.200]
It's too expensive.

[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:46.800]
It's too expensive.

[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.080]
It's too expensive.

[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.240]
It's too expensive.

[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.440]
It's too cheap.

[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:47.440]

[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:47.440]

[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:47.440]

[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:47.440]

[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:47.440]

[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.460]
It's cheap and down.

[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:50.520]
It's too expensive.

[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:50.700]
So what-

[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.740]
What could be the other excuse?

[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:52.620]
It's hot.

[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:56.760]
It's hot.

[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:57.100]
Its hot.

[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:57.920]
It's hot.

[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.520]
And they're not.

[00:31:59.060 --> 00:31:59.400]
This is not, WOW!

[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.000]
So Thank you, Daniel H composed for finally writing a good calm number one.

[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.520]
to see if you had a cup of coffee today.

[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.620]
See because this isn't a sports pool.

[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:05.940]
See because this isn't a sports pool.

[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.600]
It's a pool about this town.

[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.120]
It's a pool about these people.

[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.680]
the front-running phonies.

[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.500]
Air-conditioned state.

[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.280]
And I realized that we didn't jump on that Marlon bandwagon back in October and September

[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.300]
when they were winning the playoffs in the World Series because it would be phonia

[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.080]
would be disingenuous.

[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:25.540]
I do appreciate those great calls from Boobshambh from that Marlon parade, you know.

[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.000]
No, seriously, it's a serious problem because people here are in denial.

[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.560]
It's like, I'm a bad guy because I tell them the truth.

[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.740]
Well, now here's another guy, Dan La Bastard, who don't even speak our language.

[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.280]
Here's another guy telling you the truth.

[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.120]
In English.

[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.440]
Through an interpreter, of course.

[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.760]
But that great?

[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.760]
Dan La Bastard, you go Dan.

[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.200]
I didn't know the Bastard had it in him.

[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.560]
But it's a great call.

[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.280]
Nice going, Dan.

[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.960]
Danny Boy, Danny and Davy.

[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.780]
Prosecutors refuse rehab deal for Limbaugh and cyst on guilty plea.

[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.900]
I'm not going to read this slide.

[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.940]
I just don't have the voice plus that it's Ponderous anyway.

[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.840]
Tom Beach County prosecutors rejected an overture last month from Marcelinbaugh's attorneys

[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.940]
that would have allowed the conservative commentator to enter drug rehab

[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.080]
rather than face criminal charges for prescribbing drug abuse.

[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.060]
Keep popping him, Rush.

[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.640]
Duff admitted to me he'd tune over to Rush for a minute yesterday.

[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.160]
He was turning back and forth.

[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.580]
To see, see, now that we have our middle-level management people

[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.020]
and this rating book came out which was pretty marginal for QA.

[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:22.560]
I'm pretty weak.

[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.480]
And boy, wait till you see the next trend.

[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.800]
Oh, it's going to be a scream inducing.

[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:29.180]
Yeah.

[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.720]
So he was listening to Rush and I said, why?

[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.580]
I want to see you.

[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.980]
Anyway, the prosecutors offered to win the investigation of Limbaugh pleaded guilty

[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.160]
to a single felony for doctor shopping and agreed to a three-year-term appropriation

[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.280]
of the ill-ed Limbaugh's Miami attorney Roy Black called Proposterous yesterday.

[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.600]
The whole story is on the front page of the Sun Central.

[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.020]
If you already wrapped your fish in it, it's on our website, theorrangers.com.

[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.480]
Roy Black wrote to Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer

[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.360]
December 11th asking whether his office investigation could be resolved

[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.780]
by having Limbaugh enter an intervention program that allows drug offenders

[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.500]
to seek treatment and not face criminal convictions.

[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.120]
He has committed, they have evidence, he's committed at least 10 felonies.

[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.160]
And Roy Black says, eh, Yamaha.

[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.240]
So you can read a whole article.

[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.260]
I'm not going to dittle with it.

[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:18.360]

[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.280]
Just another, you see, the right wingers can do whatever they want.

[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.160]
Of course they can.

[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.640]
Any problem?

[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.900]
He's probably still, he, you know, Wilma was small pathetic.

[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.000]
He's probably got a good supplier right now.

[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.380]
Let us know our name, Rush.

[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.560]
We could use somewhere on here.

[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.180]
What are you smirkin' about?

[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.560]
This is definitely a pill-poppin' kind of place.

[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.860]
Yeah, ask him off, she'll tell you about it.

[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.940]

[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.560]

[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.100]

[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:55.780]
Eight.

[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.260]
It's gonna be great.

[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.640]
That's what you say, eight.

[00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.580]
And don't be late.

[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.460]
So sad.

[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.520]

[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.160]
And thereby has refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.

[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.940]
He's the first president in history to refuse United Nations election in sessions.

[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.360]
He's the old time US and world record holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.

[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.000]
His largest lifetime campaign contributor.

[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.460]
And one of his best friends can't play.

[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.980]
Presented over the largest corporate bankruptcy falling US history.

[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.940]
His political party used the N1 by the jet and corporate attorney to assure his success with the US Supreme Court.

[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.120]
During the election decision.

[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.300]
As protected as friends, the N1 and Halibut against investigation or false accusation.

[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.560]
More time in money was spent investigating the monocle of the Winsky Affair.

[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.120]
Then has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate repossent history.

[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.640]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.320]
Thanks to our old buddy Mitch Lewis who just pulled that out of his vacuum.

[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.100]
It's 11.2 million dollars.

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.100]

[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.220]
How much better I saw now?

[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.820]
What is Hal's mental liftice in my team?

[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.340]
My celestial, my caffeine-free, herb tea, cinnamon, no less?

[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:08.940]
Mark it up.

[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.360]
Oh yeah, I feel almost too much now.

[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.120]
Time to go home.

[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.680]
Here's a great fact you'll love this.

[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.680]
I was at my favorite pub this past weekend enjoying a couple of pints.

[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.080]
And one of the TV sets was tuned to the new star search with our Cineo Hall.

[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.500]
As they were introducing their panel.

[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:28.140]
One of the judges turned out to be the anxious Ego Maniac Maddie Lesham from the awful Wami days.

[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.960]
Remember Maddie Lesham?

[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.420]
I don't care.

[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.960]
What a major, major asshole.

[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.520]
Wami, got it.

[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.880]
It's really, still authentically trying to look in for the shaved head and goatee.

[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.940]
I was so disturbed I had to continue drinking until I sounded like the broadcast school guy.

[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.540]
Best facts in here.

[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.740]
I saw him, Pally.

[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.260]
What a great facts.

[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.280]
Or you know who we haven't heard from in quite a while now.

[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.420]
Who that is?

[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.200]
Hi, Pally.

[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.440]
I just mentioned that so we can get him on to the...

[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.600]
Your buddy, the one that...

[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.420]
He'll pretend he's never him.

[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.520]
It's not him on the facts.

[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.340]
It's not him on the phone.

[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.600]
Here's Bob and Atlanta's who says,

[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.080]
How come the Republicans now claim in unison that Howard Dean is too unstable?

[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.320]
To be present because he got his panties into a wad.

[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.580]
How quick they forget that the Republicans were looking into a constitutional amendment

[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.860]
to allow a third term formaled ray gun

[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.320]
who already was exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's before a second term was over.

[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.280]
What's the difference, says Bob and Atlanta's?

[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.380]
Shoopolish.

[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:28.220]
Better actor.

[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:28.960]
Right.

[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.740]
Republican.

[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:31.500]
Right.

[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.600]
Right wing hero.

[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.000]
Ronnie ray gun.

[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.900]
Oh, don't be picking out Ronnie now.

[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.360]
And it was the same trickle-down bullshit, you know.

[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.360]
Same Ronnie ray gun recession.

[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.220]
Same crap.

[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.660]
Although we didn't have anywhere near as many people out of work during ray gun as we have now.

[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.100]
Dying.

[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.360]
Or nearly as many people dying for no reason based on a pile of lies as we do now.

[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.380]
All we had a few illegal things going on, like Iran country.

[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.620]
See, when the Republicans, it's stuff like that.

[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.820]
When Democrats is like, you know, getting blow jobs.

[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:05.720]
And when the Republicans, it's like, you know, just violating every principle of the Constitution.

[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.100]
Yeah.

[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.780]
Still, blow jobs too.

[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.780]
But we don't need to know.

[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:10.860]
No blow jobs.

[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.120]
I bet your Henry's hiding it.

[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.780]
Haliburton tells Pentagon, where see here's another one.

[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.080]
Haliburton tells Pentagon workers to kick back toward projects in Iraq.

[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.520]
Now, see no matter what you say, that's why I say it's like preaching to the choir.

[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.440]
I consider and pretend we're going to make a difference and we're not.

[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.700]
It's like the Marlins thing.

[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.800]
See, that poll is so important to me because it is not a sports thing.

[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.940]
I don't care about sports other than, you know, hockey and football.

[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:34.440]
That's it.

[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.700]
Patriots and the Leafs and Panthers.

[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.300]
But it's about this place.

[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.760]
It's about here.

[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:46.900]
It's about the people here.

[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.060]
There's something wrong here.

[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.240]
I consider and just suck around.

[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.060]
Oh, this is paradise.

[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.160]
It's not paradise.

[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:52.940]
It could be.

[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.800]
But there's something wrong with a whole mentality here.

[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.940]
When you live in an area where people hate each other as much as the people here do.

[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.360]
See, the thing with a guy punching the other old guy out at the movie theater.

[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.160]
That was emblematic.

[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.760]
That was just partly symptom of this whole sick place.

[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.260]
Routine.

[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.020]
Hate.

[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.200]
Not just rudeness, but just...

[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.840]
You know, everyone's on the verge and you want to know why.

[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.300]
Because maybe, subliminally, they hate the fact that they're here.

[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:20.720]
Maybe?

[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:21.760]
They like the weather.

[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.640]
Like you go out today.

[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.500]
It's not below zero.

[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:24.020]
Like up north.

[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:24.680]
It's not freezing.

[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.480]
There's no snow.

[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.780]
Don't have to thought your car.

[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.520]
It's pleasant.

[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.200]
Sunny.

[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.400]
But there's something underlying it.

[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.280]
You can almost smell it.

[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:33.900]
Can you smell it?

[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:34.820]
Oh, God.

[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:36.980]
You can feel it.

[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.000]
Where does it start?

[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.580]
It's the old time you know.

[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:41.760]
Oh, that.

[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:42.180]
Yeah.

[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:42.940]
Oh, the cold.

[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:43.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:43.720]
You mean that?

[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.160]
The hate.

[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.900]
It starts with a bad leadership.

[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:47.980]
It starts with the newspapers.

[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:48.960]
The media here sucks.

[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.700]
You got two of the worst goddamn pandering newspapers ever invented.

[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.180]
I mean, just horrendous.

[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:54.600]
Garbage.

[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.200]
Do you know the Harold and a Sun Sentinel on Sunday?

[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.620]
Each one weighs a whole bunch of pounds.

[00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.540]
But third, man.

[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.860]
And there's nothing to read, neither one of them.

[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:01.320]
Nothing.

[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:01.740]
I know.

[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.120]
Tree-killing rats.

[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.460]
I will say this for the Sun Sentinel.

[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.320]
They've got so many of those special ad sections in the Sunday paper.

[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.580]
They now, when they deliver your paper, they put it in like an aplastic sack.

[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:12.980]
Yeah.

[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.940]
Which, by the way, if you put...

[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.660]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.320]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:32.720]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:33.480]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:33.640]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.640]

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.640]

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.640]

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.640]

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.640]

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.640]

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.640]

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.640]

[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.980]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:35.420]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:35.560]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:35.560]

[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.400]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:36.740]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.640]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.800]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:47.660]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:48.860]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:48.920]
It's going to be amazing.

[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.480]
He's just...

[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:50.700]
He's just...

[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.100]
He's just...

[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:51.120]
He's just...

[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:51.120]

[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:51.160]
He's just...

[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:51.180]
He's just...

[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:51.180]

[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:51.180]

[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:51.180]

[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:51.340]
He's just...

[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:51.360]
He's just...

[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:51.360]

[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:51.460]
He's just...

[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:51.860]
He's just...

[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:51.860]

[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.080]
He's just...

[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:52.080]

[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:52.080]

[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:52.320]
He's just...

[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:52.320]

[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.200]
He's just...

[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:53.640]
He's just...

[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.640]
He's just...

[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.540]
He's just...

[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.260]
He's just...

[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.000]
He's just...

[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.400]
He's just...

[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:07.860]
He's just...

[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.760]
Pop the Woody.

[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.240]
How do you like that?

[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.320]
Oh my God.

[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.660]
Hello, Burton Company has told a Pentagon

[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.260]
that two employees took kickbacks

[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.100]
by doing it up to six million dollars

[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.600]
and returned for awarding a Kuwaiti-based company

[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.480]
with lucrative work

[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.180]
supplying US troops in Iraq.

[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.160]
So it says today's very conservative Wall Street Journal.

[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:29.680]
It's not in some Kami Pinko-leftist publication

[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.760]
it's in today's goddamn Wall Street Journal.

[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.740]
The disclosure is the first firm indication

[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.100]
of correction involving US funded projects in Iraq

[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.140]
and raises new questions about how Burton's dealings there.

[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.020]
The companies work out raising the scrutinized

[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.320]
because of accusations that the US government was overcharged

[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.620]
for gasoline under another controversial contract.

[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.560]
There are much at grave robbers, there are much at crooks,

[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.420]
just like your Vice President and your President.

[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.000]
I'll tell you right now, the biggest crook of them all is Dick.

[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:55.800]
Yep.

[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.420]
We thought Dick Nixon was the biggest crook.

[00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.320]
Crook of Dick.

[00:44:59.320 --> 00:44:59.320]

[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.560]
The chainy is the most crook of Dick in America.

[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.340]
He could probably use some straightening out.

[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.300]
Probably be bad for his ticker, though.

[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.940]
Halibut is strenuously defended in Iraq.

[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.880]
Work is fairly priced and free of taint.

[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.320]
Oh yeah, free of taint.

[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.460]
A discovery of kickbacks could expose the company to hefty fines

[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.200]
and other punishments such as potential fraud charges.

[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:21.700]
Wow.

[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.940]
At the least a contracting expert say Halibut will be required

[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:26.940]
to reimburse the money.

[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.460]
And aren't you grateful for that cheap gas, George?

[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.400]
I got a pump hooked up in the house.

[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:32.720]
Yeah.

[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.640]
It's like a spigot.

[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.560]
The only cheap gas I got is in bed.

[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.460]
Oh yeah, I like that.

[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.560]
Love farting in bed.

[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.040]
That's one of the better people's covers over your head.

[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.660]
No, actually I put my head down underneath the cover.

[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:46.680]
Oh, that's good.

[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:47.360]
You fan it out?

[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:47.780]
Yeah.

[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.140]
I fan the flames.

[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.820]
Here's another fact from Calvin who says,

[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.160]
might take unwisely Clark.

[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.000]
Boy, this is sure becoming a little too political today.

[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:00.620]
We're trying to use that.

[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:00.620]

[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:01.460]
Sports, sports.

[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.540]
We want to make clearance happy to love sports.

[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.940]
I know I talk too much about that.

[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:08.200]
And we take some heat for it.

[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.280]
But I just, it just never ceases to amaze me.

[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.580]
If I were like you and I hated sports and spectated sports,

[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.000]
there would be a different story.

[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:15.940]
But I don't.

[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.280]
I've been a sports fan all my life.

[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.220]
But there's such a thing as being a sports fan is being neurotic.

[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.120]
It's like the difference between going to the track last night

[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.300]
and having a nice night and enjoyable time winning a few bucks

[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.820]
or calling somebody on a Tuesday and inviting them to come to the track

[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.160]
and I wouldn't trust that even open.

[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.760]
That would be above and beyond the call of like normalcy.

[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.660]
That would be like 720.

[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.640]
That would be an obsession at 715 in the morning,

[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.960]
also called Derek the same day.

[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.860]
And we'll come up.

[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.180]
Yes.

[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.760]
I mean, Rich, love you.

[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.560]
You're a great guy, but give it a rest.

[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.320]
Okay, calm down.

[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.020]
And the rest of your family, too, please.

[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.080]
Tell your nephew, gambling is for suckers.

[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:51.360]
Okay?

[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.040]
Go there, have a good time.

[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.180]
Plunge a little bit.

[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.080]
But don't plan on making a living at it.

[00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:59.760]
Calvin says, might take unwisely Clark.

[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.620]
He's not too favorable.

[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.320]
In the debate last night, I didn't see the debate.

[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:02.920]
It was at the track.

[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.460]
How did it go?

[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.100]
I didn't see it.

[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.300]
I mean, in the debate last night, he had the perfect chance

[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.000]
to level the Bush-Mister on the deserter issue.

[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.040]
Instead, he took a pass.

[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:09.900]
We need, says.

[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:10.460]
He's weeny.

[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.820]
Sooner or later, one of the candidates have to get the fact

[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.280]
out of the general public that the supposed commander-in-chief

[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:15.900]
is a fraud.

[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.700]
I thought I saw somebody saying that, that he was a deserter.

[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:20.560]
Who said that?

[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:21.740]
Dracked object.

[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:22.140]
Not a drag.

[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.660]
He went AWOL for a year.

[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.340]
One of the questions.

[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.960]
Somebody in the crowd, I think, is a little...

[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.340]
No, no.

[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.400]
One of the candidates said that the other day that he went AWOL for a year.

[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.600]
It might have been better than I'd say, because I'm not sure.

[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:33.920]
They did.

[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.100]
They had the cones to say it.

[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:35.800]
Somebody will tell us.

[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.220]
Also, Clark took a swipe at Curie for joining the veterans

[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.060]
against the war organization when he got back from Vietnam.

[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.460]
I'm a Vietnam vet too, doing the same organization.

[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.220]
Like the war in Vietnam, was a good thing?

[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:44.580]
No.

[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.380]
I think Clark is a cryptomere public in heart and can't be trusted

[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:47.960]
since Calvin.

[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.180]
And he might just have a good point.

[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:51.660]
Let's do it.

[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.120]
You don't have to be lucky when your car's on.

[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.540]
If you want to play Russian, you will have to be my guest.

[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.140]
You can open yellow pages and entrust it to some losers out there.

[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.300]
We'll be gone in a little time and all.

[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.900]
But if you want to be smart, take it to EF Terranada Repair

[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.520]
because you can really trust these guys.

[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.080]
They've been around a long time and they will be.

[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.700]
There were 50-83 North Federal Highway, just a mile and a half

[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.220]
north of Sample Road in Pompeville Beach.

[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.980]
And EF Terranada Repair experienced the difference that experience makes.

[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.820]
All EF mechanics are ASC certified technicians.

[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.560]
In other words, they know the latest technology.

[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.680]
They really know their crap.

[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.020]
And most have been with the EF team for nearly 20 long, amazing years.

[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.520]
In fact, combined, they've got over 200 years experience at EF.

[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.680]
No job is too small or too big for me.

[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.040]
Whether it's a blown fuse, a blown engine, anything in between.

[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.840]
Whether it's a 73 Toyota, do an O4 Bentley, EF Terranada Repair

[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:34.780]
be doing it all for you.

[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.900]
Jobs are meticulously double-checked for accuracy by the shop foreman.

[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.740]
And every car is cleaned upon completion of work at a look and run just like brand new.

[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.780]
EF honors most extended warranties offer you a wide-awaited service on most repairs too.

[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.120]
EF Terranada Repair folks you can trust.

[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.100]
There are 50-83 North Federal Highway in Pompeville Beach.

[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.440]
Ask about their 90-day same-as-cash New Interest Credit Card too when you call.

[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.880]
954-426-9926.

[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.280]
954-426-9926.

[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:08.600]
EF Terranada Repair be sure and tell them that old Neal sent you by their nationally recognized as one of the most successful auto repair businesses in the entire country.

[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.040]
My name is Michael and local.

[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.280]
This is 4256.

[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:20.640]
What's proud?

[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.060]
Holy Makin' on!

[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:29.580]
This is Joe Bohr and the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God!

[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:34.380]
Hi, this is Middle-Age, Pasty White Fat Man and Cod Man, Dr. Phil Quick Draw McRaw.

[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.800]
I want to thank each and every one of you for running up and buying my diet book.

[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.440]
And hey, I got good news.

[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.780]
I have a new book for you to give to your cash for.

[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.500]
It's called Dr. Phil's Hair Growth System.

[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.640]
Now you can tell by looking at my head that I've kept a goodly amount of hair around the sides.

[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.820]
And I'm going to tell your husbands just how they can keep it there too.

[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.900]
Now one of the many things you're going to learn in this book is having your husband look in the mirror while it's head of the tween your legs.

[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.740]
They don't trim for several weeks so he can have a nice triangle on his head.

[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.200]
Why, he'll look 10 years younger.

[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:05.060]
If you find it all right here in my new book, Dr. Phil's Hair Growth System.

[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.320]
With the very special forward by the late James Coco.

[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.240]
Maybe that's where Mo got that piece.

[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:14.420]
It's 1103 at 560 WQM, so clearance just came in our program director who's trying very hard.

[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.020]
He really is. He's not knowing that very hard, but he's trying very hard.

[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.660]
And he actually said something that had nothing to do with sports.

[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.340]
Yeah, I was shocking. Mark it down.

[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.180]
Mark it on the counter. Clarence talked politics.

[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.600]
He said I think it was Wesley Clark. I mean Michael Morris said that.

[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.940]
And Michael Moore has said that about Bush being a wall many times.

[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.440]
And I was wrong also. But nice try clearance because it had nothing to do with sports.

[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.740]
So going in fact, I got a new great new set of promos.

[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.420]
Can you imagine how good QM would be if we didn't have so much sports talk on?

[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:43.340]
They're already on order. Wouldn't that be great?

[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:54.180]
Can you imagine that if Mad Dog and Hank and Joe Rose talked about like Titty bars and getting laid and I often imagined food and it's fun stuff like that.

[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.760]
Don't I mean like that?

[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:02.340]
And then I wake up. Yeah. Without losing the license, how much fun I would be as opposed to the dolphins and the draft and the draft and the dolphins?

[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.180]
J. Feeder.

[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.540]
Oh, no, I forget about him. He's ancient history. You better get with it.

[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.820]
But I was wrong. It wasn't one of the candidates.

[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:13.540]
Now see, I will give Dr. Dean high marks for that. He didn't pull any punches.

[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:19.000]
That's why he rolled up his sleeves. Unlike the guy that movie theater, he didn't pull any punches.

[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.840]
But I don't think he actually went that far. It was Paul the Gala on Crossfire said that.

[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:25.460]

I see.

[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:31.420]
I get good profit from being the thief of the efforts

[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:32.780]
to find the claim.

[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:32.780]

[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:32.820]
Im droite chose the name of the thief of the Navy document.

[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:32.820]

[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:32.820]

[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:33.160]
I finally had Kia facilities.

[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:33.180]
So, I realized I wanted to have a deal with it.

[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:33.180]

[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:33.180]

[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:33.400]
I Prince tie skiing.

[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.860]
news or entertainment. Anybody? Ralph or Anne and we're talking about real

[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:41.080]
shows. Don't be mentioned in my show on Wami. I'm not looking for ass sucking. I

[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:45.920]
hate that. You know what I mean? Somebody would do that. No. Anybody like that

[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:51.740]
show needed mental help. Ralph Renek, John Hammbrick, Skipper Chauzank, Rick Sanchez,

[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:57.560]
Ann Bishop, Wayne Chandler, Dave Dixon. That's what we got so far. Now are you

[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.360]
adding those on there? Yes, I'm maddy. There are. Eric doesn't have to be... he

[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.740]
can just watch your hand. Great job on that thing. You did the extended project. Excellent job.

[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:10.360]
He really did. And he's overhauling a whole bunch of other things. We're not new. He is the best. Of course,

[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:16.020]
he has been the best. No, he is. Oh, and what ever happened with the other deal with Josh,

[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.020]
with the computer stuff. We're still waiting for all the chips to land there in that

[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:24.820]
department. So what's going to happen? Probably. It's not done definite deal, but probably. How's that? Yeah.

[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:32.340]
Well, I have to make arrangements for you to get that laptop that I bought for Beener Boy. Also,

[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:41.320]
yeah. God. You know, the last thing I heard Beener Boy say was, here's the appool we got up

[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.960]
there now. I'm not going to be able to rehire it in any way. Because you call them for a

[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:49.000]
minute. Because I'm an old softie. Yeah. I know. Just like the day I talked to Mo here last

[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.900]
day this earlier in a week. And I repent. I apologize for that. Was it this week or last week?

[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.100]
Last week. Last time is your flying. Two weeks is too much. Way too much. Never happened again.

[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:05.620]
What do you think? Why do you think the world champion Marlins have sold so few less than 5,000

[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:12.200]
season tickets? That's our first poll on eorages.com. Hop on it. 212 votes. That's Eureka Kotfer,

[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:20.280]
New York. Their fans are mostly front running phonies. 79. Front running phonies. They are. Full of crap.

[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:26.720]
What's the next bandwagon we can hop on? Come on. If the dolphins get hot, if the heat gets hot,

[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:33.040]
hot heat. Like me, most people don't give a shmit about them. 62 of you say that. You don't give a shmit.

[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.920]
And your entitled. That was my vote. I don't care about the Marlins. I don't care about baseball.

[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:44.220]
Nope. South Florida is Bushley 29. There are a few real sports fans here. 24 and boy,

[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.680]
that is positively. Absolutely correct. It's a horse in Buggie Town. I know we've been over

[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.880]
this a million times. But boy, Daniel Bastard's column got me whipped up into a frenzy. Almost.

[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:58.440]
Almost want to wipe my ass with it. And they need new stadium 18. That's why you're not showing up.

[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:08.340]
It's too hot. It rains. The town of excuses. And let me say it again. The Macarena man,

[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:12.660]
that place. Why they make up those bogus attendance is all over the NHL. I have no idea. They're not

[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:17.120]
fooling anybody. They don't just do it here. They do it anywhere. Tickets distributed.

[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.940]
When you can open up a window and throw a thousand an hour. Oh, we distribute a thousand

[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:27.680]
to tickets. 30,000 tickets. Of course, it only holds 19 to 50. But we distribute 30,000 tickets. We

[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:33.000]
open up the window, not the window. And nobody showed up. They were for free. Nobody showed up.

[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:39.840]
I'll be god damn. Must be something about this place. Too many old people. The myth of the Cuban

[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:43.320]
love of baseball. That's one of the big myths with the whole Marlin thing. So full of crap.

[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.020]
I heard some call. I was at Hancock, a mad dog. I guess they call it again about the

[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:50.800]
Oh, and Pudge Rodriguez. The Cubans loving a bullcrap. That's

[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:56.940]
racist. I don't know what to do. Crap. Garbage. Plus, he's not Cuban anyway. Right. Any

[00:56:56.940 --> 00:57:01.060]
of you? Some kind of recon. Is he a recon? He's a recon. I think you're right with a big fat ass.

[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.880]
Well, take your fat ass and get lost. Okay. Go punch packing. Go back to Detroit. You'll love it

[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:12.820]
there, man. Sucks. How many white people in Detroit? That's enough. 10 after 11 at 5.60. QAM.

[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:33.660]
Cной Marines

[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:33.860]
Saints.

[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:40.620]
12

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:40.620]

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:40.620]

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:40.620]

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:40.620]

[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.360]
A screaming alien as he drove away,

[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:50.520]
Cos they were never waiting me.

[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.260]
He grabbed the flight to Vegas,

[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.380]
And hit all the strip clubs.

[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:00.860]
Girls were crevping his friends,

[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.880]
They were given battle at the dance,

[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.660]
He was high leveled of freaking cops.

[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:09.620]
They said, bye to the punks,

[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:13.240]
And she, well, I'm pronounced.

[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.300]
A screaming alien as he drove away,

[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.340]
Cos they were never waiting me.

[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.320]
He grabbed the flight from the time they made a jersey,

[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:27.700]
And she had a head in her palm.

[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:28.660]
Welcome.

[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.320]
I was saying that she was a couple,

[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.720]
Was touching feeling like the whole mess was a big damn bomb.

[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:39.260]
Battle has to go, you messed up call.

[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:43.300]
Bins it back to the punks,

[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.500]
And she went off and down.

[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.520]
They're all done by the way.

[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:48.680]
Let's hear it.

[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:49.620]
Let's hear it.

[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.300]
No, I was thinking more like,

[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.060]
Like,

[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.660]
That's what that was.

[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.160]
I can't imagine who put that in there.

[00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:58.900]
Probably some retard.

[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.960]
Probably some crazy person.

[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:02.400]
What's it called?

[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.140]
It's called, I don't know.

[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.200]
It's called Ben and JLo.

[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:07.620]
Okay.

[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.320]
They're done as anybody here.

[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:09.460]
No.

[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.260]
So it's hard to them.

[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.440]
Just go away. Don't you understand?

[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.520]
You cause it, Fag.

[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.660]
I mean, just go away.

[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.600]
I already had stopped with a funny baloney crap.

[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.900]
And your movie is sucked by the way.

[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.480]
All of his movie without her, I guess,

[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.020]
Is doing pretty good.

[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.440]
Did he have a movie here recently without her?

[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:24.380]
I don't know.

[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.820]
Just ditch the bitch, Ben.

[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:26.920]
That's all ditch the bitch.

[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.580]
Go back to Matt.

[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:28.540]
ditch the bitch.

[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:31.420]
Here's one for our poll today by Fax from Al.

[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.060]
Thank you Al.

[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:32.560]
Good choice.

[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:35.780]

[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.420]
Charlie Baxter.

[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.300]
MT Graves.

[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:38.180]
There you go.

[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.480]
We're putting his real name or the character name.

[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:41.180]
MT Graves.

[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:41.420]
Okay.

[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.120]
And what about...

[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.140]
Oh, we got Dave Dixon, right?

[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:46.540]
From the original channel 51.

[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.860]
Those were the days, baby, from Pirate World in Dania.

[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.700]
Back when they had the nude beach in Dania.

[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.380]
Back when we had all kinds of stuff going on a four-letter day.

[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:54.700]
I've been there.

[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.160]
Back when it was like living and breathing fun people here.

[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.740]
Before all the old parts moved in.

[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.960]
And all the people came in on a rubber rafts.

[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.440]
Do it.

[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.120]
Hell with a fit-down.

[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:02.460]
Do it.

[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.120]
Hell with a fit-down.

[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.480]
Take the hell and stick them.

[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:04.760]
Okay.

[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.300]
Okay.

[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.840]
Let's get some choices for the poll here.

[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:09.480]
56670560.

[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.100]
Because we're going to start doing it at noon.

[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.460]
Pound 560 on a 18 and T.

[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:14.860]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:16.360]
Shall we?

[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.220]
Shall we plow in them?

[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:19.760]
WQIM.

[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.200]
How you doing?

[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:22.700]
Pretty good.

[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:23.100]
How you doing?

[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:23.640]
Oh, Neil.

[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.100]
How you doing?

[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:24.540]
Okay.

[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.300]
I have a Glenn Rinker for your poll.

[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.040]
Glenn Rinker is good.

[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:27.500]
Isn't he dead?

[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.200]
I don't know, but...

[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.340]
I think he had died in Orlando or somewhere.

[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.220]
I was watching the shining last night.

[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.780]
There's a little clip of him in the shadows.

[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:34.960]
Right.

[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:35.420]
That's right.

[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:36.860]
Channel 10 is on.

[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:37.400]
That's right.

[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:38.600]
Good choice.

[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.080]
Okay.

[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:39.760]
Thanks, Pally.

[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.300]
Have a great weekend.

[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.780]
Is it, Anne, also on that little clip of this one?

[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:43.380]

[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:43.760]
Channel 10.

[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.580]
I witness news.

[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.720]
Glenn with one or two ends, Rinker.

[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.160]
One.

[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.260]
Oh, come on.

[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:48.820]
Who cares.

[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.500]
He's dead anyway.

[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.140]
I'm pretty sure.

[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.000]
Who's the other guy from Channel 10?

[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:52.320]
Ron.

[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.760]
We go through that every time.

[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.160]
Ron Hunter.

[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.280]
Remember him?

[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.120]
No.

[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:56.940]
Oh, he's dead.

[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.260]
Now, one of them committed suicide in Orlando.

[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.480]
I think I might have been Glenn Rinker.

[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.620]
A lot of short people commit suicide, George.

[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.500]
Yeah, well, the guy from Family Feud.

[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.040]
What was his name?

[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:08.720]
Uh-huh.

[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:10.180]
Combs.

[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.540]
Ray Combs.

[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:12.220]

[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:12.940]
Are they Villaches?

[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.560]
Ray Combs and some people comb over, like me.

[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.000]
Are they Villaches committed suicide?

[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.420]
See, I don't know.

[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:20.980]
I didn't know that.

[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.100]
Till this day, I didn't know that.

[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:22.760]
Really?

[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:23.400]
No.

[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.800]
Yeah, I couldn't handle it anymore.

[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.660]
He was a prick for a while.

[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:26.900]
Was he?

[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:27.520]
Yeah, miserable.

[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.180]
Oh, there's nothing worse than a short prick.

[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.780]
And Ray Combs.

[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.760]
And who else did we just say?

[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.240]
Glenn Rinker.

[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.680]
I think he committed suicide.

[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.660]
Maybe we were Ron Hunter.

[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:37.620]
A lot of them guys.

[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.600]
He used to be on Channel 10.

[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:39.220]
I would.

[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:39.780]
His news.

[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.900]
I wouldn't have seen that.

[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.060]
He's a good people here on TV.

[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:43.940]
They don't last too long.

[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:44.760]
They stick around a lot.

[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.460]
What about David Bloom, Rest in Peace?

[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.020]
Don't know him.

[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.380]
Oh, the dough.

[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:50.700]
Yeah.

[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.080]
Well, he was embedded and now he's dead.

[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.480]
Right.

[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.320]
That's what he was about to put him on the room.

[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.760]
Sure, he was at a channel six year for a long time.

[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:58.340]
He's a good guy.

[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.640]
David Bloom died for another guy.

[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.000]
That for no reason at all.

[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.660]
Absolutely, positively.

[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.880]
Too many dead people.

[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.200]
It's worth it.

[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.040]
No, it's not.

[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.740]
The president says it's worth it.

[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.260]
I see.

[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:11.480]
WQA.

[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:11.780]
Hello.

[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.880]
I had a great line for that, but I can't use it.

[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:14.560]
560.

[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.560]
560.

[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.140]
0.560 on the AT&T.

[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.520]
And Verizon wireless line.

[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:20.860]
WQA.

[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:21.100]
Hello.

[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:21.920]
OK.

[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.840]
Why don't we have a short fuse today?

[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:24.300]
That's Friday.

[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.400]
How come the kids are out of school today?

[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.080]
They don't know.

[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:27.800]
They are.

[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.360]
They are, yeah.

[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:30.500]
The final is that it?

[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:30.760]
Yeah.

[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.180]
So maybe nobody's in town.

[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:33.440]
WQA.

[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:33.720]
Hello.

[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:35.040]
Neil?

[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:35.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.840]
How about the...

[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.480]
Is this Neil?

[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.560]
Yes, sounds like me.

[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.160]
Hey, how about the floor closure?

[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.840]
Well, that's 100 years ago.

[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:44.160]
OK.

[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.560]
You think so?

[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.320]
On channel seven, right?

[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.940]
That's even before I came here.

[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.220]
About Wayne Ferris.

[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.340]
Blue, I had Wayne...

[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:53.340]
Hahaha.

[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:54.960]
Hahaha.

[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.420]
We're not talking about who you have the hotspour, OK?

[01:02:59.220 --> 01:02:59.860]
Wayne Ferris.

[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.220]
We can put him on there.

[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:01.640]
OK.

[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.200]
Is it a horror?

[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:03.540]
Cloramosure?

[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.100]
Claire.

[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.040]
Claire, Cloram, I think it's Cloram.

[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:06.400]
I don't know.

[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.680]
I don't know how to spell Mojure.

[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.960]
He won't mind if we misspell it.

[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.640]
Sam and Glenn Wrenker.

[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.620]
Pretty sure they're both dead.

[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.980]
See, it's OK if you misspell somebody that they're dead.

[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.060]
I didn't spell Mojure.

[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.260]
M-O-S-A-T-E-R.

[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:15.680]
Mojure.

[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.420]
Just like Gary Mojure, who couldn't drive his finger up his butt up the track.

[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and Mark Mojure.

[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:21.440]
Another stiff.

[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.700]
Pound 5, 60 on an AT&T.

[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.240]
And Ferris and wireless line.

[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.720]
And there's something with the phone here.

[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:28.700]
Is this phone screwed up?

[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.380]
Maybe not.

[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.180]
Maybe it's just us.

[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.780]
Nobody QA him, hello?

[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:33.640]
Hey!

[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.240]
Jackie Johnson.

[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.400]
Jackie Johnson.

[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.060]
There you go.

[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:37.660]
Don't keep coming.

[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.080]
All right. Thanks, Pat.

[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:39.820]
You bet.

[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:40.840]
Jackie Johnson.

[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:41.300]
Got it.

[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.300]
We're getting about 100 names on here for this.

[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.040]
I like this poll.

[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.720]
Let's say something good about somebody.

[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:46.940]
Okay?

[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.240]
So just rip it in an ass.

[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:49.440]
Aaaaah!

[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.600]
Tired of that.

[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.940]
Always getting this crap about how I'm so negative.

[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.380]
Trying to say something good about some people who were good here.

[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.220]
And then they got out while they're getting was good.

[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.440]
Here's that first poll, baby.

[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.480]
Why do you think the world champion, Marlins, has sold so few less than 5,000 season tickets,

[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.420]
fewer than the frickin buffalo bisons, triple A baseball, minor league team,

[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:13.120]
and the Sacramento, Queen B's, whatever they are.

[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.300]

[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.480]
Their fans are mostly front running phonies, 99 out of 257.

[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.700]
Like me, most people don't give a shmit about them.

[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.660]
71 of you said that.

[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:23.720]
Don't give a shmit.

[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.900]
South Florida's Bush League, 34.

[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.400]
There are a few real sports fans here, 34.

[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.560]
And they need a new stadium, 19.

[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.940]
I love that last part of LeBaptured's Colombo.

[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:38.080]
He talks about Detroit, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh.

[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.980]
All the new stadiums in the world aren't putting any,

[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.900]
I mean, not making the teams any better, more competitive,

[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.480]
and are not putting any asses in the seats.

[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:49.820]
If a championship, if a champion, can't appreciably increase and sustain interest,

[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:50.940]
why would a new building?

[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.520]
And you are absolutely correct.

[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.880]
I never thought I would live to say it on the air about Daniel LeBaptured.

[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.840]
Finally, he put his thumb right on it.

[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.660]
That's what we're saying, Ches, was talking about yesterday,

[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.140]
putting his thumb right on it.

[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:10.000]
And even Kim Bo-Kampard this morning, made a very good point, a political point.

[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.500]
You ready for that?

[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.460]
I bet your clearance probably sneaked in, and it's an O'Neill's pretty pissed off.

[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.640]
Too much of this goddamn sport.

[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.700]
Say something about the president.

[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.200]
Sports!

[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.260]
Yeah, too much that.

[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:24.760]
You know, Bush spent a couple of minutes talking about athletes and steroids,

[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.160]
yes, in his speech.

[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.340]
And his bow said, as Bush said,

[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.860]
with all these people dying in Iraq, with so many people out of work,

[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.060]
with all of the major problems with the environment, with all these species dying,

[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.840]
all of the crap going on in the world.

[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:46.100]
And this asshole president talks about sports, about toe-cold steroids,

[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.060]
and his Paul Begalla pointed out accurately yesterday when he was the owner of the Texas Rangers,

[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.700]
and when steroid use was rampant, who did they acquire?

[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.940]
Jose Cansoco, the steroid king and queen himself.

[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.920]
And they all knew what was going on in all the owners, including Bush looked the other way.

[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.180]
Now of course, because he's got to be the goody-two shoes, commander, and thief.

[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.300]
We're not going to have no-no blow jobs in a White House, and those steroids in a locker room.

[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.140]
See, in Florida, we got Reverend Bush, is the governor.

[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.180]
Reverend Bush, right.

[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.380]
Everything now is with religion.

[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.340]
And then of course, he also talked about the faith-patient-based initiative.

[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.460]
They should have gotten up and booed him right off the stage,

[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.200]
but they don't have any balls.

[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:26.860]
That's a problem.

[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.060]
See, if the Democrats we do run over, they're going to have to do what Howard Dean did, not lose it.

[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.380]
But they're going to have to roll up your sleeves.

[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.820]
Right. Just like Ross Piro said, roll up your sleeves and do-do-do.

[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.020]
And I'll break you and take you to that, though.

[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:39.920]
Not like that.

[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.140]
You liked it?

[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.740]
I saw it again, like, 500 times since then.

[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.280]
Yeah.

[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:45.560]
And I, you liked it?

[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:46.240]
And then I'm going to go, ah!

[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.060]
Well, that's beside me.

[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:48.680]
I'm going to go, ah!

[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:50.520]
Okay.

[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.580]
I think you just charged the White House.

[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.180]
People want to be pissed off and tell him the truth, and just ripping him and ass, which he doesn't-

[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.640]
Just like move on, dot org, as much as I appreciate their efforts.

[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:02.260]
They whipped out apologizing for the Hitler and Bush ads.

[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.320]
There was nothing wrong with those ads.

[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:03.940]
They were honest.

[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.380]
And nothing to apologize about.

[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.480]
They make absolutely nothing to apologize for.

[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.140]
Oh, well, we don't want to be associated with that.

[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.100]
They were over the line.

[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:11.720]
No, they were not.

[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.440]
They were right on top.

[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:12.660]
Right.

[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:14.920]
Can't be honest in America no more.

[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:16.980]
Give it a Q-A-M.

[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.180]
Hello.

[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.580]
Steve Rotted Arrow.

[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:20.680]
Okay. Steve Rotted.

[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.420]
Don't put it down, though.

[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:22.760]
Because that was the guy.

[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:23.120]
Yes.

[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:23.780]
That was that asshole.

[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:23.960]
Yes.

[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.220]
See, you don't get to vote.

[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:28.280]
You don't get to make selections on a poll because your voice is so obvious.

[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.140]
You're such an asshole.

[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.520]
You're such a quizzling, man.

[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.420]
I'll just touch the poll.

[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:31.860]
Yeah.

[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:33.160]
Jackass.

[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:36.400]
WQA-M, hello.

[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:37.600]
Chambot.

[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.060]
Like I said, back at you.

[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.120]
WQA-M, hello.

[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:44.280]
My law police ass rojo.

[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:47.420]
5670560.

[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.040]
Pound 560.

[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.500]
I don't think we're going to have billed this list.

[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.340]
I don't think we got anybody out there, anybody here.

[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.220]
WQA-M, hello.

[01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:58.220]
Okay.

[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.140]
I don't want to lose your audience, but I'd like to talk to you with you just for a moment.

[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.140]
30 seconds.

[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:03.680]
Time's up.

[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:03.800]

[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:10.820]
Why does this organization down here find losing and buy one, get one free seats?

[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.220]
Why did they find that acceptable?

[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:13.980]
Ask them.

[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.320]
Ask them.

[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.240]
Because it's not acceptable.

[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:17.960]
No, it is not.

[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:23.540]
But blowing six or seven, three goal leads in a season is not acceptable.

[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:28.920]
And every time a hair piece gets on after the game, all he says is how great his team does.

[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:29.960]
Yeah.

[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.660]
You see not watching with everybody else?

[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.360]
He can't say how bad his hair pieces because it's worse even than most.

[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.520]
My hair is smitten, can't add George.

[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:37.780]
Can add, asshole.

[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.060]
George, you're picking on you.

[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:39.860]
Thanks.

[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.000]
It's a bush league organization.

[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.180]
Okay, it's all I can tell you.

[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:44.800]
They talk a good game.

[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.620]
The youngsters in the organization, and all this other crap.

[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.720]
You know what people are tired of waiting.

[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.900]
And like I said yesterday, season ticket holders are tired of getting gouged and paying gigantic bucks.

[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:55.800]
And then seeing tickets going two for one and two for none.

[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.540]
And the 10 freebies here in ten.

[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:58.840]
It's a joke.

[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.180]
If you have a great steakhouse, you don't say, oh, we're going to give you two steaks for one today.

[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.020]
Can you imagine it?

[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:04.900]
It was Chris.

[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:05.700]
Yeah.

[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.520]
And if that ain't good enough, how about what do you do?

[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.440]
How about two free ones?

[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:09.820]
All right.

[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.280]
I can imagine it.

[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.440]
I'm just envisioning now.

[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.880]
I can see the first person to be online for the free steaks at Ruth Chris.

[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.800]
If it's free, it's me.

[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:18.300]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:19.820]
Oh, oh, oh.

[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.200]
He'd be standing outside, tapping his toe, waiting for them to open at the right.

[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.660]
I can just see it.

[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.480]
I can envision it now.

[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.860]
5.67, they don't like our polo today I guess.

[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.820]
Or else there's nobody out there.

[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.060]
Look kind of slim to me this morning.

[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.060]
Every time the kids are out of school, it's the same thing.

[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:36.780]
Why don't you warn me?

[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:38.200]
I can stay at home and slept in this morning.

[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.180]
Exactly.

[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.700]
I don't want to do a show talking to myself.

[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.720]
You have ten people out there.

[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:44.820]
Yeah.

[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.900]
Seven people ringing the phone.

[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:46.880]
Well, that no six.

[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.100]
One of them might be real.

[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.100]
You think?

[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:50.360]
Chamba?

[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.860]
So what about who did that guy say that asshole?

[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:54.480]
What do you say Steve?

[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.340]
I think I...

[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:55.900]
Steve Rondonero.

[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.620]
No, I'm not saying we ought to put him on there.

[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.240]
He won't get any votes.

[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:00.660]
In fact, you know what?

[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.880]
I think it was Steve Rondonero.

[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.720]
26 past 11 at 5.60 QAM.

[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:05.340]
My!

[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.760]
And look all.

[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.960]
Six is 4.2560.

[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.740]
QA, QA.

[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.120]
Good.

[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.880]
Now, from the channel 10, I witness me.

[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.020]
I guess that's a QAM.

[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.620]
Hey, where's he going?

[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:20.540]
What's he doing with that machine gun?

[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:21.520]
Oh my god.

[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.960]
Quick, quick, get him into the light.

[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:27.100]
He was fed up with reading one story after another

[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.800]
about drugs and violence.

[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:33.700]
Now, she wants to write the rules and rewrite the news.

[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.840]
In and fall.

[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.280]
Starring and vicious.

[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.100]
Don't kill me, please.

[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.940]
I'll see you tonight at 5.6011.

[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:44.720]
God.

[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.480]
And boom.

[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.980]
She took the news into her old hands.

[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.260]
What are you going to do with me?

[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.920]
When I get through with you, there won't be enough of you left

[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.960]
to make a good suitcase for Don No.

[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.940]
And boom.

[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.400]
Starring and vicious.

[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.860]
Also, starring Carl Wethers is doing blood and ale.

[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.960]
And Don No says Don No.

[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.440]
There's a stationary.

[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:10.460]
Run over the Midwest.

[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.200]
And boom.

[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.740]
She rewrote the news.

[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.680]
And home.

[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:17.960]
Going round.

[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.520]
And the Dwight says he still tastes really good.

[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:21.200]
11.32.

[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.820]
What do you make him face this for, man?

[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:24.600]
I'm promising.

[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.200]
At 5.60 WQM.

[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.000]
There was a lot there, man.

[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.060]
There was a lot of meat on that bone.

[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.520]
NBC dumps Best Comedy Ever Friends ad.

[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:32.920]
Well, thank God for that.

[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.440]
Says, okay, maybe Friends isn't the best comedy ever.

[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.680]
NBC promised yesterday not to be run a promo.

[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.060]
It sounds like here.

[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.360]
A lot of people promising not to be run promos that are offensive.

[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:44.820]
Okay.

[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:49.340]
Using that phrase to refer to the show which will go off here after 10 years in May.

[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:51.660]
They were just trying to hype it when overboard.

[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:55.140]
NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Mark said it ran once and it won't run again.

[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.420]
Just like Clarence said this morning.

[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.360]
You what he said when I told him about them promos?

[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.700]
The ad hurt some people most prominently Kelsey Grammer star a phraser.

[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.120]
Five times the Emmy winner for Best Comedy.

[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.540]
Friends is one of the Emmy once.

[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:13.360]
In addition to which neither show could lick all of the family's ass.

[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.080]
Right.

[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.300]
Or the Jefferson's or I'm sure a Zayn other comedy shows.

[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:17.900]
Correct.

[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:18.440]
Right.

[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:22.160]
I can't blame them for saying that Grammer told reporters last week,

[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.420]
although he'd all know it's not true.

[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:24.580]
And you're not either.

[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.060]
Kelsey.

[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:26.780]
And watch your grammar.

[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.160]
5.607.

[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.540]
05.60.

[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.680]
Pound 5.60 on it.

[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.940]
There's no interest in this poll today.

[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.000]
Pertrenut.

[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.360]
See anyone in a while because it's something positive.

[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.320]
It's proof.

[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.380]
Here's the facts though.

[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.380]
We're getting better suggestions on a fax machine and on the phone.

[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.280]
My suggestion for your second poll is the biggest bitch ever on my TV.

[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.180]
Jilla Unruh.

[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.380]
You know who that is?

[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.480]
Jilda Unruh.

[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:53.440]
Unruh?

[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:55.180]
Jilda Jilda.

[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.580]
Jilda Unruh.

[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.100]
You are.

[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.740]
It says Jilda.

[01:12:59.020 --> 01:12:59.660]
Is it Jilda?

[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:00.820]
I think it's Jilda.

[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.180]
Well, Jilda the Lily man.

[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.280]
I don't know how to say it.

[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.580]
This is makes all the local guys on TV look like whims.

[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.860]
And it also says you should have a poll sometime.

[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.060]
A favorite local TV reporter.

[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.620]
So many have moved on to the network.

[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.840]
David Bloom, rest in peace.

[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.040]
Steve Kroff, Michael Wim.

[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:14.880]
Now we're not going to do that.

[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:15.700]
And it's too narrow.

[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.140]
How do you spell Unruh before you tear that up?

[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.640]
You and R.U.H.

[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.200]
Got it?

[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:21.760]
Get it.

[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:24.580]
5.607.

[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.320]
05.60.

[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.280]
Pound 9 are going.

[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.200]
Fones are in a little bit.

[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:27.760]
We'll get to you.

[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:29.460]
What?

[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:30.220]
What are you laughing about?

[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:31.360]
I don't like that.

[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.340]
I grabbed something out of Florida.

[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:38.960]
I'm just taking my time.

[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.060]
It's an important facts.

[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.060]
I was about to do Willie Nelson saw, which we would play today,

[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:43.980]
but we can't find it.

[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.860]
Or we found it, but it was too late.

[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:46.600]
Yeah, too late.

[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.840]
And it's, and we'll play it sometime.

[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.280]
It's still plenty of time tomorrow.

[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:50.780]
Yeah, tomorrow show.

[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.860]
Now line one never hangs on because it disconnects real fast.

[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.340]
WQM dial tone.

[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.780]
Like I said, the dial tone would have been better.

[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.200]
WQM, hello.

[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.600]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.080]
How you doing?

[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:02.400]
OK.

[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.260]
I'm fine.

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:03.260]

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:03.260]

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:03.260]

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:03.260]

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:03.260]

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:06.640]
I don't have a vote for the poll, but I just found out something.

[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:09.280]
I'm going home to New York City in April.

[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:09.680]
Yeah.

[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.200]
And I'm going to a seminar.

[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.500]
And the keynote speaker that closes is Michael Moore.

[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:15.980]
Excellent.

[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:18.680]
Yeah, so I'm really looking forward to that.

[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.640]
And I'm going to see what he has to say.

[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.640]
But I'm going to get a copy of the tape.

[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.880]
And I'll bring him back a present when I come home from New York.

[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:26.620]
Outstanding.

[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.780]
You have yourself a wonderful day.

[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.600]
And came up with a good work.

[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.060]
Thank you.

[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.040]
There you go.

[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:36.040]
56070560, Tom 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.360]
Who is your favorite all time?

[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.660]
Soft Florida TV personality.

[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.240]
Newsperson entertainment person, whatever they might have been.

[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:42.900]
Kitty show.

[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.340]
Got a good list.

[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:46.840]
We'll get that up at noon.

[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:47.480]
We'll get it up.

[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.220]
We'll go see Alice.

[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.280]
WQAM.

[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.440]
C'mon.

[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:53.780]
WQAM, hello.

[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.320]
Wow.

[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.140]
They are good.

[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.420]
I'm telling you, there's nobody here.

[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:00.880]
WQAM, hello.

[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.260]
Hi, Neil.

[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:02.800]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:08.140]
Hey, I think in recognition of Marino getting with the dolphins,

[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.560]
you should play Jimmy and Danny.

[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.500]
No, I don't think so.

[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.120]
We already been to all of that.

[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:14.880]
WQAM, hello.

[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:16.560]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:16.920]
Yes.

[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.300]
How about Morris McLemore?

[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.940]
Oh, no, I can't forget about it.

[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.020]
You know, Morris McLemore.

[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.560]
And they're all you old people that have been here a hundred years.

[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:26.480]
Get out of here.

[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.280]
Been dead for 50 years.

[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.340]
George is rolling his eyes.

[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.300]
Never heard of it.

[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.900]
Well, it's because he's just like Claire Mosier.

[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.240]
There's people around here a hundred years ago.

[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:37.560]
Come on.

[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.600]
Give us somebody that's with some meat on it.

[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:39.840]
Okay.

[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.080]
With some meat on a bowl.

[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.120]
What's wrong with you people?

[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:42.460]
God.

[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:45.680]
You're about as much fun as playing Russian Ruler with a fully loaded piece.

[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.840]
Sounds good to me, mom.

[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:50.340]
WQAM, hello.

[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:51.020]
Hey, Neil.

[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:51.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.520]
This has nothing to do with talent, really, but Penny Daniel.

[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.100]
Penny Daniel.

[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:56.440]
Yeah.

[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.580]
Well, now, see that bring back some memories.

[01:15:58.740 --> 01:15:58.880]
Yeah.

[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:00.140]
Not good ones either.

[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.320]
Well, I can understand that, but you wouldn't, you wouldn't understand that.

[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.340]
No, I would.

[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:04.880]
Thank you.

[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.460]
Thank you, sir.

[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:05.860]
Thank you.

[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:06.940]
I wouldn't understand it.

[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.060]
No, I don't, I don't get any of that straight ass stuff.

[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:10.960]
What?

[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.220]
Just that gay ass.

[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.520]
Just that gay ass, yeah.

[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.080]
And then there's always ANS at.

[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:16.860]
Bracka Moo.

[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.180]
What says gay ass?

[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.620]
He said stay away from that thing.

[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.660]
He's got dibs on it.

[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.680]
Their friends are mostly from running phone.

[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.100]
They're only on the 19 of you say that.

[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:29.240]
That's why the Marlins aren't doing Schmidt for a season tickets.

[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.040]
For running phoneies, one 19.

[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.300]
See, they don't, they're pissed off.

[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.380]
They don't like this because they're taking a shot at this town.

[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.880]
And accurately so well deserved 305 votes.

[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.320]
Like me, most people will give a shmit about the Marlins 88.

[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.660]
South Voters Bush League 39.

[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.720]
There are a few real sports fans here, 39.

[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:48.280]
And they need a new stadium, 20.

[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:50.960]
And maybe they need a new announcer.

[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.320]
You're gonna put that on there too.

[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.620]
Maybe Booog should be doing a whole game instead of Dave and boring.

[01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:00.560]
See, this station, there are a lot of people, and even, even, for real, when he was here.

[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:01.880]
Talked to a good game.

[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.940]
Ah, but, you know, but when I try to get him to really say something about people, he wouldn't do it.

[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:06.660]
Right?

[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.560]
In other words, if he coveted their wife or their hair piece or whatever it was.

[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.460]
Oh, but he's a nice guy.

[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:11.760]
Yeah.

[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.400]
Who cares?

[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.920]
He's a gack, he's a nice guy.

[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:14.500]
He sucks.

[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:15.520]
He blows.

[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.240]
His work is grotesque.

[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:18.860]
Okay?

[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.180]
Okay.

[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:24.360]
You can think of many, many, very nice people whose work isn't incompetent.

[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:25.880]
We're in the wrong business.

[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.840]
I mean, Donald Brainer might be a very nice guy.

[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:32.940]
If they attract, he couldn't, he couldn't find his way to the finish line with a compass in a road map and a search party.

[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:35.540]
With Caminwala's riding shotgun.

[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.720]
He still couldn't find his way there.

[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.480]
I mean, just because somebody is nice doesn't mean you have to cover for their, you know, inadequacies.

[01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:44.560]
Oh, excellent.

[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:46.880]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.380]
Hey, Leo, what's up, man?

[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:48.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.120]
Everybody's talking about the Patriarch ending next year, the Patriarch?

[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:52.760]
Yes.

[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:53.760]
The Brady Bill.

[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.100]
It ends this year.

[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:55.520]
Yeah.

[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:56.460]
Tom Brady Bill.

[01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:06.600]
Tom Brady Bill, the one that releases the inhibitions on the guns that they tend to round limit on the systems.

[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:11.000]
I mean, it's like, and some Democrats raising holy hell about it.

[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.400]
I mean, they're talking about what the Patriarch had.

[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:16.360]
I said, take care of what ends this year first.

[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.440]
Sir, I'm a lot more worried about the Patriarchs right now, but I'm the Patriarchs, okay, and have a nice weekend.

[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.860]
I don't want to do light bulb radio here today, okay?

[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.440]
Then we won't have any audience.

[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.740]
What's wrong with you, people?

[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:28.820]
I mean, this is a good guy we talked to him before, but just calm down.

[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.080]
The people here are not in any of this.

[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.220]
They don't know from it.

[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.120]
They don't want to know from it.

[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:33.680]
They don't care.

[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.200]
The intellectual capacity here is like that of a P.

[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.560]
So just forget about it.

[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.660]
That's why there's so much stress here.

[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:40.620]
Too up.

[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.480]
Yeah, stop being so uptight, all you people.

[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:43.020]
Just relax.

[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.740]
We're living in paradise.

[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:45.780]
It's paradise.

[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:49.580]
Be a little more friendly, a little more laid back instead of always being angry.

[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:50.420]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:51.720]
Always like unleashed.

[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:52.500]
Yeah.

[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.060]
In fact, he should come down here and do that.

[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:56.760]
Hey, there you go.

[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.000]
Then he'd be amongst people who could relate.

[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:03.300]
Because everybody here, every day they want to just put their head out the window like a network and go,

[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:04.600]
Right.

[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.400]
Don't you?

[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:07.580]
I do.

[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.140]
Wow.

[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.620]
I don't just want to, but I do do.

[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.040]
I was speaking to do do, they're showing duty on TV.

[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.480]
I'm actually still can't get over that.

[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.440]
Channel four under the guise of news.

[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:19.060]
Yeah.

[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:19.640]
Right.

[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:20.500]
They're showing crap.

[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.260]
Kitty crap on here.

[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.340]
Because it's a news story.

[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.000]
We're news.

[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.100]
No, you just want to, you just want to put some duty on here.

[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:27.420]
It's all.

[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.340]
Channel four news.

[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.780]
Not only don't they speak English, but they put duty on here.

[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.020]
Twenty till noon at 560.

[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.720]
Q.A.M.

[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:38.920]
My life and look all.

[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:40.920]
This is 420560.

[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.740]
You wait, you wait.

[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:45.300]
Miami.

[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.000]
But the perfect time turned you into an e-grove.

[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.760]
Way for water, yell, channeled in useless news.

[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:57.620]
For me tonight, for a channel 10 under the covers report of the dangers of achieving a golden time.

[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.820]
Plus, the dangers of redcrumb build up in your toaster.

[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.800]
Channel 10 Doppler Weather.

[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.000]
With channel 12 meteorologist John Matthews.

[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.600]
Here's the latest on Florida's deadly drought.

[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.720]
Another beautiful day of sunshine comes your way.

[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:14.580]
Ho ho ho ho.

[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:20.200]
Then join Christy Kruger for part seven of her special report on the safety of lactation suction devices.

[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.620]
Channel 10 News.

[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.020]
You through snows, you can't use.

[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.400]
It's on 45.

[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:26.860]
Let's put white water down there.

[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:27.720]
We're not going to wait.

[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.180]
Can't.

[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.840]
We're not going to wait till somebody sees ungrateful bastards calling.

[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.300]
How many years has he been on there?

[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:34.220]
About third man.

[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:34.680]
I agree.

[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:36.720]
I realize he used to be more popular when he had the mustache.

[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.060]
But Anne forced him to cut it off.

[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.360]
She did.

[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.640]
It's as she said, it's chafed.

[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.360]
She made him shave it off.

[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.020]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.400]
Here's the list we got so far.

[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.320]
And obviously the interest in this is phenomenal.

[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:52.900]
Well, that's okay.

[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.900]
We know that you don't want to say anything good about anybody because you're a bunch of relentless heartless bastards.

[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.600]
Who are all of the people I'd call in on the sports shows?

[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.180]
This was great.

[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:02.820]
It was classic.

[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.360]
I'm driving home yesterday.

[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.400]
Mad Dog gets a call.

[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.340]
I just a suckhole.

[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.700]
Oh, Mr. Manage, it's such an honor to speak to you when I was down at the field during the

[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.340]
Dolphin's Menderic game, whatever game it was.

[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.660]
And I wanted to come over to say hi, but I didn't have the balls to do it.

[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.020]
And Jim says, well, next time you know, we'll come by and say hi.

[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.380]
And he goes on with whatever his point was or his question.

[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.180]
And Manage hangs up on him and rips him for an idiotic call.

[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.060]
That was great.

[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.860]
As only the mad dog would do.

[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.380]
Oh, right.

[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.520]
See because he's not into that ass suckin' either.

[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.480]
People groveling, oh, Mr. Manage, it's such an honor to speak to you.

[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:36.780]
Why?

[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:37.720]
Why is that?

[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.120]
That ring.

[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.620]
But do you know anybody would be an honor to speak to them?

[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:42.660]
Seriously.

[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.740]
Can I get back to you?

[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:46.480]
Right.

[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.500]
That's my point.

[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.960]
I mean, there are people like Michael Moore.

[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.260]
I enjoy sitting around, having a few meal with them.

[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:52.980]
Be pleased to meet them.

[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:53.160]
Right.

[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.260]
I don't know about honor.

[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.840]
I'm honored to meet them.

[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.500]
I can't think of any such person.

[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.740]
Do I get to touch them?

[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:01.100]
I be.

[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:01.440]
Wow.

[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.180]
Oh, okay.

[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:02.980]
Well, that's different to me.

[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:03.520]
Tom Brady.

[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.580]
I'd be honored to meet Tom.

[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.020]
He's a macho guy like me.

[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:13.060]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Live.

[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.820]
So negative, so sour, so full of hate.

[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:16.740]
Mean.

[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.500]
This is a mean place.

[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.360]
And this building, I think, is a perfect example of it.

[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.900]
With a disease, it's a mean, mean nasty building.

[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.400]
It's hateful and hostile.

[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:32.200]
People in banging each other when this building, all the stuff that goes on in here, just waiting for my way back.

[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.200]
That's an angry building with angry stories.

[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.120]
You can smell it in the hallway.

[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:36.580]
You smell it?

[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:37.620]
Oh, that's most vague.

[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:42.060]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.060]
I feel like I should have stayed home today.

[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.840]
Yesterday I had, you know, did okay.

[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:45.980]
Today.

[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:48.440]
Well, it's just the mood, didn't it?

[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:48.840]
You're a ailment.

[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:49.900]
What do you mean by this?

[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:50.360]
It's sour.

[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.580]
I'm not in a sour mode.

[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:51.980]
They are.

[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:52.400]
Okay.

[01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.940]
They don't want to play the game today.

[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:56.960]
Sam, loosen it.

[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:57.900]
Play howie.

[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:58.940]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.620]
Mr. Rogers, it's an honor to speak with you.

[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:02.920]
All right.

[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:04.360]
It sure is.

[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.580]
I got an aim for you and she's one of your favorites too.

[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.600]
Kelly Craig.

[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.340]
Kelly Craig.

[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:08.780]
All right.

[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:09.360]
Great lady.

[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:09.780]
Okay.

[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:10.680]
Tell her to loosen weight.

[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.160]
Thanks a lot.

[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:13.660]
Kelly Craig.

[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:14.680]
Haven't seen her in a long time.

[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:15.680]
That's because I don't want to see her.

[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:16.420]
Why not?

[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.080]
She's quadruples inside.

[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.060]
Ooh, yeah.

[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:19.740]
Why?

[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.960]
She used to look like horse and wells.

[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.240]
She had to look like five of them.

[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.880]
She had that baby and she beefed up and like most ladies do.

[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.200]
But she kept beefing up.

[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:29.480]
See most women, you know, after that they lose it back.

[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:30.880]
But not her.

[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:31.320]
She found herself.

[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.260]
You can barely see her head.

[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:33.540]
No, come on.

[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.360]
It's lost.

[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.600]
I'm telling you, it looks like the button on a plush couch, her head.

[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:41.360]
That's bad.

[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:42.740]
Is she fatter than like the Humper?

[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:43.540]
Yeah.

[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.020]
Yeah.

[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.120]
She is?

[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:46.980]
Oh, man.

[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.740]
I'm telling you, you can name.

[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:53.680]
Wow.

[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:54.340]
Seriously?

[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.560]
I can't even do it.

[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.260]
Like a turtle.

[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:58.820]
In other words, like she pulls her head out.

[01:23:59.180 --> 01:23:59.480]
That's bad.

[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.540]
We're going to be killing it.

[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:01.940]
Kelly, please, lose it on its Kelly.

[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:03.300]
Please, I'm begging you, we love you.

[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:05.460]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:06.900]
Quantum cap driver.

[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:07.400]
Where is he?

[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:11.260]
See?

[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.360]
What does that mean?

[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:13.880]
I don't know.

[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.640]
He's just in coherent.

[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:15.080]
Right.

[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:15.860]
Just an asshole.

[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:16.960]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:16.960]

[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:16.960]

[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:16.960]

[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:16.960]

[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.920]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.260]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:19.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.080]
I feel so privileged to speak to you.

[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:22.800]
Yeah.

[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:23.580]
It's all right.

[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:24.980]
Right at the end.

[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.440]
I give kudos to showtime.

[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.180]
Put in your diary.

[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:36.120]
Because yesterday they were given DC 9-11, the whole thing after 9-11 and the Bush administration.

[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:42.440]
The best part of the whole show was when I'm Candelita walking into the room.

[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.100]
Yeah.

[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.340]
It was so hilarious.

[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.540]
She was so ugly and skinny and dark.

[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.080]
Yeah.

[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.400]
Was she dark?

[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:51.220]
And another for the poll.

[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.280]
I don't know if you remember back the Kendall Toyota show.

[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.000]
Yes, I do.

[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:55.500]
I'm fortunate.

[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.260]
Rockdown the radio was the bomb.

[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.200]
I used to love that man.

[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:58.700]
Don Cox.

[01:24:59.220 --> 01:24:59.580]
Okay.

[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:00.560]
Thank you.

[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.200]
You got him, man.

[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:01.940]
Thank you.

[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:02.540]
Ostech, hey, you're me.

[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.080]
This Don Cox, Reston, please.

[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:04.960]
For a lot of dead people.

[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.580]
I thought he was going to say, Mark, what's his name, Jacobson?

[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.180]
No, he was not.

[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:09.800]
He would have been lying.

[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.160]
Why do you say that?

[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.440]
To be a prick.

[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.540]
I mean, somebody says something nice about Cox on a radio.

[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.060]
Right.

[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.320]
Who died very early this soon.

[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.660]
Who deserved to die?

[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:21.200]
Is that what you did?

[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.600]
No, who deserved to be on the poll?

[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:25.400]
George Rudry is just said that Don Cox deserved to die.

[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.120]
I think that is of all the things that you've ever said all these years.

[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:29.660]
Party.

[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:32.760]
Yeah.

[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.720]
I can't believe you said that.

[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.580]
One of the originals.

[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:35.480]
Just El Fernandez.

[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:36.680]
Oh, we loved her.

[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.620]
She was a fine, fine lady in more ways than one.

[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.080]
Didn't she play the violin?

[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.180]
Oh, that was just all Mackenzie.

[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:43.680]
She's El Fernandez.

[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:44.300]
I loved her.

[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.760]
Wasn't she on a show with who was on the show with Jimmy Cifalus?

[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.320]
On Channel 10 there for Wiley.

[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:49.920]
He had me on the show.

[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.620]
And back in the Wednesdays.

[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:53.680]
Jimmy Cifalus.

[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.080]
Bob, it's that she's got some stories.

[01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.420]
No, not just nothing.

[01:25:59.860 --> 01:25:59.980]
Jimmy.

[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:00.600]
Okay.

[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.400]
Oh, here's my friend Mark again.

[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.040]
The chronic factor.

[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:03.700]
Good factor.

[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:06.660]
But Mark, I hope you're not going to load me up with a thousand.

[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.200]
Widow of Dr. Atkins.

[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:08.960]
Oh, that.

[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.280]
Mark is always good.

[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.420]
You're the best factor ever, Mark.

[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.020]
Like I said, Mark with a B.

[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:19.580]
Did you see the piece on Mayor Bloomberg, who's a major asshole by the way, who's in the

[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.340]
Nicole's, he's like, he's going to say, I hate him.

[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.520]
They despise him.

[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.960]
The comments about Atkins.

[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.800]
You didn't see that clip?

[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:26.140]
No.

[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.140]
Oh, wow.

[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.680]
It was one of those photo ops where he knew they were shooting, but I guess he forgot.

[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.700]
Well, they didn't forget.

[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.680]
New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg thought his off-the-cuff dinner comments about the late

[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.700]
Dr. Robert Atkins were just between him and a few firefighting pals, but the cameras were

[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:47.060]
rolling and now he might be wishing he had his mouth full, like maybe a stake.

[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.020]
Between bites of pasta at a Brooklyn Firehouse dinner, Bloomberg dismissed to be ported details

[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:53.960]
of Atkins death.

[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.980]
I don't believe that Bolshmit that Atkins dropped it off sliding something on the sidewalk.

[01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.740]
Bloomberg said to the firefighters during dinner earlier this week.

[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:02.940]
They showed it.

[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.520]
They showed a clip.

[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.240]
It was, I can't even describe to you.

[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.300]
Atkins would also say she was beside herself with anger once she saw the footage.

[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.680]
I was very, very hurt and I was angry at consent at ABC News Good Morning America.

[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.560]
Atkins died last year at 72 from head injury sustained in the fall on an icy New York City sidewalk.

[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.760]
Atkins low carb diet, which stresses protein over pasta bread and fruit, has remained wildly

[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.220]
popular even after his death.

[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.900]
Veronica atkins said her husband's high protein diet had nothing to do with the fall that killed him.

[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.060]
His arteries were clear.

[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.360]
He died from severe trauma to the head she said.

[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:42.060]
During his firehouse dinner, the mayor also called the diet guru fat, which he was not,

[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.220]
and insulted the food act conservative.

[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:47.480]
A fundraiser he attended a few years ago at the doctor's house in the Hamptons.

[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.740]
Oh yeah, he said I was crap.

[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.360]
You couldn't even eat it.

[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.940]
It was just it was unbelievable.

[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:53.860]
What a guy.

[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:54.440]
Yeah.

[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.400]
It would be like if you were running for president, you know what I'm saying?

[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.120]
And you thought nobody was listening and you started screaming like,

[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:01.460]
like that.

[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.280]
And you thought nobody was rolling any footage.

[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.740]
And you just start losing it and doing, you know,

[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:09.980]
grotesque, unacceptable things that you thought nobody would ever see.

[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:15.280]
We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico.

[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:18.740]
We're going to California and Texas and New York.

[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.780]
We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.

[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.660]
And then we're going to Washington, DC to take back the White House.

[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:27.620]
Yeah.

[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:28.660]
Yeah.

[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:29.400]
Yeah.

[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:30.300]
Yeah.

[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:31.160]
Yeah.

[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:32.560]
One more.

[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:32.860]
Come on.

[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.200]
Yeah.

[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:34.240]
Thank you.

[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:42.180]
Mrs. Atkins said the mayor's comments took a by surprise since he had sent a beautiful note about her husband and the work he did after he died last year.

[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.260]
Phony, you have to tell sorry to me in the world she said.

[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.260]
How pathetic.

[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:52.100]
Just ripped him an ass about how the guy was all bullshit about how he invited him to his house.

[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:52.900]
The food was crap.

[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:53.480]
It was garbage.

[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.420]
You couldn't even eat it.

[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.100]
I'm sure.

[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:59.080]
I mean, I mean, who would want like steak and lobster stuff like that?

[01:28:59.160 --> 01:28:59.540]
Yeah.

[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.240]
Nasty.

[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.260]
Things like that.

[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.120]
Lobster dipped in butter.

[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:05.320]
Asshole.

[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.900]
Michael Bloomberg is a major, major asshole.

[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:08.540]
Absolutely.

[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.440]
He even liked it reelected by the way.

[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:12.940]
Mark it down.

[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:13.640]
No chance.

[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:14.140]
A market day.

[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:15.920]
Two chances none and less than none.

[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.000]
If they brought back fear relo laguardia.

[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.020]
Just if they just propped up his body.

[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:21.520]
I'm telling you.

[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.000]
If they brought back John Lindsay, he's needed to.

[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:25.840]
I'm sure he is.

[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.340]
I think he's dead.

[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.220]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.460]
Even Ed Crouch would be, I'm a pretty sure.

[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.060]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.700]
Yes, Neil.

[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:35.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.580]
Charlie Baxter.

[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.600]
We already got it.

[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:38.440]
You already got him.

[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:38.740]
Thanks.

[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.280]
Thank you.

[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.980]
Shall we put Charlie Baxter?

[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:41.200]
Yeah.

[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.220]
Cross out empty graves.

[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:43.120]
Put Charlie Baxter.

[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.720]
Hey Eric, how do I take stuff off of you?

[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:45.960]
Like I said.

[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.640]
Well, I put Charlie Baxter.

[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:48.100]
Yeah.

[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.000]
Well, you can't even both.

[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:51.540]
We'll take off empty graves.

[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:53.320]
We don't want to distort the pool.

[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.800]
It's so goddamn scientific and very, very important.

[01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:56.800]
It is.

[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:57.780]
It's important stuff.

[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.060]
How's that other one coming?

[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.580]
Let's wrap that sucker up.

[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.800]
And I realize it's a little bit too sports intensive for this audience.

[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.660]
But I'll say it again.

[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.700]
It's not really about sports.

[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.820]
It's about anything here.

[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:10.600]
It's about this place.

[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:16.260]
And the lack of motivation, the lack of excitement, the lack of intensity.

[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:17.580]
What do they care about?

[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:23.840]
Early bird dinners and when's the funeral and where's my pollen and the, you know, and who can I bitch out?

[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.380]
Who can I get angry at?

[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:26.800]
Who can I scream at?

[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:35.620]
Why do you think the world champion Florida Marlins has sold so few less than 5,000 season tickets?

[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:36.780]
A disgrace.

[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.360]
What are the words that the Dan LaBacher uses again in a column?

[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:49.100]
He said it's the pressing, unfathomable, inexplicable, damning, and probably without precedent in major American sports.

[01:30:49.400 --> 01:31:01.120]
To win the world championship and have fewer season tickets sold than the anxious and soon-to-be extinct Montreal Expos, the Buffalo Spiesens of the AAA, whatever it is.

[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:07.060]
Internationally, credible, shocking.

[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.160]
139 people say the fans here are mostly front-running phonies.

[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.880]
38.6%.

[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:16.100]
Like me, most people don't give a shmit about them. 103.

[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:16.700]
Don't care.

[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.300]
Also about 30%.

[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:19.280]
About 30, man.

[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.100]
South Florida's Bush League 49.

[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.400]
There are a few real sports fans here. 46.

[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.840]
They need a new state in 23.

[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.040]
I just want to say one of the things and then I'll drop that whole deal.

[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:28.800]
Because we're changing the pool.

[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.420]
About this whole sports business.

[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:32.840]
See, I tried to explain to Duffinclerance this morning.

[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:38.160]
Neither one of whom is going to ever win any, you know, brownie points for being a rocket scientist.

[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:44.500]
I tried to explain to them sports talk is neurocasting.

[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:52.680]
WFA in New York, which is the most successful sports station in America is driven by old, flutty-duty, I'mus.

[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:53.760]
What a comment.

[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:54.180]
Yeah.

[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:55.540]
He drives the station.

[01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:00.520]
His ratings, which aren't that great, but nevertheless, and his revenue drive WFA in.

[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:03.800]
He's the enabler, which allows them to do all their sports craft the rest of the day.

[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:04.440]
Here.

[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:06.340]
Here, it's me.

[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:08.120]
But setting that aside.

[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:14.520]
The fact of the matter is that if it was only the sports part of it, WRFX would have big numbers.

[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:15.220]
Do they?

[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:15.480]
No.

[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.940]
The fan down here, the WAFN, 1800 on your dial.

[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:19.940]
That one had a good number.

[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:20.180]
No.

[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:20.440]
No.

[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:28.100]
If you would, if you would take the same crap that they have on WRFX and replace the personalities on this station with that,

[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.200]
we would have any numbers either.

[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:29.580]
No.

[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.020]
See what I'm saying?

[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.320]
Oh, I see what you're saying.

[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:38.800]
I mean, when you got Jim Mandage and you got Hank Goldberg and you got Jim Rose, Jim Rose and Joe Kaplan.

[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.100]
It's the personalities stupid.

[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:44.920]
And they still don't get it.

[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.100]
And you want to know why?

[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:50.040]
Because the general manager is a jock-licking, boom, a juling idiot.

[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:50.600]
That's why.

[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.680]
Three minutes till noon at 5.60 QA.

[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.840]
And by the way, clearance you are to.

[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.300]
Five and the local.

[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.360]
This is five-sixies.

[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:58.620]
Three is all yours.

[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:00.640]
Two and.

[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.260]
Okay, it's the 12 to one hour.

[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:06.660]
Yeah, at least we're today.

[01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:19.520]
Well, we were out on our first date.

[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:23.640]
After eating at a Mexican cafe.

[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.960]
While we were driving is my car.

[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:32.060]
Let one go that almost blew us both away.

[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.480]
I asked her did you cut the cheese?

[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:42.100]
Then she turned around to look at these said girls don't part.

[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.820]
Girls don't part.

[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.760]
She kept telling me that girls don't part.

[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:09.020]
She kept telling me that girls don't part.

[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.700]
She kept telling me that girls don't part.

[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.740]
That's why.

[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:17.740]

[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:17.740]

[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:17.740]

[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:17.740]

[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:25.960]
I heard another deadly squirt, then I held my nose and covered it with my shirt.

[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:34.660]
I turned around to get her back, with just a matter of time before another attack.

[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:44.440]
So I asked if she was okay, that she looked at me, and also had the same one as her own phone part.

[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:51.900]
Girls don't fight, they need a girl don't fight, but I do.

[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:52.560]
Thank you.

[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:52.760]

[01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:04.880]
Girls don't fight, girls don't fight, but I do.

[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.280]
But I do.

[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:10.440]
But I do.

[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:15.080]
Wow, they just showed a great clip of Al Sharpton.

[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.540]
I wish I would have seen that debate last night.

[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:18.920]
Not really, I was happy you're being at the track, had a good night.

[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:23.000]
They show Al Sharpton, I'm telling you, talk circles about all these guys.

[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:24.060]
Sure, never mind.

[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:28.860]
There was Dr. Dean talking about how he's not perfect and about his rant and yaddy-yaddy-yaddy,

[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:33.620]
and how, you know, he wouldn't do it if he had to do it over again, but he has to tell it the way he sees it.

[01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:36.640]
So Al Sharpton said, Governor Dean, don't be so hard on yourself.

[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:42.240]
He said, as far as hooting and hollering, he said, if I would have spent the money, you didn't Iowa come in a distant third,

[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.740]
I would have been hooting and hollering too.

[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.560]
And Dean went, like that.

[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:47.900]
How would that go now?

[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:48.580]
You go, boy.

[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:51.360]
See, the price on the problem with Dean is no sense of humor at all.

[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:52.260]
Very uptight.

[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.240]
Ah, top 10 list last night was funny.

[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:54.760]
Eight.

[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.480]
Or concentrated, don't understand.

[01:35:58.820 --> 01:35:59.860]
All right, or concentrated.

[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.360]
Well, that's fine.

[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:04.220]
But it came out of desperation, say.

[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.320]
But I'm talking about just off the cuff.

[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.360]
I'm gonna say he doesn't have a sense of humor up to that screaming thing.

[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.180]
He has no hysterical sense of humor.

[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:13.360]
He's uptight, overly medicated.

[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.180]
Okay, let's get this pole off here and get on the other one.

[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:19.120]
Okay, Eric, I don't want to get on you because you've been doing a great job, but this is done.

[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:20.020]
It's noon.

[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.140]
It's 12.05.

[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:23.460]
383 votes on the first one.

[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.280]
I know, I know, we already read the result.

[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:26.780]
Let's get on with it.

[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:27.240]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:28.500]
I think it's your fault.

[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:29.320]
What are you done to him?

[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:31.640]
Oh, Chris ordinarily.

[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:33.820]
He knows that the other pole goes up and he can go eat.

[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:39.600]
He can go eat a whole bunch of sandwiches and pasta, steaks, ribs, chitlins.

[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.820]
I know what they eat, norlando chitlins.

[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:43.200]
Or something rhymes with that.

[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:44.420]
Come on, Eric, let's go.

[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:45.480]
Let's get the other pole out there.

[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:46.640]
Let's get on with it, okay?

[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:47.700]
God damn it.

[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.640]
This is a slow move in place.

[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.040]
This is me off.

[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:55.780]
Who is your all-time favorite South Florida TV personality, newsroom entertainment?

[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.060]
Somebody you actually like.

[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.800]
Oh my god, what a concept.

[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:00.440]
Ralph Renek.

[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:01.740]
John Hammbrick.

[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:03.320]
Skippers Chuck Zink.

[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.440]
Rick Sanchez.

[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:07.020]
And Bishop Wayne Chandler.

[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:07.900]
Dave Dixon.

[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.200]
Charlie Baxter, we change that, right?

[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:11.260]
All right, I'm gonna have them all.

[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:11.960]
Glenn Raker.

[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.600]
Jilda Unruh.

[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:14.120]
Is it Gilda?

[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:15.180]
I don't know.

[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:15.700]
Oh.

[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.460]
Kelly Craig.

[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:17.860]
Don Cox, who would I leave out?

[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.480]
It'll be up there.

[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.400]
How about Bob Weaver?

[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:22.800]
How about him?

[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:23.600]
Get him on there.

[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:24.020]
Okay.

[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.480]
Don't say anything about Bob Weaver.

[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:28.560]
I haven't seen Bob in a long time.

[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:29.040]
Good guy.

[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:32.120]
I don't know, because you're gonna say he's old and all puffed up.

[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:33.920]
Don't we all get that way sooner or later?

[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:34.380]
Yeah.

[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:35.380]
Maybe not puffed up.

[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.220]
Here we do.

[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:37.100]
You'll see.

[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:38.900]
WQA Am Hello.

[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:40.340]
Yeah, hi.

[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.160]
How about our Rick Sanchez partner, Sally, the one with the Coke bottle upper body?

[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:44.480]

[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:45.100]
He gives me a fit.

[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.240]
Excellent choice, Pally.

[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.480]
Okay, all right.

[01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:49.180]
Thank you.

[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.640]
Sally, he gives me a fit.

[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:52.040]
We might actually play that.

[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.100]
Do we still have that?

[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:54.820]
Oh yeah.

[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:55.700]
And we also have.

[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:56.600]
Get him on there.

[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:56.840]
Yeah.

[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.880]
Oh, she was the best Sally fits.

[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.480]
Remember the day I told you that I would do that she stopped me in a parking lot?

[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:05.900]
All right.

[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:08.740]
She didn't stop me, but I ran into her after the show.

[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:09.960]
Mm-hmm.

[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.240]
And I had never met her before.

[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.760]
And she knew who I was.

[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.920]
And she said, oh, you know that stuff you say about me on here?

[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.280]
And I said, she said, I don't like it.

[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:17.900]
Right.

[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:18.840]
She had a major.

[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.040]
I mean, she wasn't a hostile, at least not to my face.

[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.180]
But I don't like it.

[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:24.540]
I said, it's just a radio show.

[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:30.080]
She cried before one of our fellow producers over that issue.

[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:31.120]
Over what issue?

[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.840]
The issue with the Koch-Bad Leporant.

[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:38.660]
The things, the rumors that we didn't create and we didn't invent.

[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:40.260]
We just passed them along.

[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:40.660]
They just passed them along.

[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:40.840]

[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.060]
Those rumors, they weren't rumors.

[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.980]
I have people who made me, boys, man.

[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:48.900]
I said, you know, I said, you know, I never, I never, I never happened.

[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:49.640]
Yes, you did.

[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.100]
It's to find my existence down here and it's not true.

[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:55.880]
Excellent.

[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.700]
I think Eric is gone.

[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.180]
I think he just went back to sleep.

[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.360]
I don't think he's going to change the poll.

[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:01.840]
Is he relying on you to do that?

[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:03.620]
I don't have the ability to do that.

[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:04.640]
Maybe he was relying on me.

[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:06.580]
I'm telling him, but I thought he was here and that from you.

[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:07.780]
He probably can't hear us now.

[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:09.520]
Because I would do it if I could.

[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:12.460]
But I just don't have the ability to do it.

[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:14.980]
I take you out here right now and kick your goddamn teeth in.

[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:15.700]
I'm willing to do it.

[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.220]
Come on, Eric.

[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:17.040]
Let's go, baby.

[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:17.580]
Let's go.

[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.180]
Yes, then he sleeps in.

[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.080]
He sent me a message, though, to say that he was waiting for you to print it out.

[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:25.460]
But that was, I don't know how old that message was.

[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.120]
What do you mean by that?

[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:26.920]
Print it out.

[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.120]
The old one so that you could discuss it.

[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.320]
I just got through doing that.

[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.120]
We're done with that.

[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:33.660]
We're finished.

[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:34.780]
We're finished.

[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.900]
We're finished with the frickin' marlins, okay?

[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:38.560]
They're going to play in the peoria somewhere.

[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.060]
Nobody cares.

[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:43.060]
Such a whiner, Eric.

[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:43.860]
W.D.C.Y.M.

[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:44.080]
Hello.

[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:47.620]
What about Pam Giganti from Channel 6 in the morning?

[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:48.600]
That's the line choice, amigo.

[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:49.960]
I love her.

[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.020]
She used to be the weather girl on Channel 7.

[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:52.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:53.080]
Thank you.

[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:53.840]
Thank you.

[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:56.000]
I left out of the Jackie Johnson when I read the list.

[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:57.220]
And Pam Giganti.

[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:59.000]
She said it was a Salvador Giganti.

[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.540]
Who is the guy that was answered?

[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:01.640]
That's how the locals show them.

[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:03.400]
Is it where do they do that, Joe?

[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:04.260]
I don't know.

[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:07.520]
And that's Don Francisco, a Argentinian Jew.

[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.000]
They might do that, Joe, here you think.

[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:10.740]
Salvador Giganti.

[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:11.860]
I'm sorry, Chilean Jew.

[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:13.900]
They might.

[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:14.520]
I don't know.

[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:16.240]
Is he the one that like dances on the grapes?

[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:17.840]
That's the one when they make the wine.

[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.420]
He coaches the grapes.

[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.140]
No, I'm sorry.

[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.320]
It's Chilean fruit.

[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:23.700]
Is he one of those two?

[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:24.820]
He's a Chilean fruit.

[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.440]
That's what I heard.

[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:26.160]
Don Francisco.

[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:26.900]
Oh, no.

[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:28.620]
See, now you're going to pick on him.

[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:30.180]
We hope we got the senior cruise thing.

[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:31.880]
Oh, Jesus.

[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:32.880]
We're done.

[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:33.240]
Goodbye.

[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.100]
We're picking on Don Francisco.

[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.160]
He happens to be a very nice guy.

[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:37.780]
Well, there you go.

[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:38.220]
And a match.

[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.000]
Good job.

[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:43.520]
Well, he's good.

[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:44.780]
No, it's a good show.

[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:45.980]
When he has some good flesh on there.

[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.460]
I've seen some of the most of the stunts.

[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.800]
I know that I watch it very often.

[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.920]
Oh, here's a NEY-E.

[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:52.560]
Howdy pronounced that.

[01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:53.280]
Ney-E.

[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:53.880]
Ney-E.

[01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:55.600]
Ney-E says, first time factor.

[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.960]
Why is Dean speech in Iowa?

[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.360]
And he worse than Bush and Cheney.

[01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.840]
Coloring reporter in a dress hole.

[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:03.720]
It's not the only difference being that the media let him off the hook on it.

[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:04.160]
Remember that?

[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:04.520]
Yes.

[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.820]
The New York Times reporter on the hook.

[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:05.920]

[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:06.180]
Which one?

[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:10.940]
And he didn't know that the camera was rolling and the audio was going to.

[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:12.100]
And he called him a major asshole.

[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.340]
There's that asshole or so and so from the time.

[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.660]
Yeah, guys, that's a major asshole.

[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:18.260]
Because the media, you know, that's the way they do it.

[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:19.740]
Because they bought the media first.

[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:20.760]
They own the media.

[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:21.400]
Don't you get it?

[01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:24.420]
Five, six, seven.

[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.260]
Now here's a poll suggest about road rage.

[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.820]
Who should get ticketed on our highways?

[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:28.700]
Let's go and I'll save that.

[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:30.120]
Thank you, Brian.

[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:31.160]
Excellent choice.

[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:32.920]
Okay, I'm looking at what we got to do.

[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:33.400]
Pull up.

[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:34.100]
Nice going, Eric.

[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:37.560]
Oh, Eric was just a diverge of losing the love of his life.

[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.920]
It's a labor of love to George.

[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:41.220]
Oh.

[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.540]
Okay, who are we voting for?

[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:44.400]
You want Skipper Chuck?

[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:45.600]
I want Skipper Chuck.

[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:46.580]
Well, you can vote in their care.

[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:47.080]
No.

[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:47.720]
Not if you do.

[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:48.940]
Oh, so go ahead.

[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.280]
No, I'll vote for Skipper.

[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.720]
No, I don't want to vote for Skipper Chuck.

[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:52.860]
I'll vote for somebody.

[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.840]
Plenty of people vote for Good ol' Skipper.

[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.260]
Skipper the day that Rick, a Skipper Chuck.

[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.080]
What was that with Rick and Sons?

[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:58.760]
They were doing that remote?

[01:41:59.280 --> 01:41:59.540]
No.

[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:00.360]
Yeah, you do.

[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.000]
I don't.

[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:01.860]
And I was in there.

[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:02.480]
I don't know.

[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.740]
I just make all kinds of fun of him.

[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:04.540]
And he just, I don't know.

[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:05.640]
He's okay.

[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:06.660]
They like him a lot.

[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.180]
I like him a lot.

[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.600]
Oh, I was making fun of his cemetery-village spots.

[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:12.380]
Oh, well, yeah.

[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:14.320]
And the fact that he got to be an old-futty duddy,

[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:15.620]
and as he gets older, he got to do something.

[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:17.860]
I mean, pretty soon I'm going to be doing nursing home spots here.

[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.840]
People like that 24-hour nursing care.

[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.020]
I got that 24-hour nursing care.

[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:22.100]
We're going to trade it out in Toronto.

[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:25.220]
I never told you that story about one of the tellers

[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:26.760]
at the track the other night, not last night,

[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:27.840]
but last night, whatever it's Saturday.

[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:28.660]
I'm leaving.

[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:31.400]
He says, he looks at me like he's astonished

[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:32.220]
that I'm walking around.

[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:35.020]
He says, oh, Genie, I'm glad to see your feeling better.

[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:37.800]
That was before I had my cold icy.

[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.300]
And I wonder, what is he talking about?

[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.720]
I was shaking my head as I walked out of there.

[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.860]
And I realized he must have been the one who had missed Fudge.

[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.280]
About my 24-hour nursing care in Toronto.

[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:48.240]
Yeah.

[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:51.280]
You know what Sally would say to my Fudge, OK?

[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.540]
And I think he beat her into the punch.

[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:59.740]
We're sports radio 516, QAM.

[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.080]
Stop it.

[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:10.040]
I'm a clock. It's time for the news now, Canada.

[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:12.380]
We're one and you wear the anchor sits.

[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:13.080]
Oh!

[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:14.980]
Sally gets his fence.

[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.300]
Very.

[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.380]
She bombs her head and not just her eyebrows,

[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:22.360]
gives us all the news, just to pieces and fence.

[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:24.780]
Sally is a fence.

[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.300]
Everyone knows Sally's running this ship.

[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:35.000]
Trying to compete with any bishops.

[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.500]
So comedic, so entertaining, relevant,

[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.800]
with part-taters, brings by wins.

[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.300]
Sally is a fence.

[01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:49.300]
Everyone does everything that she says.

[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:54.500]
Cracks her with it up, jumps Ricky Sanchez.

[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:55.760]
Oh!

[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.340]
So in style, some mistakenly did everything she wants me.

[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:01.420]
Don't she guess?

[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.760]
Sally gets his fence.

[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:06.300]
Sally gets his fence.

[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:08.700]
Sally gets his fence.

[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:11.700]
How come we don't ever play that?

[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:12.380]
I love that.

[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:14.040]
Because she's out of sight out of mind.

[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:15.040]
No, she's still today.

[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:16.360]
People know Sally fits.

[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.580]
They know where Sally sits and where Sally...

[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:20.060]
Shman.

[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.600]
Facing it here at Wayne Ferris, somebody else said that.

[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:24.960]
He was here at a long time.

[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:25.920]
We put him on there.

[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:26.420]
We did.

[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:27.000]
Sure.

[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:27.980]
Come on.

[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:29.000]
Richard Whitcomb.

[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:29.660]
Who?

[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.320]
The last one to give editorials on Channel 7, I believe.

[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:33.320]
Richard Whitcomb.

[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:34.760]
Was he on 7?

[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:35.460]
I think so.

[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.080]
Who else would have put him on?

[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:39.240]
Richard Whitcomb.

[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:40.000]
Somebody liked him.

[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.400]
I can't believe it.

[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:44.040]
Who has been at the old singer, Richard...

[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:45.960]
That Irish singer?

[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:48.280]
Roger Whitaker?

[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:49.180]
Very good.

[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:49.680]
See?

[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:51.700]
Richard, Roger Whitaker.

[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.140]
You got a legal...

[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:53.340]
Right.

[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:55.520]
That's who Richard Whitcomb reminded me.

[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.000]
So Skipper Chuck isn't doing all that great.

[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:00.020]
I hate to break the news to George.

[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:00.940]
Wait till I get home.

[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:01.640]
And you want to know why?

[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:02.740]
Because he eats the tropical acres.

[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:09.720]
I mean, just because you get old doesn't mean you have to...

[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.320]
Doesn't mean you have to do Paladin spots.

[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:12.360]
I like Chuck's thing.

[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:13.020]
He's a good guy.

[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.180]
Who's putting on here?

[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:14.820]
Richard Whitcomb.

[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.080]
Richard Whitcomb, W-H-I-T-C-O-M-B, Whitcomb.

[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.620]
Jackie Johnson is winning.

[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.300]
Old Donkey Puss, he's got six.

[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.360]
It's because we got a lot of horny guys out there.

[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:24.560]
It's interesting.

[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.560]
If you saw her without makeup, up close, you'd puke your guts out.

[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.860]
I'm telling you right now.

[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:30.400]
Okay.

[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:31.800]
You wouldn't touch her with Miguel's hand.

[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:33.860]
Ralph, right neck, five.

[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:34.600]
You're right about that.

[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:35.540]
Touch her with mine.

[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:37.360]
How about your hand?

[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:39.700]
Jackie Johnson, six.

[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:40.880]
Ralph, right neck, five.

[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:42.020]
Kelly Craig, five.

[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:42.620]
Love you, Kelly.

[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.800]
Lucie Mway, please.

[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:44.220]
Please.

[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:46.440]
John Hamburg, three.

[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:48.040]
Skipper, Chuck's, ink, three.

[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:51.020]
Go out and meet him at the top.

[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:51.380]
You go, Chuck.

[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:53.740]
Actually, it was the corny spots he did for them.

[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.360]
Every other was a line in there.

[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:56.580]
Oh, it was unbelievable.

[01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:58.720]
Where they showed all those acne.

[01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.680]
We're warning his city.

[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:00.600]
That's not even when they were swimming.

[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.380]
And they were dying.

[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.420]
And they were punching each other in the face and falling down in the hidden her head.

[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:05.860]
That's got nothing to do with his greatness.

[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.040]
Five way or three.

[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:08.940]
Love you, Bob.

[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:10.860]
And Bishop, two Glenn Winkertoo.

[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.160]
Anybody tell us if he's a better liar?

[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:13.780]
I don't know.

[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:15.300]
Changing again now.

[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.480]
It's what we just built in this.

[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:18.760]
It would have been on a long time ago.

[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.400]
But Eric's busy eating lunches several of them.

[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.040]
You know, Eric is like, um, he's got peaks and valleys, you know.

[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:25.800]
Ups and downs.

[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:27.240]
He gets on your good.

[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:28.180]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:31.980]
Oh, just picturing his peaks and valleys.

[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:33.160]
Oh, it's a horrible thought.

[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:34.140]
The ups and downs.

[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:36.420]
Let's see.

[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.320]
Here's the another fact.

[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:40.100]
It says I hope the second facts in one day isn't a chronic course not.

[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.720]
But I just saw this.

[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.300]
Everybody's favorite self-hating closet.

[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.420]
Uh, I can't say that fact.

[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:49.700]
Matt Raj is quoted as using a phrase that might sound familiar to long time lessons of your show.

[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:53.480]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.600]
I love this.

[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.500]
I saw this already.

[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:57.420]
I'm glad that they reminded me about Moby.

[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.440]
This is from the New York Daily News.

[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:04.760]
Activist rocker Moby is leading a G-Hot against cyber-gossip Matt Drogh that self-hating

[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.820]
a faggot, blaming him for inciting far-right wingers who sent abusive and racist emails

[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:10.340]
to comedian Margaret Cho.

[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.880]
Was that before after the Cho?

[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:18.580]
On his website and in private messages to his friends, Moby has been claiming that Drogh

[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:23.500]
took out of context, Cho's stream of anti-bropublican invective intended his comedy stick during

[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:26.400]
last week's move on.orgs award at the Hammerstein Ballroom.

[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.280]
I was outraged, Moby told me.

[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:33.100]
Everyone knows that Margaret's comedy is very irreverent and Lenny Bruce style confrontational

[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:36.940]
and Matt Drogh took it out of context and exposed her to some really irresponsible and

[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:38.440]
vile reactions.

[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:40.540]
That subsurried Drogh responded.

[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:45.320]
He pointed out that post on Drogh report.com had clearly identified Cho as a comedian and

[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:49.040]
set the scene for a profanited Laster Marse which he published at length under the headline

[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.880]
Raw Rage at Bush during move on.org awards.

[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:56.440]
A couple of days after posting the excerpts, Drogh published Cho's complete routine from

[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:56.840]
the event.

[01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.800]
There must be more of this I would hope.

[01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:02.080]
It sure is taking a long time coming over here because where is the phrase?

[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:02.700]
You see it yet?

[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:03.280]
No.

[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:07.360]
Oh no, what is this that he just wrote out a thing to read?

[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:09.520]
Oh my god, what is your story, man?

[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:10.960]
He's a busy man.

[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:13.580]
Since Doreen left, you aren't worth a crap.

[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:14.460]
Oh here it is.

[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.080]
Among her saltier observations during the liberal group's celebs studied Gale under honor

[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.120]
political ads detecting President Bush, despite all of this stupid Bush myth that the

[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:26.220]
Republican National Committee or whatever the F they call him, that they were saying that

[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:26.640]
they're angry.

[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:28.420]
I don't want to read this whole thing.

[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.480]
It says they're like effing looking for Hitler in a haystack.

[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:34.540]
George Bush is not a Hitler.

[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:36.320]
He would be if he applied himself.

[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:41.620]
After Drogh's account was linked by the right-leaning free republic.com, oh what a surprise that is.

[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:46.220]
Cho received dozens of ugly emails, most of them unprintable in a family newspaper.

[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:51.340]
Moby told me the only good thing to come in this is that the extreme right has shown

[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:51.920]
their true colors.

[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:55.560]
Bush is masquerading as a compassionate conservative, but now they've exposed their extremely

[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.920]
right wing misogynistic racist agenda.

[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.720]
Drug shot back, these emails are mild compared to what I receive on a daily basis.

[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:05.020]
This is the nature of the internet, Moby and his friends just have to butcher up.

[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:07.480]
Oh you're about to talk about butch and up, that's what he was getting to.

[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:08.400]
Butch up, bitch.

[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:09.920]
Silly as bitch.

[01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:13.020]
Self-hating, closet queen, asshole.

[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:17.340]
Anyway, join George tomorrow, loving to want to build side those boulevard to say this.

[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.500]
How much a guy I'm going to be there?

[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:19.080]
See.

[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:20.300]
That's how much a guy.

[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:22.960]
He'll be playing music from WCMQFAMA.

[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.920]
Right, scene accused music.

[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:27.540]
Scene accused.

[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:28.080]

[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:29.780]
Scene picked seed out of cruise.

[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:30.240]
She's dead.

[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.640]
Stick her ass in a back of the ship.

[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:34.620]
Hollass.

[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:42.740]
Get her out.

[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:43.660]
Take her out.

[01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:44.500]
Turn her ass out.

[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:45.340]
See, she's set it right there.

[01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:45.800]
She's a man.

[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:46.980]
Well, we know that.

[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:48.100]
She's got a big one, man.

[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.180]
Drag cany.

[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:52.040]
Join George tomorrow, guarantee you she didn't need to go see Alice.

[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:57.420]
11-1 at Bill Saddle's boulevard to sayings on Northwest 36 reaches West to 27th of the

[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:57.880]
week in Miami.

[01:49:58.400 --> 01:49:58.920]
27th of the avenue.

[01:49:59.020 --> 01:49:59.380]
What does that say?

[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:00.040]
I don't know.

[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.060]
See, I'm doing anything again, like those spots.

[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:07.280]
Stop by to win prizes and enjoy free food from Atlantic City subs where our good friend

[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:09.520]
Ira makes the difference and Scott's in the background now.

[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.740]
He's on deep background.

[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:11.860]
Stay there, Scott.

[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.640]
How come there are so many people named Scott who are like trouble?

[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:16.400]
One of those things.

[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:16.920]
Is it?

[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:21.520]
Look for the QM van tonight from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Dural ale house.

[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:26.080]
Stop by for President Abeira specials and win some free crap from a gal.

[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:28.020]
Well, I'm sure he's going to be there.

[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:29.300]
If this free beer, he'll be there.

[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:30.660]
I said, free loader.

[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:31.240]
Free loading speak.

[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:36.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT and T and Verizon wireless.

[01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:37.800]
Jackie Johnson is pulling away.

[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:38.660]
Donkey Puss.

[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.340]
See, I'm not going to suck up and apologize for that comment.

[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:44.000]
And don't tell me I don't know a hot looking woman when I see one.

[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:44.280]
Okay.

[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.220]
So you know who's hot?

[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:46.560]
Who's that?

[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:47.000]
Sheridan.

[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:47.880]
Okay.

[01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.580]
Oh, by the way, that next spot you have to read it.

[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:50.240]
That's where we don't have.

[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.060]
I know that.

[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.180]
I got the copy sitting right here.

[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:54.820]
Who's hot?

[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:57.200]
Oh, you just make a.

[01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:59.160]
Yeah, I'm saying you know who's hot with your hot.

[01:50:59.320 --> 01:50:59.860]
No, no, no, no.

[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:04.940]
You listen to this idea that fags don't know a beautiful woman when they see one kind of asshole that crap is that.

[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:09.380]
Just because fags at least have a little more objectivity, at least when women are concerned.

[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:09.940]
But they don't hit it.

[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.060]
And are oogling over everything with a screw down.

[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:12.680]
Mm-hmm.

[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:15.240]
Just like when mad dog was oogling over that bitch.

[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:16.900]
That's bad example.

[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:17.480]
What the hell?

[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:18.800]
I can't even think of her name anymore.

[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:20.500]
She manages bad eyesight, great of unsuspect.

[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:21.420]
Right, great of unsuspect.

[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:22.660]
Suspect, proof your credibility.

[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:23.120]
God.

[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:24.980]
Holy crap.

[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:29.160]
Just because he took too many hits to the head.

[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:30.560]
You wouldn't touch her with Michael.

[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.220]
What's his name's hand?

[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:33.360]
No.

[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:34.960]
The one that came off in a car.

[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:36.480]
You wouldn't take her with Steve Keynes hand.

[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.720]
No, I'm telling you right now.

[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:39.800]
You take one look at her and go.

[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:40.500]
No.

[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:41.260]
Yeah.

[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:42.280]
I'll join a monastery.

[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:44.740]
I would call her a doggy place, but you know how much I love dogs.

[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.540]
That'd be a bad insult.

[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:45.880]
Right.

[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:46.980]
Right, right, I'm on Sustorin.

[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.340]
Because I can never win a worst team was honor.

[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.600]
Air every morning, Channel 7.

[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:51.940]
Oh, Jackie Johnson.

[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:54.780]
It would be de-fo and Joe Littlebogg.

[01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:55.680]
They're just oogling enough.

[01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:58.000]
You know, you guys can do better than that.

[01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.580]
Don't sell yourself short, even if you are.

[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:00.380]
Just because you're limping.

[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:03.160]
I think all the guys with limpingness there, there was a little Jackie Johnson.

[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:04.260]
Because they can't get...

[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:04.980]
You know what it reminds me of?

[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:06.020]
In Magnolia.

[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:07.200]
Yeah.

[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:08.460]
Philip, what's his name again?

[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:09.220]
The actor I love him.

[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:10.440]
See more Thomas.

[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:10.980]
Come on, see more Thomas.

[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:12.080]
Joe in the shorts.

[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:14.320]
And the character that he's playing.

[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:16.460]
And he's making all these have seen phone calls.

[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:18.280]
And he wants to do it, but he can't do it.

[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:18.620]
Right.

[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.340]
He can't get it up.

[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:20.620]
He's brave on the phone.

[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:21.020]
Right.

[01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:22.820]
Like our callers.

[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:23.700]
Very brave on the phone.

[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:24.600]
No, tough on the phone.

[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:24.840]
Right.

[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:25.060]

[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:25.880]
Exactly.

[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.140]
But off the phone.

[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:28.460]
No.

[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.720]
This is a little bit pussy.

[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.260]
One of my favorite scenes is when it goes in to the Fat Brods apartment.

[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:35.120]
Jiquita Banana.

[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.740]
And they lie down in the bed and get under covers and face toward the wall.

[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:41.380]
Opposite.

[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:42.180]
Yeah.

[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:44.440]
That's what his character is all about.

[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:44.740]
Uh huh.

[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.540]
I can't imagine how you don't like that movie a lot more.

[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:50.860]
If they did end it.

[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.020]
No, I don't want to hear that.

[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:52.900]
That's Asuna.

[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:53.200]
Sorry.

[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:53.960]
It's Asuna.

[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:58.860]
If I don't recommend five movies right now, Magnolia would be at the top of the list.

[01:52:59.240 --> 01:52:59.800]
It's great.

[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:00.580]
Okay.

[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:01.900]
The acting is fabulous.

[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:02.240]
Sure.

[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:02.740]
Nope.

[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:03.440]
No argument there.

[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.240]
And it's just and it's long.

[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:06.740]
But there are things.

[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:09.140]
There are things in there that you will just don't expect.

[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:10.280]
I mean, just off the wall.

[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:10.460]
Sure.

[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:10.940]
It's great.

[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:12.460]
Even if Tom Cruise is good in there.

[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:15.080]
That whole storyline with Tom and.

[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:15.660]
It's.

[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.760]
All of the storylines.

[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:18.140]
Right.

[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:18.660]
All of them.

[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:20.460]
They should have ended all of them.

[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:23.700]
Wait for the sequel.

[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.500]
All right.

[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:27.560]
26 past noon at 560 WQM.

[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.000]
Georgia's taste in movies is.

[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:29.120]
Yeah.

[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:29.560]
Suspect.

[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:29.600]
Okay.

[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:29.600]

[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:29.600]

[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:29.600]

[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:29.600]

[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:29.600]

[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:29.600]

[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:31.200]
He did like record him though.

[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:32.140]
A lot.

[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:34.160]
And the girl did not, cuz he didn't understand it.

[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:34.660]
See you could.

[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:35.580]
You should have explained it to him.

[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.880]
Maybe you could have watched it with rush.

[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:38.800]
It was about.

[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:40.120]
Pill poppers.

[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:41.440]
And others.

[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:42.720]
And others of the drug.

[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:43.660]
Where the people.

[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:44.040]
Poppers.

[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.320]
Shooters and poppers.

[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:47.340]
Let's get some poppers.

[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:47.640]
Okay.

[01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:49.460]
And it's this some rush.

[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:50.880]

It's Friday, you bastards. Sometimes if you have a problem, it helps to talk to people who

[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:42.180]
have overcome the same problem. I'm buying the salary and I'm still interested in J-Lo and

[01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:49.330]
that's why there's Benefer Anonymous, a support group for those tormented souls crippled by

[01:55:49.330 --> 01:55:53.850]
their addiction to the celebrity couple through rest of the world has finally stopped caring about.

[01:55:53.930 --> 01:56:01.050]
Every day I wake up wondering are they broken up? Is the wedding on or on? What is the answer?

[01:56:01.410 --> 01:56:03.990]
Does anyone know the answer to Sally's question?

[01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:07.810]
Yeah, I do. It. Who gives a crap?

[01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:13.290]
At Benefer Anonymous, we know you're bombarded with temptation from media outlets.

[01:56:13.690 --> 01:56:16.130]
Help that to fuel your unhealthy obsession.

[01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:23.470]
Today I made a breakthrough. I learned that there's a war in a rack and a prolonged economic slump.

[01:56:23.630 --> 01:56:27.770]
Very good, Sally. I'm not sure how these things will affect Jennifer and Ben.

[01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:30.390]
Intervention! Intervention guys, get over here!

so desperately need. All Benefer Anonymous meetings are held in quiet private locations with no

[01:56:40.630 --> 01:56:44.150]
one else around in movie theaters that are still showing J-Lo. Forget about them.

[01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:47.950]
12.32 at 5.60 W.M. Ignisel, nice cup of tea here, herb tea.

[01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:57.590]
Boys, that good. Now what is it about tea that makes you cough?

[01:56:58.470 --> 01:57:00.210]
Makes you cough? It just did.

[01:57:00.710 --> 01:57:04.910]
Who's your all-time favorite stop Florida TV personality? News, entertainment, whatever the hell

[01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:11.970]
they did. Jackie Johnson 15. She is simpillating. That's sad. Makes me want to cry.

[01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:15.910]
I want to think of all the people that have worked their ass off,

[01:57:16.610 --> 01:57:18.730]
ass being the operative word which he doesn't have one.

[01:57:19.930 --> 01:57:23.250]
And really, you know, really done something worth talking about on there other than just show it

[01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:27.790]
standing there, you know. She's like the Vanna White to self-photo TV with bigger fake boobs.

[01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:31.410]
Skipper Chucks saying 12. Your buddy Skipper Chucks move it up.

[01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:35.630]
Don't eat a tropical acres anymore Skipper Chuck the life at you.

[01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:41.350]
He likes it because when he goes in there, everybody have the pollen and fizzing waiting for him on the table.

[01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:45.730]
Did you ever eat a tropical acres? We had a young don't party.

[01:57:45.970 --> 01:57:51.930]
Yeah. Who's we? We the station. I would be. We here. Here? Here? Oh no.

[01:57:52.330 --> 01:57:56.610]
I had tropical acres? I'm sure. Oh my god. I think it was. Yeah.

[01:57:56.910 --> 01:57:58.950]
Pretty sure. Too bad Moe wasn't here then. He'd have fit right now.

[01:57:59.950 --> 01:58:05.510]
Skipper Chuck 12. Ralph Redneck 9. Bob, we were nine. Glad to see Bob doing well. We love you, Bob.

[01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:11.170]
We all get old, including me. Kelly Craig 8. We all get fat. Come on, Kelly, please.

[01:58:12.330 --> 01:58:16.370]
Could we like have Kelly like, you know, march around the newsroom or something while she's on here?

[01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:19.770]
I can't. So I'm so depressed now that you said that.

[01:58:20.590 --> 01:58:24.290]
You ever see a plush? What about my good friend up there in Buffalo who I can't think of right now?

[01:58:24.450 --> 01:58:28.190]
Who's Maria Genero? What about her? I don't know. Do you want to put her on there? Yeah.

[01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:29.770]
Okay. She's great.

[01:58:31.570 --> 01:58:35.110]
And I'll tell you one thing, Jacelle Fernandez a lot better looking at Jackie's juzzle ever be.

[01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:40.030]
I'm not even close. You wouldn't agree with that? I even try to remember what Jacelle looks like.

[01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:45.170]
Oh, you kidding me. Looked like, come on. I can't picture her. All I got to do is see some push on here in a morning and

Where we are? Parked to Roma. Parked to Roma. Oh, she's legendary now that bitch.

[01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:06.990]
And like I always tell Ted David every time he calls. Even at public said ever she'd bags the size of the

[01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:10.570]
one that's under that bitch's eyes. Who would put on here? Parked to Roma. You're putting on

[01:59:10.570 --> 01:59:17.070]

[02:00:29.450 --> 02:00:31.730]
I know all of them now. I know every goddamn voice.

[02:00:33.210 --> 02:00:37.230]
The cab driver might, so maybe that's who he is. Maybe he's a cab driver that guy. Maybe that is.

[02:00:38.210 --> 02:00:42.870]
Maybe that's what that meant. I would love. I would just love to have him in that chair that you're sitting

[02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:48.050]
right up tied with his hands, you know, rope just in the building. Just take them. Take a two by four

[02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:24.070]
You're waiting for what? Nothing. Okay. We got one for the list. Yeah. I can't believe you forgot it.

[02:01:24.370 --> 02:01:29.250]
Go ahead. And then I have a comment for you. Please go ahead. Don't give us so much foreplay. Let's go.

[02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:35.230]
But you like a good session of herbal intercourse? No. All right. I haven't had one yet. Not on this time. Go ahead.

[02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:40.430]
Okay. How about Big Funky Wilson? Big Wilson's good. Put him on a list? Sure. Okay.

[02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:46.430]
And I did some sampling yesterday when I was out driving around because you had some complaints. About what?

[02:01:47.770 --> 02:01:52.650]

[02:02:26.670 --> 02:02:32.290]
If you thought that what they were trying to do to the old 103.5 after buddy, but back since it could over with.

[02:02:32.290 --> 02:02:37.790]
It's a mom. This is what I was close to it. Really? How come they got such a big number in there?

[02:02:38.410 --> 02:02:44.930]
Well, because there's some people that are still desperately trying to hang on to the disco. I see. Sounds like a bunch of wired diaries to me.

[02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:54.090]
Well, I would argue with that, but I looked on my radio and I've got one of those radios that has the the kind of programming that you can expect on a particular frequency.

[02:02:54.290 --> 02:03:02.910]
Yes. All of them do it like 99 jam says 99 jam. Y 100 says Y 100 dash seven. This one says classic.

[02:03:04.970 --> 02:03:13.070]
Yeah. Classic. I'm music. Classic. I'm music. And you know who our good friend is working over there as a production director. And of course, you know what you punch up five 60? It says sports.

[02:03:13.570 --> 02:03:24.350]
The music director are good friend on Q. I. M. It says because it's a M right. Friday clues. Oh my god. It quite a storm.

[02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:35.990]

[02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:44.870]
Who else the boomer, George? This guy. He's one of the Larry King one you got tape. Oh, the boomer. How are you doing, boomer? Yeah, right. You got a great memory.

[02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:52.730]
You still. I forgot what it was like. Well, listen, thanks for the good news, Boomer. Okay. And when are you going back to T.O.

[02:03:52.730 --> 02:03:59.770]
As soon as possible. It's a great place. I spent 30 summers up there. You can't beat it. Well, you listen to when you're up there. You listen to a charm.

[02:03:59.910 --> 02:04:12.670]
I'm you listen to. I've never turned on the radio once. Really. Not even CDL P for good talk. I hate radio. Well, so do I. Listen to. I listen to Mojo. Hey, Bill Waters. Have a great day.

[02:04:12.670 --> 02:04:20.530]
I'm Boomer. See, I was Boomer. I was not the boomer. Long Boomer. It was Joe Namaz. Joe's got a drinking problem.

[02:04:21.070 --> 02:04:27.330]
What a surprise. He's all wrinkled up like a prune failure. I want to give you a big kiss. I would play that drop in,

but we don't have it here. Damn it. It's on the disc. I don't I don't want to do that. I don't want to go through that effort.

[02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:39.330]
See, up in my DCS, I got all good stuff in there, including stuff. It might be even be in there, including stuff you'll never dream of.

[02:04:39.330 --> 02:04:48.450]
Might be in there under what? I don't know Joe Namaz or something under Joe Joe Joe and Joe and Bo show. There's Joe Bowen speaking to Toronto.

[02:04:49.290 --> 02:04:53.890]
How about Neymaz? I know the audience doesn't want to hear this. It's not interesting. Although there is this.

[02:04:54.750 --> 02:05:00.770]
Joe has been a tough season. Yeah, that's what is it being doing now in a team struggling?

[02:05:02.050 --> 02:05:08.610]
I want to kiss you. I couldn't care less about the team struggling. I want to kiss you.

[02:05:18.130 --> 02:05:23.950]
Excellent. He's a drunk. He's an idiot. He's a jock. Put them all together. What do you got?

[02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:34.570]
I can love to watch boobs and butts and biking.

[02:05:35.110 --> 02:05:37.850]
Put the threat of a rain shower and danger your life.

[02:05:37.890 --> 02:05:43.510]
Whiteboard Waterdale channels in you. Slick roads and wet pans could be a formula for disaster.

[02:05:44.110 --> 02:05:48.510]
Kristi Kruger has one of her eyes on how you can see each other from the gentle rain.

[02:05:48.890 --> 02:05:53.410]
And speaking of rain, sitting in Hordano, channel 12 weatherman John Matthews.

[02:05:53.430 --> 02:06:00.250]

[02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:08.350]
When another day of sunshine comes your way.

[02:06:08.770 --> 02:06:16.330]

It's a tough 46 if Q.A.M.

[02:06:27.970 --> 02:06:32.230]
You know, we haven't nobody's even mentioned me and it's going to hurt his jug and ego.

[02:06:32.730 --> 02:06:34.850]
I want to do I give you the real thing here, Neil.

[02:06:35.590 --> 02:06:36.550]
Brian not crossed.

[02:06:37.570 --> 02:06:39.350]
Yeah, isn't he from Wakecross, Georgia?

[02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:41.190]
I want to put him on there.

[02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:44.470]
Put Brian North Cross on. Otherwise, he'll be pissed off. He'll cut you off.

[02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:47.330]

He's perfect for Atlanta.

[02:06:55.630 --> 02:06:57.210]
He's real Yahoo or Tampa.

[02:06:58.690 --> 02:07:01.670]
Now, here's one Marty and Miami says and I have no idea what this is.

[02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:03.650]
To a South Florida recreational fisherman.

[02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:06.070]
George Pavillanimo.

Six-time champion of Dolphin, Wahoo and Kingfish is at Wahoo or Yahoo.

[02:07:14.370 --> 02:07:15.170]
And Kingfish.

[02:07:15.490 --> 02:07:17.190]
He's also got three instructional videos.

[02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:18.230]
We're not put them on there.

[02:07:19.090 --> 02:07:20.290]
Do you have any idea who that is?

[02:07:20.650 --> 02:07:21.450]
No, please.

[02:07:21.670 --> 02:07:23.790]
I mean, if we put salty salt, but he was on in Tampa.

[02:07:24.230 --> 02:07:25.210]
You remember salty salt?

[02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.850]
Flajman?

[02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:27.870]
Just from you mentioning.

[02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:29.210]
Yeah, salty salt.

[02:07:29.490 --> 02:07:31.210]
He's putting somebody besides Brian North Cross on there.

[02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.850]
Chuck Daudle.

[02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:35.710]
D-O-W-D-L-E.

[02:07:36.150 --> 02:07:36.510]

[02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:37.390]
Got it?

[02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:38.250]
Good.

[02:07:39.110 --> 02:07:40.470]
Jackie Johnson's in first place.

[02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:42.530]
A lot of desperate guys out there who can't get it up.

[02:07:43.190 --> 02:07:45.930]
In fact, the guys who voted for probably if she showed up at house

[02:07:45.930 --> 02:07:47.330]
would be like Philip Seymour Thomas.

[02:07:48.630 --> 02:07:51.070]
They'd probably sit down on the couch on the opposite end and say,

[02:07:51.570 --> 02:07:52.210]
I can't do this.

[02:07:52.770 --> 02:07:53.290]
You know what I mean?

[02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:54.690]
I can't do this.

[02:07:56.410 --> 02:08:00.050]
Who is your all-time favorite South Florida-

[02:08:00.850 --> 02:08:02.250]

[02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.890]

Whatever.

[02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:06.610]

And Bishop 8.

[02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.690]
A lot.

[02:08:29.170 --> 02:08:30.130]
And so did Dwight Lutterdale.

[02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:30.870]
He's right on a race.

[02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:32.510]
He's got 8.

[02:08:34.050 --> 02:08:34.490]
Beckham.

[02:08:34.690 --> 02:08:35.430]
And he's got 7.

Dwight Sonny and Zasegain.

[02:08:37.410 --> 02:08:38.030]
Get him off of there.

[02:08:39.190 --> 02:08:41.010]
Take a goddamn crane to get him off.

[02:08:42.210 --> 02:08:43.050]
Rick Sanchez 7.

[02:08:43.530 --> 02:08:44.590]
Rick Sanchez 7.

[02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:45.570]
Typed with Dwight Lutterdale.

[02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:46.650]
Never seemed together.

[02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:47.390]
Same guy.

[02:08:48.690 --> 02:08:49.470]
David Bloom 6.

[02:08:49.690 --> 02:08:50.150]
Rest in peace.

[02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:50.790]
He was good.

[02:08:50.930 --> 02:08:51.210]
Good man.

[02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:52.650]

Pam in at the same time too.

[02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.590]
Wow.

It is amazing.

[02:08:59.970 --> 02:09:00.450]
What?

[02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:02.410]
Why they had to call for paramedics.

[02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:05.370]
In fact, the energizer bunny had to like clutch way out.

[02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:07.070]
Kind of like a Richard Geer thing.

[02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:09.910]
Pam Giganti 4.

[02:09:10.450 --> 02:09:11.230]
John Hamburg 3.

[02:09:11.370 --> 02:09:12.010]
Glenn Winkert 3.

[02:09:12.590 --> 02:09:13.310]
Charlie Baxter 3.

[02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:14.810]
And everybody else has got two or less.

[02:09:15.070 --> 02:09:16.190]
They've Dixon's only got two.

[02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:17.530]
Oh god.

[02:09:18.110 --> 02:09:19.710]
I guess all of us people they've all died.

[02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:22.150]
All of the people really enjoyed

[02:09:22.150 --> 02:09:23.630]
Dave Dixon's corny late night.

[02:09:23.810 --> 02:09:26.390]
Those awful late night movies that used to rip an ass.

[02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.990]
Mm-hmm.

[02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:29.050]
Talk about how corny and awful and bad they were.

[02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:30.930]
As opposed to the bubbly big Wilson.

[02:09:31.110 --> 02:09:31.610]
It was a good guy.

[02:09:31.690 --> 02:09:33.430]
But he used to shield for his flex.

[02:09:33.670 --> 02:09:33.830]
You know.

[02:09:35.090 --> 02:09:36.750]
Now if you've got a big Wilson thing in there.

[02:09:37.070 --> 02:09:37.810]
Sure. Big radio.

[02:09:37.810 --> 02:09:38.230]
I love it.

[02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:38.830]
We do.

[02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:41.630]
I haven't played that in a cool.

[02:09:41.730 --> 02:09:43.930]
You know, like I haven't played that since the last.

[02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:44.490]
Oh no.

[02:09:44.590 --> 02:09:45.030]
What is that?

[02:09:45.670 --> 02:09:46.450]
That was bad.

[02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:47.370]
We just tap it on there.

[02:09:47.490 --> 02:09:48.110]
Suck my dick.

[02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:48.890]
I haven't played that either.

[02:09:50.090 --> 02:09:51.630]
How's old Brian Cox doing huh?

[02:09:51.670 --> 02:09:51.930]
Hey Brian.

[02:09:52.130 --> 02:09:52.510]
Are you happy?

[02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:54.090]
I hate WLV again.

[02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:55.270]
Suck my dick.

[02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:56.730]
I'll be them happy.

[02:09:57.250 --> 02:09:57.670]
Asshole.

[02:09:57.870 --> 02:09:58.650]
What am I looking for?

[02:09:59.130 --> 02:09:59.530]
Big radio.

[02:09:59.730 --> 02:10:00.650]
Oh big radio.

[02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:01.750]
Well that's not us anymore.

[02:10:01.930 --> 02:10:02.450]
We used to be big.

[02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:04.010]
Now we're teeny tiny.

[02:10:04.330 --> 02:10:04.690]
Sports.

[02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:06.710]
Now we need to go see Alice to try to

[02:10:06.710 --> 02:10:08.390]
as a ratings extender.

[02:10:09.110 --> 02:10:09.770]
Make them bigger.

[02:10:10.110 --> 02:10:11.470]
I don't I don't find that thing.

[02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.570]
How could you not?

[02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.890]
Big.

[02:10:13.230 --> 02:10:14.030]
What is it called?

[02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:15.090]
Big, big radio.

[02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:15.430]
Radio.

[02:10:15.770 --> 02:10:15.990]
Hello.

[02:10:16.710 --> 02:10:18.830]
Welcome to Big Radio.

[02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:20.190]
This is big.

[02:10:20.650 --> 02:10:21.310]
Big Wilson.

[02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:22.590]
And that's right.

[02:10:22.810 --> 02:10:23.790]
I'm no longer dead.

[02:10:24.370 --> 02:10:25.790]
You see this used to be wacky.

[02:10:26.070 --> 02:10:26.710]
And that was big.

[02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:29.810]
So they dug me up to do big radio.

[02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:32.230]
Well anyway.

[02:10:32.570 --> 02:10:33.690]
Welcome to Big Radio.

[02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:35.430]
And we're going to have some

[02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:37.690]
lovely lovely tunes to play for you.

[02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:39.150]
Such as this one.

[02:10:40.710 --> 02:10:42.450]
And maybe a few records.

[02:10:43.050 --> 02:10:44.930]
Some light entertainment here and there.

[02:10:46.590 --> 02:10:48.590]
Coming up we have the

[02:10:48.590 --> 02:10:51.230]
very very talented, the very very famous

[02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:53.010]
Starland vocal band.

[02:10:53.650 --> 02:10:55.310]
I believe it's afternoon.

[02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:55.870]
The light.

[02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:57.390]
One of my all time favorites.

[02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:59.330]
I used to play it all the time on the

[02:10:59.330 --> 02:11:01.350]
by the great entertainer.

[02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:05.130]
The big Wilson show followed by Bill

[02:11:05.130 --> 02:11:05.550]
Calder.

[02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:09.010]
And any rate here we are on

[02:11:09.010 --> 02:11:10.350]
big radio.

[02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:12.790]
Finally, I've made it to FM.

[02:11:13.610 --> 02:11:14.410]
And we're going to hear the

[02:11:14.410 --> 02:11:16.250]
Starland vocal band with their

[02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:17.750]
very lovely tune.

[02:11:18.690 --> 02:11:19.410]
Afternoondy light.

[02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:21.550]
But first let's let me tell you about a

[02:11:21.550 --> 02:11:22.850]
place called Pammie's

[02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:23.910]
Sexy Pretty Things.

[02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:26.070]
Oh yes, they're very very pretty.

[02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:27.870]
Very very sexy things.

[02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:29.390]
Very very lovely.

[02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:32.110]
Which reminds me of this little tune.

[02:11:33.810 --> 02:11:35.250]
And it also comes to mind.

[02:11:35.550 --> 02:11:36.990]
You know there there's a wonderful

[02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:38.870]
restaurant called Stakes and Food.

[02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:40.370]
I love this place.

[02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:41.830]
I always love to go to

[02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:42.930]
Stakes and Food.

[02:11:43.090 --> 02:11:44.010]
All my friends were there.

[02:11:44.130 --> 02:11:45.230]
Chuck's Inc and Joey Carr.

[02:11:45.790 --> 02:11:48.250]
And they have a very lovely menu there.

[02:11:48.710 --> 02:11:49.990]
And I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

[02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:52.090]
By the way, this is big radio.

[02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:54.990]
This is big and welcome to big.

[02:11:55.630 --> 02:11:57.130]
Coming up we have once again.

[02:11:57.470 --> 02:12:00.210]
Let me remind you we have the very very

[02:12:00.210 --> 02:12:02.290]
lovely Starland vocal band coming up.

[02:12:02.650 --> 02:12:03.090]
Any minute.

[02:12:03.590 --> 02:12:04.070]
Hello, big.

[02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:06.790]
1252 or 560 is a good guy.

[02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.510]
Fat.

[02:12:08.150 --> 02:12:08.630]
And always dead.

[02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:10.470]
Here's one that says I was recently

[02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:11.830]
pulled by a government poll on the

[02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:13.170]
full and the poll questions were such

[02:12:13.170 --> 02:12:14.930]
BS questions are decided to get the

[02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:15.790]
answer to be looking for.

[02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:18.010]
One question was Iraq on weapons of

[02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:19.810]
mass destruction answer one.

[02:12:20.210 --> 02:12:21.630]
I believe President Bush Iraq has

[02:12:21.630 --> 02:12:23.750]
weapons inside of his line answered to.

[02:12:23.970 --> 02:12:25.530]
I believe Saddam Hussein Iraq has

[02:12:25.530 --> 02:12:27.210]
new weapons and President Bush's line.

[02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.810]
There you go.

[02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:31.530]
Not that that was fixed or anything like that.

[02:12:31.690 --> 02:12:32.290]
No, no.

[02:12:32.290 --> 02:12:32.790]
It wasn't a regular.

[02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:33.850]
I don't believe any of these polls.

[02:12:33.930 --> 02:12:35.710]
Chris says especially ours.

[02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:37.470]
Could you please play phone lines

[02:12:37.470 --> 02:12:38.290]
and feel better?

[02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:39.050]
I don't know what that means.

[02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.690]
Phone lines.

[02:12:39.690 --> 02:12:40.290]
What is that?

[02:12:42.930 --> 02:12:43.970]
What does that mean?

[02:12:44.170 --> 02:12:44.450]
I don't know.

[02:12:44.770 --> 02:12:45.230]
Phone lines.

[02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:46.950]
Yeah, like by ELO.

[02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.590]
Telephone line.

[02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:49.090]
All right.

[02:12:49.330 --> 02:12:50.870]
What is there is no such big called

[02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:51.410]
phone line?

[02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:52.570]
So Christopher could be a little more

[02:12:52.570 --> 02:12:53.110]
Pacific.

[02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:53.530]
Okay.

[02:12:54.250 --> 02:12:55.630]
Because we have no idea what that is.

[02:12:55.630 --> 02:12:56.550]
Because I'd love to play anything

[02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:57.450]
and I feel some good time.

[02:12:57.610 --> 02:12:58.170]
I'm not going to lie.

[02:12:58.510 --> 02:12:59.490]
Because I can barely speak.

[02:12:59.710 --> 02:13:00.330]
I feel fine.

[02:13:01.170 --> 02:13:02.070]
Almost look fine.

[02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:03.530]
Yeah, I look like me.

[02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:05.150]
But I just have no voice.

[02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:08.090]
But you know what I'm not mumbling.

[02:13:08.210 --> 02:13:09.730]
I'm not quite as incoherent as those spots.

[02:13:09.730 --> 02:13:11.830]
I was just mumbling fast.

[02:13:12.030 --> 02:13:12.210]
Hmm.

[02:13:12.650 --> 02:13:13.890]
I don't know what you were doing like that.

[02:13:14.050 --> 02:13:15.910]
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

[02:13:17.370 --> 02:13:18.690]
Jackie Johnson 26.

[02:13:19.150 --> 02:13:20.110]
Well, it's better than.

[02:13:21.050 --> 02:13:21.450]
Yeah.

[02:13:22.130 --> 02:13:22.530]
Yeah.

[02:13:22.530 --> 02:13:23.390]
Skipper Chuck 19.

[02:13:23.550 --> 02:13:24.170]
I'll only do the double.

[02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.710]
You go Chuck.

[02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:26.390]
Kelly Craig 17.

[02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.990]
You go girl.

[02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:28.810]
Bob Weaver 14.

[02:13:29.190 --> 02:13:29.610]
You go Bob.

[02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:32.570]
The Giselle for Named is 12.

[02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:34.730]
Ralph Redneck 11.

[02:13:35.410 --> 02:13:36.390]
And White Lauderdale 10.

[02:13:36.670 --> 02:13:38.170]
Although now Anne is on Dwight's ass.

[02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.850]
She's got nine.

[02:13:38.850 --> 02:13:40.350]
They reverse positions.

[02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:43.670]
You think she's checking out Dwight's

[02:13:43.670 --> 02:13:43.810]
leg?

[02:13:44.070 --> 02:13:44.130]
No, I don't.

[02:13:44.210 --> 02:13:44.450]
Could be.

[02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:47.250]
She might have her nose in there checking it out.

[02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:49.830]
5.670560.

[02:13:50.190 --> 02:13:53.490]
Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:13:53.610 --> 02:13:54.910]
I can just see Sandy Peyton now.

[02:13:55.650 --> 02:13:58.450]
Driving that pickup truck out of town with Anne's body back in the

[02:13:59.950 --> 02:14:00.690]
back seat.

[02:14:01.870 --> 02:14:02.770]
Can't you see it?

[02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:04.910]
You know, I never saw a Sandy Peyton.

[02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:07.530]
I was never in the same place as her.

[02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:08.650]
She was a lovely lady.

[02:14:08.690 --> 02:14:09.770]
Nor did I ever see a picture.

[02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:10.690]
Lovely lady.

[02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:11.730]
Real bitch.

[02:14:13.130 --> 02:14:13.610]
WDQA him.

[02:14:13.650 --> 02:14:13.810]
Hello.

[02:14:14.610 --> 02:14:15.190]
Hi, Neil.

[02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:16.470]
Hi, I'm hanging in.

[02:14:16.770 --> 02:14:17.590]
I'm okay.

[02:14:17.690 --> 02:14:18.510]
Is this George?

[02:14:18.730 --> 02:14:19.770]
No, this is not George.

[02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:20.970]
George doesn't speak this language.

[02:14:21.490 --> 02:14:23.190]
Okay, I have two for your fault.

[02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:24.330]
Well, one would be good.

[02:14:25.230 --> 02:14:26.610]
One would be Angela Ray.

[02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:29.070]
Angela Ray is your all-time favorite.

[02:14:29.690 --> 02:14:30.170]
I love this.

[02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:31.370]
Especially when she came back.

[02:14:31.490 --> 02:14:32.710]
It's I guess she left for a while.

[02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:33.430]
Now she's back.

[02:14:33.590 --> 02:14:34.910]
Yeah, she went to New York for a few minutes.

[02:14:35.110 --> 02:14:35.950]
Not good, man.

[02:14:36.090 --> 02:14:36.250]
Yeah.

[02:14:36.630 --> 02:14:36.810]
Okay.

[02:14:36.810 --> 02:14:37.930]
The other one around there.

[02:14:38.150 --> 02:14:39.770]
I mean, the other one is my all-time favorite.

[02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:41.290]
Yes, that's Kitty Carlyle.

[02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:43.990]
Kitty Carlyle was on the air here.

[02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:46.570]
Another asshole call.

[02:14:46.730 --> 02:14:47.950]
Another guy trying to be funny.

[02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:50.090]
Is he funny?

[02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.430]
No.

[02:14:50.590 --> 02:14:51.290]
Is he interesting?

[02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.570]
No.

[02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:52.550]
Did he amuse you?

[02:14:52.710 --> 02:14:52.870]
No.

[02:14:53.070 --> 02:14:53.210]
No.

[02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:54.190]
He just nassled me.

[02:14:55.210 --> 02:14:57.170]
See anybody that would vote for Angela Ray first.

[02:14:57.330 --> 02:14:58.570]
Then Kitty Carlyle on the...

[02:14:58.570 --> 02:14:58.810]
Click.

[02:14:59.210 --> 02:15:00.070]
You know, there was clever.

[02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:03.130]
It was so pathetic.

[02:15:03.310 --> 02:15:04.330]
I'd rather hear the guy that goes,

[02:15:04.570 --> 02:15:04.910]
Chamba!

[02:15:05.210 --> 02:15:05.850]
I'd rather hear him.

[02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:06.710]
And we will.

[02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:07.370]
Oh yeah.

[02:15:07.610 --> 02:15:09.030]
Oh, we already got two today.

[02:15:09.110 --> 02:15:09.770]
We'll give them one more.

[02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:11.770]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[02:15:12.530 --> 02:15:13.850]
It was about Nancy O'Dell.

[02:15:14.230 --> 02:15:14.710]
Who's that?

[02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:16.190]
Nancy O'Dell?

[02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:17.150]
Yeah, I never heard of her.

[02:15:17.690 --> 02:15:19.110]
I know Edo Della.

[02:15:19.150 --> 02:15:22.670]
They're famous tonight or she's on that night daytime show.

[02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:24.010]
Is she a South Florida person?

[02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:25.670]
Yeah, she was done at NBC6.

[02:15:26.090 --> 02:15:27.790]
All right, well, no, can I be about it?

[02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:28.130]
Okay.

[02:15:28.190 --> 02:15:28.890]
We'll put it on her.

[02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:29.330]
Thank you.

[02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:31.550]
Nancy O'Dell and put on Edo Dell.

[02:15:31.850 --> 02:15:32.490]
He won't get any votes.

[02:15:32.630 --> 02:15:33.210]
He's a good guy though.

[02:15:33.890 --> 02:15:34.250]
Edo Dell.

[02:15:34.250 --> 02:15:35.170]
Dark complexity guy.

[02:15:35.170 --> 02:15:35.790]
You know Edo Dell?

[02:15:36.030 --> 02:15:36.350]
No.

[02:15:36.670 --> 02:15:37.350]
Yes, you do.

[02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:39.810]
He's a news reporter on four or six or one of them.

[02:15:39.850 --> 02:15:40.770]
I don't care about that.

[02:15:40.770 --> 02:15:41.430]
Yes, you do.

[02:15:43.190 --> 02:15:44.250]
You know who that is.

[02:15:44.430 --> 02:15:45.150]
If you saw him, you know who.

[02:15:45.150 --> 02:15:46.130]
And if they don't have a big rack,

[02:15:46.170 --> 02:15:46.950]
I don't remember their name.

[02:15:47.110 --> 02:15:47.650]
Hey, well, he does.

[02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:49.790]
56705.

[02:15:49.930 --> 02:15:51.670]
I heard Joe Rose talking about his teacher's today.

[02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:52.170]
That was great.

[02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:53.430]
He's always talking about his breasts.

[02:15:54.170 --> 02:15:55.170]
His guy, no, mastia.

[02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.570]
He was.

[02:15:55.930 --> 02:15:56.030]
Yeah.

[02:15:56.850 --> 02:15:58.450]
Now, you know, who else had big breasts

[02:15:58.450 --> 02:15:59.470]
and died of a...

[02:15:59.470 --> 02:16:01.530]
I'm trying to tell Joe Luce getting the shape again.

[02:16:02.130 --> 02:16:02.670]
Rod Roddy.

[02:16:03.070 --> 02:16:03.390]
Right.

[02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:05.650]
He died of breast cancer.

[02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:06.350]
That's right.

[02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:07.210]
It can happen.

[02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:08.590]
It can happen to you.

[02:16:08.810 --> 02:16:09.990]
And Bob Barker's still on.

[02:16:10.130 --> 02:16:11.710]
Well, that's scary.

[02:16:12.070 --> 02:16:14.230]
Well, what I saw, uh, what day was it?

[02:16:14.330 --> 02:16:14.630]
Wednesday.

[02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:16.410]
On a price is right.

[02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:17.250]
Maybe want to cry.

[02:16:17.570 --> 02:16:18.930]
Because I was like, I'm just mourning.

[02:16:18.930 --> 02:16:19.570]
I love the show.

[02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:20.710]
Yeah.

[02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:22.710]
But he has, he's just...

[02:16:22.710 --> 02:16:24.230]
Like, like I said before.

[02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:25.330]
Lost it.

[02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:26.270]
Time to go Bob.

[02:16:26.710 --> 02:16:27.850]
Oh, God Bob.

[02:16:28.050 --> 02:16:29.750]
Go on, go on with a, you know, a stream of glory.

[02:16:30.450 --> 02:16:31.750]
Don't go out like some dottering fool.

[02:16:31.930 --> 02:16:33.190]
I can't remember what the hell game it is.

[02:16:35.310 --> 02:16:37.890]
On Tuesday, he tried to push the God damn mountain climber

[02:16:37.890 --> 02:16:39.510]
over the edge of the machine.

[02:16:39.650 --> 02:16:39.950]
He did.

[02:16:40.430 --> 02:16:41.490]
He was pissed off.

[02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:44.730]
Oh, now, who could that be on the bat line?

[02:16:44.910 --> 02:16:45.790]
QA and bat line?

[02:16:46.130 --> 02:16:46.950]
Hey, bat line.

[02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:48.470]
It's me, your good friend, such calling.

[02:16:49.130 --> 02:16:49.710]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:50.370]
How you doing?

[02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:51.330]
How you doing, man?

[02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:51.990]
What a shock.

[02:16:53.410 --> 02:16:54.990]
Somebody we actually enjoy talking to.

[02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:56.290]
That's not supposed to be that way.

[02:16:56.470 --> 02:16:57.210]
I understand.

[02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:58.330]
All right, but you do.

[02:16:58.730 --> 02:16:58.950]
Jeez.

[02:16:59.950 --> 02:17:00.730]
Everything under control.

[02:17:00.910 --> 02:17:01.730]
How's your protect doing?

[02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:04.470]
What are you laughing about?

[02:17:04.570 --> 02:17:05.710]
You guys loved him.

[02:17:06.650 --> 02:17:07.550]
Yeah, I know.

[02:17:07.930 --> 02:17:08.250]
I know.

[02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:09.630]
I remember that day too.

[02:17:10.670 --> 02:17:11.870]
Yeah, that was great.

[02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:14.770]
Oh, man, you really thought it's strange today.

[02:17:15.470 --> 02:17:17.730]
I just, I got a cold and I can't speak.

[02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:18.610]
You've had that.

[02:17:18.810 --> 02:17:19.310]
Well, let me go.

[02:17:19.450 --> 02:17:20.190]
You probably caught it.

[02:17:20.190 --> 02:17:21.290]
I'll probably caught it from Rick.

[02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:24.090]
No, you don't haven't talked to his,

[02:17:24.090 --> 02:17:26.470]
I don't even know where he, what he's doing.

[02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:27.790]
I don't know where he is.

[02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:28.550]
Was that Rick Riley?

[02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:29.070]
Yeah.

[02:17:29.470 --> 02:17:29.870]
Oh, well.

[02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:30.910]
Who the hell is that?

[02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:32.550]
We're like 10, anyway, we like you.

[02:17:33.170 --> 02:17:33.910]
We hate him.

[02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.550]
We hate him.

[02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:36.130]
Who?

[02:17:37.050 --> 02:17:37.930]
Jincy James.

[02:17:38.370 --> 02:17:39.650]
Which one of our herfn, the old one?

[02:17:40.310 --> 02:17:42.050]
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.

[02:17:42.370 --> 02:17:44.250]
Boy, you better get yourself a hobby.

[02:17:45.470 --> 02:17:46.430]
Fill up your blue.

[02:17:46.690 --> 02:17:47.650]
Jincy James.

[02:17:47.970 --> 02:17:48.750]
Yes, I do.

[02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:51.030]
You and I are the only people in time who know who that is.

[02:17:51.770 --> 02:17:52.310]
That's right.

[02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:54.290]
The way I N T S Y.

[02:17:54.510 --> 02:17:55.210]
Jincy James.

[02:17:55.430 --> 02:17:55.590]
Yeah.

[02:17:56.090 --> 02:17:58.950]
And how about the guy who used to do the dog racing show

[02:17:58.950 --> 02:18:00.050]
with a false teeth who died?

[02:18:00.050 --> 02:18:01.270]
Oh, jeez.

[02:18:01.410 --> 02:18:03.330]
The guy that Larry King gave the mind to go back on TV.

[02:18:03.630 --> 02:18:04.710]
He used to do the show with Jika.

[02:18:05.670 --> 02:18:06.810]
You know what I'm talking about.

[02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:08.670]
I do, but I can't remember the name.

[02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:11.010]
This is the only guy that ever did a TV show

[02:18:11.010 --> 02:18:11.890]
with no teeth in his mouth.

[02:18:12.730 --> 02:18:13.890]
You know, it's serious.

[02:18:14.050 --> 02:18:14.530]
It's the truth.

[02:18:14.670 --> 02:18:15.350]
That's what you know.

[02:18:15.350 --> 02:18:16.210]
Somebody will know who that is.

[02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:16.910]
I know.

[02:18:17.510 --> 02:18:20.070]
You know what I was glad to hear you

[02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:21.630]
mentioned you're a couple of days ago

[02:18:22.210 --> 02:18:25.810]
about the audio on Channel 7 on cable.

[02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.190]
Right.

[02:18:26.730 --> 02:18:28.750]
Just, yeah, it's been that way for months.

[02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:28.930]
I do.

[02:18:28.930 --> 02:18:31.950]
But if you if you watch it on the on the direct TV,

[02:18:31.950 --> 02:18:32.590]
it's fine.

[02:18:32.810 --> 02:18:34.810]
So it's not Channel 7.

[02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:35.590]
It's the cable.

[02:18:35.730 --> 02:18:36.890]
It's that crap cable we got.

[02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:37.390]
Comcast.

[02:18:37.590 --> 02:18:38.490]
They should die.

[02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:42.730]
We'll take care of yourself, so I'm doing it right now.

[02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:43.090]
Please.

[02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.990]
But you are.

[02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.990]
I'll see you later.

[02:18:45.130 --> 02:18:45.790]
Don't work too hard.

[02:18:47.130 --> 02:18:47.530]
OK.

[02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:49.690]
Oh, he's great.

[02:18:50.470 --> 02:18:52.210]
Yes, he we finally, after all these years,

[02:18:52.210 --> 02:18:53.110]
you've finally been a bit of that.

[02:18:53.170 --> 02:18:54.170]
You hated Rick like poison.

[02:18:54.370 --> 02:18:54.610]
Yeah.

[02:18:54.750 --> 02:18:55.330]
You know,

[02:18:56.110 --> 02:18:56.290]
why?

[02:18:56.390 --> 02:18:56.710]
Because now,

[02:18:56.810 --> 02:18:58.490]
since it's OK, he hasn't talked to me.

[02:18:58.490 --> 02:18:59.130]
Doesn't matter.

[02:18:59.470 --> 02:18:59.890]
Yeah, it does.

[02:19:00.130 --> 02:19:00.590]
Don't hate Rick.

[02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:01.170]
Yeah, you do.

[02:19:01.310 --> 02:19:02.530]
I don't don't like him at all.

[02:19:02.850 --> 02:19:03.230]
Don't.

[02:19:03.250 --> 02:19:03.830]
He's a redneck.

[02:19:04.210 --> 02:19:04.590]
Yes.

[02:19:04.810 --> 02:19:05.650]
Hard-ass, sure.

[02:19:06.190 --> 02:19:06.630]
Big head.

[02:19:07.330 --> 02:19:08.310]
OK, can be.

[02:19:08.430 --> 02:19:09.250]
We got to do the break.

[02:19:09.470 --> 02:19:10.330]
And now I do the spot here.

[02:19:10.550 --> 02:19:11.210]
Not I've been out of the play.

[02:19:11.210 --> 02:19:12.130]
No, I just play a sound.

[02:19:12.370 --> 02:19:13.110]
Because I can't speak.

[02:19:13.430 --> 02:19:14.910]
My life and love.

[02:19:15.630 --> 02:19:17.310]
This is sports radio by Citi.

[02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:22.610]
Just the one to two hour.

[02:19:23.090 --> 02:19:23.910]
It's a phenomenon.

[02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:29.430]
This is our

[02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:31.470]
galazzolpea.

[02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:34.530]
And I'm sure you will agree.

[02:19:35.970 --> 02:19:37.370]
People are funny.

[02:19:37.570 --> 02:19:38.610]
God, tell anybody.

[02:19:39.850 --> 02:19:40.870]
Big Brian Nord,

[02:19:41.110 --> 02:19:42.530]
crosses claim to pain.

[02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:46.050]
Was hanging in the closet when Andrew came.

[02:19:46.970 --> 02:19:49.610]
But when we get a soft summer of grease,

[02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:51.330]
he gets so hyper-petal,

[02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:53.190]
linked it like that sex-ritch sleep.

[02:19:53.770 --> 02:19:54.550]
This is our

[02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:56.310]
galazzolpea.

[02:19:57.130 --> 02:19:58.310]
This is our

[02:20:00.570 --> 02:20:00.970]
galazzolpea.

[02:20:00.990 --> 02:20:01.630]
And I'm sure.

[02:20:01.950 --> 02:20:02.410]
Gord's Gord.

[02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:03.390]
You will agree.

[02:20:04.930 --> 02:20:06.230]
People are funny.

[02:20:06.430 --> 02:20:07.270]
You'll get anybody.

[02:20:07.930 --> 02:20:08.910]
Now, what was that about Brian?

[02:20:08.910 --> 02:20:10.390]
Was it a closet and Andrew came?

[02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.650]
Gord's Gord.

[02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:14.750]
Now, do you remember what Carlos said to Coney?

[02:20:15.090 --> 02:20:16.090]
In that scene in the Godfather?

[02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:17.690]
When he was whipped here with that belt.

[02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.510]
Clean it up.

[02:20:18.810 --> 02:20:19.130]
Clean it up.

[02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:20.610]
You get any back in the beach.

[02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.990]
That's what Andrew said to Brian.

[02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.810]
In the closet.

[02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:25.130]
Neil Godditz says,

[02:20:25.210 --> 02:20:26.130]
how about Miss Harkheimer?

[02:20:26.410 --> 02:20:27.350]
Oh, Jack speaking to ladies.

[02:20:27.970 --> 02:20:30.050]
Jack Harkheimer, she was just on board in this morning.

[02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:32.250]
And of course, they're in contact with a rover on the

[02:20:32.250 --> 02:20:32.830]
Amarze again.

[02:20:32.930 --> 02:20:33.830]
We should be mentioning that.

[02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:34.090]
Good.

[02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.810]
Isn't that great?

[02:20:34.930 --> 02:20:35.430]
Don't you feel better?

[02:20:35.610 --> 02:20:35.810]
Much.

[02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.770]
They're talking to it.

[02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:38.290]
Hey, rover.

[02:20:39.930 --> 02:20:40.870]
Aaron Hialeus says,

[02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:42.050]
tell George Thurallon for me.

[02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:43.310]
Roll one for Aaron Hialeus.

[02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:45.950]
I use pipes.

[02:20:46.310 --> 02:20:49.330]
He's at the JC Penny's in Westland right now.

[02:20:51.090 --> 02:20:51.890]
Cinnamon Stofr.

[02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.530]
Oh, boy.

[02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:53.650]
Somebody's name's going way back.

[02:20:53.810 --> 02:20:54.190]
Remember her?

[02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.650]
Cinnamon Stuffer.

[02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.830]
Sure.

[02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:57.590]
A real silly person on Channel 7.

[02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:58.290]
Of course, that's redundant.

[02:20:59.370 --> 02:21:00.870]
Nobody's voted for a spielcuse in array.

[02:21:01.050 --> 02:21:01.510]
Thank God.

[02:21:02.470 --> 02:21:04.470]
Cinnamon Stofr from WSVN.

[02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.970]
Right.

[02:21:05.350 --> 02:21:05.570]
Excellent.

[02:21:06.750 --> 02:21:07.970]
It's getting a good list of, uh,

[02:21:08.170 --> 02:21:09.410]
how come nobody's mentioned Don?

[02:21:09.730 --> 02:21:09.910]
No.

[02:21:10.210 --> 02:21:10.330]
Huh?

[02:21:10.770 --> 02:21:11.370]
Put him on there.

[02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:12.510]
I don't.

[02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:13.310]
Oh, come on.

[02:21:14.650 --> 02:21:15.650]
Some people have voted Don.

[02:21:16.110 --> 02:21:16.330]
No.

[02:21:16.510 --> 02:21:17.030]
He's a good guy.

[02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:17.990]
Good weather guy.

[02:21:18.130 --> 02:21:18.950]
He knows what he's talking about.

[02:21:19.050 --> 02:21:19.490]
Some of the time.

[02:21:20.970 --> 02:21:22.770]
I'll tell you one weather guy that nobody's mentioned.

[02:21:22.770 --> 02:21:25.070]
So girl, uh, guy, nobody's mentioned yet.

[02:21:25.350 --> 02:21:25.790]
I know.

[02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.890]
I'll give you a clue.

[02:21:27.350 --> 02:21:28.970]
Oh, come on.

[02:21:29.010 --> 02:21:29.910]
You gotta narrow it down.

[02:21:30.090 --> 02:21:30.410]
No.

[02:21:31.130 --> 02:21:31.770]
Come on.

[02:21:32.430 --> 02:21:33.070]
Miss Kamal.

[02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:35.350]
That's why I was going to, uh, think the first time.

[02:21:35.410 --> 02:21:36.030]
I didn't wait that.

[02:21:36.610 --> 02:21:39.210]
Well, she's got a little bit of a problem.

[02:21:39.350 --> 02:21:39.770]
Who are you knowing?

[02:21:40.030 --> 02:21:41.570]
Doesn't on TV in this town.

[02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:42.370]
Oh, come on.

[02:21:43.210 --> 02:21:44.430]
You know, who else we haven't put on her?

[02:21:44.530 --> 02:21:45.750]
Speaking of whether people are good friend.

[02:21:45.970 --> 02:21:48.170]
Who occasionally, uh, Bob Soapr.

[02:21:49.410 --> 02:21:50.910]
They're trying to put old Bob Soapr on her.

[02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:51.370]
He's a good guy.

[02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.690]
Absolutely.

[02:21:51.690 --> 02:21:52.430]
He likes us there.

[02:21:52.610 --> 02:21:54.070]
Too many people like us, but he likes us.

[02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:54.770]
Gary Nelson.

[02:21:54.770 --> 02:21:55.370]
We love Bob.

[02:21:55.430 --> 02:21:55.930]
We love four likes us.

[02:21:56.190 --> 02:21:57.190]
Although, when I'm going to put you under Gary,

[02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.850]
we'll get any votes.

[02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:58.510]
Please a good guy.

[02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:02.150]
5 6 7 0 5 5 60.

[02:22:02.730 --> 02:22:03.370]
Pound 5 60.

[02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:05.530]
Let me do the promo again, because I think it's so amusing.

[02:22:06.810 --> 02:22:07.650]
Join George tomorrow.

[02:22:07.870 --> 02:22:08.990]
I'll have it in the morning to one o'clock.

[02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:10.190]
All you real.

[02:22:10.610 --> 02:22:11.130]
Died in the world.

[02:22:11.230 --> 02:22:12.970]
But we want to see if he still have anybody listening out there.

[02:22:12.970 --> 02:22:13.150]
No.

[02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:14.390]
Oh, they're out there.

[02:22:14.430 --> 02:22:15.630]
They're just not down there.

[02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:17.410]
And where does everybody go on Friday?

[02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:20.330]
Miss Farways, they can.

[02:22:20.470 --> 02:22:20.870]
No, seriously.

[02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:22.490]
And of course, now that the kids are out of school,

[02:22:22.490 --> 02:22:24.370]
I bet we're in another a lot more three day people.

[02:22:24.390 --> 02:22:25.290]
Maybe the ones at the beach.

[02:22:25.430 --> 02:22:27.770]
But at this, no, I'm not, I mean, out of town, they go away.

[02:22:28.890 --> 02:22:30.030]
Like you Orlando, I get.

[02:22:31.470 --> 02:22:32.030]
Orlando Orlando.

[02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:34.270]
Oka, God, do we're in pipe Plaza?

[02:22:35.090 --> 02:22:35.370]
Melbourne.

[02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:35.990]
Dun Eden.

[02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:37.010]
They're Dun Eden.

[02:22:37.810 --> 02:22:38.370]
11 to 1.

[02:22:38.430 --> 02:22:39.750]
You could be eating at Bill Sardin,

[02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:41.390]
as Boulevard of Savings, Northwest 36,

[02:22:41.530 --> 02:22:42.450]
we take you to get there early.

[02:22:42.730 --> 02:22:43.830]
27th Avenue, I'm gonna get there early,

[02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:45.650]
because these Saturdays guy only has so many senses.

[02:22:46.450 --> 02:22:48.150]
And the spits, I mean, the guys that work there

[02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.790]
will eat them all up.

[02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:50.970]
Stop by to win prizes and enjoy free food

[02:22:50.970 --> 02:22:51.990]
from Atlantic City subs.

[02:22:52.170 --> 02:22:52.890]
I was a great guy.

[02:22:52.890 --> 02:22:53.470]
I love you, Ira.

[02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:55.050]
You know what's how I'm not eating

[02:22:55.050 --> 02:22:56.390]
in fat-filled sandwiches anymore?

[02:22:57.250 --> 02:22:59.450]
Look for the QM van tonight from 6 to 8 PM

[02:22:59.450 --> 02:23:00.590]
at the DeRale ale house.

[02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:02.830]
Stop by for Presidentate beer specials

[02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:04.650]
and win some free crap from a yearland.

[02:23:04.730 --> 02:23:06.530]
Your favorite station used to be QA'am.

[02:23:06.750 --> 02:23:07.290]
Remember those days?

[02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:08.550]
For a long time ago.

[02:23:08.730 --> 02:23:09.310]
When we used to be good.

[02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:12.750]
Jackie Johnson, now they're only doing that

[02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:15.890]
to piss me off and see if they don't understand it or care.

[02:23:16.390 --> 02:23:17.090]
I don't care.

[02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:19.550]
They can vote for whomever they like.

[02:23:19.690 --> 02:23:21.210]
But she's not down with that.

[02:23:21.630 --> 02:23:22.390]
38 votes.

[02:23:22.390 --> 02:23:23.530]
You're not down on best.

[02:23:24.350 --> 02:23:24.750]
Best.

[02:23:25.350 --> 02:23:27.290]
Not even she ain't in the top 400.

[02:23:28.590 --> 02:23:29.210]
Huh, huh.

[02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:30.830]
How many sheets will we have to go through

[02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:31.750]
to put her name on it?

[02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:32.690]
About 30, man.

[02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:33.890]
But she's got 38.

[02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:35.510]
Skipper, 25.

[02:23:37.350 --> 02:23:38.230]
Yeah, about 45.

[02:23:38.430 --> 02:23:40.030]
But the one on the right is about a 32 though.

[02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:42.390]
No, she's got two fake boobs

[02:23:42.390 --> 02:23:43.390]
and they're not even the same size.

[02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.910]
No, they're not.

[02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:47.270]
I mean, one is a Mariah Carey model

[02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:49.570]
and the other one is more like a Vanna white one.

[02:23:50.410 --> 02:23:52.430]
It's a white one and the other one's kind of like more

[02:23:53.570 --> 02:23:53.890]
pussed.

[02:23:54.010 --> 02:23:55.850]
Jackie Johnson 38 with a skinny ass.

[02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:58.030]
You know what reminds me of it's like when the Paris Hilton video.

[02:23:58.110 --> 02:23:59.070]
I remember the day the guy called

[02:23:59.470 --> 02:24:01.850]
and he really want to talk to me because he knew I didn't care.

[02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:03.670]
Paris Hilton video.

[02:24:03.690 --> 02:24:04.070]
He's seen it.

[02:24:04.110 --> 02:24:04.870]
George, remember that day?

[02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:05.250]
Yeah.

[02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:06.770]
Now, why would it?

[02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:08.430]
It reminds me of Ron Jeremy.

[02:24:08.930 --> 02:24:10.810]
Why would I want to see him without clothes on?

[02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:12.090]
I don't want to see him with this clothes on.

[02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:13.330]
And the same with her.

[02:24:13.330 --> 02:24:15.390]
I'd rather see Paris but she's all

[02:24:15.390 --> 02:24:18.450]
than Ron Jeremy than anybody would have been

[02:24:18.450 --> 02:24:20.510]
Ron Jeremy but I'm just saying she's a skanky bitch.

[02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:21.510]
She's a skanky skinny.

[02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:24.590]
And the only reason they get excited about seeing that is because

[02:24:24.590 --> 02:24:25.490]
they can.

[02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.930]
Right.

[02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.750]
Because it's there.

[02:24:26.850 --> 02:24:27.310]
And it's Paris.

[02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:28.010]
Right.

[02:24:28.490 --> 02:24:30.510]
She's a billionaire who gives a crap.

[02:24:30.690 --> 02:24:31.030]
She is.

[02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.330]
She is a runway.

[02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:32.050]
Ganky.

[02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:33.490]
Now, there's a horse saying nasty.

[02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:34.290]
There's an ugly horse.

[02:24:34.390 --> 02:24:34.610]
Right.

[02:24:34.970 --> 02:24:35.710]
No argument there.

[02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:39.150]
In fact, I would say Jackie Johnson's got a bigger body.

[02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:40.350]
Better, better, bigger.

[02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:41.450]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:24:41.610 --> 02:24:42.130]
There you go.

[02:24:42.130 --> 02:24:42.410]
Very much.

[02:24:42.650 --> 02:24:43.290]
Better, better.

[02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:44.950]
39 for Jackie Johnson.

[02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:46.330]
They want to hop on it.

[02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:47.590]
Skipper Chuck 27.

[02:24:48.430 --> 02:24:50.470]
They like to dine at tropical acres with Chuck.

[02:24:51.250 --> 02:24:51.910]
We live the old day.

[02:24:51.970 --> 02:24:52.350]
Come on now.

[02:24:53.530 --> 02:24:56.170]
See, that's all you know from is the tropical acres and

[02:24:56.170 --> 02:24:58.050]
the cemetery village spot.

[02:24:58.210 --> 02:24:59.570]
See, we don't remember him that.

[02:24:59.690 --> 02:25:00.470]
How about you, a car?

[02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:02.250]
Who dining and they.

[02:25:02.370 --> 02:25:03.710]
Oh, that guy.

[02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:05.930]
I think he died yet.

[02:25:07.130 --> 02:25:08.490]
Dining in the hands.

[02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:09.070]
Oh, that was bad.

[02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:12.910]
And as much of a bozo as he is on the air, he's the same.

[02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:14.590]
That's him.

[02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:17.810]
And his brother Steve Shapiro, whatever his name is.

[02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:20.110]
Joey Carr and his my brother Steve Shapiro.

[02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:22.110]
Well, how come you guys don't have the same last name?

[02:25:22.450 --> 02:25:22.450]

[02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:23.850]
Oh, I see.

[02:25:24.930 --> 02:25:26.130]
We had two different mothers.

[02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.670]
Right.

[02:25:27.010 --> 02:25:27.250]
Your mama.

[02:25:28.050 --> 02:25:29.170]
Eat two mama and follow us.

[02:25:29.290 --> 02:25:29.570]
Now, wait a minute.

[02:25:29.970 --> 02:25:30.530]
Phone lines.

[02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:33.230]
Maybe Eric could add the bits if he ever stops eating it says here.

[02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:34.610]
I don't, I never heard of that.

[02:25:35.570 --> 02:25:36.370]
Is it X-rated?

[02:25:36.690 --> 02:25:37.250]
I sure hope so.

[02:25:39.310 --> 02:25:39.970]
Oh, this?

[02:25:40.390 --> 02:25:40.790]
What is this?

[02:25:41.010 --> 02:25:41.530]
Good guy.

[02:25:42.210 --> 02:25:42.950]
What is it?

[02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:44.130]
It's a patient, is what it is.

[02:25:44.430 --> 02:25:44.790]
Is it Miss Ruth?

[02:25:45.250 --> 02:25:45.470]
Sure.

[02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.970]
Oh.

[02:25:46.890 --> 02:25:47.490]
Correct him.

[02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:10.530]
Do you hear the big catatonic?

[02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:16.650]
Weirdos call us all the time.

[02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:18.410]
All the day line.

[02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:22.070]
Spastic morons who have no life.

[02:26:22.430 --> 02:26:22.690]
Eric.

[02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:24.050]
All the power lines.

[02:26:24.390 --> 02:26:24.850]
Where are we?

[02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:25.010]

[02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:28.030]
People just want a way start time.

[02:26:28.570 --> 02:26:29.630]
All the vocal lines.

[02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:31.270]
Let's try it one more time.

[02:26:32.190 --> 02:26:32.910]
North Miami.

[02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:34.390]
Hello.

[02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.990]
Yes sir.

[02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.790]
Hey, how are you doing?

[02:26:35.890 --> 02:26:36.210]
OK.

[02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:38.070]
What kind of call is the evening now?

[02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.710]
Oh, worse.

[02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:41.210]
The absolute worst of the pits.

[02:26:41.470 --> 02:26:41.910]
I know.

[02:26:42.310 --> 02:26:43.570]
What the hell is that other fucking...

[02:26:43.570 --> 02:26:44.590]
Just like this call again.

[02:26:45.070 --> 02:26:46.350]
So what can we do for you today, sir?

[02:26:46.570 --> 02:26:48.030]
We just want to tell you having a day

[02:26:48.030 --> 02:26:50.030]
and keep having a good show.

[02:26:50.190 --> 02:26:50.550]
OK.

[02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.630]
Bye bye now.

[02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:52.510]
Have a great life, pal.

[02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:53.330]
Yeah, thank you.

[02:26:53.410 --> 02:26:54.990]
Don't ever call a show again.

[02:26:58.030 --> 02:27:00.750]
Monk brain morons who beat their wives.

[02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:02.570]
On the day line.

[02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:06.210]
Drulling perverts without a dime.

[02:27:06.210 --> 02:27:08.230]
On the power line.

[02:27:08.910 --> 02:27:12.310]
Why do we waste our time?

[02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:13.890]
With the vocal line.

[02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:15.770]
I might lose my mind.

[02:27:16.450 --> 02:27:17.490]
On our phone.

[02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:19.010]
All the lights.

[02:27:19.930 --> 02:27:21.650]
Ring it off the wall.

[02:27:22.050 --> 02:27:22.190]
Yeah.

[02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:23.350]
On our phone.

[02:27:24.350 --> 02:27:24.810]
All the lights.

[02:27:25.690 --> 02:27:28.090]
On what the news gonna call our.

[02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.950]
Phone.

[02:27:29.410 --> 02:27:30.590]
All the lights.

[02:27:31.350 --> 02:27:33.390]
Follow me another asshole.

[02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:34.690]
On our phone.

[02:27:35.730 --> 02:27:36.070]
All the lights.

[02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:39.090]
I'm sure that it won't be the last one.

[02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:40.890]
That's a good one.

[02:27:50.330 --> 02:27:50.970]
Here you go.

[02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.530]
You asked for it.

[02:27:51.630 --> 02:27:52.590]
It killed some good time.

[02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:54.990]
Wendy Corona says she's amazing.

[02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.590]
Who is that?

[02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:56.990]
Never heard of her.

[02:27:57.450 --> 02:27:59.130]
Wendy Corona Big Nips says.

[02:28:00.090 --> 02:28:00.510]
Well then.

[02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:00.870]
Uh.

[02:28:01.570 --> 02:28:03.310]
Doesn't say Big Teets is Big Nips.

[02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:05.650]
Probably teeny tiny teets and huge nips.

[02:28:06.770 --> 02:28:07.590]
She's all nip.

[02:28:08.370 --> 02:28:09.690]
Oh, it's big and nip and then the bug.

[02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:11.550]
The latest track and pull you're gonna be upset.

[02:28:12.730 --> 02:28:14.430]
The CNN track and pull no hamster.

[02:28:14.490 --> 02:28:15.410]
I wrote it down.

[02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:16.430]
I don't have it exactly here.

[02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:19.310]
It was like carry 32 and Dean 22%

[02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:21.030]
and the Boston Globe Pull.

[02:28:21.730 --> 02:28:23.930]
Carry 34% Dean 19.

[02:28:25.410 --> 02:28:25.990]
So I have to know.

[02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.370]
Oh well.

[02:28:26.650 --> 02:28:27.490]
I have to make a scream.

[02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:30.990]
12 minutes after a one.

[02:28:31.210 --> 02:28:32.650]
I am trying to tell you just the way it is.

[02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:34.070]
He's just he's self-destructed.

[02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:34.570]
He's got no one.

[02:28:34.770 --> 02:28:34.890]
Oh my god.

[02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:37.310]
He's just uh he had it going.

[02:28:37.710 --> 02:28:38.030]
Alas.

[02:28:38.970 --> 02:28:39.490]
He is.

[02:28:39.930 --> 02:28:41.370]
He's got a lot of words he said.

[02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:44.650]
I'll tell you a place that may have a pimple or two here in air.

[02:28:44.770 --> 02:28:45.190]
It beats a lot.

[02:28:46.810 --> 02:28:48.610]
There's probably been a pimple and two in air.

[02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:48.870]
Huh?

[02:28:50.010 --> 02:28:50.330]
Unjewf.

[02:28:50.470 --> 02:28:51.790]
The sound you hear in the back in the shower.

[02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:53.130]
Those are just pimples.

[02:28:53.310 --> 02:28:54.510]
It's flying off.

[02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:55.810]
But man, I won't get out of your food.

[02:28:56.490 --> 02:28:57.110]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:28:57.170 --> 02:28:58.090]
The food there is delicious.

[02:28:58.470 --> 02:28:58.990]
It's fresh.

[02:28:59.390 --> 02:29:00.110]
It's cooked to order.

[02:29:00.450 --> 02:29:02.430]
They have every kind of pasta dish ever invented.

[02:29:02.770 --> 02:29:04.010]
They got fantastic veal.

[02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:04.910]
The best in the city.

[02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:05.610]
Try it Jeff.

[02:29:06.350 --> 02:29:08.830]
And they got three different kinds of award-winning pizza too.

[02:29:09.430 --> 02:29:11.990]
Every Monday night at the pizza loft is La Zanya night.

[02:29:12.130 --> 02:29:14.470]
Every Tuesday egg plant night by one of these dinners on these nights.

[02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:15.990]
Get the second one for just five bucks.

[02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:17.670]
Wednesday kids eat feed with adults.

[02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:19.150]
They can see Jeff's famous magician.

[02:29:19.470 --> 02:29:20.310]
Whip it out for him.

[02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:22.150]
Thursday is bike night at the loft too.

[02:29:22.270 --> 02:29:23.450]
Come on a motorcycle by one dinner.

[02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:24.790]
Get the second for half price.

[02:29:25.170 --> 02:29:25.650]
They got it all.

[02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:28.650]
They got seafood, calzone, super subs at the pizza loft.

[02:29:28.810 --> 02:29:32.010]
And at prices are so low you can take the whole gang there over and over again

[02:29:32.010 --> 02:29:34.050]
and eat for nearly rumor like prices.

[02:29:34.450 --> 02:29:35.630]
Call them for takeout delivery.

[02:29:36.330 --> 02:29:37.710]
In other words almost for free.

[02:29:38.010 --> 02:29:41.030]
Call 9-5-4-916-8880.

[02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:41.890]
What is that you're eating?

[02:29:42.310 --> 02:29:43.050]
Guacamole Duret.

[02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:44.130]
Oh what a spec.

[02:29:44.690 --> 02:29:45.910]
9-5 that's see.

[02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:46.270]
Turn that.

[02:29:46.570 --> 02:29:47.450]
Moe was right about you.

[02:29:47.730 --> 02:29:48.670]
Guacamole love and spit.

[02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:49.190]
Absolutely.

[02:29:49.650 --> 02:29:51.970]
Call 9-5-4 or is it guava love and spit?

[02:29:52.310 --> 02:29:52.770]
Guava love and spit.

[02:29:52.810 --> 02:29:53.670]
I hate guacamole.

[02:29:53.890 --> 02:29:55.270]
It's like it's like green mushroom.

[02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:56.750]
Taste nothing like guacamole.

[02:29:57.430 --> 02:29:59.590]
And the good news is you will find any guacamole at the loft.

[02:29:59.590 --> 02:30:03.590]
9-5-4-916-8880 for takeout delivery whatever.

[02:30:04.050 --> 02:30:06.490]
And of course you'll find them in the pizza loft plaza.

[02:30:06.850 --> 02:30:08.730]
University drive between Griffith and 595.

[02:30:09.210 --> 02:30:11.250]
Right beyond Pairland imports with a Schmidt load of parking.

[02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:12.310]
Absolutely free.

[02:30:12.650 --> 02:30:13.990]
Pizza loft you can't be the one with the stick.

[02:30:14.250 --> 02:30:15.970]
Say how the rumors when you're eating at the pizza loft.

[02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:17.850]
My and local.

[02:30:18.470 --> 02:30:20.150]
This is 420560.

[02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:25.850]
So I might as well have one with you too.

[02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:27.810]
You've seen him on Channel 7 News.

[02:30:27.810 --> 02:30:29.730]
First, as a tube it reported.

[02:30:30.130 --> 02:30:34.810]
Now, as a tube an anchor that wears more makeup than Tummy-Fake Baker and Mary Kay Combined.

[02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:36.850]
Rick Sanchez sings.

[02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:50.010]
Here are the dulcet tones of the men who brought you crunching.

[02:30:50.390 --> 02:30:51.430]
Rick Sanchez.

[02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:02.110]
Rick Sanchez.

[02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.690]
Overkill.

[02:31:03.090 --> 02:31:04.130]
I'm a fucking ayyau.

[02:31:05.330 --> 02:31:07.030]
I'm a starry kind of kid.

[02:31:07.410 --> 02:31:08.450]
I'm a fucking ayyau.

[02:31:08.970 --> 02:31:10.490]
Rick Sanchez sings.

[02:31:10.970 --> 02:31:13.970]
Give me a home with a plaza.

[02:31:14.670 --> 02:31:16.590]
I'm a lover of the gym.

[02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.390]
I'm a lover of the gym.

[02:31:17.410 --> 02:31:18.130]
Don't miss Rick Sanchez.

[02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:20.810]
In his PC face, Thor over Hylia.

[02:31:21.330 --> 02:31:22.910]
It's one show you all want to miss.

[02:31:23.130 --> 02:31:23.970]
Thank for a good one.

[02:31:23.970 --> 02:31:33.350]
I'm a lover of the gym.

[02:31:37.970 --> 02:31:39.090]
Rick Sanchez.

[02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:40.750]
He loves his audience.

[02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:43.590]
I accept you as a precious gift from God.

[02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:47.010]
One 17 at 560 WQM.

[02:31:47.090 --> 02:31:47.870]
Happy Friday to him.

[02:31:47.870 --> 02:31:48.810]
We hope you have a wonderful weekend.

[02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:49.650]
But nice being with you.

[02:31:49.730 --> 02:31:50.110]
See ya.

[02:31:50.470 --> 02:31:51.450]
I'll make it.

[02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:52.150]
I'll survive.

[02:31:53.390 --> 02:31:57.350]
It's the hot tea, the great lime dyed coke.

[02:31:57.650 --> 02:31:58.370]
Thanks again, Katrina.

[02:31:58.430 --> 02:31:58.850]
She's great.

[02:31:58.890 --> 02:32:00.530]
She probably dyed cheerio coke today.

[02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:01.810]
Very nice.

[02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.670]
And it tastes very good.

[02:32:02.770 --> 02:32:03.110]
It is nice.

[02:32:04.350 --> 02:32:05.530]
In fact, I hate regular coke.

[02:32:05.690 --> 02:32:06.610]
I like Pepsi and other time.

[02:32:07.050 --> 02:32:07.170]
What?

[02:32:07.450 --> 02:32:08.110]
Yeah, it's a stock coke.

[02:32:08.470 --> 02:32:11.230]
But these new flavors, right?

[02:32:11.350 --> 02:32:11.350]

[02:32:11.390 --> 02:32:11.910]
The vanilla one though.

[02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.570]
Vanilla one blows.

[02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:13.690]
Too sweet.

[02:32:14.110 --> 02:32:16.890]
And that's just too sweet, but it's kind of like a funky taste.

[02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:17.190]
Right.

[02:32:17.470 --> 02:32:19.950]
Like a rat dyed in it.

[02:32:20.390 --> 02:32:21.210]
I mean, I had the lime yet.

[02:32:22.730 --> 02:32:24.530]
Oh, well, I'll leave you the rest of this bottle.

[02:32:24.770 --> 02:32:25.130]
I hate you.

[02:32:25.210 --> 02:32:26.990]
I'm going to take it with you on the line.

[02:32:27.150 --> 02:32:29.110]
No, I didn't think I'd be a nipple yet.

[02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:32.130]
Although I'm thinking how I started doing it.

[02:32:32.330 --> 02:32:33.610]
Looks like a lot of people in this audience would like

[02:32:33.610 --> 02:32:34.870]
to start the suck it on nipple.

[02:32:36.250 --> 02:32:36.770]
I would.

[02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:37.950]
Or maybe Jackie's Johnson.

[02:32:38.190 --> 02:32:39.250]
I bet you didn't know she had one.

[02:32:39.390 --> 02:32:40.350]
She's got 45 votes.

[02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:41.450]
Schivertuck 33.

[02:32:42.490 --> 02:32:43.150]
Come on, Chuck.

[02:32:43.370 --> 02:32:44.990]
Kelly Craig 19, Bob Weaver 17.

[02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:47.190]
Are we sliding anybody in here?

[02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:48.390]
Because I would feel bad if I did that.

[02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:49.090]
Slighting?

[02:32:49.610 --> 02:32:50.470]
I'm sure we are.

[02:32:52.850 --> 02:32:54.530]
Television personality, entertainment,

[02:32:55.370 --> 02:32:59.110]
news, sports, weather, all of these things.

[02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:02.290]
How much Jimmy Cifilis?

[02:33:03.810 --> 02:33:04.890]
Well, I wasn't going to bring him up.

[02:33:05.210 --> 02:33:05.730]
How about your rose?

[02:33:06.690 --> 02:33:10.310]
How about Mad Dog, Humber?

[02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:13.630]
Now, this should be for people who are just TV people.

[02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:15.730]
We don't have to put no radio people out here doing TV.

[02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.630]

[02:33:17.130 --> 02:33:17.450]
Mad Dog.

[02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:19.110]
No, no, I was saying all those other ones that I was mentioned.

[02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.430]
All those.

[02:33:19.950 --> 02:33:21.810]
Don't start looking for an Amera Bell thing.

[02:33:21.950 --> 02:33:23.030]
OK, I know where the hell it is.

[02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.870]
I have you guys, my guys.

[02:33:24.290 --> 02:33:25.530]
Yeah, whatever you say.

[02:33:25.650 --> 02:33:27.170]
Some of the English is much better now.

[02:33:27.450 --> 02:33:28.010]
Thank God.

[02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:29.210]
Some of the spots we're playing.

[02:33:29.310 --> 02:33:32.510]
I don't want to, you know, you know what I'm saying?

[02:33:32.610 --> 02:33:33.030]
Yeah, what?

[02:33:33.490 --> 02:33:36.610]
What a heavy, we got all kinds of problems.

[02:33:37.010 --> 02:33:38.450]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:33:39.170 --> 02:33:40.290]
If anyone thinks it's another.

[02:33:40.450 --> 02:33:42.510]
Well, at least my being here, we got rid of those awful

[02:33:42.510 --> 02:33:45.390]
promos before they were able to create a lot of disturbance.

[02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:48.190]
And again, it's because clearance, he means well.

[02:33:48.370 --> 02:33:49.230]
It's just that he's an idiot.

[02:33:49.570 --> 02:33:50.130]
That's a problem.

[02:33:51.210 --> 02:33:53.130]
No, no, but I'd rather have somebody who's an idiot,

[02:33:53.250 --> 02:33:55.910]
but means well as opposed to somebody who's mean spirited.

[02:33:56.110 --> 02:33:56.510]
Absolutely.

[02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:57.490]
And doesn't mean well.

[02:33:57.730 --> 02:33:58.230]
See what I'm saying?

[02:33:58.830 --> 02:34:01.490]
Who thinks that they're very smart, but are vicious,

[02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:02.070]
absolutely.

[02:34:02.250 --> 02:34:02.550]
Absolutely.

[02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:04.930]
And so that's a lot.

[02:34:05.090 --> 02:34:05.150]
Absolutely.

[02:34:06.090 --> 02:34:06.350]
Disgusting.

[02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:09.950]
You know who we need to do is a, I'm sure I'll never see

[02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:10.550]
her or meet her.

[02:34:11.930 --> 02:34:12.630]
His wife.

[02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.690]
Can you imagine?

[02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:15.830]
You know how many years they've been married?

[02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:16.790]
How many years have they been married?

[02:34:16.850 --> 02:34:17.750]
About 30, man.

[02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:20.050]
He told me that the other day when we hit our very brief

[02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:23.530]
truce, he said the only thing he cares about is that

[02:34:23.530 --> 02:34:24.930]
lovely lady he goes home to wherever he did.

[02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:25.910]
I said, well, what about your wife?

[02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:28.790]
No, no, no, no, he was talking about his wife.

[02:34:29.870 --> 02:34:32.050]
For 30 years now, she, and then can you imagine?

[02:34:32.170 --> 02:34:33.070]
It's just like my mother.

[02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:36.710]
How could anybody put up with her for 40 years?

[02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:38.670]
How could anybody tolerate it?

[02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:42.270]
And she just, if she can't get to you the first time,

[02:34:42.530 --> 02:34:43.370]
you'll repeat it.

[02:34:43.370 --> 02:34:47.150]
She'll keep zetting and zetting and zetting until you finally,

[02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:51.850]
ah, is, you know, until you just can't handle it or do you

[02:34:51.850 --> 02:34:52.350]
want to scream?

[02:34:53.070 --> 02:34:54.410]
You know how it worked with my mother?

[02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.510]
Yeah.

[02:34:55.610 --> 02:34:58.510]
The bastards had to come and both of them.

[02:34:59.630 --> 02:35:00.230]
What is that?

[02:35:00.330 --> 02:35:01.630]
Both her husbands were pregnant.

[02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:01.990]
Oh, I see.

[02:35:02.110 --> 02:35:03.830]
Yeah, they had to come and they must have been

[02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:04.790]
faster than the previous one.

[02:35:05.490 --> 02:35:05.490]

[02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:08.230]
I mean, 40 minutes with my mother is fine.

[02:35:08.490 --> 02:35:09.390]
Your dad didn't have it coming.

[02:35:09.990 --> 02:35:11.450]
I think it was a good match.

[02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:11.770]
Right.

[02:35:13.390 --> 02:35:14.390]
WDQM line nine.

[02:35:14.650 --> 02:35:18.050]
Neil, you forgot Mr. Alsham shying with his ham-hawks.

[02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:19.110]
Alsham shying with you.

[02:35:19.310 --> 02:35:20.270]
OK, thank you so much.

[02:35:20.310 --> 02:35:20.670]
Shame on me.

[02:35:20.730 --> 02:35:20.970]
You're right.

[02:35:21.150 --> 02:35:21.710]
Alsham shying.

[02:35:22.430 --> 02:35:23.390]
Tell me piece of crap.

[02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:24.290]
I can't stand him.

[02:35:25.850 --> 02:35:28.290]
I mean, the ham-hawks is bad enough, but just he's so full of crap.

[02:35:28.450 --> 02:35:29.770]
And I'll never forgive him for that day.

[02:35:30.190 --> 02:35:32.870]
You remember the day I saw right here that we had the

[02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:36.050]
full, the eight minutes fully hurricane threat, right?

[02:35:36.170 --> 02:35:37.110]
And Mayor Ping up a cane.

[02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:39.030]
He was going, oh, everybody's got a shut down.

[02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:41.030]
And of course, the thing was already gone by here.

[02:35:41.610 --> 02:35:44.130]
And so he takes his cameras up there in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:35:44.570 --> 02:35:46.350]
And they had some, what restaurant was it?

[02:35:46.390 --> 02:35:47.390]
It was something that I don't know.

[02:35:47.790 --> 02:35:48.330]
Unless Olis.

[02:35:48.810 --> 02:35:48.970]
Right.

[02:35:49.050 --> 02:35:50.610]
They opened up because then goes I think.

[02:35:50.770 --> 02:35:51.830]
The thing was already gone.

[02:35:52.170 --> 02:35:52.370]
Right.

[02:35:52.530 --> 02:35:53.350]
It was already gone by.

[02:35:53.430 --> 02:35:55.010]
There was no threat to date or broward anymore.

[02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:58.590]
And she bought you and the mayor said this and you opened up.

[02:35:58.710 --> 02:36:00.630]
And they, you know, screw you, Alsham shying.

[02:36:00.630 --> 02:36:01.350]
You're an asshole, man.

[02:36:01.650 --> 02:36:02.350]
Can't stand you.

[02:36:02.930 --> 02:36:05.230]
He's one more reason not to watch Channel 4.

[02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:07.350]
Although he is the only one there whose last name is not Rodriguez.

[02:36:08.510 --> 02:36:09.750]
W.D.C.Y.M.

[02:36:09.810 --> 02:36:12.450]
C.Y.M.

[02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:13.390]
Yes.

[02:36:13.710 --> 02:36:14.130]
Yes, sir.

[02:36:14.770 --> 02:36:17.070]
Neil Rogers knows all this about music.

[02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:20.630]
Who made who sang the song Red Wine?

[02:36:21.410 --> 02:36:21.890]
Red Wine.

[02:36:22.490 --> 02:36:23.650]
Red Wine.

[02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:24.090]
Yes.

[02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:25.350]
Jury Veil.

[02:36:25.710 --> 02:36:26.570]
Who is it?

[02:36:26.770 --> 02:36:27.110]
I don't know.

[02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.670]
Red Wine.

[02:36:28.310 --> 02:36:28.730]
Neil Diamond.

[02:36:30.510 --> 02:36:31.590]
Puppy Campo.

[02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:33.950]
Puppy Compost.

[02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:52.770]
Puppy Campo.

[02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:52.770]

[02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:53.290]
Dad, I'll say it's a little if you can.

[02:36:53.290 --> 02:36:53.290]

[02:36:53.290 --> 02:36:53.290]

[02:36:53.290 --> 02:36:53.290]

[02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:53.370]

[02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:53.370]

[02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:53.370]

[02:36:53.370 --> 02:36:53.630]
Better not be the worst except you, Iam feels.

[02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:53.650]
Iญ возможность to a player who feels happy due to deine işi.

[02:36:53.650 --> 02:36:53.770]
He didn't do it and his mind cannot enjoy without the feeling of losing it.

[02:36:53.770 --> 02:36:54.810]
I mean, he's not that well.

[02:36:54.810 --> 02:36:57.630]
And you've felt移 and love into your mind about your Europaicosre maybe.

[02:36:57.850 --> 02:36:59.850]
What an evil need!

[02:36:59.950 --> 02:37:00.850]
He knows your voice.

[02:37:01.250 --> 02:37:01.810]
There were things I could not tell you.

[02:37:01.810 --> 02:37:03.170]
Backwards mall about that?

[02:37:03.170 --> 02:37:03.770]
You know?

[02:37:05.090 --> 02:37:08.790]
I believe it's C-A-F-F-E-I-R-O. I believe. I don't know.

[02:37:10.850 --> 02:37:13.370]
There have been so many. I'm spelling all these faux-neticos.

[02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:15.810]
Yeah, we don't care about this phone. We know that can do a spell check.

[02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:17.370]
I spell it like Chattaro.

[02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:19.230]
Caffado.

[02:37:21.210 --> 02:37:22.050]
Red red wine.

[02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:24.290]
You be 40. That guy.

[02:37:24.890 --> 02:37:28.410]
You be. That guy, you know what he's got? He's got W-D-40 in his name.

[02:37:28.450 --> 02:37:29.110]
Correct him! Yeah.

[02:37:29.350 --> 02:37:30.790]
The guy I called before. The old cocker.

[02:37:31.610 --> 02:37:32.950]
What are you playing now?

[02:37:33.630 --> 02:37:34.230]
Red red wine?

[02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:35.710]
No, it's just some music.

[02:37:35.710 --> 02:37:36.610]
Doesn't sound like it.

[02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:38.750]
Music from the original motion picture soundtrack.

[02:37:38.910 --> 02:37:39.090]
Oh.

[02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:43.470]
You be 40. That can't be.

[02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:46.550]
It couldn't have been the original recording of Red Red wine.

[02:37:46.810 --> 02:37:50.290]
Maybe it's Red wine is what he was talking about. Is there just a Red wine?

[02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:52.370]
No.

[02:37:53.490 --> 02:37:54.390]
But there is.

[02:37:55.950 --> 02:37:57.710]
There's that one, though. Just in case.

[02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:11.290]
And don't forget, there was also a U.B. Illin.

[02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:12.890]
Don't forget about them.

[02:38:14.290 --> 02:38:15.010]
567-0560.

[02:38:15.150 --> 02:38:16.990]
I'm not going to be glad when it gets to be 2 o'clock.

[02:38:17.470 --> 02:38:19.750]
Not that I'm really delighted to be here.

[02:38:19.930 --> 02:38:24.910]
But there's nothing worse than trying to do a talk show with a horse voice.

[02:38:26.430 --> 02:38:28.450]
46 votes for a horse face.

[02:38:28.450 --> 02:38:30.570]
Jackie Johnson is in first place.

[02:38:30.810 --> 02:38:31.550]
Old Donkey Puss.

[02:38:32.270 --> 02:38:32.750]
46.

[02:38:32.890 --> 02:38:33.470]
Just a Donkey Puss?

[02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:35.530]
Yes. Ever see it?

[02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:36.830]
Trying to.

[02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:39.930]
Some people get confused with an ass.

[02:38:41.710 --> 02:38:42.970]
Jackie Johnson 46.

[02:38:44.290 --> 02:38:45.370]
Skipper Chuck 34.

[02:38:46.810 --> 02:38:47.670]
Kelly Craig 20.

[02:38:48.770 --> 02:38:51.130]
I'm not even at there. I have much more I could say, but I won't.

[02:38:51.430 --> 02:38:52.310]
Bob Weaver 19.

[02:38:52.770 --> 02:38:53.910]
Giselle Fernandez 60.

[02:38:54.050 --> 02:38:55.170]
I'm doing a double digits only.

[02:38:57.070 --> 02:38:58.310]
Guy Seyrafford, Nick 12.

[02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:59.710]
Dwight Lawterdale 12.

[02:39:00.050 --> 02:39:01.190]
Ricky Tiki Sanchez 11.

[02:39:01.350 --> 02:39:02.010]
I have to replay that bit.

[02:39:02.110 --> 02:39:02.830]
They love you, singing.

[02:39:03.250 --> 02:39:03.930]
They hit you on the ear.

[02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:05.250]
They hit you personally, Rick.

[02:39:05.650 --> 02:39:06.410]
Even more than that.

[02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:06.970]
He what's his name?

[02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:08.310]
What's his name?

[02:39:08.570 --> 02:39:08.990]
Greg Vudell.

[02:39:09.210 --> 02:39:09.330]
Oh.

[02:39:10.290 --> 02:39:12.490]
And David Bloom and Bishop Tenepey.

[02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:13.310]
It's both worse than peace.

[02:39:15.150 --> 02:39:17.430]
I think Andy deserves to have her ass left alone now.

[02:39:17.490 --> 02:39:17.750]
Dwight.

[02:39:18.030 --> 02:39:19.130]
She's been dead for many years.

[02:39:19.170 --> 02:39:19.570]
She's not even.

[02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:20.910]
Not even Luke Warme anymore.

[02:39:21.250 --> 02:39:21.350]
You know?

[02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:24.690]
If you stuck one of those turkey thermometers in her ass.

[02:39:24.690 --> 02:39:25.870]
It wouldn't even register.

[02:39:26.210 --> 02:39:27.050]
It would be very her face down.

[02:39:27.050 --> 02:39:27.910]
She's been dead that long.

[02:39:28.050 --> 02:39:29.510]
Well, they buried her face down for Dwight.

[02:39:31.230 --> 02:39:33.730]
And for the rest of us too, because we don't want to see that push no more.

[02:39:34.410 --> 02:39:35.330]
Old butch and.

[02:39:35.610 --> 02:39:36.630]
Please, we can park our bike there.

[02:39:36.850 --> 02:39:38.310]
There's another one I had no sense of here.

[02:39:38.350 --> 02:39:38.730]
We're boy.

[02:39:39.410 --> 02:39:40.910]
The things I used to say about her on here.

[02:39:41.050 --> 02:39:44.950]
And I, and don't forget to use to have the signs up on the Bulletin Board there at Channel 10.

[02:39:45.250 --> 02:39:48.310]
Anyone who watches the near Roger, or listen to any of Rogers will be fired.

[02:39:48.730 --> 02:39:48.990]
Right.

[02:39:49.090 --> 02:39:49.850]
She hated you.

[02:39:50.130 --> 02:39:53.710]
That is a true story that militant bitchie dyke and now she's dead.

[02:39:54.290 --> 02:39:54.650]
God.

[02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:57.010]
26 past one at five.

[02:39:57.550 --> 02:39:58.510]
At five six.

[02:39:58.750 --> 02:40:00.090]
Q.A.M.

[02:40:00.470 --> 02:40:02.790]
Had a great time at Pompedo Park last night and you will too.

[02:40:03.210 --> 02:40:05.790]
Just a half mile from both I and I be five in the floor to turn pike.

[02:40:06.370 --> 02:40:11.930]
Pompedo Park is easy to get to invest in all they give you free admission and free general parking every single day.

[02:40:12.210 --> 02:40:13.330]
How's General Matt Tarthor doing?

[02:40:13.390 --> 02:40:14.210]
He's still on the outside.

[02:40:14.510 --> 02:40:14.730]
Come on.

[02:40:15.150 --> 02:40:15.610]
Can him again.

[02:40:15.690 --> 02:40:16.030]
Yes.

[02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.550]
That a boy.

[02:40:17.690 --> 02:40:18.730]
Old Dickman, come here, junior.

[02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.610]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:40:19.690 --> 02:40:20.690]
There was a guy that could drive on.

[02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:21.550]
Dickman, come here, senior.

[02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:22.730]
Man, you were the best dick.

[02:40:22.730 --> 02:40:23.210]
You were great.

[02:40:23.470 --> 02:40:24.110]
Good man.

[02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:27.510]
Live harness racing in a poker room at Pompedo Park open every Monday.

[02:40:27.870 --> 02:40:28.450]
Now listen rich.

[02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:29.530]
Every Monday.

[02:40:30.050 --> 02:40:30.370]
Wednesday.

[02:40:30.610 --> 02:40:30.910]
Not Tuesday.

[02:40:31.490 --> 02:40:31.930]
Wednesday.

[02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:33.310]
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

[02:40:33.430 --> 02:40:34.010]
It's pretty simple.

[02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:36.750]
In other words, every day except Sunday and Tuesday.

[02:40:37.450 --> 02:40:40.170]
Poker starts at noon to midnight and live racing gets underway.

[02:40:40.570 --> 02:40:41.290]
7.05 p.m.

[02:40:41.430 --> 02:40:41.710]
Like tonight.

[02:40:42.270 --> 02:40:45.650]
Every Monday night there's a two for twenty five dollar dinner special at the top of the park restaurant.

[02:40:46.090 --> 02:40:49.850]
Every Wednesday night it's dollar night for draft beers, sodas, hot dogs and more.

[02:40:49.850 --> 02:40:53.350]
Every Thursday's ladies that with two for one drink specials.

[02:40:53.470 --> 02:40:55.770]
Also every night on the fourth floor player's room.

[02:40:55.950 --> 02:40:59.270]
There's a 7.95 plated dinner special and coming up this Monday.

[02:40:59.390 --> 02:41:00.190]
Listen carefully now.

[02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:02.950]
Monday, February 2 is the next free spaghetti dinner night.

[02:41:03.010 --> 02:41:04.210]
You don't want to miss that at Pompedo Park.

[02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:06.190]
It's going to be chilling.

[02:41:06.570 --> 02:41:07.150]
It's thrilling.

[02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:10.910]
And then on Friday, February 6, which is a week from two weeks from tonight.

[02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:14.070]
What's the date today?

[02:41:14.430 --> 02:41:15.190]
Two weeks from tonight.

[02:41:15.770 --> 02:41:19.330]
Pompedo Park celebrates their 40th anniversary with a special night featuring live music.

[02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:24.890]
Giveaways, free prize drawings, a family fun night and tea card display and tons of other things going on.

[02:41:24.990 --> 02:41:25.710]
You know who's going to be MC?

[02:41:26.110 --> 02:41:27.830]
I give up my good friend Rick Shaw.

[02:41:29.770 --> 02:41:32.010]
And he promises to watch the cap before he shows up.

[02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:35.530]
Pompedo Park for sign-up casting is also open every day seven days a night.

[02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:40.390]
It's a week with the best and hardest, thoroughbred highlight action from all across North America for you to watch and plunge your guts on.

[02:41:40.750 --> 02:41:43.330]
Pompedo Park, a block south of Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road.

[02:41:43.550 --> 02:41:49.310]
For the new racing schedule, go online at pompedopark.com or call them 9-5-4-9-7-2.

[02:41:49.310 --> 02:41:50.130]
2000.

[02:41:50.390 --> 02:41:53.750]
Go for your live racing to that at pompedo park, 705-p.m.

[02:41:53.970 --> 02:41:55.170]
5-0-0-0.

[02:41:55.310 --> 02:41:57.110]
This is 5-6-0.

[02:41:57.430 --> 02:41:58.210]
3-0-0.

[02:41:58.310 --> 02:41:58.790]
You're all yours now, Nick.

[02:41:59.890 --> 02:42:00.610]
You're in.

[02:42:13.730 --> 02:42:16.750]
Ground cut short, to major more.

[02:42:20.390 --> 02:42:23.990]
Ground cut short, to major more.

[02:42:27.550 --> 02:42:32.950]
When you get your ego, what's on your side on?

[02:42:34.330 --> 02:42:38.150]
Ground cut short, to major more.

[02:42:39.850 --> 02:42:40.170]
Seven.

[02:42:41.930 --> 02:42:44.810]
Lunch time over, or the dinner now.

[02:42:45.950 --> 02:42:46.170]
Four.

[02:42:47.770 --> 02:42:48.610]
Three.

[02:42:49.150 --> 02:42:54.690]
Unless you tell us three go put on MSG.

[02:42:54.830 --> 02:42:59.110]
This is ground cut short, to major more.

[02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:02.350]
You're two, two, twenty-two, seven.

[02:43:05.170 --> 02:43:10.070]
One, two, three, bow, side, or delivery, every hour.

[02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:16.670]
And that's how come you gotta come and pick it off.

[02:43:16.770 --> 02:43:19.110]
Yeah, I'm into the back door.

[02:43:19.350 --> 02:43:24.150]
Yeah, this is major one to come, cut short.

[02:43:25.070 --> 02:43:27.310]
I got a few complaints.

[02:43:29.410 --> 02:43:35.670]
How the heck I supposed to eat the one, tan soop.

[02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:41.630]
Who when you forget to give me a pressing spoon you fool?

[02:43:43.290 --> 02:43:45.270]
Huh, what's this?

[02:43:47.370 --> 02:43:50.030]
Why you don't give me my surprise package?

[02:43:50.610 --> 02:43:53.290]
No surprise package to put on.

[02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:56.130]
That's what I mean today.

[02:43:57.670 --> 02:44:01.230]
More points, this is gonna be real math, right?

[02:44:02.050 --> 02:44:04.510]
You left out my pork fry, right?

[02:44:05.370 --> 02:44:06.750]
What are your geekies?

[02:44:08.770 --> 02:44:10.030]
Exactly, it's 134.

[02:44:10.170 --> 02:44:12.330]
I think I'm getting a little bit of voice just enough for 25 more minutes.

[02:44:12.470 --> 02:44:13.230]
Oh, I was wrong.

[02:44:14.050 --> 02:44:16.290]
Now, guess who's on right now doing a report on Rush Limbaugh?

[02:44:16.470 --> 02:44:16.930]
Rush drug Limbaugh?

[02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:17.330]
Link effect.

[02:44:18.870 --> 02:44:19.610]
Oh, damn it.

[02:44:19.710 --> 02:44:21.890]
And effect someone is gonna be left doing it all verbally.

[02:44:22.830 --> 02:44:23.650]
Susan Candy-Adi.

[02:44:24.290 --> 02:44:25.170]
Why isn't she on our list?

[02:44:25.390 --> 02:44:25.790]
I love Susan.

[02:44:26.030 --> 02:44:28.510]
She's great, she's been on CNN a long time.

[02:44:28.510 --> 02:44:30.030]
We love Susan Candy-Adi.

[02:44:30.150 --> 02:44:30.730]
She's a sweetheart.

[02:44:31.010 --> 02:44:31.370]
Yes.

[02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:33.770]
I'm at the time that Steve Nicol-Brotter and Yash,

[02:44:33.970 --> 02:44:35.810]
that stupid fairy report, that was embarrassing.

[02:44:36.010 --> 02:44:36.650]
I'm sorry, Susan.

[02:44:38.110 --> 02:44:39.430]
He's an idiot, Steve Nicol.

[02:44:39.570 --> 02:44:40.670]
I hope you're listening on the internet, Steve.

[02:44:41.450 --> 02:44:42.030]
In the bar.

[02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.670]
Over to hell, you're hanging out.

[02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:44.550]
Jim Brosmer.

[02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:47.310]
On WTVJ, you know, remember Jim Brosmer?

[02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.630]
Yes.

[02:44:48.250 --> 02:44:48.830]
The little child.

[02:44:48.930 --> 02:44:49.990]
The deaf didn't remember Jim Brosmer.

[02:44:50.050 --> 02:44:51.430]
He was on a long time, he was very good.

[02:44:51.810 --> 02:44:53.490]
And he's a candy-Adi with a T or a D on the end.

[02:44:55.410 --> 02:44:55.770]
TTI.

[02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.770]
TTI.

[02:44:57.170 --> 02:44:58.050]
She's got TTIs.

[02:44:59.010 --> 02:45:01.870]
Uh, Jim Brosmer, he left town, I don't remember what happened to him.

[02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:05.390]
And they came back on Channel 10 and just bombed.

[02:45:05.490 --> 02:45:06.410]
They didn't make no impact.

[02:45:07.610 --> 02:45:10.150]
See, there's a difference between people, you know, we liked it.

[02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:11.270]
I thought he was a good anchor, Jim.

[02:45:12.310 --> 02:45:14.010]
But he just wasn't a big factor in the market.

[02:45:14.250 --> 02:45:15.130]
I don't know why.

[02:45:15.410 --> 02:45:16.610]
Because it's a tough town.

[02:45:17.530 --> 02:45:19.850]
Not too many people really make like a big impact here.

[02:45:20.430 --> 02:45:22.190]
Unless they got big teeth, right?

[02:45:22.530 --> 02:45:22.930]
Big nipples.

[02:45:23.610 --> 02:45:24.010]
Big nips.

[02:45:25.270 --> 02:45:26.270]
Or big ass.

[02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:28.070]
Like Maris Grisias.

[02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:30.870]
49 for Jackie Johnson.

[02:45:31.090 --> 02:45:31.310]
Wow.

[02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:32.250]
That is.

[02:45:32.390 --> 02:45:32.790]
Don't blame me.

[02:45:33.570 --> 02:45:34.550]
I'm not blaming anybody.

[02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:36.210]
If they like Jackie, they can have her Johnson.

[02:45:36.650 --> 02:45:37.270]
She's got one.

[02:45:38.090 --> 02:45:39.390]
Skipper Chuck Zanky, you stab one.

[02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:40.190]
He's got 36.

[02:45:41.530 --> 02:45:42.390]
Kelly Craig 22.

[02:45:43.090 --> 02:45:44.350]
God don't even know what Kelly's got.

[02:45:45.470 --> 02:45:46.030]
Bob Lee.

[02:45:46.170 --> 02:45:47.150]
I love Bob Weaver.

[02:45:47.210 --> 02:45:47.970]
One of my favorite people.

[02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:48.590]
Love your Bob.

[02:45:49.090 --> 02:45:50.050]
I keep saying that.

[02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:51.290]
Not too much though.

[02:45:51.550 --> 02:45:52.810]
Just out for a name is 18.

[02:45:53.250 --> 02:45:53.610]
Do I love it?

[02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:54.570]
Oh, do you see this?

[02:45:54.850 --> 02:45:55.170]
What?

[02:45:55.170 --> 02:45:57.830]
That's a family friend I called in to see.

[02:45:58.090 --> 02:45:59.470]
Let us know about this.

[02:45:59.630 --> 02:46:05.310]
You'll remember his kid TV show that talked a lot about literature and science and music.

[02:46:05.770 --> 02:46:07.410]
Oh, just not going to make sure.

[02:46:07.850 --> 02:46:08.410]
All right.

[02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:09.110]
We're going to take that.

[02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:11.270]
You put an evil hacks on Captain Kangaroo boy.

[02:46:11.410 --> 02:46:12.370]
You guys do that.

[02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:13.770]
Bob Keeshin just died.

[02:46:13.950 --> 02:46:14.670]
Captain Kangaroo.

[02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:16.630]
To sad day.

[02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:19.410]
Oh, well, call up Mr. Green jeans.

[02:46:19.410 --> 02:46:20.350]
We had suds on before.

[02:46:20.350 --> 02:46:22.330]
He said, well, call him up anyway.

[02:46:22.470 --> 02:46:22.990]
Tell me get ready.

[02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:24.370]
Mr. Moose.

[02:46:24.370 --> 02:46:24.670]
Dead.

[02:46:24.890 --> 02:46:25.150]
Yeah.

[02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:26.170]
Funny rabbit.

[02:46:26.470 --> 02:46:26.690]
Dead.

[02:46:27.210 --> 02:46:27.590]
Long time.

[02:46:27.890 --> 02:46:28.290]
He died.

[02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.790]
Yeah.

[02:46:29.410 --> 02:46:30.290]
Magic drawing board.

[02:46:30.930 --> 02:46:31.370]
He died.

[02:46:31.490 --> 02:46:32.070]
Right after the show.

[02:46:32.390 --> 02:46:32.530]
Yeah.

[02:46:33.130 --> 02:46:33.690]
Pinkie Lee.

[02:46:33.930 --> 02:46:34.390]
He died.

[02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:35.710]
Francis Horowitz.

[02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:36.470]
He died.

[02:46:36.910 --> 02:46:37.730]
Thing down the school.

[02:46:37.970 --> 02:46:38.350]
He died.

[02:46:38.650 --> 02:46:39.070]
Oh, she died.

[02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:40.790]
I don't want to play that one.

[02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:44.590]
Captain Kangaroo was dead.

[02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:45.950]
George put an evil hacks on him.

[02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:46.450]
I bet you he died.

[02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:47.450]
Oh, it after you said that.

[02:46:47.550 --> 02:46:47.930]
Right after I said it.

[02:46:48.030 --> 02:46:48.990]
Right after you mentioned his name.

[02:46:49.050 --> 02:46:49.470]
Go right over.

[02:46:50.170 --> 02:46:51.730]
I'll don't ever mention my name again, please.

[02:46:53.730 --> 02:46:54.130]
Oops.

[02:46:54.930 --> 02:46:55.410]
What was that?

[02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:57.010]
The one thing.

[02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:58.610]
Oh, it sounded pretty good there.

[02:46:59.210 --> 02:46:59.770]
Sound like something.

[02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.830]
It's what I meant to play.

[02:47:00.870 --> 02:47:01.770]
Like telephone lines.

[02:47:01.990 --> 02:47:02.330]
Your riders.

[02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:13.770]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18T.

[02:47:14.210 --> 02:47:15.310]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:47:15.670 --> 02:47:16.350]
What else did I stand?

[02:47:16.470 --> 02:47:16.730]
Look at this.

[02:47:16.810 --> 02:47:17.370]
By the 10th.

[02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:20.670]
So the defense had those medical records and was referring to them.

[02:47:20.670 --> 02:47:23.770]
So today, an attorney for the hospital went before the judge and said,

[02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:25.530]
Judge, we want those records.

[02:47:25.770 --> 02:47:26.790]
What is that story about?

[02:47:27.210 --> 02:47:27.790]
I don't know.

[02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:32.310]
If you want to read the whole Russian ambassador, if you didn't see the end of those papers this morning, it's on our website.

[02:47:33.210 --> 02:47:33.810]
Russian is.

[02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:35.970]
Russian this and the red blacks of that.

[02:47:36.350 --> 02:47:37.070]
Prosecutors said this.

[02:47:37.230 --> 02:47:37.910]
Ten felony counts.

[02:47:38.830 --> 02:47:40.110]
Pee bargain, etc., etc.

[02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:42.610]
I'd read a lot more of it, but I can't speak.

[02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:44.270]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[02:47:45.830 --> 02:47:46.470]
Q-A-M?

[02:47:46.650 --> 02:47:47.030]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:47.810 --> 02:47:48.750]
Hey, Neil.

[02:47:49.150 --> 02:47:49.850]
Yes, it is.

[02:47:50.430 --> 02:47:52.010]
Neil, you are the overlord.

[02:47:52.210 --> 02:47:53.510]
I am. I'm loading it.

[02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:54.150]
Hey, listen.

[02:47:54.910 --> 02:47:56.610]
How about a big lotion?

[02:47:57.310 --> 02:47:58.030]
Did we put him on there?

[02:47:59.150 --> 02:47:59.930]
He's on there, man.

[02:48:00.470 --> 02:48:01.370]
Oh, no way, dude.

[02:48:01.650 --> 02:48:02.170]
Yeah, he's on there.

[02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:03.450]
Hey, I-

[02:48:03.450 --> 02:48:05.330]
He's- he's- he's tinkling on it right now.

[02:48:05.590 --> 02:48:07.470]
He's tinkling on the big eye of reason the sky.

[02:48:08.110 --> 02:48:09.490]
Hey, there ice cubes right now.

[02:48:09.510 --> 02:48:09.830]
Hello, Pete.

[02:48:10.430 --> 02:48:10.750]
Hello, Pete.

[02:48:11.790 --> 02:48:12.950]
Have a great day, Brad.

[02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:13.010]

[02:48:13.150 --> 02:48:13.530]
Get out of here.

[02:48:14.290 --> 02:48:14.610]
Hello, Pete.

[02:48:15.290 --> 02:48:15.850]
Great guy.

[02:48:16.770 --> 02:48:17.590]
Well, I didn't know it.

[02:48:17.690 --> 02:48:17.990]
I did.

[02:48:19.150 --> 02:48:20.330]
I had dinner with him one time.

[02:48:20.430 --> 02:48:20.830]
He kept pulling-

[02:48:20.830 --> 02:48:21.350]
He looked great.

[02:48:21.470 --> 02:48:23.310]
He kept reaching across the table on the anke my food away.

[02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:23.990]
Now, he didn't do that.

[02:48:25.390 --> 02:48:26.910]
I'm trying to think of who did do that.

[02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:28.190]
Remember?

[02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:28.770]
No.

[02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.970]
No, he- not even-

[02:48:29.970 --> 02:48:31.590]
No, there was somebody I can't remember who it was.

[02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.990]
Uh, long ago.

[02:48:33.210 --> 02:48:33.490]
Your mom.

[02:48:33.870 --> 02:48:35.830]
No, somebody, uh, personality type.

[02:48:36.450 --> 02:48:37.190]
And he would like-

[02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:38.130]
Oh, can I try some of that?

[02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:39.090]
And he would like reach across.

[02:48:39.490 --> 02:48:41.490]
And take a little bit of something off everybody's plate.

[02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:42.430]
I hate that.

[02:48:42.590 --> 02:48:43.490]
Oh, my God.

[02:48:44.050 --> 02:48:44.710]
I thought that-

[02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:45.550]
Even I wouldn't do that.

[02:48:45.650 --> 02:48:47.930]
I'm about as tacky as it gets, but that is-

[02:48:47.930 --> 02:48:49.990]
So frickin' grotesque.

[02:48:50.170 --> 02:48:51.150]
Oh, can I have a little of that?

[02:48:51.270 --> 02:48:51.990]
Let me see how that is.

[02:48:53.050 --> 02:48:53.890]
And I-

[02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:55.770]
What I should have it was got up and like bent over once.

[02:48:56.090 --> 02:48:56.770]
I had it like that.

[02:48:57.270 --> 02:48:58.270]
You can have some more of that.

[02:48:58.650 --> 02:49:00.530]
Which he really, I had a punch to right in order.

[02:49:00.750 --> 02:49:01.030]
You know what I mean?

[02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.110]
Yeah.

[02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:02.670]
It had a punch to right in the head.

[02:49:02.770 --> 02:49:03.090]
Real hard.

[02:49:03.310 --> 02:49:06.130]
In fact, get a hold of that guy from the movies up there in Broward.

[02:49:07.250 --> 02:49:07.910]
Hey, there you go.

[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.570]
You can barely see.

[02:49:08.770 --> 02:49:09.710]
I still keep my mom in the movie.

[02:49:09.810 --> 02:49:10.630]
I still can't get over that.

[02:49:10.810 --> 02:49:13.170]
The fact that the daughter is rationalizing.

[02:49:13.530 --> 02:49:15.790]
And they turn down the, uh, the play agreement.

[02:49:15.790 --> 02:49:17.870]
I just can't believe it.

[02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.450]
It was murder.

[02:49:18.730 --> 02:49:19.290]
Is what it was.

[02:49:19.470 --> 02:49:22.810]
It was the theater's fault for not having adequate old people security.

[02:49:22.810 --> 02:49:23.490]
I see.

[02:49:23.830 --> 02:49:24.430]
That's what they're saying.

[02:49:24.690 --> 02:49:26.890]
A punch this guy in the head, right?

[02:49:27.230 --> 02:49:29.510]
He fell down, went into a coma, and he died.

[02:49:29.930 --> 02:49:31.290]
Kind of like that ricksoncious thing.

[02:49:32.450 --> 02:49:33.530]
W-Q-A-M.

[02:49:34.590 --> 02:49:35.070]
Hello.

[02:49:35.310 --> 02:49:35.770]
Yes, sir.

[02:49:36.450 --> 02:49:36.790]
Yes.

[02:49:37.290 --> 02:49:37.750]
We are now.

[02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:38.990]
It sounds just like you.

[02:49:39.290 --> 02:49:40.490]
Sounds just like you, too.

[02:49:40.690 --> 02:49:41.010]
Okay.

[02:49:41.270 --> 02:49:41.770]
I hope not.

[02:49:41.770 --> 02:49:42.950]
I've got two of them.

[02:49:42.990 --> 02:49:47.490]
One's pretty obscure, but one is, uh, I can't believe she's not even on there.

[02:49:47.850 --> 02:49:47.850]

[02:49:48.010 --> 02:49:48.990]
Connie, Connie Chung.

[02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:50.970]
Connie Chung was here.

[02:49:51.490 --> 02:49:51.970]
Of course.

[02:49:52.310 --> 02:49:52.850]
I didn't know that.

[02:49:53.210 --> 02:49:53.550]
Yeah.

[02:49:53.790 --> 02:49:54.310]
What was that?

[02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:56.050]
And the long time.

[02:49:56.050 --> 02:49:57.090]
How many years ago was that?

[02:49:57.210 --> 02:49:58.130]
About 30, man.

[02:49:58.310 --> 02:49:58.550]
Okay.

[02:49:58.730 --> 02:49:59.170]
30, man.

[02:49:59.750 --> 02:50:01.990]
Uh, and there was another guy that did.

[02:50:02.030 --> 02:50:05.770]
He's brought in to go against the gift for Chuck Show back in the early 60s.

[02:50:05.770 --> 02:50:08.590]
It was called Banjo Billy's Fun Boat.

[02:50:08.590 --> 02:50:10.070]
I don't know if you remember that or not.

[02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.650]
No.

[02:50:10.830 --> 02:50:11.970]
But Banjo Billy.

[02:50:13.370 --> 02:50:13.690]
Okay.

[02:50:13.730 --> 02:50:14.190]
Don't even know.

[02:50:14.490 --> 02:50:15.190]
That's Ben Zell.

[02:50:15.450 --> 02:50:16.010]
We got it.

[02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:16.490]
Thanks, Pally.

[02:50:16.850 --> 02:50:17.770]
Got anybody think of it?

[02:50:17.770 --> 02:50:19.010]
Which of those are we putting on there?

[02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:20.670]
Banjo Billy and Connie Chung.

[02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.950]
Chung.

[02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.230]
Chung.

[02:50:22.030 --> 02:50:22.990]
I don't know if she was here.

[02:50:24.190 --> 02:50:26.390]
And listen, if he says she was here, she must have been here.

[02:50:26.530 --> 02:50:26.790]
Maybe for...

[02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:27.370]
Why would he lie?

[02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:28.070]
Couple coffee.

[02:50:28.130 --> 02:50:29.230]
No, he was, uh, he knew his crap.

[02:50:29.570 --> 02:50:29.970]
You could tell.

[02:50:30.950 --> 02:50:32.490]
Jackie Johnson, nobody's gonna touch her.

[02:50:33.250 --> 02:50:33.930]
Oh, oh.

[02:50:34.770 --> 02:50:35.750]
51 for Jackie.

[02:50:38.570 --> 02:50:39.810]
Skipper Chuck 37.

[02:50:40.590 --> 02:50:41.430]
I don't know why you're so...

[02:50:41.430 --> 02:50:42.990]
I mean, he's gotta have a sense of humor.

[02:50:43.730 --> 02:50:44.630]
Of course he does.

[02:50:44.810 --> 02:50:46.730]
What's wrong with being old and decrepit?

[02:50:48.090 --> 02:50:48.550]
Uh, everything?

[02:50:48.850 --> 02:50:50.690]
And putting your teeth in the glass of tropical acres.

[02:50:50.990 --> 02:50:51.270]
Everything?

[02:50:51.910 --> 02:50:54.110]
Yeah, but when you're 35...

[02:50:56.370 --> 02:50:58.070]
We're supporting you, 560.

[02:50:58.590 --> 02:50:59.530]
You A.A.A.

[02:51:29.530 --> 02:51:32.110]
I was around, it's hard to sleep.

[02:51:33.090 --> 02:51:36.050]
I know it's for show, but in a cop's after me.

[02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:39.710]
But, who'd they want from this old yearning?

[02:51:40.850 --> 02:51:44.530]
I'm just sitting here, hoping that you'll be...

[02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:48.330]
Oh, you know it from the vehicle.

[02:51:48.590 --> 02:51:49.330]
I know who I am.

[02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:50.670]
I'm a God for you.

[02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:52.210]
I'm aware of everything.

[02:51:52.990 --> 02:51:54.030]
Take me to the shop.

[02:51:54.350 --> 02:51:56.650]
And take off the head gear in the atsitzers, too, please.

[02:52:00.030 --> 02:52:03.150]
While you're writing these down, while you're typing these out.

[02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:05.350]
Captain Kangaroo did it 86.

[02:52:05.790 --> 02:52:05.910]
Oh, boy.

[02:52:05.930 --> 02:52:06.450]
So, it's 86.

[02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:09.070]
It's enough to make you scream.

[02:52:10.290 --> 02:52:11.790]
Hey, show you how many years this show ran.

[02:52:11.930 --> 02:52:12.850]
About 30, man.

[02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:14.030]
Right, right on the number.

[02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:18.070]
Bob Keeshin noted generations of children as TV personality.

[02:52:18.290 --> 02:52:21.970]
Captain Kangaroo has died at 76, only moments before his name was mentioned in vain.

[02:52:22.390 --> 02:52:25.050]
By talk show producer George Rodriguez at WQM in Miami.

[02:52:26.190 --> 02:52:27.630]
I'm reading it right off MSNC.

[02:52:27.630 --> 02:52:27.910]
He's sitting.

[02:52:30.570 --> 02:52:33.650]
The Captain Kangaroo show began its 30-year run.

[02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:34.630]
About 30, man.

[02:52:34.750 --> 02:52:35.370]
In 1955.

[02:52:36.190 --> 02:52:36.970]
You put the hacks on him.

[02:52:37.290 --> 02:52:37.730]
You're killer.

[02:52:37.850 --> 02:52:38.430]
I do it all the time.

[02:52:38.650 --> 02:52:39.270]
Elante Kleesto.

[02:52:40.410 --> 02:52:44.990]
Characters included the Captain himself and pals Mr. Green Jeans, Mr. Moose, and Bunny Rabbit.

[02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:47.630]
A favorite sketch involved Mr....

[02:52:48.350 --> 02:52:48.690]
Mr....

[02:52:48.690 --> 02:52:49.790]
What, there's a board, Mr. Mayor.

[02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:52.070]
Dropping ping pong ball in the captain's head.

[02:52:52.310 --> 02:52:52.530]
No, Captain said.

[02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.550]

[02:52:52.610 --> 02:52:54.070]
They left out the moves.

[02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.710]

[02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:59.030]
Moose would drop balls on the captain's head.

[02:52:59.050 --> 02:53:02.730]
According to the Internet movie database, Captain Kangaroo won six Emmys and three Peabody awards.

[02:53:02.730 --> 02:53:03.630]
Remember Mr. Peabody?

[02:53:04.110 --> 02:53:04.410]
That's right.

[02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:05.290]
I like that show better.

[02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:05.830]
I know.

[02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:07.790]
But before portraying...

[02:53:07.790 --> 02:53:08.470]
I didn't know that.

[02:53:10.510 --> 02:53:10.910]
Hmm?

[02:53:11.090 --> 02:53:17.410]
Before portraying the captain, Keeshin was the first actor to play sidekick Clarebel the clown on the Howdy Doody show.

[02:53:18.030 --> 02:53:19.490]
I guess I didn't know that, but I forgot.

[02:53:19.850 --> 02:53:20.590]
That's important stuff.

[02:53:21.010 --> 02:53:21.630]
He was a...

[02:53:21.630 --> 02:53:22.390]
Clarebel.

[02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:23.270]
See?

[02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:24.010]
Here's the staff.

[02:53:24.330 --> 02:53:25.450]
He used to squeeze it.

[02:53:26.190 --> 02:53:28.570]
Keeshin was author of numerous books including Growing Up Happy.

[02:53:28.750 --> 02:53:30.970]
Captain Kangaroo tells yesterday's children how to nurture their own.

[02:53:31.310 --> 02:53:32.030]
And Good Morning Captain.

[02:53:32.230 --> 02:53:33.450]
50 Wonderful Years When Bob Keeshin...

[02:53:34.270 --> 02:53:34.670]
Something.

[02:53:35.090 --> 02:53:35.950]
TV's Captain Kangaroo.

[02:53:36.190 --> 02:53:38.530]
He also wrote a series of books about a character called...

[02:53:38.530 --> 02:53:39.170]
Itty Bitty Titty.

[02:53:39.350 --> 02:53:39.530]
A Kitty.

[02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:41.310]
What?

[02:53:41.350 --> 02:53:41.670]
Cat.

[02:53:42.210 --> 02:53:42.990]
Itty Bitty Titty.

[02:53:43.530 --> 02:53:44.270]
That's what he wrote.

[02:53:44.890 --> 02:53:45.810]
That was about Jackie Johnson.

[02:53:46.570 --> 02:53:47.530]
You oughta see her real ones.

[02:53:48.610 --> 02:53:49.450]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:53:49.570 --> 02:53:50.350]
She keeps them in a jar.

[02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:54.630]
Well, send them all to your desperate guys out there.

[02:53:54.770 --> 02:53:54.890]
Okay?

[02:53:55.290 --> 02:53:56.130]
All you limp guys.

[02:53:56.910 --> 02:53:58.210]
Now, here's one from Mark.

[02:53:58.510 --> 02:53:59.730]
Oh, this is just amazing.

[02:53:59.890 --> 02:54:00.530]
You're going to cramp.

[02:54:03.290 --> 02:54:05.570]
He's got some old names at Walt Kronyce.

[02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:06.350]
Oh, yeah.

[02:54:06.470 --> 02:54:07.030]
The Boy Channel Turned By The Man.

[02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:08.110]
Right?

[02:54:08.750 --> 02:54:10.930]
You better get your typing fingers, right?

[02:54:10.990 --> 02:54:11.830]
He's got 100 names.

[02:54:13.390 --> 02:54:15.690]
Lori, the Buzz, Hibberd.

[02:54:16.570 --> 02:54:17.170]
Remember that?

[02:54:17.270 --> 02:54:17.770]
We got drops.

[02:54:18.030 --> 02:54:18.770]
She was our neighbor.

[02:54:19.570 --> 02:54:19.810]
What are they?

[02:54:19.810 --> 02:54:20.370]
What are they under?

[02:54:21.950 --> 02:54:22.350]
Uh...

[02:54:22.350 --> 02:54:24.270]
Remember, it is all for a very good class.

[02:54:24.490 --> 02:54:26.530]
So even if you absolutely take no Rogers,

[02:54:27.150 --> 02:54:29.170]
pause, pick up the CD anyway,

[02:54:29.330 --> 02:54:30.510]
what's the worst that can happen?

[02:54:30.770 --> 02:54:31.510]
And that is the Buzz.

[02:54:31.690 --> 02:54:32.070]
What's the name?

[02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:34.790]
Yeah, what a big endorsement.

[02:54:34.910 --> 02:54:36.330]
Like grandma, I'm so sure.

[02:54:37.530 --> 02:54:38.970]
And then of course there was always...

[02:54:38.970 --> 02:54:39.470]
Swallow?

[02:54:39.850 --> 02:54:40.510]
Yeah, she did.

[02:54:41.350 --> 02:54:42.230]
Let's see who else.

[02:54:42.750 --> 02:54:43.510]
Peter Ford.

[02:54:44.930 --> 02:54:45.550]
Bob Mayor.

[02:54:46.210 --> 02:54:47.970]
How can we leave my good buddy Bob Mayor off of there?

[02:54:47.970 --> 02:54:49.110]
Hey, get off the phone, book's Bob.

[02:54:49.390 --> 02:54:50.250]
People are starting to talk.

[02:54:51.390 --> 02:54:51.890]
Michael, pardon me.

[02:54:52.510 --> 02:54:53.410]
Well, I don't know.

[02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:54.330]
Put him on there if you want.

[02:54:54.510 --> 02:54:55.470]
He just pissed me off of it.

[02:54:55.530 --> 02:54:55.970]
I think about um...

[02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:57.010]
Catherine Harris.

[02:54:58.430 --> 02:54:59.090]
We hate you now, Mike.

[02:54:59.190 --> 02:54:59.870]
We used to like you a lot.

[02:54:59.950 --> 02:55:00.770]
And I would despise you.

[02:55:00.890 --> 02:55:01.210]
You're an idiot.

[02:55:01.770 --> 02:55:03.810]
Sucking Catherine Harris's smelly old toes.

[02:55:04.650 --> 02:55:04.930]
Nasty.

[02:55:06.030 --> 02:55:06.590]
Camberl Marshall.

[02:55:07.450 --> 02:55:07.690]
Ha ha.

[02:55:09.690 --> 02:55:10.310]
Are you getting these?

[02:55:11.610 --> 02:55:12.950]
Let me give you a clue on the next one.

[02:55:13.050 --> 02:55:13.950]
I'm spelling them all wrong.

[02:55:14.110 --> 02:55:14.550]
Let me give you a clue.

[02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:15.290]
Forget about spelling.

[02:55:16.310 --> 02:55:16.870]
Dave Gain.

[02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:18.230]
I was gonna say it.

[02:55:18.290 --> 02:55:19.170]
Bigger than like that cell.

[02:55:20.130 --> 02:55:20.610]
Terry Merriman.

[02:55:21.170 --> 02:55:22.870]
I wonder if she's kind of Jim Merriman Jr.

[02:55:23.730 --> 02:55:24.570]
Or Tom Merriman.

[02:55:25.890 --> 02:55:26.250]
Uh...

[02:55:26.250 --> 02:55:26.630]
Oh.

[02:55:27.070 --> 02:55:28.270]
Somebody says Tony Segredo.

[02:55:28.350 --> 02:55:29.110]
Now smell his name right.

[02:55:29.290 --> 02:55:30.390]
S-E-G-R-E-T-O.

[02:55:31.250 --> 02:55:31.610]
Okay.

[02:55:32.010 --> 02:55:32.390]
You got it?

[02:55:32.910 --> 02:55:36.330]
S-E-G-R-E-T-O.

[02:55:36.670 --> 02:55:36.990]
You got that?

[02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:38.870]
And you might want to put on there.

[02:55:39.030 --> 02:55:39.650]
He's an asshole.

[02:55:39.890 --> 02:55:40.010]
Yeah.

[02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:41.570]
Well, I'm sorry he's one of Hank's friends.

[02:55:41.610 --> 02:55:41.930]
I forgot.

[02:55:42.090 --> 02:55:42.650]
He's still an asshole.

[02:55:44.090 --> 02:55:44.450]
Uh...

[02:55:44.450 --> 02:55:46.350]
Speaking of that, Sloppy Jennifer Villapi.

[02:55:48.570 --> 02:55:49.590]
I don't forget that note.

[02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:52.290]
The real Kurt Nochi wrote, thank him for the things I said about her.

[02:55:52.530 --> 02:55:54.510]
What she used to do with that show from Italy on the travel channel?

[02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.750]
He's, uh...

[02:55:56.750 --> 02:55:56.930]
Oh.

[02:55:57.350 --> 02:55:57.670]
Massive.

[02:55:57.730 --> 02:55:58.230]
Run away, ego.

[02:55:58.430 --> 02:55:59.410]
I'm totally spelling all these wrong.

[02:55:59.590 --> 02:56:00.210]
I don't care.

[02:56:00.530 --> 02:56:01.070]
Nobody cares.

[02:56:02.210 --> 02:56:02.990]
Uh, what else?

[02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:04.390]
Gail Bright.

[02:56:04.930 --> 02:56:05.530]
Okay, Gail.

[02:56:05.610 --> 02:56:06.770]
How can we leave off our close friend, Ray?

[02:56:06.770 --> 02:56:07.430]
Sorry, Gail.

[02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:09.730]
They're talking about eating, yes!

[02:56:10.070 --> 02:56:10.630]
Eating, yes!

[02:56:11.550 --> 02:56:12.750]
That was Gail Bright's friend.

[02:56:12.750 --> 02:56:14.170]
Right, right, right.

[02:56:14.170 --> 02:56:14.330]
Right.

[02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:16.750]
Rad Burky, I don't know who that is.

[02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:17.110]
Rad.

[02:56:17.770 --> 02:56:18.510]
Who is that?

[02:56:18.610 --> 02:56:19.250]
You don't remember Rad?

[02:56:19.530 --> 02:56:19.790]
No.

[02:56:19.930 --> 02:56:20.830]
Might be still on somewhere.

[02:56:21.310 --> 02:56:22.070]
Who was it?

[02:56:22.370 --> 02:56:22.970]
What was it?

[02:56:23.790 --> 02:56:24.670]
He was...

[02:56:24.670 --> 02:56:24.670]

[02:56:25.050 --> 02:56:25.830]
I don't know who that is.

[02:56:25.890 --> 02:56:26.390]
Rad Burky.

[02:56:26.470 --> 02:56:27.030]
Todd Tungan.

[02:56:27.570 --> 02:56:28.990]
That's the big question to channel 10.

[02:56:29.290 --> 02:56:30.630]
Is who is Todd Tungan and does Don?

[02:56:30.770 --> 02:56:30.930]
No.

[02:56:32.330 --> 02:56:33.190]
Todd Tungan.

[02:56:33.810 --> 02:56:34.630]
Willard Shepard.

[02:56:35.690 --> 02:56:40.250]
Now I get confused between Slop Smith that's on Fox's New's now.

[02:56:40.250 --> 02:56:41.150]
He's an idiot.

[02:56:41.370 --> 02:56:42.570]
Or talk about a lightweight.

[02:56:43.390 --> 02:56:46.270]
He used to have the ballet Slip resigning to parking on.

[02:56:46.310 --> 02:56:47.570]
In fact, there are Channel 7 and IOD.

[02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:48.770]
Willard, uh, huh?

[02:56:49.470 --> 02:56:50.310]
You know what I'm talking about.

[02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:50.770]
Yeah.

[02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.490]
Shepard Smith.

[02:56:51.670 --> 02:56:52.070]
Oh, Shep.

[02:56:52.330 --> 02:56:52.870]
Shepard is out.

[02:56:54.350 --> 02:56:55.070]
Willard Shepard.

[02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:56.010]
He's on Channel 6, Annie.

[02:56:56.410 --> 02:56:56.810]
Dark and Plagot.

[02:56:56.810 --> 02:56:57.150]
No.

[02:56:57.410 --> 02:56:57.770]
There he is.

[02:56:58.130 --> 02:56:59.630]
Or the late Mark Lovener on Channel 7.

[02:57:00.050 --> 02:57:00.410]
LUDNER.

[02:57:00.630 --> 02:57:01.070]
Mark Lovener.

[02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:03.030]
I don't think there's any.

[02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.350]
Oh!

[02:57:03.550 --> 02:57:03.730]
In it.

[02:57:05.570 --> 02:57:05.990]
Let's see.

[02:57:06.030 --> 02:57:07.850]
Oh, here's Annett's talking about Lee's favorite.

[02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:10.130]
Tony St. Redo's one of them, as well as Dan Cofflin.

[02:57:10.990 --> 02:57:15.230]
The asshole did sports for Channel 6 and late 80s who kept accentuating reports by ringing

[02:57:15.230 --> 02:57:17.430]
a bell like he was an 18th century town cryer.

[02:57:17.670 --> 02:57:20.590]
I remember he once called Michael Jordan an idiot for missing a slam dunk.

[02:57:20.890 --> 02:57:22.070]
He was gone soon after that.

[02:57:22.310 --> 02:57:24.330]
In conclusion says Mark Boy is a lengthy facts.

[02:57:24.370 --> 02:57:24.730]
God.

[02:57:25.270 --> 02:57:25.730]
Thank you, Mark.

[02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:27.890]
John Hamburg should be doing much better.

[02:57:27.970 --> 02:57:28.210]
That's right.

[02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:28.850]
John was great.

[02:57:29.350 --> 02:57:31.250]
And then he went back to Texas to Houston, I think.

[02:57:31.350 --> 02:57:32.030]
How big were his boobs?

[02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.370]
42.

[02:57:34.350 --> 02:57:35.030]
No, he was excellent.

[02:57:35.170 --> 02:57:35.870]
You didn't like John Hamburg?

[02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:36.630]
I liked him great.

[02:57:36.770 --> 02:57:37.290]
What do you talk about?

[02:57:37.290 --> 02:57:39.530]
He was, I would say he's the best news anchor.

[02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:40.670]
Oh, Del Frank.

[02:57:40.750 --> 02:57:41.790]
That guy would get upset with me.

[02:57:41.850 --> 02:57:42.730]
We don't put Del Frank.

[02:57:42.970 --> 02:57:43.730]
Del Frank.

[02:57:44.270 --> 02:57:44.590]
Del Frank.

[02:57:44.750 --> 02:57:45.070]
Del Shannon Frank.

[02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:46.610]
Rest in peace.

[02:57:46.750 --> 02:57:47.350]
He also did.

[02:57:47.650 --> 02:57:49.170]
How come all the good people are the dead people?

[02:57:49.410 --> 02:57:50.550]
And the rest of us are still alive.

[02:57:50.690 --> 02:57:50.830]
God.

[02:57:51.850 --> 02:57:52.110]
Say.

[02:57:52.230 --> 02:57:53.210]
Well do something about it, George.

[02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:54.150]
Start with your mama.

[02:57:54.450 --> 02:57:55.550]
Oh, I hex Captain Kangaroo.

[02:57:55.770 --> 02:57:55.950]
Yeah.

[02:57:56.550 --> 02:57:57.130]
Say your mama.

[02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.710]
Me mama.

[02:57:59.010 --> 02:57:59.230]
Oh.

[02:57:59.710 --> 02:58:00.270]
Two mama.

[02:58:00.510 --> 02:58:02.170]
No, she's more powerful than all of us.

[02:58:02.370 --> 02:58:02.950]
I see.

[02:58:04.170 --> 02:58:04.530]
Okay.

[02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:05.030]
Thank you, Mark.

[02:58:05.470 --> 02:58:06.330]
Just a fantastic.

[02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:08.370]
Oh, and he also done Francisco.

[02:58:08.490 --> 02:58:09.110]
Did we put him on there?

[02:58:09.870 --> 02:58:10.070]
No.

[02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:11.070]
But we will.

[02:58:12.870 --> 02:58:15.130]
Because somebody says the one person you forgot we talked about.

[02:58:15.130 --> 02:58:17.410]
It says the old proverb will zoom to the top of your poll.

[02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:19.510]
Those old Hispanics love him.

[02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:20.390]
Says Thai.

[02:58:20.650 --> 02:58:21.190]
One of yours.

[02:58:21.730 --> 02:58:22.470]
What do you mean by that?

[02:58:22.530 --> 02:58:22.910]
Is it you?

[02:58:23.010 --> 02:58:23.210]
Yes.

[02:58:23.430 --> 02:58:23.810]
Don Francisco.

[02:58:23.810 --> 02:58:24.630]
He was Jewish.

[02:58:25.230 --> 02:58:25.590]
He's a Jewish.

[02:58:26.390 --> 02:58:27.130]
He's a Jew.

[02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:28.850]
He's a Chilean.

[02:58:29.090 --> 02:58:30.170]
Now what is this?

[02:58:30.390 --> 02:58:30.830]
Who is this?

[02:58:31.790 --> 02:58:32.470]
Who is this?

[02:58:33.970 --> 02:58:34.910]
Oh, this must be.

[02:58:34.910 --> 02:58:37.110]
Is this a picture of was that?

[02:58:37.170 --> 02:58:37.850]
Is that Skipper Chuck?

[02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:39.250]
I can't even tell who that is.

[02:58:39.330 --> 02:58:39.890]
Somebody who can't even pick up.

[02:58:39.890 --> 02:58:40.370]
Hey, Skipper Chuck.

[02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:41.090]
Who is that?

[02:58:41.270 --> 02:58:41.890]
Captain Kangaroo?

[02:58:42.290 --> 02:58:42.510]
No.

[02:58:42.770 --> 02:58:43.130]
I don't know.

[02:58:43.810 --> 02:58:45.230]
I can't even tell who that is.

[02:58:46.030 --> 02:58:49.190]
It's definitely that talks about Dave Gaming the same but that's not Dave Game.

[02:58:50.210 --> 02:58:51.330]
That must be Skipper Chuck.

[02:58:51.350 --> 02:58:51.970]
He's 90.

[02:58:52.410 --> 02:58:52.970]
Look at that.

[02:58:53.410 --> 02:58:54.670]
He's rinsing out his teeth.

[02:58:55.310 --> 02:58:56.390]
That's a beautiful shot.

[02:58:56.810 --> 02:58:59.970]
He looks a little like Dave Duval, the one a man on CFTO in Toronto but he's not.

[02:59:00.270 --> 02:59:00.610]
He's great.

[02:59:00.730 --> 02:59:01.310]
I love Dave Duval.

[02:59:01.590 --> 02:59:02.250]
You see him?

[02:59:02.330 --> 02:59:02.410]
No.

[02:59:02.410 --> 02:59:02.590]
No.

[02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:03.530]
Of course not.

[02:59:04.090 --> 02:59:08.210]
K.S. says, and Anbyship is the only news acre that ever did every news cast with the giant

[02:59:08.210 --> 02:59:08.970]
water of gum in her mouth.

[02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:10.130]
She had a giant water in her mouth.

[02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:11.190]
What's she to the news?

[02:59:12.110 --> 02:59:13.170]
You know where she's got it now?

[02:59:14.410 --> 02:59:14.830]
Back them.

[02:59:16.130 --> 02:59:17.110]
That's what Dwight told me.

[02:59:17.930 --> 02:59:20.210]
One night they cut back to Anne too quickly after a commercial.

[02:59:20.250 --> 02:59:24.010]
She was looking down at her copy and furiously chewing a huge lot of gum.

[02:59:24.830 --> 02:59:27.790]
Suddenly she looks up completely startled by the fact that she's on the air.

[02:59:28.170 --> 02:59:30.890]
Pushes the water gum into her right cheek and starts her story.

[02:59:32.070 --> 02:59:34.390]
Ever after that I could always tell there was a lot of gum in her cheek.

[02:59:34.390 --> 02:59:36.330]
It really gave her voice that bull'd like he saw.

[02:59:37.370 --> 02:59:39.230]
Maybe it was a chase back or maybe it was a chaw.

[02:59:39.490 --> 02:59:40.610]
Like she needed a lot of help.

[02:59:41.850 --> 02:59:43.170]
I'm on my head long.

[02:59:43.930 --> 02:59:45.410]
This is 420 of ice.

[02:59:46.110 --> 02:59:47.010]
You way out.

[03:00:18.050 --> 03:00:28.470]
You get now that I'm only one big big Taylor Bell.

[03:00:29.470 --> 03:00:31.030]
Don't worry about it.

[03:00:31.310 --> 03:00:33.230]
We got it.

[03:00:33.490 --> 03:00:37.790]
Now we're all pumping and saying we got it.

[03:00:37.790 --> 03:00:41.830]
We're going to take this the more we got it.

[03:00:41.830 --> 03:00:44.650]
Where is my Jesus?

[03:00:47.750 --> 03:00:52.470]
You say 9 or 11 is what they got you to believe.

[03:00:55.690 --> 03:01:01.150]
Can't get any gum or but a own party card to believe.

[03:01:03.630 --> 03:01:08.930]
You believe what they say like a frog.

[03:01:08.930 --> 03:01:11.350]
I'm a fellow fool.

[03:01:12.470 --> 03:01:13.950]
I say you have patience.

[03:01:14.470 --> 03:01:19.690]
The state of the fool is true.

[03:01:21.310 --> 03:01:25.010]
For the election of all we got it.

[03:01:25.550 --> 03:01:27.610]
Push it's got it came.

[03:01:28.170 --> 03:01:29.090]
We got it.

[03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:31.810]
Get them on your knees.

[03:01:32.390 --> 03:01:33.350]
We got it.

[03:01:38.610 --> 03:01:40.170]
We got it.

[03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:45.810]
We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico.

[03:01:46.270 --> 03:01:49.270]
We're going to California and Texas and New York.

[03:01:49.630 --> 03:01:53.250]
We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.

[03:01:54.390 --> 03:01:57.230]
And then we're going to Washington DC to take back the White House.

[03:01:58.250 --> 03:01:59.610]
Bye bye bye.

[03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:02.610]
I'm 566 on MQAM.

[03:02:03.430 --> 03:02:04.290]
Miami for learning.

[03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:04.910]
Yeah!

[03:02:05.430 --> 03:02:05.710]
Yeah!

[03:02:07.810 --> 03:02:08.490]
Absolutely.
