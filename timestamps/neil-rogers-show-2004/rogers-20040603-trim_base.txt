[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.980]
We can't see the R by R, not only with the whole book, which is a long ways away.

[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.760]
This is only the first part of this spring book.

[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.360]
But anyway, I notice, for example, that Big 106, which had taken that precipitous drop,

[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.460]
losing more than 80% of their men from February to March overall, or many team plus.

[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.000]
They actually went back up from a 1.3 to a 3.3.

[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.820]
How do you like that?

[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.720]
And I'm looking at Zeta.

[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.220]
Where the hell is it here? Where's the morning number?

[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.040]
This is a mess. Just like, yes, I'm picking up where I left off yesterday.

[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.020]
I probably shouldn't be doing this.

[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.320]
I can't find it. Where the hell is QA in the morning?

[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.600]
There it is. Yeah. 5.0.

[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.420]
And Zeta actually dropped from a 5.1 in March to a 4.6 in April.

[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.280]
How do you like that?

[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.440]
Oh my god.

[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380]
Wow, and that's when they were still had the poly and run on there.

[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.460]
So you can only imagine what's going to happen with Lexyn Luther.

[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.400]
If it wasn't for that damn, that's an example.

[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.240]
Yeah, right. Well, that's what I'm getting to.

[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.900]
The ethics sampling that goes on in addition to which there's a phenomenon that takes place.

[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.900]
And that's just arbitrage, that's just a sampling.

[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.360]
The fact of the matter is that the Hispanic could be the whole mentality of South Florida,

[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.100]
which is very divisive and very unfortunate.

[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.300]
See, being here at Toronto, which is rated as the most culturally diverse city in the world,

[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.920]
not just in North America, but in the world.

[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.180]
I read it somewhere like in the funny pages. No, it's true.

[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.460]
And we got every kind of people, there's packies and Indians and Chinese and like white people,

[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.540]
a few of them and like, you know, a few shfarchers and lots of faggots.

[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.280]
Junior say I'll be real pleased to see that.

[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.580]
And just every kind of people under the sun.

[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.400]
And yet, in spite of that, no matter where you go, everybody speak in English.

[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.560]
Now, in my funeral, of course, you got the fraud problem.

[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.280]
That's cool then. Who the hell cares about them? That's another story.

[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560]
But here we don't have that.

[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.660]
But in South Florida, you still have this incredible ethnic division that goes on.

[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.140]
And it's not getting better. It's getting worse than I remember years ago,

[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.720]
back during those really ugly days in the early 80s, the emery old boat lift,

[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.000]
and all the real ethnic hate that just spilled over.

[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.540]
Just like all the bodies that were spilling over on the streets because

[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.460]
Castro sent us all of his murderers and rapeants and things like that.

[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.240]
But at any rate, and people saying, well, you just have to be patient, okay?

[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.940]
It's only like 20 years since Castro took power in all these people came.

[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.040]
The assimilation process will happen.

[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.760]
I think they're full of crap.

[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.840]
Yeah, why'd you listen to them?

[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.360]
Because I was stupid.

[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.260]
I could have told you it wasn't going to happen.

[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.880]
Oh, well, why didn't you tell me?

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.820]
No, the assimilation process is happening, but not the way you think.

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.780]
Well, you may have a good point, because here's our new format we're starting on Monday.

[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.280]
Here's a little sample of it if I can find it.

[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.480]
Really?

[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.160]
Can I confirm my record?

[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.220]
That's not it.

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.540]

[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.360]
Gold, gold.

[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260]
The six-month-old World Champion of Badminton.

[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.300]
Gold, gold, in our club.

[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.300]
But, George, just like you were looking for.

[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.480]
I'm Gold, gold.

[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.300]
I heard you were a great player of Badminton.

[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.600]
Yeah, I was just kidding.

[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.680]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.680]

[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.680]

[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.680]

[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.700]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.080]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.080]

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.160]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.200]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.120]

[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.080]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.100]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.300]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.780]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.340]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.820]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.080]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.580]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.380]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.460]

[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.540]

[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.760]

[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.800]
I was just kidding.

[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.000]
I was just kidding.

[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.560]
I was just kidding.

[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.440]
Uh, let's see, we got 29.4%.

[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.380]
Oh, good, man.

[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.880]
Hispanic stations of the total 12-plus.

[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.580]
Hispanic stations of the total 12-plus.

[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.480]
Well, that's a scary number.

[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.500]
Well, that's a scary number.

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.700]
Like I said in that one day part...

[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.700]

[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.160]
Like I said in that one day part...

[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.460]
in morning, was it in mornings...

[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.800]
I don't want to waste a lot of time fumbling

[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.020]
I don't want to waste a lot of time fumbling

[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.740]
through these like I did yesterday.

[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.460]
That was bad.

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.540]
That was that was that was that was that glasses

[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.840]
that was that was that was that was what I was.

[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.280]
That was that was that was that out of another dimension.

[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.020]
That was that out of version.

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.380]
All right.

[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.340]
And stop.

[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.300]
It's at start twenty-rating commercial

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.360]
WXDJ number one, WAQ out radio mom V which had all these old men in this book.

[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.840]
Luckily nobody in the age of 100. CMQ FM is numbered tied for second with them.

[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.300]
QBA is fourth and Aradio Ritmo is fifth so the top five stations in men, 60th NM are all, no speak at English.

[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.460]
Well what kind of communist bunch of crap is that?

[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.620]
How to have not only do you compete with that but what is the excuse for that here in the year 2004 huh?

[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.360]
I think it's time seriously that somebody says look enough it is bull crap already enough of the pandery that gonna happen.

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.100]
Which is why I'm delighted not to be there most of the time because it's a city filled with hate and frustration because people just don't get along.

[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.440]
Unlike what that guy at the airport was trying to mock me a few weeks ago he's full of crap.

[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:33.380]
Now everybody doesn't love everybody else and the ethnic groups don't get along and people continue fleeing like crazy and whether it's to a boca or whether it's this steward or whether it's the Jacksonville or Savannah Georgia.

[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.480]
Where would hella all going because they can't stand it no more.

[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.860]
So here's my poll question today that was quite a long lead in one of them.

[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.280]
That's right. You got four hours.

[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.800]
No yeah no spots.

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.460]
Alright.

[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.260]
Alright going to that QAM sales department man you people are right on top of it boy.

[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.520]
What a bunch of losers we get this great trend that comes out yesterday shows all the way around from the morning the midday in the afternoon

[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.340]
where kick and ask even nighttime we had a really good trend thanks to the marlins and at decay.

[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.500]
But so all the way around we're just kicking ass and we come in for a log like this it's like sticking a pin in a big fat balloon you know what I mean.

[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.520]
I think I've been puncturing a big balloon watching it gasp or right out of it.

[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:22.120]
If there's an assimilation process going on in South Florida why does so many Hispanics still watch read and listen to Spanish media what a long poll question.

[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:34.100]
And I'm sure I don't have all the answers here but the George and I tried to put it together if there's an assimilation process going on in South Florida why does so many Hispanics still watch read and listen to Spanish media we got five choices so far.

[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.140]
There is no assimilation process.

[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:43.140]
I have no clue it's the lazy way to live they like the programming better or it really is a banana republic.

[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.760]
I don't think I know did you refactor this Eric without the additional to yes good good for you because you know he gets a little surly when you don't.

[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.380]
I'm going to do sports radio 5c.

[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.140]
2 a.m.

[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.880]
Only in the banana republic baby only in Miami.

[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:11.860]
Hi Richard Simmons here and since there's been weeks and weeks of publicity about my unfortunate misunderstanding in that airport.

[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:20.840]
I decided to use my status as an exercise guru to launch a brand new home video for all of you fat bastards out there.

[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.820]
It's been slapping to the old age.

[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:37.500]
Oh this is such a fantastic video 3 solid hours of nothing but regular people running around in short short smacking the living heck out of a passer by here's a clip.

[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.280]
Pardon me sir do you know what time it is?

[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.920]
Yeah it's time to slap your face.

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.440]
Just what?

[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.900]
Time to slap your face.

[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.160]
Oh yeah?

[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.160]
Yeah.

[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.700]
Yeah.

[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:53.160]
And that gives me gentlemen if I can interrupt please to the beat it slap and slap and slap and slap.

[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.200]
Oh wait oh you make me so proud.

[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:08.460]
So if you're someone who's uh oh put on a few pounds over the spring and you want to get back your girl's figure why not order my latest over price fitness plan.

[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.580]
Bitch laughing to the old age.

[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.940]
Come on.

[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.540]
That damn fat guy I can't stand him.

[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:23.960]
1045 at 560 we got a few votes 32 votes on the poll it's up on your now neowriers dot com when you finish your scouring Christy at Throwington.

[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.780]
It really is a banana republic 14.

[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.720]
There is no assimilation process 11.

[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.300]
It's the lazy way to live for.

[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.280]
They like the programs more too and I have no clue one.

[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.620]
No clue.

[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:43.200]
In fact maybe the audience has some other suggestions for this poll today or maybe they have some answers is to why maybe the English language program is just so bad.

[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:52.600]
Well I would say you'll be no but I was saying to you one of the reasons that music is so bad on the FM band is there are very few English language stations on FM.

[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.820]
Take a look at it.

[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.480]
Is it a little one but it's the same elsewhere.

[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.300]
What?

[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.680]
What's the clear channel that all the homogenized programming they're talking about it now.

[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:09.260]
Yeah but long before even this was the case before clear channel owned all the stations long before that the music in the market for whatever reason absolutely suck bad programmers whatever the reason is.

[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.760]
Now let's say now power 96 is like you know 50% young Hispanics 50% young blacks and 10 white people I mean that's what that's at.

[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.060]
I'd like to think that's the way it is but embarrassingly what?

[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.540]
Way more anglos than either one of us would want to admit or listen really yeah how sad.

[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:36.540]
At any rate the FM stations that are geared strictly toward the non-ethnic life which is elevator music slush.

[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:48.460]
Love 94 which is jazz crap absolute puke yeah kiss country kiss it's our station don't say too much to crap kiss.

[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:57.680]
It is crap magic which thanks to Bob Hall or whatever the jerk is over to PD is crap all these in which could be good if they had a good PD but they don't.

[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.680]
Why 100 so how many is this now five.

[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.020]
I think that just it's stumbled on another entry for the poll.

[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:12.920]
One sandwich programming blows and Zeta well there's seven or eight but I mean out of all these other there's so many there's about a dozen.

[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.680]
Spanish language and now there's more than that one two three four five six seven eight.

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:25.940]
And it is more than a dozen of 15 that are with this ethnic geared programming so we don't have all of that much choice.

[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:34.260]
At any rate that my point being a radio sucks five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty only AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.320]
WQAM hello yeah the mistake you're making is where the ones that are being assimilated.

[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.700]
Yeah why you you sound like you're speaking English to me.

[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.440]
Yes I got a question for you are you working I go out there today sir.

[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.240]
No actually I might eat some plantino itself.

[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.360]
Oh there you go well you're making a good start that's excellent.

[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.540]
Yeah and I'm gonna write that to that and don't forget to be fry your beans too.

[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.580]
Oh I'm sorry that's wrong.

[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:10.860]
Yeah I'm gonna wreck just thinking about it but the thing I don't say is young Paul and Ron so they actually went down in the radio.

[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.420]
In one demo yeah they went up a little bit in some other place but yeah in a month of April they didn't do all that great on Zeta.

[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.520]
Did you catch you you know I don't want to rehash anything but yes you do.

[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:34.920]
Paulie says because of a bit he used for him that he could own you and I'm thinking to myself this guy you ripped more stuff off of you and he could own you because he could only for what?

[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.540]
Exactly I don't know if some bit you guys used it his.

[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.980]
There's a bit we used that he if you sell it to a comedy service we subscribe to the comedy service that's where that came from.

[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:53.660]
He could own me like he's gonna sue me go right ahead Paulie have a good time okay sweetheart in addition to how many how many times we played that over the last 15 years.

[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.000]
Yeah right these about as funny as some of cancer.

[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.960]
There you go.

[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.600]
Why do they call it instead of big 106 why do you speak 105.9 now?

[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.780]
Call him up an actor okay and find out when you let us call time jiket let him know.

[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.980]
Who was that which one of the trips was that he's a very annoying.

[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.560]
I don't know WQM hello Q.A.M.

[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.780]
No speaking glaze I guess WQM hello.

[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.260]
Hold on.

[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.840]
When is DS?

[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.240]
When ODS.

[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:29.780]
Yes.

[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:29.860]
Yes.

[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.640]
I don't.

[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.380]
There's one point that's also very important the subjects.

[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.900]
You're not going to be talking about child is and you're not going to be talking about what's happening in other countries.

[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.240]
They do talk about them.

[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:43.920]
Yeah.

[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.460]
That's one of the reasons they listen to the Spanish on all those music stations.

[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.060]
No.

[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.220]
On all the top stations.

[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:50.940]
Right.

[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.980]
A lot of them have good ratings.

[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.220]
Yeah.

[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:59.320]
More than good ratings but mostly old demographics like a lot of the OM on B their average listener is death plus 10.

[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:05.580]
Well you'd be surprised if you wouldn't believe how many people after we are and started listening to the Spanish and the young.

[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.240]
Young people are listening to the Spanish language at talk now.

[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:09.920]
Yep.

[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.300]
For what reason?

[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.120]
What's going on in other countries.

[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:22.960]
So the young young Hispanics in South Florida are considered by what's happening in Venezuela and in El Salvador and in whatever.

[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.180]
Absolutely.

[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.680]
A lot of those countries are about to have a revolution.

[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.380]
Are they really?

[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.020]
Yeah.

[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:29.740]
Okay.

[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.100]
Well let us know when they start the industrial revolution.

[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.740]
That's a great thing.

[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.100]
560560.

[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.200]
Found 560 on the AT&T and Verizon.

[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.140]
Well guess here we better have a lot more Chinese stations here right?

[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:44.680]
Yeah.

[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.940]
Man oh man.

[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.880]
To me it's just I just don't buy that.

[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.320]
I mean maybe I'm maybe I'm way out of touch what I know.

[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.060]
It's not my crowd.

[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.360]
But I just don't mind.

[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.100]
What's out of the alien I have to do with that?

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.400]
Is he saying that we alienated the from?

[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.820]
I don't make any apologies because what we said in the show was my opinion.

[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:05.980]

[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.900]
And I stand by it and turned out to be right.

[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:08.720]
Yeah.

[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.960]
It was a child custody case in the local media irresponsibly.

[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.400]
People like Rick Sanchez and Elian Rodriguez and lots of others.

[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.240]
And of course on the Spanish language talk stations whipped everybody up into a frenzy

[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.440]
which doesn't take out of a lot in South Florida and it turned into just a hate fest over nothing.

[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.700]
Over absolutely nothing.

[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.620]
Oh that's a dinner.

[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.600]
We know all of us all the we know basher's and then the fisherman and all of a sudden a bullcrap.

[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.860]
It was just it was tragic.

[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:35.660]
It was pathetic.

[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.000]
It was the epitome of what South Florida has become.

[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.300]
Okay.

[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.800]
A festival of ethnic case.

[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.920]
That's really where it's at.

[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.420]
But that has nothing to do with the ratings.

[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.100]
The alien thing was going on before and it's going on now that it's all over with.

[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:46.540]
Yeah.

[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.360]
But I think his point being that it polarized the listeners that much more.

[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:57.880]
And I'm sure that's true to some extent because our Spanish language, our Hispanic listenership is dropped way down.

[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.620]
And you know what?

[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.360]
I don't really care.

[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.920]
I'm not going to pander to anybody.

[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.260]
Hispanics, anglos, jews, goyami.

[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.020]
I don't really care.

[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.720]
They don't pay me to do that.

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.240]
They pay me to get my opinions and entertain and do whatever the hell I do.

[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.480]
And that's what I'm going to do.

[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.600]
And if we have to say, oh poor Elianito and do ya buelas and all of a sudden a bullcrap.

[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.000]
Who gives a flying crab man?

[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.300]
All the stuff that's going on in the world.

[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.760]
It's just like I was talking about the Jews with Israel.

[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.580]
It's the same thing.

[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.700]
I don't give a flying crab about Israel.

[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.800]
I couldn't care less.

[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.600]
Oh, but it's the only democracy.

[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.100]
Well, good for them, okay?

[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.740]
Hey, no more.

[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.840]
I racked out to them.

[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.720]
Well, whatever the hell yeah.

[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.440]
Now we got the new democracy and I racked out about that.

[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:35.920]
That's right.

[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.860]
And what about Afghans?

[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.820]
Well, we forgot about them.

[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60, Audi AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.620]
And let's just hope Elian's getting his three squares today and Mrs. is happy meal for a much better long life.

[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.320]
At least now he's living with us a little bit of freedom.

[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.460]
Somebody QA, hello?

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.320]
Hey, wanting to go?

[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:02.840]
I think simply the reason is I think you might have it on your post or guess I'm already it, but because they don't understand it.

[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.920]
I mean, I have this lady at my job who says that she would like to listen to some of Spanish radio, but she just can't really understand what she says.

[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.360]
She understands like every third word.

[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.600]
She can't, she doesn't get it.

[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:18.200]
And he enjoys that a long time ago that Spanish culture like three decades behind as far as comedy is concerned.

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.220]
Yeah.

[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.060]
So they'll do it slapstick.

[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.500]
Yeah, but see that.

[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.960]
That thing is just because they don't, so that's a good approach of guessing it.

[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.220]
They simply don't understand it.

[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.320]
So you don't get it?

[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.640]
No, they don't understand it.

[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.340]
They don't comprehend it.

[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:29.880]
Okay.

[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:30.480]
Thank you.

[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.240]
Thank you.

[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.740]
Do you get it?

[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:33.940]
I didn't understand a word.

[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:34.600]
I'm either.

[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:53.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0

[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.760]
Yeah, 30 more.

[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.360]
I think you're off because consider the fact that some of us have resorted to listening to NPR.

[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:06.580]
Yeah, tell you what, if I could understand another language enough to listen to any other programming,

[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.760]
I would look for any other programming than what's on English language radio.

[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.640]
Yeah, but you wouldn't be interested.

[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.660]
I mean, you speak in a Spanish, although I've discovered not as much as we think.

[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.900]
But you could be listening to those stations, but you're not interested in what they're talking about,

[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.160]
right, nor the music, nor anything, but, right?

[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.500]
But if they had a Portuguese station that played decent music, I'd listen to it.

[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.340]
Chinese, you bangy anything.

[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.960]
What did you say after Chinese?

[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.100]
I said, yeah, I'm grateful now.

[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.200]
It's a country.

[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.520]
Well, this is anyway, this really is a bit out of republic.

[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.820]
You're right, that's the answer they like.

[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.120]
36, and that's probably right.

[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.480]
That was my vote out of 89.

[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.520]
It is, but whatever.

[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.480]
There is no assimilation process.

[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.060]
29.

[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.540]
It's the lazy way to live.

[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:48.760]
11.

[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.920]
I have no clue, seven, and they like the programs more.

[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:52.300]
Six.

[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.920]
Speak in English, baby.

[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.780]
Speak in English.

[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.480]
That's my comment by long distance.

[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.540]
Speak in English.

[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:58.160]
No.

[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.200]
If all these people from all over the world here can be speak in English, hey, without their

[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.360]
heavy action, believe you me, plenty of them got a heavy action, and don't bother me.

[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.620]
At least they're, and it's one of the reasons the people are getting along so well.

[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.120]
Everybody gets along.

[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.220]
There's no ethnic war going on here in Toronto.

[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.420]
Everybody is a friendly.

[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.060]
They get along, no matter what.

[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.340]
Oh, that'll never fly down here.

[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.680]
No, well, of course, then, it'll be a lot more boring, right?

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.340]
We don't want that.

[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.280]
What do we do if we can't hate?

[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.000]
WQA, and hello.

[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.100]
Neil.

[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.360]
Man, it's good to talk to you.

[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:27.600]
Listen.

[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.120]
I like the program that you banged you station.

[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.040]
Anyway, I bet you would.

[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.420]
I hear Britney is going to be the PD.

[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:38.900]
I'm sorry.

[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.760]
The PD, the pivot DJ.

[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:41.720]
Anyway, go ahead.

[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.380]
Okay.

[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:50.200]
I'm seriously, I like to be like a manager, go over to Cuba and get, alien, bring them back

[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.540]
over here and market him into a messiah.

[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.120]
I'm coming off.

[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.980]
He could be Dolly Lama, Jr.

[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:56.800]
Yeah, I could do.

[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.500]
Imagine coming off the airplane and shroud and all the people standing around the money you

[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.800]
can make, marketing him if you can get them.

[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.380]
Yes, I can't imagine that very easily.

[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:06.580]
Right.

[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960]
You can do that.

[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.340]
Oh, man, it would be cool.

[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.880]
Anyways, your station signal really stopped turning on beach the last year.

[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:14.820]
Yeah.

[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.780]
Well, I have Josh Beckett go out and pee on the tower if he has any left over after he

[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.760]
feels his washing his hands.

[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:20.740]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800]
The fee in the yield line.

[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:22.860]
Thanks for the bad news.

[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.240]
Tell me you're making that up.

[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600]
I'm not making it up.

[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.240]
Ask Mo when you see him tomorrow morning.

[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:27.780]
He'll tell you.

[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.440]
He'll give it the load on.

[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:30.960]
He will.

[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.200]
Ask Yaldi.

[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.520]
Yaldi's probably more up your alley.

[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:36.880]
Ask him about it.

[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.840]
I tell you right now Josh is just holding back.

[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:40.680]
He knows the real story.

[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.080]
He's read the face for some reason.

[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:42.760]
Why is that?

[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.680]
Because he knows the story.

[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.800]
He's probably seen him do it.

[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.540]
See, I would care about this whole assimilation thing.

[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.660]
He's probably been in the locker room there when Josh Beckett was peeing on his hands.

[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.960]
I witnessed a golden shower.

[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.400]
Like I said, I sure enjoyed having a beast on the show yesterday.

[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.020]
I am lost.

[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.060]
It's just sports when you fight.

[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.940]
You weigh out.

[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.480]
But I'm in the corner.

[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.500]
We are a unit that cares.

[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.580]
And I'm saying care.

[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.720]
The reason why I say care because it's so hard to let things go when you care about

[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:17.940]
it.

[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.500]
When you care about it.

[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.140]
I would say love and then everyone say that you're a faggot.

[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:23.800]
Well, man.

[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.220]
I have no idea.

[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.860]
Absolutely.

[00:20:47.860 --> 00:21:00.500]
I'm going to play in the mud.

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.600]
We'll pack the beans and add a lot of us.

[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.340]
Just go away.

[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.440]
We're all fed up.

[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.160]
I don't know.

[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.660]
I don't know.

[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.060]
I don't know.

[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.580]
I don't know.

[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.100]
I don't know.

[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:16.100]

[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:16.820]
I don't know.

[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:16.820]

[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.160]
I don't know.

[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:17.820]
I don't know.

[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:17.840]
I don't know.

[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.080]
I don't know.

[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.620]
I don't want to go back.

[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]
I like dropping for three toys better.

[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.940]
I don't know.

[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.020]
You've got your Pokemon T-shirt.

[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.860]
And you're making us ears.

[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.300]
You've had your fun.

[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.320]
I'll start packing.

[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.520]
So they can get you out of here.

[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.180]
It's at the point where we can stand it.

[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.120]
Everybody's hiding up.

[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.320]
Above all the hooligans and crackers.

[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.640]
We put our guns on and off.

[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.180]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, young gun down this.

[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.060]
Why don't you go home?

[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.140]
I don't know.

[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.820]
I'm here, they're young gun down this.

[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.160]
Go home and leave us alone.

[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.580]
They're giving away free as in age green cards.

[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.000]
Can I have one?

[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.120]
Get over it already.

[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.420]
Okay, get over it.

[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:33.880]
What do you say?

[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.080]
Oh, Jesus, God.

[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.680]
128 votes.

[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.080]
If there is an assimilation process going on in South Florida,

[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.720]
why does so many Hispanics all watch, read, and listen to,

[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.860]
Spanish media.

[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.440]
It really isn't banana Republic 49.

[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.560]
There is no assimilation process, 45.

[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.560]
It's the lazy way to live 18.

[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.220]
I have no clue eight.

[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.740]
And they like the programs more eight out of 128.

[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.040]
Ain't so great.

[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.100]
Here's a fact that says,

[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.000]
be going to mean so great.

[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.320]
Paul and young Ron suck.

[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.500]
Well, that's interesting.

[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.720]
Maybe you're going to tell Junior Say all about it.

[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.900]
Says, what are their comedy bits include the trivia game

[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.720]
with questions that no one can answer for months?

[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.160]
Oh, that is so entertaining.

[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.740]
It says, let's play, let's ask the same stupid question every day.

[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.160]
I could own him, you know what?

[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.900]
You talk about a guy who lives in a fantasy world, man.

[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.280]
Paul, you are just a tragic.

[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.600]
You know, I was talking to him just the other day at the Eaton Center.

[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:26.320]
Yeah.

[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.740]
I ran into him after lunch.

[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.260]
I was eating.

[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.980]
And he was telling you that he could own you?

[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.200]
And he was saying, I could own you if you don't stop playing at Bill and Ted's comedy adventure.

[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.620]
Or maybe it was the one with the semi smith or whatever.

[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.220]
No, no.

[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.060]
How much could he own you for?

[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.040]
As a matter of fact, if my memory is correct, I think he sent us that.

[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.440]
Did the semi smith and everything that we play of his were sent to us?

[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.360]
They were sent to us or the Bill and Ted, I think, was part of a more of the comedy services.

[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.160]
But whatever they were given to us, okay?

[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.960]
So if you don't want us to play them anymore, just notify us by mail.

[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.660]
It will be delighted not to play them no more since we have about even with all the FCC restrictions,

[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.100]
about 85,000 bits that we can still play.

[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.160]
And at the time that it was sent to us, it was with the strong encouragement.

[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.220]
Please, please, please play this.

[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:03.540]
I'm so proud of you.

[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.560]
Right. Since we have an audience and they didn't at the time.

[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.860]
And quite frankly, of course, these trends didn't have all that much when they loved to say to either.

[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:14.420]
I mean, for our morning, for the Mojo shows to be going up from a 370 to a 5 in men in a morning,

[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.860]
many 18 plus, and Zeta drops from a 510 to a 460.

[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.980]
See, they went from a 360 to previous month up to a 510 when Stern first went off.

[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.300]
And then people sampled it for a while and said, eh, 410 to a 460.

[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:26.980]
See what I'm saying?

[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:27.920]
What are you saying?

[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:33.180]
After they heard that trivia bit for the 455th time, and they started hearing my material and your material and fills material.

[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.220]
And are you sure?

[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:34.480]
Yeah.

[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:35.540]
And immaterial.

[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:36.420]
Right.

[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.040]
And they said, boy, this is really marginal at best.

[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.260]
But I'm glad to see that the castor of the cell has this obsession with me.

[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:44.940]
Just obsessed.

[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.220]
This is the thing when I write my memoirs in about five minutes.

[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.780]
There are over the years there have been.

[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.420]
All of these people are just, and I don't enjoy it.

[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.180]
To me, it's nauseating.

[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.800]
Get a life, all right?

[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.500]
I have no life.

[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:57.920]
God.

[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.040]
Obsessed with the erogies for whatever the reason being.

[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:01.900]
Like Joey Reynolds.

[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:03.920]
Yeah.

[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.580]
Who's that jerk that used to be on with Tanner that we had on IOD?

[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.740]
The gym really?

[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:09.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.900]
What's up with that old Catholic, I see.

[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.500]
Yeah.

[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.600]
Obsessed.

[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:13.820]
Really?

[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.520]
Who was some of the other one?

[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.560]
Mr. Eagle, of course.

[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.040]
His whole life became the anti-neil.

[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.100]
He abandoned his Judaism and became a born again Christian.

[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.260]
He abandoned his liberalism.

[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.640]
He became a right wing fanatic, a homophob.

[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.140]
Anything that Neil was about, he became the opposite.

[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.880]
And by the way, I'd like to congratulate Mr. Rico.

[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.840]
I was just going to ask you how well that was born.

[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.980]
Oh, ask me how his numbers were, man.

[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.580]
They were just absolutely unbelievable.

[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.840]
How were his numbers?

[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.560]
Just tell me what your problem is.

[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.840]
No, why should I charge Steve Ocas?

[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.560]
I know you people on that station can't afford to subscribe to Arbitron,

[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.840]
so you can't really see the numbers.

[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.780]
Well, I'll tell you your number right now, okay?

[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.140]
And men.

[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.020]
Many team plus, six to ten A.

[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.400]
And that includes even old cockers, man up to the end of 400.

[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.760]
Six to ten A.M., which last time I checked was his show.

[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.860]
And I think the station I believe is WNMA correct me if I'm wrong.

[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.180]
In the month of April, in the last trend, they had a point.

[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:10.440]

[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:10.580]
Oh!

[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.460]
Now, amazingly, in March, they actually had a two share,

[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.720]
which was an aberration because prior to that, they had a point, one to point four.

[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.500]
And back in December of last year, they matched this month, April's with a point.

[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:23.920]
Oh!

[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.720]
So most of the time they have a point, which I just like doing that point.

[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:29.700]
Zero.

[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.540]
Zero, zip it, e-duda.

[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.120]
Remember the day that we took that poll and they tried to load it up with all that baloney about talk show host?

[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:41.020]
And we just dumped them off of there because the small handful of mispits of nerds that he's got,

[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.000]
listening over there, it's just the same bunch of the chronics.

[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.700]
It's the old, they need the chronic tonic is what they need.

[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.720]
But they're good luck to them, okay?

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.440]
Him and his 85 adopted children.

[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.500]
Hope they have a wonderful life.

[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.900]
56670560.560 on the ATT and Verizon wireless line.

[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.220]
WQAM, hello.

[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.760]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:00.360]
Pretty good.

[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:05.540]
I was going to talk about the assimilation thing with some of the English language newscasters.

[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:14.940]
Just drives me crazy whenever somebody is Spanish and is subject to a story how their name gets pronounced

[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.960]
is if they were in downtown Madrid or downtown Savannah.

[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.240]
You mean like...

[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.520]
Yeah, something like that as opposed to a Chinese guy or a Russian guy,

[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.280]
they're only making attempt at the pronunciation.

[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.620]
But I got a suggestion for a poll.

[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:31.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.040]

[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:38.380]
Since Channel 10 got rid of Frank Ford after 100 years and 6 got rid of Weaver after 1000 years,

[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:43.140]
maybe you could do a poll over what anchors, the personalities that you get rid of.

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.680]
By here, Kristy Krug, or one more time with the anti-flearing or throat, I think you're going to go crazy.

[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.880]
I think that sounds like tomorrow's poll to me.

[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.580]
Alrighty.

[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.700]
Thanks a lot, Pally.

[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.320]
Have a great day.

[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.360]
See how fast that was?

[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.820]
We were desperate for a good poll.

[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.700]
That is a good poll.

[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.960]
Now, what software to TV personality needs to be deep 6 immediately?

[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.720]
Now, we know who's going to win that.

[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.580]
Hands down.

[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.080]
Maybe you think we got to exclude him?

[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.160]
Now, let's put him on there.

[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.980]
I think Belkis will give him a run for his money.

[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.320]
Belkis will be able to give him a run?

[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.660]
Well, we'll see.

[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.440]
We'll find out tomorrow.

[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.440]
That's the magnificent poll for tomorrow.

[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.560]
For tomorrow, not for today.

[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.080]
Why the hell can't find that thing?

[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.660]
I already have a homosexual relationship with Nihil, so I might as well have one with you too.

[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.320]
Let's see.

[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.820]
Earl says they don't have to assimilate as long as they stay in Miami.

[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.340]
A worker of the lady who's been in the US for 9 years doesn't speak English.

[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.840]
For a reason, for not speaking English is.

[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.780]
She lives in Miami and says she doesn't need to.

[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:34.820]
Well, La Rida.

[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.860]
And Tio, honey.

[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.120]
Let's see.

[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.920]
Los Borgos says he will be assimilated in San Foda.

[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.920]
Resistante is futile.

[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.840]
Resistance is futile.

[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:46.500]
That's cute.

[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.700]
But nevertheless, it doesn't happen.

[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.580]
It's never going to happen.

[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.040]
It's just something I'm pondering.

[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.920]
Because every time these numbers come out, you look at these stations that more and more stations

[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.820]
are audio to hitmo.

[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.820]
And all these stations that a lot of us never even heard of before.

[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.620]
And I can remember when I first came to South Florida and on the AM band course,

[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.780]
having grown up up north and going to school in the Midwest, the Michigan State.

[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.660]
And all the AM stations at night, you'd hear a WMBC from New York, and WI-Less from Chicago,

[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.980]
and KMOX from St. Louis.

[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.400]
And all these big 50,000 stations.

[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.560]
And of course, in South Florida, because of geographic location, and because of the fact that it's so flat.

[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.200]
You don't, unless it's a very, very exceptional light.

[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.040]
You didn't take those stations up on your AM radio.

[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.740]
And of course, back when I first came to town, it was before FM was really doing much of anything.

[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.400]
All you would hear was a cacophony of no-spegate in glaze.

[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:41.020]
All the stations coming in from Cuba and from Mexico and Caracas and the Bonair,

[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.240]
and all this other crap, you know, Mexican radio.

[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.280]
Yeah, this should do.

[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.080]
Ask who was it? Who was it that used to work somebody with us, used to work at EXTRA,

[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.620]
was it in my four-connization?

[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.460]
Yeah, EXTRA. It's like San Diego and in the street, being in Mexico. Somebody worked out there.

[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.740]
Anyway, it was Miss Tanner. I don't know. I don't think so.

[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.200]
They don't like his kind of Mexico.

[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.800]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.860]
And Verizon live.

[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.680]
I can say nothing.

[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.380]
Here's line 9. QAM, hello.

[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:11.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.640]
Okay, I can say party problem. We had a problem with arbitrarmy.

[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.800]
We were trying to get this when they called us for the diaries.

[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:17.420]
Yeah.

[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.580]
And I was trying to explain to them they wanted to humane the household.

[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.820]
I was trying to explain to them my significant other's status.

[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.240]
And they were like, hey, and we finally worked through that.

[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.740]
Then we got into ethnicity when I said Chinese.

[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.060]
First, there was anything she wanted to know was the Hispanic.

[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.300]
They wanted to know what?

[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.960]
Ethnicity. I tried to say Chinese. Well, is he Hispanic? No.

[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:45.160]
Well, so it is, you know, they she wanted to they wanted more Hispanic.

[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.260]
And when I tried to mention Chinese, because you know, I thought I would be clearly

[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.240]
you know, it might be another demographic that you guys use.

[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.300]
And I was trying to say Chinese. And she was like, it she totally was lost.

[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.300]
So you're right. A big.

[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:00.660]
I'm lost.

[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.440]
Thanks for the bad news, man.

[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.680]
I tell you right now, my psychic powers again, who is I just talking about Miss Tanner?

[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.400]
Yeah.

[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.840]
That's the Chigurina one pile right there. Is that bitch?

[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.080]
This big campaign. Oh, you don't have enough representation of the Spanish language radio stage.

[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:22.640]
In the meantime, I say that those of us who work for the English speaking stations for whom he is a consultant paid very handsomely, I believe.

[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.720]
We had to sue his silly a pear-shaped ass.

[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.580]
Is what we ought to do.

[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.540]
You know, that you mentioned it sounds like a lawsuit to me, Duff.

[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.700]
It is pretty pear-shaped.

[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.260]
Yeah. And his ass too.

[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:43.740]
This business. Oh, they're under sample. I mean, you know, how I see he represents a consultant for this for this chain of Spanish language radio stations all over the country.

[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.580]
And that's fine. You know, more power to them.

[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.380]
All the staggets got to stick together. That's what the junior sail told me.

[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:51.980]
Gay.

[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.560]
Yeah. I got news for it. They got touchy feelin' J. Feeler going to be their quarterback.

[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:04.200]
They could be like, no, seriously, two and 14 this year. I don't want to get the Dolphin fans really nervous, especially after my payfits won the Super Bowl second time.

[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.780]
Nobody remembers that there was a game.

[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:13.920]
There was a very exciting game, probably the most exciting Super Bowl in history, but nobody remembers that because all I remember is the big flap, yeah.

[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:19.560]
Which has been shown 80 trillion times. What a bunch of hypocrites you people are, man. You can't show it enough.

[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:26.760]
And if you could, if you thought you could get away with showing it without the, the little gray out there on the booby, you would be doin' that every 15 minutes.

[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:36.460]
If Michael Power had all of a sudden some kind of a, some kind of a religious experience and anti-religious experience and called up all the networks and see it in right now and said,

[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:44.000]
oh, guess what? We decided you can show it all you want. We've been too repressive. Let's try to make up for lost time. You'd be seeing it. How many times a minute?

[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.040]
About 30 minutes.

[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.780]
Yeah. As Justin was whipping that thing off of her boob.

[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.280]
Man, talk about one good boob deserves another one. Good God. Yeah, it was a great game.

[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.160]
Payfits won by the way they pulled it out. Good old Tom Brady. Pulled it out. Can I say that?

[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:00.800]
No.

[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:09.180]

We have an elevator that goes up to the suite and an elevator that goes down to the street.

[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:32.540]
It's over. Don't you think it's over? Who chose this stupid concept and the money somewhere disappeared between the hand and the ass?

[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:45.460]
You're fine up to the suite down to the street. Good luck you're fine.

[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:53.020]
I think your concept is total. At this stage of your job interview I am not impressed.

[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.020]
You're fine.

[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.640]
You're fine.

[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.700]
You're fine.

[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.440]
You're fine.

[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:40.020]
Good down you're fine.

[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.300]
I feel like every time I read the result like we're leaving something out.

[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:23.900]
Your suggestion was a good one. What was that? The English language programming sucks and people are turning to anything else.

[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:35.340]
I like the programming better. It's a weak choice.

[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.520]
It's a weak choice.

[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.920]
They like the program more.

[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.700]
It's not even written the way that I gave it to you but that's okay.

[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.260]
The time it got the Eric probably something lost in the translation.

[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.480]
They like the programming better. What do you got here? They like the programs more.

[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:36.720]

[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:47.240]
If there is a simulation process going on in South Florida, why do so many Hispanics still watch, read and listen to Spanish media?

[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:51.560]
That's our poll question today because we think it's got an embarrassing too when you come right down to it.

[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.600]
It's one of the real major black marks on the faces of Florida.

[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.840]
It's one of the things that keeps us from being all together.

[00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.640]
You know, like one big happy family?

[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.520]
Oh, together what?

[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.440]
Pathetic, embarrassing.

[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.540]
There is no assimilation.

[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.200]
I'll read the result of the poll, I guess.

[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.860]
I don't have to read this from this page.

[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.800]
It really is a banana republic, 136.

[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.980]
There is no assimilation process, 103.

[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.920]
It's the lazy way to live, 46.

[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:19.640]
We never did put theirselfish Christians to busy doing a beast routine today.

[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.120]
He's gone.

[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.620]
What do you mean he left?

[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.480]
They did a switch of ruins.

[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.060]
Who's in there now?

[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.380]
Miguel.

[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:25.900]
Hola.

[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.280]
And why is that?

[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.940]
He said they had to put a professional spik in there now?

[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.400]
That's right, Joshua, since it's spiky enough.

[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.480]
What's that all about?

[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.080]
There's no baseball game in town today?

[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.900]
No, I said I had to go do that yellow pages thing.

[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:39.180]
What?

[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.280]
That van hit you were reading earlier?

[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:46.460]
Oh my, you know, something this really, we're going to have an explosion on air right now.

[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.360]
You know, this reminds me of starting to turn it like Mo Jr.

[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:50.920]
Absolutely.

[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.960]
See, I have, I hate to agree with Mo on anything,

[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.740]
but this marks twice in the same week.

[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:56.520]
Oh.

[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:02.480]
The idea that we have a producer in there who's generally, he works for us when they don't have him doing something else.

[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.440]
Like we always come second, duff and clearance.

[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.100]
Like we're like small potatoes.

[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.540]
Again in this trend, who's got the highest ratings on a radio station?

[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:10.740]
Yeah.

[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.400]
Who's got the highest radio stations at almost every damn trend for the last 70 years?

[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:14.680]
Yeah.

[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.900]
But we get whatever is like a left end.

[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:17.760]
I'm not knocking Miguel.

[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.100]
We're delighted to have the professional spik Miguel who fits right in with his conversation.

[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.560]
And who by the way does it at wrong?

[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:22.720]
What?

[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.680]
It's not like that.

[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.040]
It's because Miguel wanted very, very much to work with you.

[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.240]
That's why he sent Josh out on the radio station.

[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.220]
Get out of here.

[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:28.840]
You're so close to that.

[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.740]
I can just get out of here too.

[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.080]
All right.

[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.160]
Go join him over there.

[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:33.680]
What are you talking about?

[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.740]
Somebody had to go out there.

[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:36.480]
Right.

[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.560]
And you want to go?

[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:39.700]
Why not?

[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:41.740]
It's hot out there.

[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:42.640]
And he wanted it.

[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.200]
It's hot out there, man.

[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.080]
Well, this is an outside thing.

[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.740]
Yeah.

[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.060]
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.720]
Anyway, join QA and then Josh Cortis.

[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.860]
And the real yellow pages from Bell Sound from noon to one of the beauty schools of America,

[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.580]
1176.

[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.480]
South was 67th Avenue, Miami.

[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.400]
Stop by to pick up tickets to pick up tickets.

[01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.740]
Do not coming Marlon's home game.

[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.540]
That's what you wrote.

[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.440]
So stop by to pick up tickets to pick up tickets.

[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.320]
Yeah.

[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:06.980]
Pick something up.

[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.780]
And then we got a good doctor for you.

[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.200]
And then join QA and then Marlon's for a watch party.

[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.720]
In fact, if you watch too closely, you might need the same doctor starting at six o'clock tonight at the Davey

[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.860]
House of 595 in university.

[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.300]
Stop by to win more of those Marlon tickets for it.

[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.580]
It's starting to get like the Panther tickets off a lot of them available these days.

[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.020]
And other prizes from Billy the Marlon and the Mermaids.

[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.700]
Watch the Marlon's and the Met's from the Davey House right on the old tube.

[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.460]
And when you watch it on TV, then you won't have to listen to Dave Van Boring.

[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:36.460]
So you can see that now and not have to fear that Josh will get all nervous about it.

[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.940]
He probably gets read face when he's sitting there with Van Boring up in a booth, you know.

[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.180]
Because I ripped Van Boring just.

[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.520]
And deservedly so.

[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.460]
Davey just terminally.

[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.340]
Maybe in a nice guy.

[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.480]
Everybody says he's a really nice guy and got a hot wife.

[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.380]
But a bad hair piece and just is crappy on ear boring.

[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.840]
I think it's time to send him up up and Oive.

[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.240]
Anyway, did I give the results of the poll?

[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:56.820]
I guess I did.

[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.860]
Yeah, so we're going to change the poll at noon.

[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.920]
And I'm going to do the what the guy called it before.

[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:04.940]
I'm not going to use that for tomorrow.

[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:06.600]
That's a cop-out. So you would do that.

[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.320]
Yeah, but not lazy.

[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:09.140]
Right.

[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.320]
And deservedly so with what they're paying you, I can understand it.

[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.500]
What sound Florida TV personnel needs to return next?

[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.100]
That's the poll question is going to go up there.

[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.340]
No, I didn't.

[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.320]
Oh, a fact that Eric was he and I were on the outs.

[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.000]
He doesn't know yet.

[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.740]
I said that.

[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.520]
I had a few names.

[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:24.400]
What?

[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.020]
I'll fax it up right out a couple of minutes.

[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:26.340]
Okay.

[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.460]
Well, I mean, he needs to know it because at noon we're going to change it.

[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.300]
If he doesn't have it, he can't change it right away.

[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.600]
And he's certainly not going to be able to type it up like when you snap your finger.

[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.100]
Especially if you only snap one, you can't hear it.

[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.320]
What sound Florida TV personnel needs to retire next?

[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.100]
And we got I put wrist sanchez at the top because I have very little doubt.

[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.860]
Now you're going to put spielkeys in a ray.

[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:48.460]
Somebody you'd like to get off the air.

[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:48.980]
They use it.

[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:49.740]
Angel array.

[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:51.600]
Angel array.

[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.020]
I'll give you another one.

[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.620]
Who's done faxed it.

[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.060]
All right.

[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.280]
Well, no, I mean, Angel can put it on there.

[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.460]
If he's going to come in and if he's going to sit on his ass in there, he can do that.

[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.740]
Are you going to do the same thing with him that you did with the beast yesterday?

[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.180]
Yeah, I'll send back.

[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.500]
Stick up for all the lazy people in there that don't want to do anything.

[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:10.040]
It's a club.

[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:13.360]
Oh, the beast have to put on that headset and answer a few calls.

[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.420]
My God.

[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.340]
No wonder mode expires him like boy.

[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.960]
Of course, mode expires everybody like boys, but that's beside the point.

[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.140]
You want me to screen some calls for you?

[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:21.760]
No.

[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:22.340]
Okay.

[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.480]
No, I want you to type some of these names in here that they're going to call in with.

[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:27.580]
Okay.

[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:29.460]
Angel array.

[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.540]
And my other choice in here is Elliott Rodriguez.

[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.680]
Boy, oh boy.

[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:37.680]
If you pardon the name association, he just you talk about professional Cuban man.

[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:44.020]
This guy back during the days of the alien business and then that one we had the thing with the Michael road of vote up.

[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.160]
I'm sure it didn't quite make it.

[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.920]
You know, with the illegal aliens, he was just hyperventilating on here.

[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.680]
I thought he was going to have a stroke right on the air.

[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:55.360]
You're supposed to be there reporting the news, not letting your ethnic hysteria intervene.

[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.480]
Okay, but you can't do that.

[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.160]
Can you, Elliott?

[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:57.640]
How?

[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.100]
No.

[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.320]
God is you awful.

[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.500]
Do they have anybody on there whose name doesn't end in a Z besides Bob Soeper?

[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.080]
No.

[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.500]
And then of course don't forget the weather for me.

[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:10.680]
Now, how come you just fact me this pool?

[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:11.720]
I don't know how you'd be.

[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:12.340]
Oh, buddy.

[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:12.720]
You are.

[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.980]
You are just not on, on what?

[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:16.460]
Into it.

[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.400]
So we'll wrap up this other thing and give me just an ad Elliott out here.

[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:22.740]
Elliott Rodriguez.

[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.140]
Good.

[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.600]
And the facts are off the air so that he can have it by noon and plenty of time.

[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.680]
Because otherwise, you know, we don't want a lot of pressure on him.

[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.380]
My first, how do you spell Rodriguez?

[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.080]
ELL IoT.

[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.680]
He isn't stored, Elliott, the jockey of the triple crown winner,

[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.140]
Smarty Pants Jones, who's going to win by about 15 lengths on Saturday.

[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.300]
Okay, I'm factored by T.O.

[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.560]
Now, I can't wait for it.

[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:42.940]
It's going to be a Saturday.

[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.820]
Dave Johnson will be called 11 o'clock tomorrow morning.

[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.400]
So I guess Dave and I are two for two.

[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:52.520]
I guess I didn't take a genius to figure out the Derby and the pre-knist winner.

[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.560]
Two for two.

[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:57.100]
But I did give you that big triple and nobody called and said,

[01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:01.320]
Hey, I listened to you on that imperialism in Derby and used him on the bottom.

[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.540]
That's what Dave said.

[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.720]
He said he used him on the bottom.

[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.100]
Here's line nine.

[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:07.820]
QAM, hello.

[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.040]
Yeah, I got a topic for the poll.

[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.020]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.400]
How about what thing could you have to take to the deserted island

[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.600]
if you had one thing to take?

[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.300]
What would it be?

[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:20.860]
That's not bad.

[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:24.640]
Now, I kind of weak, but I was the guy who factored in Jamie Lee Curtis yesterday.

[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.860]
I see she got 20 votes.

[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:26.940]
Yes, she did good.

[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.120]
A lot of people will assure you're a love for dikes.

[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.420]
I mean, for a butcher-laden woman.

[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.060]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.960]
They've got nothing to thank you about true romance.

[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.180]
Let me ask you, what would you take to a desert island?

[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.540]
Jamie Lee Curtis.

[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.220]
Okay, see ya.

[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.960]
Oh, I don't want to say I've said, but I think that's the word.

[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:44.720]
He likes Jamie Lee.

[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.060]
She's, I don't know.

[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.440]
She never still afraid, right?

[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.180]
She's okay.

[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.740]
I like her.

[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.220]
In other words, I see her in a movie.

[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.240]
I think, oh, I might watch this.

[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:56.540]
Like that Halloween part 85, whichever one it was.

[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.140]
Where Josh Hartner was in the first movie I've ever seen.

[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.720]
And I told you, this kid's going to be a star.

[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.220]
And you said, ah, you just like him because he's another pretty boy.

[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.560]
And then when he became a star, he, uh, no longer was a pretty boy no more.

[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:07.500]
He's something to happen to him.

[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.580]
He aged about 80 years and about 10 minutes.

[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.620]
No, sorry.

[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.500]
And I didn't see any of those movies.

[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.000]
He was in Black Hawk Down, right?

[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.200]
Yeah, I never saw it.

[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.240]
And then there was the big, right?

[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.480]
What was the big movie he was in?

[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.200]
Pearl Harbor.

[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:21.480]
Pearl.

[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.900]
Are you mumbling now?

[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:23.880]
Pearl Harbor.

[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:24.680]
Very good.

[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.620]
Pearl Harbor in the Black Hawk Down.

[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:29.840]
Josh Hartner.

[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:31.140]
He should have been on it list yesterday.

[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.000]
Ever since somebody out there is fantasizing about him and about that mole.

[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.940]
In fact, I think the remember the mole they took off of Frank Ford on Channel 10 before they fired his ass.

[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.240]
I think Josh Hartner took it.

[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.420]
Five said, Greg has been asking, where the hell is that mole?

[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.320]
Where is that mole?

[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.460]
I think it's on Frank's forehead.

[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.200]
Or I, I, I, I, I said you might find it in somebody's.

[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:49.360]
Frank.

[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.020]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:52.280]
Down there.

[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.000]
Yes, sir.

[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.240]
Yeah, I got two people on your poll.

[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.560]
I don't know if you put them on there yet.

[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.000]
Bob Weaver's in Channel 4.

[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.980]
Bob Weaver's already been retired, unvoluntarily.

[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.180]
He's already in the absentia.

[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.400]
What about Bob Mayer?

[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.080]
Okay, little Bob Mayer.

[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.620]
Well, I have to give the phone books back.

[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:10.080]
Thanks, pal.

[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.420]
Little Bob Mayer.

[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.180]
Not a good guy.

[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.520]
Isn't it nice that, you know, the way they treat people in the software, a mic, a reneering.

[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.620]
There's a good guy, Western Peace.

[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:19.520]
WIWD was on here.

[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.680]
How many years on IOD?

[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.180]
100 years.

[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.460]
They never let him even say goodbye.

[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.880]
They just, unceremoniously swept his ass out the door.

[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.820]
But they, he had the last laugh on them, though.

[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.760]
Because he had just, they just signed into a new deal.

[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.440]
I don't understand any of these things.

[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.700]
I don't understand any of this.

[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.560]
It's like the Panthers.

[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.020]
They signed a new three-year contract with the Rick Dudley.

[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.240]
And then they fire his ass.

[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.760]
And then now they're going to have to be paying him.

[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:46.820]
And all of these other people, I think they're paying a subterred, a dween subterred.

[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.680]
They're paying all these people that are working for the organization.

[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.980]
How can they afford to pay Rimmer all the big bucks if they're going to have to pay those people?

[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.880]
And no, I haven't heard a word from Rimmer.

[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.640]
He's really laying low on break, quiet.

[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:56.340]
Thank the Lord.

[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:56.960]
Knock on wood.

[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.000]
Because then I'll be asking about those rumors about him going to Columbus.

[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:01.400]
That people were starting, right?

[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.000]
And so if we don't speak, then he can't tell me.

[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.460]
I think that I can repeat it on the years, see?

[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.180]
I say.

[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.900]
Well, we don't want to jeopardize.

[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.260]
Because, you know, then I'll be getting phone calls for people.

[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.140]
I got enough people already telling me a song.

[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.300]
It's song to dance about, well, you know, their contract came to an ending.

[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.520]
Do I have an extra 75 grand stuff like that?

[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.400]
I'm sorry.

[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.540]
I just can't be the Godfather of the entire universe.

[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.080]
You know what I mean?

[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:23.820]
What do you mean?

[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.440]
I mean, it's one thing to be fat, but it's the other thing to be rich.

[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.760]
I am the local office of the 65 city.

[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.920]
The radio's on your phone.

[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.440]
Q&A.

[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.520]
This mark, Morgan, is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.120]
We are a unit that cares.

[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.220]
And I'm saying care.

[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:48.640]
The reason why I say care, because it's so hard to let things go when you care about it.

[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:49.500]
Absolutely.

[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.120]
When you care about it.

[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.680]
I would say love and then everyone say that you're a failure.

[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:54.440]
Well, I'm not.

[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:59.780]
On the next episode of the show, Gildy Young's Dean Stars as Vic Mackie.

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.240]
I've got nothing to say to you, Matt.

[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.720]
You're a bad man.

[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.900]
A very bad man.

[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.980]
I'm gonna bring your face on the stove here.

[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:12.800]
Attention, Matt.

[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.740]
When Gildy faces off with Captain Mo.

[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.680]
I-I don't think I saw a view doing the guy here.

[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.200]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.840]
And I want to keep it on the rat, see?

[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:23.400]
Okay.

[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.120]
I don't want nobody knowing what went on there.

[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.100]
It could be my career.

[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.380]
Your sacred is sacred, see.

[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:28.820]
Good.

[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:29.460]
I got it.

[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.300]
Hey, everybody.

[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.840]
Captain Mo put the mo in promo.

[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.820]
That damn fact, I can't stand it.

[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.520]
Okay, 12 o'clock at 5.60 WQAM, where I'll smit cannon at first pool.

[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:51.160]
Here's the result of it.

[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.460]
And again, we apologize for asking the-

[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.020]
Usually the pool is worded pretty well, even when we understand it.

[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.120]
So if there's an assimilation process in going on,

[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.760]
now what inspired me to take this poll?

[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.180]
That's right.

[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:02.480]
The ratings that came out yesterday.

[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.800]
It just continues to get more and more notes beginning in English.

[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.820]
And those stations continue zooming up more and more.

[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.900]
And maybe he's right.

[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.000]
The very first call we had about this, that Julio Guy.

[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.420]
When he said that a lot of the Spanish-speaking people are concerned about stuff that's happening in South America,

[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:22.520]
and Central America, and Spanish-speaking countries, and Espanya, and all of these things.

[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.680]
And as a result, I don't hear about that on the English language stations.

[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:27.060]
And that's what they're interested in.

[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.200]
Do you think there's any point there at all?

[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.600]
There may be a little point.

[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.800]
A little tiny tad.

[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.120]
Now McGurll on the other hand doesn't listen to those stations.

[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.340]
He listens to Big 106.

[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.440]
It's 1059.

[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:40.280]
Sir.

[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.020]
Well, I'm just going to say 1059.

[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.580]
So we can monitor Paul and Ron so that when they own me, he'll find out exactly which parts.

[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.620]
Who gets to cellulate?

[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:52.540]
Fat rich.

[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.700]
That's all I got for him.

[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.000]
Oh, somebody says Tony Segredo.

[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.060]
That's an excellent choice.

[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.620]
Man, what a silly goose that is.

[01:11:58.820 --> 01:11:59.340]
Oh, brother.

[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:02.820]
I mean, Tony, and not only that, but what an ego.

[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.640]
What a massive gigantic ego.

[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.860]
I remember back when Tony was a humble little sports nerd guy many years ago.

[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.000]
I know he and Hank are really tight, but.

[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.800]
And as a matter of fact, I had a hand-hank on the air on my show when I was on I&Z one time.

[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:16.700]
Talking about horse racing.

[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.500]
And one of the horses that was running at that time was a little tiny horse called Creme Fresh.

[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:23.500]
Creme Fresh.

[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:24.760]
Okay.

[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:28.700]
And I remember I said it just like I said at the first time there kind of like Van Diesel.

[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.940]
Only I was joking yesterday and you got all psychotic.

[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.820]
And I said Creme Fresh.

[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.720]
Or so I said a little bit off, you know.

[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.200]
And they kind of like looked at each other like, oh my god.

[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:37.760]
He doesn't know.

[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.640]
And it asked from my horses at, you know.

[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.360]
And I looked at Hank and I said speaking of horses at.

[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.160]
And that was in the days.

[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.340]
And I actually, Hank and I got along well in those days.

[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.600]
Then we had a little of fallin' out.

[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.020]
And now we're pretty tight.

[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.200]
Although I don't see him anymore.

[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.840]
And you know why he avoids me when I'm in town.

[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.260]
He used to come in early.

[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.720]
Every time I'd be in town for a week, he'd come in early.

[01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:00.640]
And we'd bond a little bit and you know, grip a mow and ask behind his back.

[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.480]
But because then I'll see how what a giant he is in the industry.

[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:05.420]
You know what I mean?

[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.560]
It pains me to see it.

[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.760]
I mean it beats me like that.

[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:10.800]
It doesn't bother me at least.

[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:11.480]
And the least.

[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.180]
The bothers me.

[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.160]
Well, bothers you because you like him.

[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.860]
With me, I just, I don't know.

[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.300]
I tolerate him.

[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.860]
That's a bit, not on the show anymore though.

[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:19.460]
You're done, Beast.

[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.040]
You've finished.

[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:20.600]
Adios.

[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:21.580]
Arirvindarch.

[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:22.460]
Duy.

[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.140]
Anyway, here's the poll.

[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.080]
If there's an assimilation process going on inside the floor, why does somebody in Spanish

[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.600]
still watch read, listen to Spanish media?

[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.480]
This really is a banana republic.

[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:31.420]
148.

[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:32.640]
No shmit.

[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.820]
There is no assimilation process.

[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:35.640]
124.

[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:38.700]
Well, by the time you get that with those two, you already got 75%.

[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.720]
It's a lazy way to live.

[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.320]
53.

[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.800]
I have no clue.

[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:43.420]
21.

[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.860]
Or they like the programs.

[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:45.920]
More 17.

[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:46.940]
More better.

[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:48.680]
Out of 363 votes.

[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:50.540]
They didn't like the poll.

[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:52.260]
And I didn't like it either.

[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.280]
Tony Cigreto is a good one for this other poll though.

[01:13:55.260 --> 01:14:00.580]
Along with Rick Sanchez, Angela Ray, Spielke's Norey, Elliot Rodriguez.

[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.020]
Who else did you put on there?

[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:03.820]
Bob Mayor.

[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:04.840]
Poor little Bob Mayor.

[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.220]
Leave Bob alone.

[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.260]
I mean, he's on the poll, but leave poor little by.

[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.060]
He's a good guy.

[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.760]
Okay, so he's 110 years old.

[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.960]
And they now have not only have to set him up on four phone books so they can get his head over the top of the counter on the set.

[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.480]
But they also have to have a place to hang his bag, okay, which is a little bit, you know, unseemly.

[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:24.940]
But he's a good guy.

[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.280]
And Bob, we were a great guy.

[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.560]
And the good news is though, you'll be pleased to know this.

[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:29.840]
I think it was in jikers.

[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.280]
Well, I don't know where I read it.

[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.840]
But we were still getting paid.

[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:36.940]
Wait a minute.

[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:37.340]
Wait a minute.

[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.580]
There's a channel set up right now.

[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.480]
I don't know what you care about it.

[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:42.020]
I would say love and then everyone say that you're a failure.

[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:42.780]
Well, I'm not.

[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:43.940]
Chelsea Bowman.

[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.320]
We just need to know.

[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.200]
In and nothing.

[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:50.580]
Just checking.

[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.880]
Bob, we were still getting paid.

[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:57.820]
Well, that's good.

[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:58.500]
That's good.

[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:58.920]
That is good.

[01:14:59.040 --> 01:14:59.720]
We're happy about that.

[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:05.340]
In fact, if he can not have to work and get paid, although again, after all of those years they sent him out to pasture.

[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.080]
I don't understand what's wrong with you.

[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:08.620]
Grey Rowers.

[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:09.580]
I know the business sucks.

[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:14.820]
I know it's just the most heartless, cool obnoxious money, grub and grab, especially this place.

[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:16.420]
It's like that emerald coast spot.

[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:21.060]
I know that there's some new stuff in there that we had in the last piece of copy.

[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:24.380]
And there was some other problems with that copy that said this is the last weekend for something.

[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.460]
And the spot was supposed to run for three weeks.

[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.360]
Well, how's that possible?

[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.460]
So I had him to fast me a new piece of copy.

[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.980]
But they don't put the new stuff in there.

[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.600]
See, this is the way it is now with these word processors.

[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.540]
They take and change a line.

[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.060]
And then they just print out the rest of whatever was there before.

[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:41.660]
You know, they shan that they do with that?

[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:41.920]
Sure.

[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.860]
And we just don't care.

[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.280]
And it saddens me because we're here to do a job for people.

[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.600]
I don't just mean, not to say that gratuitously.

[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.600]
But if somebody's going to spend their money and support your show, they expect you to do a job for them.

[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:01.040]
Not just a piece of, see, with our sales department, it's just a piece of paper with words on it.

[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.180]
That's all it is.

[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.480]
Just like Gary Sarner would at first, the Vroom TV copy that we got from that agency is,

[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:09.040]
that was an humiliation that they got horrendous.

[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.900]
I can't describe what a piece of crap that was.

[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.280]
Hey, they're bitter about that piece of paper with words on it.

[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:15.700]
What does that mean?

[01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.860]
That's more worth than they ought to be doing as far as they're saying.

[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.860]
Well, who's thinking bad?

[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:19.260]
Okay.

[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.400]
You're about to lazy order, write in order.

[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.100]
Anybody can do that.

[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.200]
They're just order takers.

[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:29.740]
Just like Todd Dreck back there, with his own in-house boiler room that is back going back there.

[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.380]
And then they drive him over to Naples to honor him as the topsof.

[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.740]
Oh, brother, topsof sales guy in the outfit.

[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.840]
Brother, you people in the Beasley organization, man, you don't know which side is up.

[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.720]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.080]
Anyway, that takes care of the first floor.

[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.780]
I'm getting off on that sales department again.

[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.000]
I don't want to do it because I do it all the time and they're not going to change.

[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.760]
It's like the thing with that pole I just took.

[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.720]
It's never going to change.

[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:54.400]
You can scream about it and yell and carry on like crazy and then they're going to change.

[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.280]
Jeff says, I've got a few pole suggestions.

[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:01.360]
He came up with these on 5.95.

[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.000]
What makes, uh, his innerly pointed back?

[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.020]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:07.960]
Tag number.

[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:08.960]
Wow.

[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.120]
What specialty tags got the most self-centered drivers?

[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:12.780]
I like that.

[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.400]
Those so-called vanity plates.

[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.400]
Why do we have those?

[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:18.320]
The same thing that it.

[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.060]
Now, but why?

[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.040]
Why do we allow that?

[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:24.580]
I know why we have to want to support light because Jeff Bush wants to be the...

[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.440]
He wants to be the preacher of the state, not the governor.

[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.760]
That's an extra revenue stream, the vanity plates.

[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:30.840]
Oh, I see a revenue stream.

[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.660]
Is that the same stream that's going on Josh Beckett's hands?

[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:41.060]
Let's see if he's got a fish which bumper sticker or add on accessory makes you avoid or a vehicle at all cost.

[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.800]
Yeah, the ones that have the little animal on the back whether it's a dog or a cat with the little moving head, you know what he is.

[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.860]
I avoid them. I get... I pull off the road.

[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.540]
That's nothing.

[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.640]
You see the rear window full of stuffed animals that you can see through it?

[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:53.980]

[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.040]
Which is by the way highly illegal, highly against the law.

[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.160]
It's the law, okay?

[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.180]
I better redo that.

[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:04.520]
I don't like the way I bleep that.

[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:09.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a gate TNT and Verizon wireless line.

[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:13.340]
What's off-road a TV person who needs to retire next?

[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.780]
I haven't voted yet, so I have no idea.

[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:17.980]
But I'm sure Rick Sanchez, nobody can touch Rick.

[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:18.740]
Let's see.

[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.100]
Cast my vote and just by magic.

[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.700]
Like I said, cast my vote. Rick Sanchez 19.

[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:30.000]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, out of the first 29.

[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:36.520]
Angela Ray III, Tony Siger-Wet-02, Spooky's Narei-2, Elliott Rodriguez got a pair and won for poor little Bob Mayor.

[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.500]
Hey, listen, I guarantee you Bob's got the same deal that we've regard if they'll pay him not to work.

[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:41.980]
I'm sure he'll take that right now.

[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:47.180]
But why wouldn't they like... not only let weaver stay good vibe, but why wouldn't they honor him?

[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.020]
Why wouldn't they have like a special... you know what I'm saying?

[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.040]
Because they're bastards like the Rennary thing they were talking about.

[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.500]
Yeah, because you people in this business, Bob Green, there's a real good one for you.

[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.080]
A real hot one. Oh yeah, I'll take Harry George.

[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.060]
I'll take Harry George.

[01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:58.820]
Yeah, you sure did.

[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.280]
Lier, little liar, little phony, little twerp.

[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:04.780]
Who now you can?

[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.280]
Mustacheo geek.

[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:15.320]
And how long did he and our good friend Cheryl know that they were dumping IOD, that Cox broadcasting was selling it to Paxen, but didn't tell us about it.

[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.280]
Oh, here, now this is cute.

[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.340]
There's one that says Dwight Lauderdale must die, so the others may live.

[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.500]
But that was how you're really feeling. Dwight Lauderdale.

[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.060]
Yeah, he just ate the same anymore since he can't talk about eating on a year, you know.

[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:32.460]
Chitlins.

[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.400]
Now since he shaved off the mustache, it's kind of like that Hercules thing in our Samson.

[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.160]
Samson, yeah.

[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.640]
Like I said, David Samson.

[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.800]
In fact, I knew there was something wrong when I was in town.

[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.740]
I turned on Channel 10 news and there's Dwight without the mustache.

[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:53.580]
This is a while back and he looks in the camera and says, we did it.

[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:54.640]
I knew there was something wrong.

[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:01.100]
56070560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon line WQA and hello.

[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:02.000]
Hello.

[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:02.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.840]
Yeah, I got a suggestion for retirement.

[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:06.940]
Go right ahead.

[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.380]
I'm listening to you.

[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.380]
I'm sorry.

[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.300]
Michelle Gillin.

[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.380]
That's a fine choice.

[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.560]
She should have been gone a long time ago.

[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.840]
Her and I hate to say it, but she should have been there with ambitious.

[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.060]
Okay, that's bad.

[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.080]
That's really bad.

[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.400]
Sandy's jealous about that.

[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.380]
Although I can see maybe Michelle doing a documentary about ambitious body.

[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:36.120]
What?

[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:37.900]
No, Anne's body disappeared.

[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.400]
We're not really sure whether Sandy have scented with it or was Dwight.

[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.180]
I'm not really sure.

[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.020]
Oh, get on the story.

[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:42.480]
See what you did.

[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.180]
Michelle Gillin, see, this is part of the deal that always happens in software and that is

[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:50.300]
that the rejects the people who make it to the big time and there for about five minutes.

[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.000]
Like Mr. Ego.

[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:54.900]
Remember he was on WABC in New York for about how many minutes?

[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.000]
About 30 minutes.

[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:56.700]
That was the end of that.

[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.660]
In fact, that happened while we were at IOD.

[01:20:58.700 --> 01:20:59.160]
You were there.

[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.400]
Mr. Ego.

[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:07.180]
Mr. Kane goes to New York to the big time to WABC and he was there for like about, I don't know,

[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:07.980]
five and a half hours.

[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.980]
That was big news at the station, if I recall.

[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.740]
And then of course they had to bring in Stan Major.

[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:20.160]
Now let me ask you, Milky Way, lighter dark.

[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.120]
Dark, always dark.

[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.020]
Anybody by a new watch lately?

[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:24.660]
Good watch?

[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:25.760]
Matter of fact.

[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:32.940]
For Stan, man, Stan is on the talk show Death Watch for us speaking of watch.

[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:33.560]
At any rate.

[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.520]
Well, he sure died in IOD out there then.

[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:40.860]
So Mr. Ego went to New York for about two minutes and came back sucking around for a job.

[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.780]
I don't know if I'm a light bulb for quite a while.

[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.960]
And then we had the Angela Ray went off to New York for about seven or eight minutes.

[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.240]
And they lacked her ass right back to town.

[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.620]
And the same with Michelle Gillan.

[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.940]
Who NBC had a dump off somewhere after that embarrassing grotesque investigative report about.

[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.000]
The Chevy trucks wasn't at it or was it Ford?

[01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:58.760]
I forget what it was.

[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:01.720]
But whatever was it was totally bogus and was butchered and botched.

[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.660]
And they got their ass sued and she just screwed up big, big time.

[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:06.020]
Michelle Gillan.

[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:13.060]
And then she came back as the brutalist investigative reporter who was going to undo and expose all the ills of society and yadda yadda yadda.

[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.800]
She's another fag hag by the way, you know?

[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:16.120]
No, I had no idea.

[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:19.840]
Or you didn't know that she was real tight with Alice Rantell back in the day.

[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.520]
She's a real fag hag, Michelle.

[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:24.340]
And anyway.

[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.320]
How should I get a few votes?

[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.900]
Elliot Rodriguez must go now.

[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:30.260]
Yeah, bye bye, Elliot.

[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.860]
Get to see Elliot on all right.

[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.720]
We'll go pack you a one of the median O.C.

[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:35.820]
Get out of here.

[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.700]
Man, he is nauseating.

[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.420]
Just dripping with it.

[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:40.840]
You know what I mean?

[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.960]
No, with what?

[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:45.840]
Ask Josh Beckett.

[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.820]
12 minutes past noon.

[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.020]
Oh, I speak of that during the QM in the real yellow pages.

[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.780]
From Bell South today, now until 1 o'clock.

[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.860]
I want Josh to get some people to come out there.

[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.780]
The beauty schools of America at 1176,

[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:02.680]
Southwest, 67th Avenue, and Miami,

[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:04.340]
stop by to pick up tickets to pick up tickets,

[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.860]
throughout County Marlins home game with Josh Cordes.

[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:09.500]
And maybe Josh Cordes will be peeing on his hands out there.

[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.020]
Because his name is Josh too, huh?

[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:12.620]
We're just Josh.

[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.500]
They were talking about that.

[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.540]
I'll hear this one.

[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.100]
You guys show you how desperate they are.

[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.560]
Nobody wants to talk about that.

[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.740]
Marlins now because they went on the road and they lost three in the road of the reds.

[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:27.060]
They got swept so they're off that bandwagon real fast for the time being.

[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.340]
Even though they're still in first place by two games,

[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.480]
they're like 7 over 500.

[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:31.640]
Nobody cares about that.

[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.560]
Nobody certainly wants to talk about the Panthers or the Santa Cup finals.

[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.320]
Game numbers five tonight in Tampa.

[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.260]
Anybody care about that?

[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.220]
No, in fact, nobody anywhere cares about that.

[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.940]
Worst series, the worst finals since last year.

[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:44.800]
Just terrible.

[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:45.860]
Just awful.

[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.120]
Colma inducing.

[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:48.820]
Calgary, my ass.

I would love to keep you all to myself.

[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:01.540]
Coming, this Christmas from bogus industries.

[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.760]
It's the I can drive like Rick Sanchez board game.

[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.400]
It's a real life action adventure game that uses the streets of South Florida as a game board.

[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:15.560]
Start begins at Concession Stand A of Joe Robby Stadium.

[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.760]
Where each contestant has to drink himself to oblivion,

[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:24.380]
where it gets the highest blood alcohol level first, goes on to level number two.

[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.080]
They run down the pedestrian and the hall has honed section of the game.

[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.440]
This leaves your game police bubble,

[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.680]
and these programs come up with a difference used to go home and get his license.

[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:40.980]
There is off to the final leg of the board game, higher in a turn.

[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:45.020]
Go to court and whoever gets off with the easiest sentence wins.

[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:48.620]
It's ours, your Bones for the Horn Bound.

[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:52.220]
The I can drive like Rick Sanchez board game.

[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:53.440]
It's a real life action.

[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.300]
Thanks, Polly Boy.

[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:59.360]
It's a 12-17. He's getting a lot of air here today, you know what?

[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.780]
And he can use all the help he can.

[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.580]
Paul Castronov, a Paul little run around big 105.9 in the morning.

[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.780]
Well, it's pretty weak.

[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.340]
Now what's now that we got McGell,

[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.460]
he can tell us all about Lexin Luther and the Terry.

[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:12.600]
Right?

[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.180]
Well, you're supposed to be our in-house monitor.

[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:16.700]
You monitor all these other morning shows.

[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.340]
Yes, I do.

[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:19.360]
And have you heard Lexin Luther and Terry?

[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.260]
Can't take it anymore.

[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:21.920]
Oh, that good, huh?

[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:22.580]
Yeah.

[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.700]
Red Necky Advice Show is the only thing that I've gotten on it so far.

[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.880]
Just a cramp.

[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.460]
Yeah, who's that?

[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.160]
So in other words, the people who are not intellectual enough to listen to Ron and Ron,

[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.900]
these are the people who listen to Lexin Luther and Terry.

[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.220]
This is a good one for the Paul.

[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:43.600]
I say, I say these with a lot of sadness because they're people on his pole I like.

[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:45.100]
And here's one of them.

[01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.020]
Kelly, I'm not Sally Struthers Craig.

[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:47.840]
It's a somewhere.

[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.620]
Oh, it's bad.

[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:50.380]
That's good.

[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:51.760]
Come on, Kelly.

[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:52.740]
Loose announcer too.

[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:53.500]
Would you please, sweetheart?

[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:54.740]
We'd like to keep you around for a while.

[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.540]
She had the kid there a while about how many years ago?

[01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:58.460]
About third, man.

[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:01.660]
And after a while, that stopped thinking, go to excuse anymore, you know?

[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:06.000]
Who might have talked, but she just ballooned up and she just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.400]
Well, she's got to explode right there on your screen.

[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.600]
I remember the day we used to say she was high.

[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.080]
Yeah, I mean, she's a great person.

[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:14.780]
I mean, we love Kelly.

[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.740]
She's one of the few people in the media actually likes us.

[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.180]
Don't you know what I guess?

[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:19.660]
Huh?

[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.060]
Oh, yeah, she does.

[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:21.900]
Don't say that.

[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:24.780]
She knows she's got mirrors in the house.

[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:25.780]
Are you sure?

[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.140]
She ain't no Bella LaGosie.

[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.440]
She's got a mirror to her house.

[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:29.000]
She's seen.

[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.280]
But yeah, she became a monster in the industry.

[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.640]
That's really kind of a sad thing.

[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:34.720]
Kelly Craig.

[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.720]
And Bob Meer, I like a lot.

[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.540]
Bob's a good guy.

[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:38.600]
Make no mistake about it.

[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:39.600]
So he's too fit on.

[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:40.860]
In fact, he looks up to you, George.

[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.760]
What's out for the TV personnel needs to retire next?

[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:49.480]
Rick Sanchez, 47 out of our first 81 votes.

[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:55.260]
Tony cigarette, 09, Spooky's Narein 9, Angela Ray 6.

[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.380]
See, the only problem with this poll is it's kind of like self-limiting, isn't it?

[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.420]
I mean, how many people we got?

[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.980]
How many people are on TV and self-floor?

[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:02.880]
About third, man.

[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.560]
I don't know, but we'll have them all on before 12.

[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:08.940]
Well, Kelly Craig wants me to extend the best thanks to, even though he's not with us anymore, Dave Game.

[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:12.500]
Because the people out of GoTon buy like extra big TV sets when Dave was on here.

[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.160]
Now they can watch and enjoy Kelly Craig.

[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:15.780]
That's bad.

[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.460]
Remember Dave Game?

[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:18.760]
Sure, what happened to him?

[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:19.880]
Exploded.

[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.580]
Angela Ray 6, Elliott Rodriguez, 3.

[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:25.460]
He is...

[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:25.800]
Oh, good.

[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.220]
Man.

[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.800]
I'll tell you they got a good news anchor on Channel 4.

[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.240]
What's his name?

[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:30.900]
They got the glasses?

[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:32.920]
Mm-hmm.

[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:34.480]
What's his name?

[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:34.800]
Nobody knows?

[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.780]
I don't know these people's names.

[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.220]
I know. See, that's the sad part of it is.

[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:40.180]
Nobody knows.

[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.480]
And Steve War was good.

[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:42.140]
Is he still there?

[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.120]
Is he the one they replaced?

[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.240]
Why bother learning their names?

[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.640]
They're going to be gone in five minutes.

[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:48.120]
Just read the news.

[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:48.600]
I don't care.

[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:48.860]
Okay, yeah.

[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:52.720]
Michelle Gillens got three Dwight Waterdale 2, Bob Mayor 2, and Killer Craig don't have any.

[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.360]
But, I mean, we used to have people that you knew their names.

[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:56.500]
See, this is the difference.

[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.940]
This is what else has happened to the median South Florida.

[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.020]
I mean, how many news anchors besides silly Tony Cigarweta and Dwight Waterdale who've been there for a long time?

[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:07.980]
But other than that, how many do you really know who, like you said, what their names are?

[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.360]
The weather people.

[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.960]
Now, I'm down there last time and I'm looking on the weather and who are these people?

[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:17.800]
Where does Miss Norcross get all these little fruit cakes he runs around finding, huh?

[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.020]
Well, I can't imagine.

[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:21.480]
I ain't saying that.

[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:22.540]
Duff will tell you.

[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.580]
But, I mean, where the hell are they finding these people?

[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.480]
We used to have, and then John Hammbrick was great.

[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.780]
He was too good for the market, though.

[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.440]
Too good for Channel 6, which is now Channel 4, I don't know whatever it was.

[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:34.840]
John Hammbrick was great.

[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:38.300]
And isn't his kid now doing us some stuff on one of the on 4 or 6?

[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:39.860]
I don't know.

[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:40.460]
He is.

[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:41.940]
Something, Hammbrick.

[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:42.400]
I don't know.

[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:43.400]
Handball and handball.

[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.420]
How many, how many, Ralph Renek?

[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:49.660]
Mm-hmm.

[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.320]
Oh, back now.

[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:51.980]
Yeah.

[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.720]
Well, I'm a serious, but I mean, all the years that I've been there, used to know these people

[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:56.720]
were meant something.

[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.680]
They were said, they had Jim Brosmer.

[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.300]
You don't remember Jim Brosmer?

[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:00.780]
Yeah, I do.

[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:01.720]
I was a little kid down here.

[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:02.040]
Right.

[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:03.180]
Jim Brosmer was good.

[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:04.940]
And then he got screwed over too.

[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.220]
Del Frank.

[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:08.180]
Remember Del Frank?

[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.620]
No, I remember Del Shannon.

[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:12.620]
Del Frank was great newsman.

[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.940]
He worked in Washington, DC.

[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:18.260]
He came down like a lot of other people, like semi-retire, and he went on Channel 4, like

[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.460]
the same time Renek was there.

[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:22.980]
That was some news back when 4 was 6 or 6 was whatever it was.

[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:27.560]
We had some news people, even big, bold, like he and Bishop, man.

[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:29.640]
She didn't take any crap from anybody.

[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:31.540]
And Bishop, you know, the whole deal with her.

[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:33.080]
She did people know who she was.

[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.060]
Now you got that cross-eyed, what's her name on there?

[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:38.380]
On Channel 10.

[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.120]
Kelly Kruger.

[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.500]
Looks a little like Freddie Kruger.

[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.120]
And that's her and Christy Kruger, I'm sorry.

[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.840]
A cross-eyed one.

[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.560]
Did you ever see her and Freddie Kruger together?

[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:48.400]
Oh, same person.

[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:50.680]
Cross-eyed bitch.

[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.400]
W.A.C.A.M. Hello.

[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:53.820]
Hey, man.

[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:56.040]
Tell Neil that Rob Hanmer-Hans.

[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.380]
Is that the guy on the floor?

[01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:59.020]
Oh, Hanmer-Hans.

[01:30:59.380 --> 01:30:59.960]
Yeah, he's pretty good.

[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:02.320]
Yeah, that's the guy on Rob Hanmer-Hans.

[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:03.780]
That's him on Channel 4 now.

[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:04.540]
Yeah, he's okay.

[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:06.700]
But he was on Channel 7, you know.

[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:07.180]
Wait, what?

[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.160]
Yeah, that guy was on Channel 7.

[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:11.440]
Well, I never watched Channel 7, so I never known.

[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:12.180]
Thanks a lot, Kelly.

[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.380]
Rob Hanmer-Hans.

[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.760]
Don't put him on the list.

[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.060]
I mean, we're just, you know, we're just emoting

[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.400]
about the various people around here.

[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.420]
And I think he's good.

[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.820]
He's a good anchor. Steve Orr was good.

[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.660]
I think he's gone.

[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:27.180]
And then the awful people, the embarrassing people,

[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.140]
they just keep coming back like a bad penny, like Angela Ray.

[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:30.760]
Yeah.

[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:31.740]
Wow.

[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.700]
I think people just die in a terrible crash.

[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:38.600]
I mean, Angela, who the hell are you kidding, honey?

[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.480]
And how the hell did you get that job in New York?

[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.720]
Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, shabits.

[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.660]
President Bush has consulted an outside lawyer in case he needs

[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:50.060]
to retain him in a grand jury investigation of who leaked the name

[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.280]
of a covert CI operative last year.

[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:54.460]
Valerie Plame.

[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.220]
There's no indication that Bush is a target of the leak investigation,

[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:01.340]
but the president decided that in the event of AIDS

[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:03.060]
and attorneys' advice, he would retain him.

[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.220]
White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said,

[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.320]
Joseph Wilson, Valerie Plame's husband,

[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:13.960]
charges that Plame's cover was blown as payback for his challenge

[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.040]
to President Bush's claim in last year's state of the union

[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.480]
addressed that Saddam Hussein was actively shopping for uranium

[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.580]
to build a unabomba.

[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.800]
Saddam Hussein has been trying to buy uranium for Africa,

[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.280]
Mr. Bush said in the January 28, 2003 address

[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.960]
where he lied through his teeth and has a lot of practice.

[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.200]
Wilson has pointed fingers to the vice president's office,

[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.320]
and the president's political director, Carl Rove,

[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.480]
in his recent book, claiming Rove told a reporter

[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.120]
that Wilson's wife is fair game.

[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.640]
The Justice Department assigned a special team

[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.120]
as investigators to the case last fall, demanded thousands

[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.000]
of emails, other correspondence from the White House,

[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.280]
and as either interviewed or brought before the grand jury,

[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.540]
several high-ranking officials, Cheney done it.

[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.680]
If it's anything bad, Cheney done it.

[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:51.840]
If it's Chalabi, just remember the CH factor, okay?

[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:53.340]
Chalabi, Cheney.

[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:53.860]
Okay.

[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:54.520]
Anything with the CH?

[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:56.440]
Got it?

[01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:56.980]
All right.

[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:57.840]
John Deleton.

[01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.120]
Exactly.

[01:32:59.480 --> 01:32:59.860]
Same difference.

[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.600]
566-00560, China, pound 560 on the AT&T

[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:05.640]
and Verizon Wireless Live.

[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:09.320]
What South Florida TV need a person out needs to retire next?

[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:11.740]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:12.600]
Hey, Neil.

[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:13.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:15.120]
I got a person for your fall.

[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:15.660]
Yes?

[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.180]
Alicia, Lane, in child 6.

[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:19.640]
Alicia?

[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.160]
Lane.

[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:21.880]
Lane?

[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.080]
Never heard of her.

[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:23.940]
What does she do?

[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.520]
She's a news reporter.

[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:30.520]
I don't know.

[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:41.320]
I don't know.

[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.500]
I don't know.

[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.000]
I don't know.

[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.120]
I don't know.

[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:50.120]

[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:50.120]

[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:50.120]

[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:50.580]
I don't know.

[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:51.340]
I don't know.

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.340]

[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:51.440]
I don't know.

[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:51.440]

[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.440]
I don't know.

[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:52.620]
I don't know.

[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.060]
I don't know.

[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.400]
I don't know.

[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:54.420]
I don't know.

[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:54.800]
I don't know.

[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.500]
I don't know.

[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:10.780]
I'm going to jump to grappling right on top of that block.

[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:10.780]

[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:15.500]
IGM Turn on.

[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:25.480]
Hey, don't run.

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:25.480]

[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.320]
As many as you want to make.

[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:27.740]
Three.

[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:33.380]
Rick Sanchez, man, look at that.

[01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:34.760]
Boy, they, Rick, they hate you.

[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.280]
Even Greg B. Del ever got the kind of hate that they have for you.

[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.460]
How's Greg B. Del doing, by the way?

[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.180]
Is he still around? How's he doing? What?

[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.260]
Life. I don't know.

[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.440]
What sound flowed a TV person now needs to retire?

[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.800]
Next retire, Rick! Retire!

[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.840]
104 votes and Rick Sanchez has 62 of them.

[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.960]
He's got 60% of all the votes. That's staggering.

[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.080]
But I predicted it.

[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.200]
Tony Cigarette, oh, cookies in a ray to have 9 a piece.

[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.320]
Same person, by the way.

[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.860]
Angel Ray 8, Michelle Gillen 5, Dwight Lauderdale 4,

[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.500]
Elliott Rodriguez 4, Bob Mayor 3, and Kelly Crave don't have any.

[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:15.320]
Everybody likes Kelly.

[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:16.580]
You auto-apologize.

[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.980]
I like Kelly for Conor of Fat Tub.

[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:19.760]
That was terrible.

[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:20.960]
I like her.

[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.840]
Conor like Dave Gamed Jr.

[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.620]
I'm in law.

[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.060]
This is Sports Winninger 5, Sydney.

[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:29.580]
She way am.

[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.040]
If I win this game, I guess I can kill Angel Ray.

[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.200]
Where's Angel Ray? What's she doing with that machine gun?

[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.100]
Oh my god.

[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:39.640]
Quick, quick, quick, stand right to the light.

[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:43.760]
She was fed up with reading one story after another

[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.460]
about drugs and violence.

[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:50.360]
Now she wants to write the rules and rewrite the news

[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:56.040]
in and whole starring and mission.

[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:57.820]
Go, Kelly, please.

[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.440]
I'll see you tonight at 5, 6, 11.

[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:01.320]
Scott.

[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.360]
And whole.

[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.840]
She took the news into her old hands.

[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.920]
What are you going to do with me?

[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.360]
When I get through with you, there won't be enough of you

[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.660]
left to make a good two-kate or darn long.

[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:18.080]
And whole, whole, story and vision.

[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.520]
Also starring Carl Withert is going to Notre Dame.

[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.600]
And Don, Don says Don, No.

[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:27.160]
There's a stationary crawl over the Midwest.

[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.360]
And Bo, she's re-rooted the news.

[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.780]
And home coming soon.

[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:37.500]
Count 31 at 560, WDQ.

[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.780]
I mean, I want to upon a time whatever happened to Walter Cronice

[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:40.540]
with the bow ties.

[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.000]
I give up what happened.

[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:45.120]
Go to other markets and like you can go back to Detroit.

[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.740]
There was Bill Bonds on WXYZ for 100 years.

[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.360]
There was Jack and Merlin Turner on WWJ Channel 4 for 400 years.

[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:54.920]
You go to Pittsburgh.

[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.720]
There was a guy with a boat tie also.

[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:57.340]
What's his name?

[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.500]
The sports guy in Pittsburgh.

[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:00.100]
I'm KDK TV.

[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.740]
I don't know, but his catalog is showing up here in my mailbox.

[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:03.360]
Oh.

[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.500]
And that's bad.

[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:08.200]
Oh, and it's on the tip of my tongue, Bill.

[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.080]
Somebody will know.

[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.560]
The sports anchor from KDK in Pittsburgh.

[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:12.880]
Bill Curry.

[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.340]
I think that's it.

[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:14.620]
Really?

[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:15.340]
Yeah.

[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:16.480]
What a memory.

[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:17.680]
He was great.

[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.940]
He said, these are people that had some personality that like Dave Devall,

[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.700]
it does the weather here on CFTO in Toronto.

[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.560]
He's been there for 80 years, I think.

[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.280]
You're used to that.

[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:28.700]
People are creatures of habit.

[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.960]
And none of us in this, they're putting all these walking Barbie dolls,

[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:35.080]
these bubble head doll type interchangeable part people.

[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.500]
And who now cares about them?

[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:38.920]
Here's a good fact though.

[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:39.600]
Here's some good news.

[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.020]
Sherman Osborne on her show today,

[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:43.300]
Bash Rush Limpet, calling him a bigot liar.

[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:44.760]
Other degrading comments.

[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:45.540]
It was awesome.

[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.080]
Go, Sherman.

[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:46.960]
Go, you go, girl.

[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:47.940]
Whatever you are.

[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:49.980]
That's good news.

[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.840]
Rip that critical ass.

[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.100]
I don't hate her as much now.

[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:53.740]
Yeah.

[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:55.980]
You hate Sherman Osborne based on what?

[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.060]
I just because she's disgusting.

[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.420]
No, she jacked up the cost of bands.

[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:06.800]
She raised the cost for the bands to perform on the second stage during Osfest,

[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.400]
shutting out a lot of up and coming bands.

[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:09.520]
I know where to pay her fees though.

[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:09.980]
That was bad.

[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:10.560]
She's a bitch.

[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:11.140]
She is.

[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:13.560]
She can rip brush and we don't need her to rip brush.

[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.280]
We can all do that.

[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.780]
But anyway, you go share and do your thing.

[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:21.820]
US frantic, the soft and harsh language in US rights report in or un-eracked.

[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.040]
This is a pretty embarrassing.

[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.040]
Of course, we got a lot of embarrassment lately, especially at the U.S.

[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:30.940]
is scrambling the soft and leisurely harsh and inflammatory criticism of the US-led coalesce

[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.660]
in Iraq that is expected to be contained.

[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:36.380]
And a UN Human Rights Report to be released this week US officials said,

[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.280]
they're scrambling.

[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.640]
The officials said US diplomats are lobbying for language in a report

[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:44.760]
from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to be toned down.

[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:49.300]
And a bit to prevent a new firestorm of controversy over the restrement of Iraqi detainees

[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:53.680]
by US troops that the notorious Abu Gharram prison outside Baghdad.

[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.220]
The final version of the report is to be released tomorrow at the UN Human Rights Headquarters in Geneva.

[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:01.080]
Is that New York or a Switzerland?

[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.600]
And Washington fears that without changes its publication could complicate efforts

[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.980]
to secure passage of a new UN Security Council resolution on Iraq,

[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.600]
the official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:15.020]
The resolution is critical to securing support for the interim Iraqi government

[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.040]
taking power June.

[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.460]
And prefer the detainment of the US-led multinational forced remain in the country after that date.

[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:25.820]
What we're looking at in the draft is strong anti-US and inflammatory language

[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:29.580]
that was written before we've got a chance to submit its own own information on official said,

[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.540]
what we're looking for is a more balanced approach.

[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:34.820]
They're trying to like water it down, water down the truth.

[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:38.360]
Kind of like the version of the news that the American public gets eventually.

[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:39.800]
Little water down, crap.

[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:45.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:48.900]
Our second poll today, I don't think either one is all that great to be honest with you.

[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:52.540]
Although thanks to the caller we called this one in, he's probably pretty excited about it, you know?

[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.000]
That's a good idea.

[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.540]
No, this is a good idea, I just, I don't know.

[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:00.740]
What software did TV personnel needs to retire next?

[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.400]
Who is the weather guy?

[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:06.800]
Oh, that's the weather guy on KDK and Pittsburgh.

[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:07.980]
That's what I'm trying to think of.

[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:11.880]
If I can think of that, then I want 80 million dollars in cash and small bills right now.

[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:16.360]
There was a really, really bizarre weather guy.

[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.000]
What the hell?

[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:17.660]
Somebody will know.

[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.760]
Facts it in, call it in.

[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:23.380]
The weather guy from back in the day when the men were men and women were built.

[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:26.500]
The whole career was doing a sports with his vote ties and it was a weather guy.

[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.240]
And they also had Miren Cope on there doing a sports too.

[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:34.440]
145 votes, Rix and by the way, a moe you ain't no Miren Cope.

[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:38.420]
Rix Sanchez or Johnny Most, not even close to Johnny Most.

[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:41.720]
Next time you rip Johnny Most, I'm going to come in there and rip your piece off, okay?

[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.960]
I'll come back to town, rip off your hair piece next time you rip Johnny Most.

[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.420]
You couldn't shine Johnny Most shoes.

[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:49.800]
Rix, what?

[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:54.260]
We're just thinking we got 100 bucks for the bounty on that muskrat so you can collect it.

[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.520]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.580]
You can get a hell of a shoe shine for 100 bucks.

[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:02.700]
Rix Sanchez 87, they want you to retire.

[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:05.260]
Rick, they want you out now out of 151.

[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:06.580]
He's got 58% of the vote.

[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.120]
Spilky's in array 14.

[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:09.140]
What's the one?

[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:10.120]
How about Marilyn Mitchell?

[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:11.760]
How come nobody has any hair yet?

[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.380]
With a green cat eyes, huh?

[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:15.760]
Marilyn Mitchell, boy.

[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.820]
She is nasty, nasty.

[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:21.600]
She's a thing with Channel 7 is they put people on her really offensively.

[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.200]
Look at it.

[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.820]
And then they hyperventilate and get all whipped up into a frenzy.

[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.020]
And that's what people like, I guess.

[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:27.340]
I don't know.

[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:32.440]
That's why they think Jackie Johnson so hot because all these other broads they put on their just absolute skanks.

[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:33.880]
Man.

[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:39.000]
And I don't care what you say about Jackie Johnson, she is so overrated that there came to get it to you.

[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:40.780]
Oh, she's overrated, but still.

[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.060]
Yeah, she's still got the right parts.

[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:43.520]
I know.

[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:44.720]
Okay.

[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:48.820]
She had to hear some of these guys carry on about Jackie Johnson.

[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:55.260]
You think that she was a combination of Sophia Loren, Gina Lola Brigida and somebody.

[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:57.780]
Spilky's in array 14.

[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:58.900]
Tony Cigarette of 13.

[01:41:59.040 --> 01:41:59.700]
Angelara 8.

[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:02.020]
Dwight Lottardale, seven Bob Mayors got seven.

[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:02.820]
Poor little Bob.

[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:03.580]
Come on.

[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.500]
Lay off a little Bobbie mayor.

[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:07.260]
He never still afraid training.

[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.320]
He's a good Jewish boy that sits on 15 phone books.

[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.060]
That's the true story, by the way, that he sits on a phone book to make him a hyena.

[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:15.700]
I just made it up.

[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:16.660]
I do something else to get high.

[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.040]
Michelle Gillan, six for Michelle.

[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:22.480]
See, once somebody changes the way you pronounce the name, then you know, there are real.

[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:23.380]
Okay.

[01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.560]
Tony Dor set.

[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.620]
When he was Tony Dor set, he was okay.

[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:28.140]
Tony Dor set.

[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.640]
So is he still pronouncing it that way?

[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:34.160]
Oh, Michelle Gillan, although she was always the same faghyg bitch.

[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.460]
Michelle, it's Michelle Gillan.

[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:40.880]
Six people want you out today by one o'clock, Michelle.

[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.100]
Elliot Rodriguez five, Kelly Craig two, poor Kelly.

[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:47.780]
Jennifer Velopi two, she's got a pair.

[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.700]
And Alicia Lane has got none.

[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:53.840]
And Miguel says there ain't nothing wrong with Alicia Lane.

[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.480]
Is she Kendall Lewis?

[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.280]
Nathan.

[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.400]
WQA, hello.

[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:05.840]
Pat Singleton.

[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.040]
The crazy one.

[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:09.360]
He's one.

[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:10.860]
It's the crazy one.

[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:13.700]
You know, you know, you're going to get his name, Pat Singleton.

[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:14.940]
No, not even close.

[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:16.520]
No, yeah, it was.

[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:18.440]
Oh, there was another one.

[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.760]
Anyway, well, thank you for the other one to call me back.

[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:23.160]
That's not even close to where they got them.

[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.960]
And because as soon as somebody would say it, I would know it immediately.

[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:30.560]
See, every market, every major market had its very famous people.

[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:37.420]
You go to Hawaii and doing the sports was Les Kider, who was 175 years old with one eye, like all, Pat Stup.

[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.620]
But there was Les Kider.

[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:41.660]
He used to be the greatest boxing announcer, even more, I think, might agree with that.

[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.420]
Les Kider was great.

[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.320]
Down those ingots.

[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:46.580]
Whatever the hell it was.

[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:48.400]
The English were doing Hanson and Floyd Patterson.

[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:49.360]
You heard me.

[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:50.460]
Something about a dingo?

[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.200]
Yeah, down goes the dingo.

[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.240]
I mean, there was no Howard Cosell.

[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.280]
Down goes Frazier.

[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:57.180]
I shouldn't be talking about Howard Cosell.

[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.140]
Dave Johnson will get upset.

[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:00.380]
But Les Kider.

[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:01.820]
And you know what I'm talking about?

[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.440]
Every market had its, they were like fixtures.

[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:06.420]
Right?

[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:08.580]
Yeah, picture.

[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:09.220]
What the hell do you know?

[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:10.040]
You never been anywhere.

[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.400]
You've been in like Bozeman, Montana, and somewhere in Jersey, and Trenton or somewhere.

[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:14.120]
That's it.

[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:14.640]
No, that's it.

[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:15.440]
A visited newer.

[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:20.560]
Boy, I can't believe I can't think of the name of the weather guy on KDK.

[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:25.580]
If somebody doesn't call an interaction today before 2 o'clock, that's going to drag me crazy.

[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:26.840]
But drag me up the wall.

[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:28.200]
Very, very notorious.

[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:29.740]
It's just a wild man, you know.

[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.120]
Which is what the weather people, and whatever happened to a Walter Kronis in his bow ties.

[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:34.840]
He's probably dead.

[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:39.720]
And the other guy, Dick from Channel 4, the old Channel 4.

[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:42.860]
They used to work with Weaver.

[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:44.080]
Oh, I don't know.

[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:45.700]
Oh, yeah, the hell you don't.

[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:46.480]
Dick Femmeel.

[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:46.860]
Oh.

[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:49.160]
Dave had made invented seeds after him.

[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.900]
You'd probably just picked a couple of those this morning.

[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.500]
I just heard you talking about him.

[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:53.480]
Dick Femmeel.

[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:54.600]
He used to be the booth announcer.

[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:58.120]
He was the voice of the station on Channel 4.

[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:01.220]
Back in, or I can't even figure out where the hell it was.

[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:02.340]
You know, when Renek was there.

[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.620]
Hello, to QAM.

[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:04.860]
Hello.

[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.060]
Hi, Neil.

[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:06.800]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.600]
I picked this switch here for a minute if I could.

[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:09.760]
Shifty years?

[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:10.680]
Yeah.

[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:15.580]
Do you think that Junior Stale has merged with the great one now to...

[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:16.520]
Hello, to QAM.

[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:16.760]
Hello.

[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:17.640]
Neil.

[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:18.380]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:21.940]
First of all, Kudos and congratulations to you and the gang down there on your website.

[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.240]
It's a great job on your website.

[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:26.120]
Even Eric, we said along our best Eric.

[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:27.320]
We used to be together.

[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:27.860]
Yeah, Eric, yeah.

[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:29.700]
I talked to George a couple weeks ago.

[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:36.380]
I'll urge everyone again to go to the website and click on the news and article icon here and get a real rude awakening

[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:38.040]
to what's exactly going on in this country.

[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:39.020]
It's actually pretty scary.

[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:47.520]
But secondly, you were George recommended a book regarding the Bible being a bunch of bubble mites and all that.

[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.560]
I can't remember what was Da Vinci's code of waking Da Vinci's code.

[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:51.960]
You had to remember what was Da Vinci's code?

[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.360]
It's just a Da Vinci code, right.

[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.140]
I have already.

[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:55.840]
It's a normal.

[01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:56.880]
It's going to be a movie.

[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.480]
It's an hour movie.

[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:00.600]
But I've definitely debunked the whole biblical book.

[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:04.140]
Yeah, I went to the book and they got like three of them out there.

[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.660]
I couldn't decipher from even reading the Bible.

[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:09.160]
I'll give you the best book to the Bible.

[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:10.080]
The Bible.

[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:11.240]
The Bible.

[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:11.440]

[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:12.860]
Yeah.

[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:14.600]
I'm not serious.

[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:15.560]
I know.

[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.580]
Well, my boy has been spent at some time with my mother-in-law.

[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:24.980]
He's been coming home wearing a cloth and a necklace and asking questions about where the first human came from and all that.

[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:28.700]
I thought I'd pick a book up and maybe hand it to her.

[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:29.440]
Listen, listen.

[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.140]
Open your eyes and open your brain.

[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.120]
Get a pen's guide to the Bible.

[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:34.460]
Yeah, right?

[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:34.980]
No, seriously.

[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:36.160]
What was the book Da Vinci's code?

[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:39.860]
You're just trying to tell you something and you're listening.

[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.960]
Listen, something you can give to a kid because it's got little cartoon pictures in it.

[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:44.000]
How old is the kid?

[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:45.680]
He's only six years old.

[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:47.200]
Oh, this is perfect then.

[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:49.020]
Ken's Guide to the Bible.

[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:51.700]
Ken's Guide to the Bible.

[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:54.220]
Ken's Guide to the Bible.

[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:54.920]
Yes.

[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:56.140]
All right.

[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:57.140]
Where can he get that?

[01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:58.040]
Middle anywhere.

[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:00.820]
I've never gone out of my way to the Bible.

[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:01.760]
I've never gone out of my way to the Bible.

[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.520]
Well, straighten out before it's too late, man.

[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:06.400]
Straighten his ass out before Father Rotuldo's, okay?

[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:08.200]
It only costs eight books.

[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:13.220]
Greg Mughnell is on Mornings on WGNA640 AM, says this fact.

[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:14.280]
Oh, my God.

[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.660]
I stumbled on him trying to get away from Moe and Gellie.

[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:20.260]
Greg, we bend you then, Mughnell.

[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:24.700]
The most overrated mediocre human being in a history of South Florida media, if he asked me.

[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:25.400]
Poor Greg.

[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.960]
I probably shouldn't say that because he'll take it personal.

[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:29.520]
That's why I said it.

[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:29.980]
Why?

[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:30.460]

[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:32.540]
I'm a fucking man, dude.

[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:32.960]

[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.020]
I was a real five-six-year-old.

[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:35.160]
You AM.

[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.020]
They're all great money, Python, but he, Eric Idol, to me, was always my favorite.

[01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:40.100]
He's just incredible.

[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:42.340]
I liked Graham Chapman, the guy that died.

[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.760]
But he's dead, though.

[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.300]
Yeah, he is.

[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:47.920]
I like him all, but to me, John Cleese was great, huh?

[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:48.140]
Sure.

[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:48.960]
He's hysterical.

[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.960]
But Eric Idol, something about him.

[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:58.260]
Anyway, you'll be pleased to know that Bob Cosmo, that name just now, this is how many years since I've been in Pittsburgh.

[01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.300]
Bob Cosmo, man.

[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:00.260]
A Zen in years.

[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:06.980]
And Bill Curry with a bow tie and Bob Cosmo was the weather guy back when KDKA was like a really, and maybe it still is.

[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:07.980]
I guess it probably still is.

[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:10.460]
The dominant TV station in the market.

[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.820]
How could you possibly remember something like that?

[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:20.660]
But then again, when you can remember, Franklin Sears driving Felix Forbes in the eighth race in the Hazel Park and winning by six open lengths.

[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.760]
I mean, there are things in my mind that I want out of there that I have no use for, but they will not go.

[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:27.260]
You know what I mean?

[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:28.120]
Un-un-un-aways.

[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.100]
Yeah, they did it to, uh, stuff.

[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:35.400]
So what's the Sheridan on Passions, and it worked like magic?

[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:42.260]
And by the way, anybody else watching Passions getting a little bit sick and tired of these pirate stories?

[01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:45.480]
Oh, brother, talk about going through the doldrums of summer.

[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:48.400]
Get some new script writers in there, please.

[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.040]
AP editors were forced to retract an earlier report that a meteorite might have hit near Olympia Washington this morning.

[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.100]
Oh, my God.

[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:03.860]
After discovering that a source won Bradley Hammermaster, claiming to be an astronomy professor at perpetrated a hoax.

[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:09.560]
An early report that a meteorite had turned out to be false at AP spokesman Jack Stoffes.

[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.140]
It looks like a version of the story was killed because it talked about a meteorite hitting.

[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.440]
He said AP was reviewing how the error occurred.

[01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:19.020]
I think it happened because somebody there was stupid.

[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:25.560]
The original story, which AP released at 703 this morning stated that someone identified as Bradley Hammermaster

[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:31.560]
and purported to be a University of Washington astronomy instructor, had told Cairo Radio, K-I-R-O, and Seattle

[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:36.020]
and the piece of media were about the size of a small car and just hit it before 3am.

[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:47.980]
The radio station also quoted the man as saying a team was being assembled ahead for an area where the object was believed to have hit near the tiny Southwestern Washington community of Chahalus at the palace.

[01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:52.820]
The version was picked up by dozens of new sites, most of which later deleted the Hammermaster.

[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:54.640]
You know who I hear was writing the meteor?

[01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.300]
Oh, Catherine Harris.

[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.800]
Not what I was going to say.

[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:02.560]
Oh, Duff.

[01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:09.820]
The bogus report followed genuine reports of bright lights being seen all along a 60 mile stretch of the Puget Sound,

[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:16.940]
which National Weather Service and U.S. Coat Guard officials were investigating as either a streaking meteor or other outer space activity.

[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:20.040]
Better get our bell online, outer space activity.

[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:21.600]
Uh oh.

[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:28.780]
An advisory by the AP sent out at 7.25 this morning stated the AP story, a meteorite Washington has been eliminated.

[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:31.360]
The identity of the source of the story cannot be confirmed.

[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.820]
Later versions of the AP story revealed the hoax.

[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:35.640]
A hoax.

[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:48.100]
No one by the name of Hammermaster is known to be in the astronomy department and the description given by the car or the station of the object and automobile size piece of a small car from piece of the larger trily meteor was clearly bogus.

[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:51.000]
But don't let that confuse the in P man.

[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:53.480]
They're pissed off because more people are shoving a Kruger.

[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.600]
5 6 7 0 5 6.

[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:59.320]
I can't believe that Bob Cudzman just that's scary to me that bothers me a lot.

[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.180]
I mean, I want to know the name, but the fact that, huh?

[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.080]
It's good that your mind hasn't gone yet.

[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:09.980]
More little shots there.

[01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:12.660]
Just wait till you're old and feeble about six or seven months.

[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:13.840]
You'll see.

[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:16.100]
I'm gonna beat you.

[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:19.020]
Now here's one that says, oh, yeah, here we go.

[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:21.900]
Here's the real winner of the, I'm so glad you sent me this fact.

[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:22.600]
Thank you, Alex.

[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.960]
This is absolutely the answer.

[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:27.020]
Ike Siemens.

[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.320]
Good God.

[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:32.760]
Also what happened to Al Sunchron and his hemhawks?

[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:33.740]
Is he gone?

[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:34.380]
Al Sunchron?

[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:35.120]
I can only pray.

[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:35.440]
No.

[01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:36.740]
He's still there.

[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:37.420]
He's still waving it.

[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:37.880]
Yeah.

[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:42.940]
It was funny that he old Ike Siemens, who's one of the, just a hack.

[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:44.980]
Just a hack, a total sellout.

[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:48.800]
He turned himself into a pom and Mickey Erison back during that silly arena dead thing.

[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:50.320]
What a clown you are.

[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:51.320]
Ike Siemens, man.

[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:52.840]
Silly old goofball.

[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:57.020]
It says, I bet if you do the pull tomorrow about a self-order radio person that needs to be there,

[01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:58.600]
well, hardly get 100% of the vote.

[01:51:58.700 --> 01:51:59.880]
No, I get a bunch retire.

[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.360]
We've already done that.

[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.680]
Do we want to do that?

[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:05.640]
I don't care.

[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.460]
Don't bother me, none.

[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:08.120]
Yeah, let's do that tomorrow.

[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.560]
So I wish self-order radio personality out of retire.

[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:11.580]
I bet you cast it over.

[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:12.300]
Get a few votes.

[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:15.020]
Let's see.

[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:16.360]
Here's Stuttering Gilles says.

[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.040]
Today's pool.

[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:19.680]
Lonnie Quinn, NBC6.

[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.860]
See, there, there, there have been conditioned now to sing NBC6.

[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.440]
Nobody says CBS4.

[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:25.780]
Nobody says ABC10.

[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:28.720]
But NBC6 morning, weatherman, Quistamore, very arrogant.

[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:29.900]
Lonnie Quinn.

[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:30.520]
Got it?

[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:31.400]
Got it.

[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:32.740]
What if he had Lonnie Quinn, medicine guy?

[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:35.820]
That's what Stuttering Gilles says down on homestays.

[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:37.600]
Good luck to you, Stuttering Gilles, you're okay in my book.

[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:42.200]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.400]
And for our so glad we changed the pool, you know?

[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.160]
Yeah, this is more fun.

[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.900]
Yeah, because the other stuff is just a given, you know, the Spanish language.

[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:53.480]
Those people who want to listen, it's a free country, to a point.

[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:56.620]
Although I will say this, starting on Monday, you can't listen anymore station

[01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:57.540]
and don't broadcast English.

[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.520]
I just decided.

[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:00.420]
Wouldn't that be great?

[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:03.140]
Let's start a different language in broadcast and that.

[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:07.000]
I still say that like back back in the day when I first started in this market, the KAT,

[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:10.180]
they used to have a separate, there were two different things.

[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.840]
There was the date book, there was a Broward book, right?

[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:13.600]
Right.

[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:16.760]
And there was a separate ethnic book, right?

[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.580]
And that's the way it should be because advertisers who want to, you know,

[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.780]
you might have a 20 share.

[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.500]
But if you have nobody listening, but pick me out of this three feet tall,

[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:29.300]
those people are going to be by an elevator shoe.

[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:30.760]
They will be by an elevator shoe.

[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.980]
Whatever they are going to be by.

[01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:32.580]
You see what I'm saying?

[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:34.620]
They are not going to be buying like big cars.

[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:37.800]
They say better way to target your demographic.

[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:38.400]
Exactly.

[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:38.740]

[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:39.600]
Very advertising tool.

[01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:40.280]
Exactly.

[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:46.900]
Ike Siemens, man, he just makes me angry because he's a fool.

[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:47.760]
He's a clown.

[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:49.140]
He's a silly person.

[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.240]
He's an embarrassment.

[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:52.380]
He's okay.

[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:53.980]
WQM, hello.

[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:55.060]
Hey, Neil.

[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:55.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.760]
I have been on East Coast in a few years,

[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:03.160]
but it's a big, fat, Dave game still on the air.

[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:04.280]
Not here.

[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.440]
Oh, I thought it was, wasn't it?

[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:08.420]
They've been on the air.

[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.460]
Here he is, but on the air here for a long time.

[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:11.240]
We'll see.

[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:13.780]
That's how long it's been since I've been over there, but he should retire anyway.

[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:14.780]
Okay, thanks.

[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:15.640]
I think he's dead.

[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.100]
How could we find that out?

[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:19.720]
Somebody to call.

[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:22.260]
Somebody to have to call because you could do a search on that.

[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:24.800]
I don't think he's, he was big, but not that big.

[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:25.200]
You know what I mean?

[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.620]
He wasn't big enough to be on the internet.

[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:27.480]
Maybe he was.

[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:29.260]
I'm going to do it right now.

[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:32.760]
Dave game.

[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:36.320]
Okay, let's wait with Bated Bread.

[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.060]
Let's get some of that good stuff on.

[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:45.380]
Dave's game room.

[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:49.620]
Pete's pinball pages.

[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:50.980]
Oh, I didn't put PD Lenny in there.

[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:51.980]
We put Dave game in there.

[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.560]
And by the way, PD Lenny, your station didn't show up either in Dating Broward.

[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.320]
Whatever the hell's call out is our.

[01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:59.200]
See, this is the thing we'd keep channel to.

[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:00.000]
It's another thing they do.

[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:04.220]
You got WFTL, WFLL, WFELL.

[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:05.620]
Nobody knows.

[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:07.280]
Has any idea what the call out is our.

[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:09.920]
That he 50 thing in Palm Beach.

[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.280]
Oh, Steve Lapis is going to put you guys right off the map.

[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:15.920]
And the normal cats sending me emails and faxes months and months ago.

[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:17.080]
Oh, they're going all sports.

[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:18.020]
Defeo is on there.

[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:18.260]

[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:19.760]
Do they show up at all?

[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:20.160]

[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.600]
They don't need to sneak because they're out of the market.

[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:23.920]
Palm Beach station.

[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:28.160]
So if you don't show up at all, they don't even list you.

[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:30.820]
I mean, at least Mr. Ego, his station is listed on there.

[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:34.320]
And they just happen to have a point in the morning when he's on.

[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:36.600]
Zero, which means nobody's listening.

[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:38.800]
No seriously, stop exaggerating.

[01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:39.300]
What's the number?

[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:41.120]
What's what number?

[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:42.040]
His number.

[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:43.040]
Steve?

[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:43.440]
Yeah.

[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:44.420]
Oh!

[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:45.280]
Point.

[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:45.920]
Oh.

[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.220]
Or maybe it's 0.

[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:48.020]
Oh.

[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:48.800]
Or maybe it's 0.

[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:49.680]
Oh.

[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:52.100]
It's low.

[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.160]
Rhymes with.

[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:53.520]
Oh!

[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:58.140]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8, pound 5 6 6 the only AT&T.

[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:01.880]
See, since a blind bite can't find that station on the dial anymore, they're in real trouble.

[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.300]
And since Ken Block moved to another block.

[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:07.840]
He moved a block further away.

[01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:08.580]
He can't hear it.

[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:11.360]
WQAM, hello.

[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:13.120]
Yes, hello.

[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:14.000]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.100]
I'm so glad you had a Walton Corona.

[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.220]
It ends alive.

[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.340]
Come on.

[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:20.060]
I can confirm the Walton Corona is alive.

[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:22.020]
Is he still in South Florida?

[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:22.660]
Yes.

[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:24.120]
I think it is in our county.

[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:27.340]
They just did a story about, you know, kind of where are they now, kind of a thing.

[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:27.620]
Right.

[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:28.480]
Just recently.

[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:33.260]
So he is still around still wearing very loud shirts and apparently doing fun.

[01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:34.740]
Well, thanks for the good news.

[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:35.500]
There you are.

[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:36.100]
See you.

[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:37.680]
Well, he's still alive.

[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:38.900]
Probably wearing a big bow ties.

[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:40.940]
He was the weather guy channel 10 back in the day.

[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:41.620]
And you remember him.

[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:42.420]
I can't believe that.

[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:43.900]
No, I remember his bow ties though.

[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.120]
Just the bow ties, but not him.

[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:48.280]
Well, it looked kind of a clown face.

[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:49.960]
Not with any like makeup, or anything.

[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:51.400]
He was kind of a clown face.

[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:51.960]
That was just him.

[01:56:52.100 --> 01:56:52.760]
He was okay.

[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:56.400]
It was like really old and funny, but he was really old at that point.

[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:57.680]
But it was just his thing.

[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.520]
Some people even when they're young, they're old and funny.

[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:01.160]
You know what I mean?

[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:01.540]
Absolutely.

[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.080]
Oh, yeah.

[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:02.700]
I'm sure him.

[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:03.620]
Oh, man.

[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:03.960]

[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.320]
Can you imagine him as a young person?

[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:05.980]
Not really.

[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:08.220]
I think he was born with that piece of a head spread, honestly.

[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:09.480]
Can you get it up?

[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:10.360]
Cutting loose.

[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.080]
I can imagine him cutting a few.

[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:14.720]
I'll tell you that.

[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:16.600]
And I just don't want to be there when it happens.

[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.640]
1257 at 560 WQM with a heat of summer here.

[01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:22.860]
Now it's a great time to get out of that car you've been driving.

[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:27.320]
And get yourself into a great new Toyota from Armstrong Toyota of homestead.

[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:32.820]
On US 120 minutes south of the A36, they're worth the drive to save you thousands on great new Toyota's.

[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:35.800]
With rising gas prices, maybe you want to car with more fuel economy.

[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:43.760]
The legendary, I like the way you spelled this fat boy, the legendary Toyota Corolla can be risked for just $11,990 or at least it for just $209 a month.

[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:46.120]
Need a great Toyota for that college or high school graduate?

[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:49.520]
How about the Toyota Echo, at least priced at just $199?

[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:54.420]
Need a truck, the V6, Toyota Tundra regular can't be leased for just $239 a month.

[01:57:54.780 --> 01:58:01.520]
Looking for the hottest new cars around check out the Corolla XRS and Solarra convertible now in stock at Armstrong Toyota of homestead.

[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:02.880]
They're locally owned and operating.

[01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:04.260]
They'll just about stand on their head.

[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.020]
They'll do anything to make sure you're a happy customer.

[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:10.400]
And their service department's even opened late till late weeknights to make sure your service work gets done.

[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.460]
And keep in mind that Armstrong Toyota homestead was the first dealer to offer your free tires and batteries for life.

[01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:18.740]
Now that the first to offer your free replacement parts for life, that's correct.

[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.820]
Tires, batteries and free parts for life, nobody else know where it is that.

[01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:29.660]
So say goodbye to those screaming, hollering big hot shot dealers who scream and hollering the gifts in their dealership under phony pretense.

[01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:32.740]
See David Rich, the GM at Armstrong Toyota homestead today.

[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:39.980]
Armstrong Toyota homestead, they were in US 1 and 2.93th Street in homestead just 20 minutes south of the 8.36th drive a little and save a ton.

[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:44.180]
I'm at Green New Toyota today only at Armstrong Toyota of homestead.

[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:46.020]
That's my life and love.

[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:48.380]
This is sports radio 560.

[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.760]
You ain't too a-a-a-a.

[01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:55.020]
Oh boy, it's the one to two hour.

[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.480]
Yeah.

[01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:59.720]
We are a unit that cares.

[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.760]
And I'm saying care.

[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:06.300]
The reason why I say care, because it's so hard to let things go when you care about it.

[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:11.340]
When you care about it, I would say love and then everyone say that you're a faggot.

[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:12.020]
Well, I'm not.

[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.540]
This special day here it is the world.

[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:21.780]
When the screaming days peak the rest of the girls in the closet no more.

[01:59:22.060 --> 01:59:23.520]
That's what day day is for.

[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:26.300]
It's a day after all.

[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.480]
Absolutely.

[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:37.260]
We can hear the squirts we can tickle and tease us with our manicure.

[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:40.620]
Go cheese is a gay day after all.

[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:48.100]
We'll be holding hands in a denture and watch the lies of an alley marching band.

[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:51.480]
We'll make tourists treat with a kiss on the cheek.

[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.800]
It's a gay day after all.

[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:58.360]
We can wear tight shorts made of gold, long made.

[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:01.900]
And wear mascara like the ladies' date.

[02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:05.260]
We can then sew way as we print since I shake.

[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:08.380]
It's a gay day after all.

[02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:15.720]
MGM will have a celebrity ball hosted by a reptillar and a roo-ball.

[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:19.180]
There'll be bourbon on the rock, not to mention people like Hawk.

[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:22.360]
It's a gay day after all.

[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:26.800]
It's a gay day after all.

[02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:30.160]
It's a gay day after all.

[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:33.300]
It's a gay day after all.

[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:34.260]
It's a gay day after all.

[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:37.360]
It's a gay day after all.

[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:39.760]
Baining!

[02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:42.100]
102 at 560 W.C.M.

[02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:44.060]
That was his name by the way Pete LeCoc.

[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:44.720]
First baseman.

[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:48.060]
He was Peter Marshall's son from the Hollywood Square did you know that?

[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:49.100]
Oh, that'd be four worms.

[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:50.240]
I'm sure you forgot.

[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:51.600]
He was no Bob Cudsmah though.

[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:52.400]
From KDK.

[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:56.260]
I don't think I'm ever going to recover from remembering that.

[02:00:56.420 --> 02:00:58.120]
It's just where did it come from.

[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:58.620]
You know what I mean?

[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.600]
It's not like an easy name.

[02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:01.740]
I mean Bill Currioke.

[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:03.080]
That's a piece of cake.

[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:03.940]
You know, it's a simple name.

[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:08.300]
But Bob Cudsmah, how many people do you know named Cudsmah?

[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:08.640]
None.

[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:13.480]
How many people do you know named Navu Al-Marab?

[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:14.220]
None.

[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:16.560]
Well, here's a guy.

[02:01:16.740 --> 02:01:17.240]
That's his name.

[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:20.760]
He was once in prison as the number 27 man on the FBI list of must-captured

[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:21.420]
terrorist suspects.

[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:22.200]
Guess what?

[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.000]
He's free again.

[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:29.920]
He's free despite telling a Jordanian informer he planned to dive a martyr by driving a gasoline truck into a New York City tunnel,

[02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:35.840]
turning its sideways, opening its fuel valves, and having an al-Qaeda operative shoot a flare to ignite a massive explosion.

[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:42.000]
Free despite telling the FBI he had trained on rifles and rocket propelled grenades at militant camps in Afghanistan,

[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.280]
and after admitting he said money to a former roommate convicted trying to blow up a hotel in Jordan.

[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:52.740]
Free despite efforts by prosecutors in Detroit and Chicago to indict him on charges that could have kept in prison for years.

[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:58.260]
Those indictments were rejected by the Justice Department in the name of protecting intelligence.

[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:02.540]
Even two judges openly questioned Al-Marab's terror ties.

[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:07.700]
The indictments rejected by the Justice Department who they were too busy probably covering up statues.

[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:13.960]
The Bush administration in January deported Al-Marab to Syria, his home in the country, the U.S. government,

[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:16.000]
along as regarded as a sponsor of terrorism.

[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:24.440]
The quiet end to Al-Marab's case proves that it provides a stark contrast to other cases in which the Bush administration's health suspects without lawyers as enemy combatants.

[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:29.780]
It also contrasts with terms FBI agents used to describe an internal document obtained by the Associated Press.

[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:35.900]
Al-Marab intended to murder himself and attack against the U.S. and FBI agent road in December 2002.

[02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:45.540]
A footnote in Al-Marab's deportation ruling last year added, the FBI has been unable to rule out the possibility that Al-Marab is engaged in terrorist activity or will do so if he's not removed from the U.S.

[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:53.840]
One FBI report summarized a high-level debriefing of a Jordanian-Jed Jordanian informant that was conducted personally by the U.S. Attorney in Chicago.

[02:02:54.240 --> 02:03:01.140]
The informant claimed Al-Marab told him of specific terrorist plans during their time in prison while Al-Marab was serving an eight-month sentence-frendering U.S. illegally.

[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:03.840]
The whole story is on our website. It's just nauseating.

[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:12.320]
I think it's on our website, isn't it? Maybe it's not. I better check it out. I'll check it out, Eric. I'll get it to you. Amigo.

[02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:22.100]
5.6705.60.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Marlos Line. Don't forget to join QM in a Marlins' Freight watch party. Everybody goes and gets a free watch.

[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:32.660]
Not. It's a watch party. In other words, you sit around and you watch it. Right? Starting at 6.30 at the Davey Ale House, low-keyed it off 5.95 in the University.

[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:42.620]
The city stopped by to win Marlins' tickets at the prizes from Billy the Marlin and the Mermaid's and watched the Marlins crush the myths at the Davey Ale House. They're playing that in New York. They're playing right in the Ale House.

[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:49.340]
And Josh Beckett's going to be well. I can't tell you what he's going to be doing or where he's going to be doing it on his hands, I think.

[02:03:50.440 --> 02:04:01.360]
What sound flow to TV personality needs to retire? Next. Before it's too late. 241 votes. Rick Sance has 133. Tony Segredo, 22.

[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:06.940]
You're right on Rick's ass. Well, it's not close, but at any rate, you're in second place, Tony. They're getting real tired of your Cornball crap.

[02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:10.820]
Of your being a silly person. That's what you are. You're a silly, Tony. You're a silly person.

[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:15.460]
Even Cambron Martian had more credibility than he had none. Remember that?

[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:16.460]
Yep.

[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:22.780]
Boy, another another case of sports nerd-turned-news anchor. Hey, Poof, you're a news anchor. Well, based on what?

[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:29.420]
I don't know how we were going to have somebody worse, Steve. Cambron Martian. I felt sorry for him. He just couldn't cut it.

[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:39.940]
Tony Segredo, 22. Spilky's N' Array 18. Dwight Lauderdale 17. Marilyn Mittsell. See, I told you, old cat eyes are getting some votes. She's got nine.

[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:46.900]
She is disgusting. Angela Ray 8. Bob Mayor 8. N8. N8. Michelle Gillan.

[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:55.240]
She's got the 7. Elliot Rodriguez 6. Kelly Craig 4. Now, see if Kelly Craig had 8. I could have said 8 and 8 and 8. They would have been bad though.

[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:01.580]
We love you, Kelly. A lot of the fat people are the good people, Kelly, but don't forget the fat people also are the dead people.

[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:08.860]
This has George. She'll be out. Give you a list. Jennifer Veloppi 4. Lonnie Quinn's got three. I have no idea who that is.

[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:12.300]
I just sent you a facts from Michelle all about him.

[02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:18.060]
A facts from Michelle? See. No, not that Michelle.

[02:05:19.580 --> 02:05:20.920]
You have to be kidding me.

[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:25.240]
This is the most shocking news I've ever heard in my life.

[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:30.240]
Other than Walt Kronis is still alive, which we're glad to hear that Walt. You never stole a freight train.

[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:31.940]
I think he ever liked me though.

[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:38.820]
So, so many people in the South Florida media just didn't like me. I was too much of a big mouth.

[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.420]
You know, they don't like that. And Bishop, if that one of we know this story, all of poison.

[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:48.300]
He hated me. He hated me. He had me most up all over the walls. It was prohibited for any employee of the news department.

[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:51.440]
They're listening to the Roger show where they be farted and stuff like that.

[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:54.320]
She was kind of like a female mole. Absolutely. Female.

[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:57.540]
With a better piece. Dave game.

[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:04.340]
Now, where did you get this other stuff? You just because it's your writing. Eric and it's on their website.

[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:08.980]
But Eric's one that found it. And then we got another facts about it saying the same thing.

[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:15.040]
Holy moly Dave game is the webmaster for the WFOR website.

[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:16.220]
Oh my god.

[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:18.940]
And senior producer special projects also.

[02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:25.360]
For WFOR. Well, that's good news. Dave game did not explode. He's not dead. He's just too big to get on camera anymore.

[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:31.520]
Now, what do you like to see? I think that's a great. I look the consultants are always coming up with something new and different.

[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:33.780]
You know, because news is just the entertainment now.

[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:37.220]
How about an all fat news team?

[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:40.160]
Who Kelly Craig is the news anchor, huh?

[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:43.320]
All right. As the anchor. Oh, that was Dave.

[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:45.400]
Dave game.

[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:50.120]
Our good friend Bob. We were Bob kind of punched up there in the library.

[02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:51.960]
You're quite a bit of this team. No.

[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:55.040]
We're talking about the really, really big, really pully's.

[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.260]
Can you just even imagine that? That would be great.

[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:01.000]
It's the big news at six.

[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:04.240]
Spotters by flint fast.

[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.380]
Here's what I said, sponsored by a balance for life.

[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:09.480]
And our good friend Troy.

[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:12.120]
Hey, by the way, Troy, that copy. I'm still trying to figure it out.

[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:15.020]
We're not talking about Troy Stradford. We're talking about the other.

[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:17.040]
Troy. The one from balance for life.

[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:19.020]
Good guy. I have a little bit the ditty.

[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:22.960]
Somebody beat me earlier, nominating Lonnie quince's me shell.

[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:27.620]
But here's a little info about him. He is a former soap star. Oh, no, drop it Lonnie.

[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:29.660]
Those weathermen have a habit of doing that.

[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:34.800]
He was in days of our lives. He had a really bad, purely mullet going on at that time.

[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:39.080]
Sorry about the company letterhead, but I'm not ashamed that I'm not listening for anyone to know.

[02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:42.360]
Whatever. Oh, she works for somebody. I don't want to.

[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:43.640]
Thanks, me shell.

[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:49.900]
I do like that. I have no idea that is I just know that I saw a lot of really bizarre weather people on strange people.

[02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:52.300]
And of course, don't forget Miss Kamal when she hanging it up.

[02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:55.380]
You notice I don't want to make any suggestions because then I'll say it.

[02:07:56.500 --> 02:08:03.920]
Right. So don't. But I'm really shocked that we haven't had anybody not one so far.

[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:06.640]
I know. Yeah, exactly. I'm searching for it.

[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:08.260]
If I can find it. Oh, here he is.

[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:09.760]
I want to give you the real thing.

[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:11.380]
Yeah. The weather fairy.

[02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:14.260]
You're waiting not to make believe whether for you from Miss Kamal.

[02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:17.140]
We're talking about the one and only original weather fairy on channel four.

[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:19.960]
Little Brian Warker and orc was your hysteria specialist.

[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:23.040]
See, some people thought it was like the hurricane specialist.

[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:26.260]
The each did for well, the each did for several things.

[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:27.440]
Are we putting them on?

[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.440]
Oh, come on. Put Brian orc was out there.

[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:32.400]
I'm not going to wait for the public. The each did for many things.

[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:35.920]
But it's for hysteria specialist. Not just hurricane or homo specialist.

[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.860]
Little Brian orc was the only the only there's only one weatherman left on the air.

[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:46.720]
I guess now that we've been putting mouth balls who's a straight weather guy and it's done and Bob.

[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:47.480]
And Bob. Soaper.

[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:50.400]
Excuse me Bob. We love Bob. Soaper. He's a good guy.

[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:55.220]
He's the best Bob and Marilyn Soaper. We work with him at WI back in the day.

[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:57.500]
Mandy WQ a hello.

[02:08:58.260 --> 02:09:00.540]
There's a very man. Hello Soaper. I saw Mandy.

[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:03.000]
I saw very man. Hello on King last night for about three seconds.

[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.180]
There's some show he was on. I don't know what it was.

[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:08.460]
Maybe it was on Debra Norville. Oh my gosh.

[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:14.120]
Wow. She is just gone to pieces and very to what a lady.

[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:15.420]
WQ a hello.

[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:16.740]
Hello.

[02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:18.040]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:22.220]
Yes, I'd like to put someone on the pool if he's already not on there.

[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:22.900]
Okay.

[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:27.000]
Are you ready?

[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:28.360]
I'm ready. I'm listening.

[02:09:28.980 --> 02:09:30.080]
Okay. Lonnie Quinn.

[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:31.400]
Lonnie Quinn.

[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:33.180]
Yeah, I can't stand him.

[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:36.140]
He's very arrogant enough. Nox is what I'm hearing.

[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:42.420]
Yeah, it's not just that, but you know, I can't stomach the weather because he's making smart ass jokes.

[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.260]
Oh God. There's nothing worth it on a weather guy making smart ass jokes.

[02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:47.120]
That's right.

[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:49.040]
Thanks, we don't have a great day.

[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:50.300]
You're welcome. You too.

[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:51.140]
Bye-bye.

[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.440]
Lonnie Quinn, what do you say? Should we put him on there?

[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:55.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.

[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:56.560]
I don't want to be like this.

[02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:58.300]
We spent about a half an hour talking about Lonnie Quinn.

[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:01.700]
Well, she's busy with a crying baby back there is something she's busy, okay?

[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:03.800]
She's trying to make a living.

[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:05.400]
She's trying to get away with that baby.

[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:06.000]
Right.

[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:12.540]
So Josh Cordes got shipped off to that reel to a some appearance that Miguel didn't want to do.

[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:14.240]
This is quite a deal we got going on that day.

[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:17.420]
Since we don't have Doreen the Queen running around to a boss Miguel around.

[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:20.200]
So he just does basically whatever the hell he wants to do.

[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:20.740]
That's right.

[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:23.300]
Yeah, what's wrong with that? That's my kind of job.

[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:24.200]
He waited long enough.

[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:24.660]
He paid his dues.

[02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:29.820]
Just like Tom Jicca predicted, you know, that I was going to be calling in the show from, you know, at my whim whenever I felt like working.

[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:31.840]
Well, guess a lot. I don't feel like it anymore today.

[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:35.900]
That's right.

[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:38.280]
That Jicca man, he is just a...

[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:39.340]
No, I got some material.

[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:42.700]
Man, no, it's the rest of my friend's.

[02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:48.340]
Yes, and of course, the emotion of the victory, the agony of the defeat, the popotamo, the popotamo.

[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.920]
I think it's got to be fairly safe. It's a cartoon show.

[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:54.180]
So we're not going to have any bleeps. We're going to have to put in there.

[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:56.240]
No, I think we're safe. Maybe.

[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:02.060]
From it, it's after one at five sixty WQM. We got the mad dog Jim Madditch coming along at two.

[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:04.840]
The Humper from the Belmont man, the tension is growing towards.

[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.600]
Aren't you like pins and needles about smarty Jones? Just needles.

[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.480]
Now, come on, you're going to... you're going to care a little bit about what?

[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:16.240]
About that horse, about winning the triple crown, about champion, about something good for once.

[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:19.260]
You know, I mean, it's not... it's not that important, but it's something positive.

[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:21.900]
No, but a week from tomorrow, I'll pretend to care a lot.

[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:24.280]
Something we latch on to. Why is that?

[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:26.500]
Dave Jones will be calling in, and I'll be talking to him.

[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:27.240]
A week from tomorrow?

[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:29.140]
Isn't that right?

[02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:30.560]
No, he's calling in tomorrow.

[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:33.840]
No, but when I'm on...

[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.520]
Well, why will Dave Johnson be calling?

[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:37.660]
I thought he was going to be calling in on that day.

[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.940]
Yeah, tomorrow, like I just said.

[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:42.520]
Okay. Anybody following this conversation?

[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:45.300]
The Belmont is this Saturday.

[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:50.020]
Now, maybe Dave will be calling in next Friday just to say, hey, look how great we did.

[02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:53.300]
I kind of doubt it. But good luck to you.

[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:57.520]
One third, one third team at five sixty WQM.

[02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:01.180]
Let me tell you, if you're confused about here, because we got...

[02:12:01.180 --> 02:12:03.300]
How many different hair sponsors we got on the station at?

[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:04.180]
About third, man.

[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:08.680]
Everybody and their brothers trying to set you some big song dance with this hair and that hair.

[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:16.340]
I want to make a suggestion from a guy who knows who could be the biggest expert on how bad you can look with a bad piece.

[02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:17.300]
Oh, God about it.

[02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:23.620]
That's right. Forget about these other guys. Talk to Charles Alfieri, because for more than 35 years, Charlie's appeared as a guest on Good Morning America.

[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.620]
The Today Show, CBS Morning News, the Tomorrow Show offering the best looking hairline, the best piece anywhere in the world.

[02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:35.600]
It's called the natural hairline system. It's so good looking. It's 100% undetectable. People think it's your real hair.

[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:43.200]
That's the difference. Very few pieces do people think it's like real hair. Most of them think A is either straw or B is some barnard and I'm going to let him out of the sky.

[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:45.160]
Or maybe a meteor landed on your head.

[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:49.380]
Charles Alfieri gives you this guarantee that you can really have to be crazy to turn down.

[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:51.400]
You try a system for a month, for about...

[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.280]
About third, man.

[02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:57.660]
Thirty days, and after a month, if you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells, just bring it back and say, hey, Charlie, here's your hair.

[02:12:57.660 --> 02:12:58.400]
Forget about it.

[02:12:58.580 --> 02:13:04.120]
And Charlie also services and repairs existing hair systems, including shampoo and trim, usually while you wait.

[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:06.880]
So don't delay, call Charlie the England, change your life forever.

[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:12.740]
Look better when younger than you ever dreamed you could again with some real great looking hair and not a mousey looking piece.

[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:16.320]
Call toll free, 1-800-321-2413.

[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:23.840]
1-800-321-2413, or on that wicked web, say how to Dave Game while you're at it, check them out at Charles Alfieri.com.

[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.360]
My life and look all this is for trade-off I-6-E.

[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:30.420]
You weigh a few a.m.

[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:33.680]
You drenched packin'?

[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:35.740]
Ignorance has never been more blissful.

[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:42.400]
Lending across America are obediently drinking the new Republican flavored Guyana punch-cool-aid.

[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:48.020]
Too late too late, face-pray, treat your too late, and don't pay.

[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:53.600]
Oh, I'm glad I'm a Republican. I like being associated with filthy, nasty animals.

[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:59.200]
Hey, if there's anything I need to know, I can pleasure my show with some Guyana punch-flavored gul-aid and opt-e-rush.

[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:01.680]
One of my trailer hopes smells pretty bad.

[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:03.240]
Better drink some gul-aid.

[02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:08.800]
Too late too late, face-pray, treat your too late, and don't pay.

[02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:14.200]
On-crow to the Republican, why are you wearing on my sleeve as a symbol of wealth and prestige?

[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:18.660]
I believe tax cut to the wealth they support the truth, just like Bush is good for the Jews.

[02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:24.160]
And Time Guyana punch-cool-aid refeshes the best, if you miss chim-jones in Dave Karej.

[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:29.740]
Cool-aid, cool-aid, face-pray, treat your too late, and don't pay.

[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:33.080]
The story of a who's like a American for much, we bought it!

[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:35.280]
Now we can play with you like a little toy.

[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:40.740]
Skies the limit on what you pay for gas, and if we attack you, you'll just retaliate against somebody else.

[02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:44.720]
So keep watching your dumb-down TV, and drink your gul-aid.

[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:50.500]
Gul-aid, cool-aid, face-pray, treat your gul-aid, and don't pay.

[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:55.000]
One-eighteen, by the way, Duff must have had a rough time at the doctor on last Monday.

[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:58.960]
Yeah, we can go Monday because he's slipping and is old age.

[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:01.000]
There's a bit on the new book of Brian Disk.

[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.540]
The chances of that getting played on this show on a scale of zero are minus infinity.

[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:06.720]
It's called Tranny Queen.

[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:08.860]
You won't be hearing that one anytime soon.

[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:13.160]
In fact, if you have a copy of this yourself, you might want to like put a big thing through it right now.

[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:15.200]
Yeah, I'm queuing it up now.

[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:17.380]
You're queuing it up right now?

[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:19.580]
Track four?

[02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:20.280]
Yeah.

[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:21.760]
Don't play it!

[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:23.580]
What's it about?

[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:26.020]
It's about the old Tranny Queen.

[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:27.440]
Ah!

[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:31.140]
Like I said, the answer is no chance.

[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.420]
And don't be a villain for it, Brian, why do you add it?

[02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:35.400]
Oh, too late, I turned that invoice in.

[02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:36.700]
Oh, damn!

[02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:37.900]
You better do a makeup.

[02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:40.340]
At 50 bucks is going to have to come out of muffs salary, I think.

[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:43.160]
How do I help you let that thing slip by?

[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:44.300]
I mean, that thing isn't even close.

[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:46.240]
You'll hear it and we'll discuss it tomorrow.

[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:46.840]
Okay.

[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:47.300]
Off the ear.

[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:48.600]
Let's see.

[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:51.800]
Here's one that says, please add Al Sunshine and his flying finger.

[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:55.040]
I think that's what they've got, Duff, with the old flying finger.

[02:15:55.980 --> 02:16:01.320]
Al Sunshine, the Hamhawk man, as long as I live, I'll never forget that day with that phony hurricane.

[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:04.080]
And Mayor Penis Bicania.

[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:05.360]
See, I can actually say that.

[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:05.760]
Careful.

[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:07.460]
One, no, I can say that.

[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:07.820]
Right.

[02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:10.120]
Yeah, but you almost relapsed.

[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:13.220]
No, I just was trying to like ease into a way there.

[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:15.680]
ease into a piece of opinion.

[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:19.560]
And, yeah, doubt that.

[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:24.980]
But at any rate, he was getting everybody hyperventilating about the hurricane and already had gone by.

[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:28.020]
You can see down the radar, it was already up to Palm Beach County.

[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:32.960]
And all the restaurants and all the establishments are supposed to be closed, the out of all this other crap.

[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:37.140]
And Al Sunshine's up there, he's admonishing the guy in Broward.

[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:38.540]
What was that place?

[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:41.800]
It was a very famous place there on La Solas or something.

[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:43.920]
That diner where everybody has breakfast.

[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:44.480]
Yeah.

[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:46.180]
All the bags hang out like Norm Kent.

[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:49.320]
And anyway, he's like chastising them because they're open for business.

[02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:51.260]
People wanted a place to go eat.

[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:52.280]
There was the hurricane coming.

[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:52.640]
Okay.

[02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:54.160]
Was it Mango's?

[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:54.880]
No.

[02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:55.420]
Okay.

[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:57.660]
And here's Al Sunshine on their waving his hand.

[02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:58.640]
Shame on you.

[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:00.620]
Shame on you, you tub of crap.

[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:01.500]
Go lose some weight.

[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:03.280]
Get off my screen, you idiot.

[02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:05.140]
Shame on you.

[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:06.720]
Disgusting.

[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:07.880]
Piece of turd.

[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:09.300]
Five, six, I see.

[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.740]
They've game they got hidden away somewhere because he's too fat.

[02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:15.140]
But Al Sunshine, they got him on their waving his ham-hawks.

[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:16.600]
He must have naked pictures.

[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:20.560]
Probably 20 cigarette-a-winner or a billy goat or billy bean.

[02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:22.700]
WQA and hello.

[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:23.420]
Ah!

[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:23.900]
Left it.

[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:28.920]
See, now, there is one of the great moments in the history of my life.

[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:31.200]
All I had to do was mention.

[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:35.640]
I just mentioned in passing just jokingly as an aside, Ken Block.

[02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:39.880]
And barely, barely even registered on the Richter scale.

[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:44.900]
And here he is repreasing his performance from almost 30 years ago.

[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:45.860]
Stop turning, man!

[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:46.220]
Ah!

[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:46.920]
Lots of thought.

[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:48.100]
This is his life.

[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:49.500]
I mean, this is just...

[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:50.080]
I have no life.

[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:50.920]
Holy moly.

[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:51.940]
Go brush those teeth.

[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:52.860]
Will you play sweetheart?

[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:56.640]
Go get some listerine and do something about that queen.

[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:57.820]
I mean, man.

[02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:01.560]
Is that amazing to you or what?

[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:02.640]
I know what was going to happen.

[02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:04.140]
Today?

[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:08.000]
As soon as you mentioned his name, I knew I knew I could feel it happening.

[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:09.280]
Oh, brother.

[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:12.200]
Where was that restaurant?

[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:15.920]
We had on the air where we did the appearance.

[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:17.120]
Were they all showed up?

[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:17.820]
The whole group of them?

[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:19.980]
Down in South-Dade.

[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:20.900]
Was it Lorenzo's?

[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:21.520]
It was Lorenzo.

[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:22.640]
I don't know, before my time.

[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:23.760]
No, it was not.

[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000]
Oh, oh, it was there.

[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:26.020]
Where we're out of QAM.

[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:26.960]
It was a QAM thing.

[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:27.980]
It was not before your time.

[02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:29.480]
It was down at Lorenzo's.

[02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:29.900]

[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:31.960]
And they had like a...

[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:32.860]
Google Faire or something.

[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:33.640]
Everybody came in there.

[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:35.040]
They were like, I'll eat in the chocolate stuff.

[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:37.180]
And that whole group showed up.

[02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:39.540]
Including that one too, I believe.

[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:42.760]
This guy's got teeth as yellow.

[02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:44.460]
Even the Chinese would be embarrassed.

[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:45.720]
That's how yellow his teeth are.

[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:50.780]
And there he is doing his Jacoosto routine.

[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:52.680]
28 years later.

[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.680]
It is just as scary as what it is.

[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:56.360]
I have no life.

[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.200]
That's the South Florida motto, baby.

[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:01.700]
There ought to be a gigantic billboard.

[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:04.060]
When you cross the border from Joji into Florida,

[02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:05.380]
I ought to say, I have no life.

[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:06.100]
Big letters.

[02:19:06.700 --> 02:19:08.180]
Forget about those God billboards.

[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:09.240]
Oh, look at this.

[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:11.160]
I can't believe South Florida's answer to Willow and Scott.

[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:13.240]
Jack Horkheimer has made the list.

[02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:14.740]
No, she hasn't yet, but she has now.

[02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:15.640]
Miss Horkheimer.

[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:16.840]
I don't know, she's on TV.

[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:20.680]
Yeah, he does those channel two...

[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:21.840]
Thank you.

[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:22.200]
What do you call it?

[02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:24.700]
The Star Gazer.

[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:25.780]
Star Gazer.

[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:26.800]
The Star Gazer Queen, yeah.

[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:29.040]
Miss Horkheimer will be on there, okay?

[02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:30.720]
She's looking a little long in the tooth.

[02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:36.200]
5670560, pound 566, the only AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:38.080]
I apologize for that night at INZ.

[02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:39.540]
I almost throws you out of the studio, Jack.

[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:41.080]
Not...

[02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:42.780]
WDQA and hello.

[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:44.500]
Hey, you know, the Twin Angles.

[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:45.120]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:46.480]
Hey, I'm free of ball.

[02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:47.320]
Yes?

[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:48.480]
It's probably not in there already.

[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:49.300]
Guck, he's in the race.

[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:50.680]
I will just gotta go.

[02:19:51.140 --> 02:19:52.900]
Okay, she's only got 28 votes.

[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:57.220]
She probably a good idea, either listen when I read the list.

[02:19:57.340 --> 02:19:59.660]
I'll do it again right now, but it's just shocking and shameful.

[02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:03.960]
What's out for a TV person now needs to retire next?

[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:05.680]
Rick Sanchez 160.

[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:08.140]
Oh, I got tomorrow's pool.

[02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.300]
Okay, it's about fat people.

[02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:11.820]
Okay.

[02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:13.500]
Anyone inspired me?

[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:15.780]
Dave Game is still alive, but Dave Vicks and he's dead.

[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:18.140]
Right?

[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:19.060]
Right.

[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:21.300]
What was that guy in MSNBC?

[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:22.980]
Jerry Nochman.

[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:24.300]
Remember that big fat guy?

[02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:24.740]
No.

[02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:27.600]
He was the head of the news on MSNBC.

[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:28.460]
He's dead.

[02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:33.440]
So we're gonna do your favorite fat...

[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:34.540]
Well known fat person.

[02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.100]
All right, we've never done that.

[02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:36.980]
Dead or alive.

[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:39.720]
We're gonna put a weight limit on there because people are gonna be...

[02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:41.220]
Oh, well, we're talking really fat.

[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:42.700]
Well, we'll be the arbiter of that.

[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:43.460]
We're not like me.

[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:44.520]
I don't qualify for that.

[02:20:44.620 --> 02:20:46.080]
I'm fat, but I'm not like...

[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:47.600]
We're talking real fat, you know?

[02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:49.280]
Like John Candy, people like that.

[02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:49.800]
Yeah.

[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:53.860]
People who died from being so fat or may very well soon.

[02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:55.160]
Who's your favorite tub of lard?

[02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:56.400]
Like Kelly Craig.

[02:20:56.580 --> 02:20:57.400]
Oh, and I see that was bad.

[02:20:57.600 --> 02:20:58.980]
Now you've glued me into that.

[02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:00.420]
We love Kelly Craig.

[02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:02.760]
She may be my favorite fat person.

[02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:03.740]
Fat rich.

[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.800]
Although he's not a major celebrity.

[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:07.680]
All the way thinks he is that fat is bad anymore.

[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:08.520]
Fat rich money.

[02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:09.180]
Now you're right.

[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:10.540]
He's lost quite a bit of weight, of course,

[02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:11.740]
when times get lean, you know?

[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:12.720]
So do you.

[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:13.260]
So do your body.

[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:16.880]
What's the floor of the TV personality?

[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:18.300]
Now needs to return to X-Rick Sanchez.

[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:19.820]
I told you, no contest.

[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:22.280]
162 day H-U-Rick.

[02:21:22.480 --> 02:21:24.700]
They despise you and that guy you hit is still dead.

[02:21:26.220 --> 02:21:29.460]
162 votes over 50 percent, 51.2, to be exact.

[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:31.320]
As they say, New Jersey.

[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:33.440]
Belkies in Array 29.

[02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:34.960]
White Lauderdale 24.

[02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:36.820]
20 cigaretteos got 24.

[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:40.220]
Boy, Dwight's moving up there fast, any?

[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:42.400]
Merlin, it's 11.

[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:45.520]
Michel Gillin, Angelo Ray, Bob Mayor, got 10 apiece.

[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:46.700]
Now I think that's bad.

[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:49.900]
Lumpet and Bob Mayor with Michel Gillin, Angelo Ray.

[02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:50.820]
You'll people ought to repent.

[02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:52.060]
You ought to apologize for that.

[02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:54.060]
Kelly Craig.

[02:21:54.700 --> 02:21:56.040]
All that weight in all she's got.

[02:21:56.200 --> 02:21:56.340]
Yeah.

[02:21:58.700 --> 02:21:59.980]
Elliott Rodriguez 6.

[02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:02.160]
Lonnie Quinn's got 6 already.

[02:22:02.540 --> 02:22:04.300]
I don't know who that is, but I'm sure I wouldn't like him.

[02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:05.760]
I've Seaman's 5.

[02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:07.100]
Jennifer Volopi 5.

[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:08.280]
Sloppy Volopi.

[02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:10.480]
Al Sunshine, Mr. Hamhawk 3.

[02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:12.100]
Alyssia Lane finally got 1.

[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.140]
Brian Northclass has 1.

[02:22:14.140 --> 02:22:17.480]
And Miss Harkheimer, she just went on there, so she'll start moving it up pretty soon.

[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:19.820]
WDQA, hello.

[02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:23.140]
Yes, is this WQA?

[02:22:24.700 --> 02:22:25.060]
WQA?

[02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:25.980]
WQA, yes sir, you got it.

[02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:26.700]
Cool.

[02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:27.640]
What do you got?

[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:32.400]
I wanted to give Neil the name of that restaurant at Fort Lauderdale and...

[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:33.200]
You're speaking to him.

[02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:34.560]
Oh.

[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:38.760]
It's called the food, it's full of radiance, sorry.

[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:39.940]
Right, that's the one.

[02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:40.980]
I'm sorry, man.

[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:42.620]
You keep calling me by surprise.

[02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:45.000]
And also, Marilyn Nitzel, she looks like a...

[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.100]
I'm probably going to get cut off, but she looks like a...

[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:48.360]
Okay, where you are, you're right.

[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:53.180]
See, he made a bad move there.

[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:54.300]
See, I could have enjoyed it.

[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:55.060]
You could have enjoyed it.

[02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:57.100]
Miguel might have enjoyed it, but nobody else would have heard it.

[02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:58.920]
He said I'm probably going to get cut off and you're right.

[02:22:59.020 --> 02:22:59.180]
You did.

[02:22:59.260 --> 02:22:59.900]
Well, that's okay.

[02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:01.940]
The Floridian, that's the one.

[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:04.600]
Boy, I ate there once upon a time about 100 years ago.

[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:06.400]
I just...

[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:07.740]
That's not my part of town.

[02:23:07.900 --> 02:23:09.820]
That Lasola, that Artsy Fartsy...

[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:11.340]
That's the gate place?

[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:12.480]
What?

[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:16.220]
No, not necessarily, but it just happens to be that Norma can hangs out there,

[02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:17.680]
so that makes it a little bit more...

[02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:20.340]
It's all the way on the end past all the arts and the farts.

[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:21.740]
What, the Floridian?

[02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:22.180]
Yeah.

[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:24.840]
I know, I've been there, I've eaten there.

[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.480]
I know a little bit about town.

[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:30.780]
I've been around a couple of lifetimes, but that's the one.

[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:35.380]
And here's all people, all sunshine, lecturing the fine folks at the Floridian,

[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:37.780]
which is a very popular place, especially for breakfast.

[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:41.780]
And they're open up when nobody else is open, because people want to eat, okay?

[02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:43.400]
There was no hurricane coming.

[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:44.060]
It was gone.

[02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:45.260]
It was in West Palm Beach.

[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:45.720]
It was up...

[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:48.620]
It was up the gondola north of Alaska with Johnny Horton or somewhere.

[02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:51.360]
And the mayor's on there trying to, you know,

[02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:54.920]
just like all the politicians, just like make a hero out of himself, you know?

[02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:56.300]
Well, I'm going to save all your lives.

[02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:56.980]
Well, guess what?

[02:23:57.100 --> 02:23:59.360]
You would jackass the hurricane's already gone.

[02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:00.280]
Go take a look at it.

[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:01.040]
Una Mapa.

[02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:03.540]
Jeez.

[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:06.840]
And here's the sunshine on their channel for chastising.

[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:08.200]
And lecturing, man.

[02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:10.620]
If anybody needs a good lecture, look at a mirror, schmuck.

[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:14.020]
I have a local, this is 560.

[02:24:14.580 --> 02:24:15.880]
The radio's all yours now.

[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:17.800]
Thank you, Ian.

[02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:21.320]
I'm not the boss.

[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.260]
I'm the real hero.

[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:24.000]
I'm the real hero.

[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:30.200]
This is the Daily Show.

[02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:31.960]
Talk to the Daily Show.

[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.480]
I have everybody.

[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:35.780]
Welcome to the Daily Show.

[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:38.660]
Oh, wait a minute before we go on.

[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:41.020]
Princess Diana's mother dies in Scotland.

[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:41.780]
Are you interested?

[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:42.120]
No.

[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:45.100]
I'm going to change the face of sports radio.

[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:48.780]
Because now, I'm the voice of the dancers.

[02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:51.780]
And an elephant of modern radio.

[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:53.620]
Oh, boy.

[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:57.740]
I don't like to do here.

[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:01.800]
Like, uh, talk to the same three qualities about sports.

[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:03.680]
And sports.

[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:05.740]
And sports.

[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:09.800]
I even got lots of hilarious comedy things.

[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:14.040]
Coach, coach, coach, coach, I'm a coker head.

[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:15.200]
That's it.

[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:17.360]
Take that, Mo.

[02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:21.260]
The old cock-a-sta-sta-sta-sta-sta.

[02:25:21.260 --> 02:25:22.620]
I'm the star now.

[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:25.240]
My old two-star and I was a spy.

[02:25:25.700 --> 02:25:26.760]
You are watched up.

[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:28.240]
Now you're the bum.

[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:30.260]
You can't hit me no more.

[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:32.560]
You can't hit me no more.

[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:33.500]
I can't hit you.

[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:35.280]
You're on the radio, you moron.

[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:36.880]
Oh, I'm a...

[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:37.360]
Hey, look.

[02:25:37.980 --> 02:25:39.620]
Maybe I was a little out of the line.

[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:43.420]
The things I said, uh, like that.

[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:44.620]
Yeah, you were.

[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:46.160]
And I'm not gay.

[02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:47.080]
You're right.

[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:47.400]
I know.

[02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:52.520]
In all fairness, that big fat old guy, they stuck me with tisses me like they used to do.

[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:54.120]
But he's not you.

[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:56.040]
Ah, that's so sweet.

[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:58.600]
You make me almost want to come back with you.

[02:25:58.600 --> 02:25:59.560]
You can go and eat.

[02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:05.120]
Yes, but they, my life, was filled with joy.

[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:07.340]
You can go and eat.

[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:08.600]
Ow!

[02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:12.660]
Now I'm stuck when I go out of love and go.

[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:16.780]
You're my best sidekick and loyal.

[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:20.500]
I miss how you're caught like a girl.

[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:22.260]
You can go and eat.

[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:23.680]
Yes, for hold you.

[02:26:24.740 --> 02:26:25.860]
I miss you.

[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:27.520]
What are you doing?

[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:29.720]
My old old.

[02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:32.980]
I can't knock on back.

[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:34.440]
You're my TV.

[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:37.600]
My old old.

[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:42.480]
I ain't waiting to smack on a show that's seen.

[02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:46.920]
But the same way you have a good time.

[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:50.400]
Why you're waiting on the unemployment line.

[02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:53.320]
Why you have a little man call me from a town.

[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:55.940]
You're my best sidekick.

[02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:57.360]
You're my best sidekick.

[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:00.700]
27-2 at 560.

[02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:01.980]
That's number one with four bullets.

[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:15.000]
U.S. Army speaking of bullets is issued in order to preventing thousands of soldiers designated for duty in Iraq, Afghanistan from leaving the military, even when their volunteer service can emit expires official said yesterday.

[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:16.560]
Oh, I'm leaving.

[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:18.120]
No, think again.

[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:20.660]
Not so fast.

[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:29.480]
The move to extend the service of some soldiers involuntarily was the latest side of increasing stress on the army as the Pentagon straps to maintain adequate troop levels in the two conflicts.

[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:31.740]
They're strict a little on the thin side.

[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:36.520]
And our good friend Ronnie Zamora, Mocee Hino more.

[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:38.400]
In fact, maybe he's with Phil the Bug Man.

[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:41.380]
Do you see what they sent him?

[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:43.180]
Oh, yeah, Costa Rica.

[02:27:43.180 --> 02:27:50.840]
A man whose defense is a 15-year-old was that violent television shows like Kojak, let him to kill an elderly neighbor 27 years ago, was deported yesterday.

[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.220]
It was native Costa Rica.

[02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:53.400]
Nice job, Ellis.

[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:54.440]
You idiot.

[02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:58.100]
Ronnie Zamora, 42, was flown to Costa Rica early yesterday.

[02:27:58.440 --> 02:27:59.240]
Says Nina Pruneida.

[02:27:60.000 --> 02:28:00.880]
Nina Pruneida.

[02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:02.240]
She's the prune lady.

[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:05.480]
A spokesman with the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:07.820]
I wonder if she's related to Isabel de Cassada.

[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:13.060]
He was released from prison Tuesday in the federal custody after spending the last 27 years behind bars.

[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:16.120]
He was sentenced to life in prison for fatally shooting 83-year-old Elr.

[02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:16.940]
While we already know that.

[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.740]
We talked about him the other day.

[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:22.580]
Oh, see, that's all there is to that.

[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:27.020]
He's in Costa Rica now, probably in the wilderness of the rainforest, probably searching for Phil the Bug Man.

[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:28.700]
What?

[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:29.880]
We'll see Hino Zamora.

[02:28:31.620 --> 02:28:32.560]
How do you know that?

[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:35.920]
Maybe they can be intoxicated together with or without the TV.

[02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:39.420]
So let me tell you about Greg Vudelle.

[02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:39.880]
I'm sorry.

[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:43.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:44.380]
Oh, I can't tell you.

[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:45.660]
Calm 5, 60 on it.

[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:47.840]
It was a story about the old sterling country kitchen.

[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:50.620]
Come to QA and hello.

[02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:53.840]
WQM, hello.

[02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:54.580]
Relief.

[02:28:56.280 --> 02:28:56.640]
Wow.

[02:28:57.820 --> 02:28:58.600]
Ron is back.

[02:28:58.780 --> 02:28:59.300]
Aren't you excited?

[02:28:59.480 --> 02:28:59.940]
Aren't you thrilled?

[02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:00.700]
Thrilled and delighted.

[02:29:01.900 --> 02:29:03.840]
Let's get, like, an ambulance early.

[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:04.660]
It's the only June.

[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:05.900]
But let's get, like, a cruise.

[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:07.340]
Christmas gift ready for Ron.

[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:08.600]
I'll start wrapping the package.

[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:13.160]
70 QA and hello.

[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:14.320]
Hi, dear.

[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:15.260]
Yes, sir.

[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:15.800]
Am I the mobile?

[02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:17.880]
Let's go to a mobile now.

[02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:19.260]
It sounds like Reverend Jones to me.

[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:21.260]
I don't know who he is.

[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:21.620]
Yeah.

[02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:22.480]
It's you.

[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:25.700]
I'm getting better than you are on that, or at least close as good.

[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:26.860]
No, it was him.

[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:28.380]
No kidding.

[02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:29.180]
No Schmidt.

[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:31.780]
It takes about two words now.

[02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:35.820]
You got that certain sound like retard, dehuman defective in your voice.

[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:36.180]
Okay?

[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:37.280]
You and your boyfriend there.

[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:40.380]
And Dick Feinberg says don't even show your acid pomp in the park anymore.

[02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:42.340]
WQM, hello.

[02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:43.700]
Hey, Neil, why are you now?

[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:44.380]
Pretty good.

[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.160]
Can I just vent a little bit?

[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:46.600]
You got a minute?

[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:47.660]
Go in and have it.

[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:48.360]
Got all the time you want.

[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:49.060]
Take a couple of hours.

[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:50.120]
All right.

[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:53.200]
We're in an hour out in the soft floor of the street today.

[02:29:53.640 --> 02:29:55.880]
I go to McDonald's just to get a freaking coffee, right?

[02:29:56.380 --> 02:29:58.320]
And then there's all confusion in the front of the line.

[02:29:58.420 --> 02:29:59.680]
Is this person going to speak English?

[02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:01.120]
They can't count the change correctly.

[02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:06.860]
And the park my car is the old hand gets out of a car and drags her purse along the whole side of my car.

[02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:09.240]
Nothing works here.

[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:10.320]
I hate that place.

[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:11.760]
I got four letter of answer for it.

[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:12.780]
Sir, MOVE, move.

[02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:13.220]
Get out.

[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:15.100]
When a doubt gets out of the car.

[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:15.960]
It's good enough for me.

[02:30:16.060 --> 02:30:16.660]
It's good enough for you.

[02:30:16.780 --> 02:30:19.260]
Just, you know, probably can't get a deal like I got going here.

[02:30:19.380 --> 02:30:21.780]
But I tell you one thing, man, I got the best deal going.

[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:22.440]
Yeah.

[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:23.560]
I do.

[02:30:23.700 --> 02:30:24.060]
I really do.

[02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:24.700]
I do.

[02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:25.740]
The first one I'll tell you that.

[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:27.060]
I'm not one of these people always, eh.

[02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:30.080]
And, you know, soft floor to like through wine and cry a lot.

[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:32.300]
You know, I'm not into that thing anymore.

[02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:32.900]
Not no more.

[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:33.540]
I used to be.

[02:30:33.700 --> 02:30:35.320]
You don't have anything to whine about because you're out of that.

[02:30:35.420 --> 02:30:35.540]
That's right.

[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:38.380]
Now that I'm not there most of the time, I have very little to complain about.

[02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:39.340]
My life is wonderful.

[02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:40.100]
Life is sweet.

[02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:40.700]
Life is great.

[02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:42.100]
I'll be going on vacation very soon.

[02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:44.300]
Before you know it will be July and then July and August.

[02:30:44.440 --> 02:30:45.240]
George will be on most days.

[02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:46.420]
I'll be on only Tuesday and Thursday.

[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:48.140]
And the paychecks keep rolling in.

[02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:49.200]
And what's not to like?

[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:51.480]
I might just extend my contract a hundred years.

[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:52.480]
I?

[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:53.560]
Not.

[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:54.500]
Oh, that's right.

[02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:55.120]
You'd like that.

[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:56.040]
Sure.

[02:30:56.520 --> 02:30:56.700]
Yeah.

[02:30:56.880 --> 02:30:57.040]
I'll would.

[02:30:57.940 --> 02:30:58.300]
I'll be there with you.

[02:30:58.300 --> 02:30:58.840]
Look at me.

[02:30:58.840 --> 02:31:00.500]
I'm going to be there with you without me.

[02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:01.660]
But there's some other people there.

[02:31:01.860 --> 02:31:03.380]
They're like, you know, clean on.

[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:06.540]
I have a whole lot of clean on the appendages.

[02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:11.180]
People are like their existence is based on my continuing to breathe the fresh air, continuing

[02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:11.520]
the city.

[02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:13.080]
But every day which I can do.

[02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:15.160]
I can do this like with my eyes closed.

[02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:16.220]
You know what I mean?

[02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:22.220]
The best thing that the best thing that I ever did in my life besides making this deal was.

[02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:24.660]
I just don't care about the calls.

[02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:26.760]
I mean, it's a no interest to me.

[02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:27.840]
And they don't believe that.

[02:31:28.020 --> 02:31:29.620]
They really think that, ah, I really got it.

[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:30.400]
I don't care.

[02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:35.040]
See, it's no consequence as long as all the decimal points in the right place on the check

[02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:36.120]
and the amounts are right.

[02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:37.380]
That's all I care about.

[02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:40.260]
And we're still here doing a fine job.

[02:31:40.400 --> 02:31:40.820]
Kick and ask.

[02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:42.180]
We got the highest numbers on the station.

[02:31:42.280 --> 02:31:46.040]
And spite of this, ethnic sewer that we're in the middle of here with all these, uh,

[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:49.700]
no speaking English stations and all this hip hop rafters and rap that.

[02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:53.160]
In spite of all of that crap that we're up against the odds, we're still kicking ass.

[02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:56.600]
Like I said, Greg Weeds got to hurt you the size of Montana up his ass.

[02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:59.860]
He's got to have because he hasn't got any idea what he's doing.

[02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:02.160]
He would know a microphone from his elbow.

[02:32:05.160 --> 02:32:08.740]
And yet in spite of all of these things, we just keep puking Rae Elmas in.

[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:09.740]
No, I know.

[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:11.100]
What's not to like?

[02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:14.000]
What come you off on that tangent?

[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:14.580]
I don't know.

[02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:15.560]
Move.

[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.360]
Just, ah, well, it's a beautiful day.

[02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:22.160]
The sun is shining for Castanol, who's very obsessed with the Toronto weather forecast,

[02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:22.880]
evidently.

[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:24.040]
Sun is shining.

[02:32:24.220 --> 02:32:25.380]
It's 18 degrees Celsius.

[02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:26.540]
It's 64 degrees.

[02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:28.740]
It's going to be a high of 20 day, 68.

[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:33.300]
19 and more of 66 sunny in 22 on Saturday, 72.

[02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:36.600]
And mostly sunny in 23, 73 Fahrenheit on Sunday.

[02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:37.380]
How do you like that?

[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:38.220]
No more rain inside.

[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:38.720]
We had enough.

[02:32:39.860 --> 02:32:40.220]
Beautiful.

[02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:41.940]
I can't wait to go out to lunch.

[02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:44.520]
See what I'm saying?

[02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:45.540]
What's not to like?

[02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:46.540]
None.

[02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:48.560]
Everything is beautiful.

[02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:50.960]
And of course, a lot of people in South Florida, we don't like that.

[02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:53.600]
You know, they want to, they want to extend that hostility.

[02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:55.260]
And now I understand that, sure.

[02:32:55.660 --> 02:32:58.860]
Because when I'm there just a week at a time, a couple weeks at a time, whatever it is,

[02:32:58.940 --> 02:33:00.220]
I get very angry too.

[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:03.820]
Except for this last time that I was there for some reason, everything was beautiful.

[02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:05.600]
I don't know why.

[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:07.740]
Everything was like a dirty.

[02:33:08.060 --> 02:33:09.220]
It was a productive week.

[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:11.560]
My dentist, I went to the dentist and my teeth cleaned up.

[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:15.880]
Oh, and by the way, I do want to say this, my good friend, Dr. My dentist, Dr. Gary.

[02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:16.640]
Why?

[02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:17.780]
Who's the best?

[02:33:17.900 --> 02:33:18.280]
He's great.

[02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:19.340]
Over there, a tapton.

[02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:19.840]
What is he?

[02:33:19.980 --> 02:33:20.760]
A tapton, you're Johnson.

[02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:24.160]
But his dental hygienist, you know, who cleaned my teeth?

[02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:24.840]
Yeah.

[02:33:24.860 --> 02:33:25.460]
See, she's wrong.

[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:27.320]
And I don't, because you were to feel bad.

[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:31.320]
Did I tell you what she told me about the toothbrush, the radius toothbrush?

[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:31.880]
No.

[02:33:33.340 --> 02:33:36.720]
Because my teeth back in the, we're back in the molders way in the back.

[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000]
I had some, what do you call it?

[02:33:40.020 --> 02:33:40.740]
I don't know.

[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:41.220]
You call it.

[02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:41.540]
Oh, okay.

[02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:44.460]
And anyway, she's a woman and she's the gums again.

[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:47.540]
A little, of course, I hadn't been in a year and a half with just too long.

[02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:49.980]
I'm supposed to do it like every six months or a year, whatever.

[02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:54.140]
And she's giving me, when I told her, I said, well, I used that radius toothbrush.

[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:56.840]
Ah, her eyes looked up like a Hanukkah bush, man.

[02:33:56.940 --> 02:33:59.080]
She had got nothing but bad news with that.

[02:33:59.160 --> 02:33:59.960]
Everybody uses it.

[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:02.600]
They've had bad experiences because it doesn't reach back there.

[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:04.240]
Well, that's baloney.

[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:05.800]
There is nothing like the radius toothbrush.

[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:08.920]
You just have to learn and nerd at how to use it right.

[02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:13.440]
So when you're reaching up into the back parts there, you just have to be sure you hit everywhere.

[02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:14.100]
Yes.

[02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:15.380]
Just because it's further.

[02:34:15.380 --> 02:34:21.160]
Because nowadays the toothbrushes that they're making are like, they cover like a half of your front tooth.

[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:24.740]
What kind of a job brushing your teeth can you do with a piece of crap like that?

[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:29.640]
And like I told you, those electric, those little battery operative gizzles, you know, they're doing.

[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:32.720]
All they're doing is loosening up all the mercury vapors in your teeth.

[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:37.920]
If you have any fillings and all that's going into your system and making you sick, that's not good for you.

[02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:38.300]

[02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:39.360]
I have nothing but fillings.

[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:40.520]
Me too.

[02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:42.560]
Sandier, use one of them little batteries.

[02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:44.280]
No, no, not me.

[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:46.080]
I heard your wife is.

[02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:47.740]
Nothing your mouth.

[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:49.780]
That's what I was talking about.

[02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:58.140]
But anyway, and then the other stuff that I did with all the rest of my tests and my ass and my this and my dad and all my body parts.

[02:34:59.340 --> 02:34:59.580]
Right.

[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:03.060]
And it came into my blood, my PSA was fine.

[02:35:03.780 --> 02:35:04.960]
And what's nothing like?

[02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:07.480]
So like Marty Python says, look at that bright side.

[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:09.580]
We've got too many sour people in South Florida, okay?

[02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:11.160]
I can't help but that you're stuck there.

[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:17.360]
We're sports radio 5CC, 2AM.

[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:22.080]
They state the girls go out!

[02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:28.300]
An ancient evil lots returner.

[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:31.080]
I wonder if any of the world is never known.

[02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:33.040]
Oh hello, how it's done?

[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:36.060]
Now, one secret government agency.

[02:35:36.620 --> 02:35:39.180]
Welcome to the Federal Communication Commission.

[02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:40.820]
It looks like a fat black man.

[02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:41.960]
It's been called a problem.

[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:44.140]
To stand against that.

[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:46.320]
You missed your hands on the pants of the warmest ocean.

[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:48.020]
There are enemies that go with you.

[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:48.620]
To the night.

[02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:50.480]
And we?

[02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:52.200]
How do I use the glue?

[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:52.860]
BOOM!

[02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:54.480]
Never done it.

[02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:55.400]
It's good for the end, William.

[02:35:55.740 --> 02:35:56.340]
How do I kill it?

[02:35:56.600 --> 02:35:57.340]
Hell, jaw.

[02:35:57.960 --> 02:35:58.320]
Wow.

[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:01.080]
Now banned from a radio near you.

[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:02.060]
145.

[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:03.920]
I'll tell you who else should have been banned from this station.

[02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:04.820]
What, what, what, why?

[02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:05.140]
Yeah.

[02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:08.440]
Otherwise, maybe we might have a shot at putting the stern on there, you know it.

[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:10.300]
But because of what, what, what, what, what?

[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:11.560]
And it could have happened little Tommy.

[02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:14.440]
You know that, but you keep writing all the Pablo Mansions in your column

[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:16.020]
and pretending you don't know this from that.

[02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:17.240]
Whatever you like.

[02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:21.300]
What sound for the TV personnel that needs to retire next?

[02:36:21.400 --> 02:36:22.200]
That's our first poll.

[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:23.220]
Our first poll was about,

[02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:24.420]
Spixer won't speak English.

[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:28.460]
The second one, Rick Sanchez is leading the way speaking of that.

[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:29.280]
Well, he's speaking English.

[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:32.040]
In fact, I would rather than just stick to the Spanish, you know it,

[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:32.860]
when he can write down to it.

[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:35.020]
And they probably don't want any part of me there.

[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:35.420]
No.

[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:39.700]
Well, Rick Sanchez 190, Spooky's an array of 35.

[02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:42.200]
A lot of people get Spooky's when they see her on her screen,

[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:43.780]
even if they don't know what that means.

[02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:45.280]
Tony Cigarette was got 28.

[02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:46.280]
He's tied with white lottery.

[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:49.200]
They're separated into hip or joined 28 apiece.

[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:51.900]
Like Simon's twins, one little darker.

[02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:53.580]
Marilyn Mitchell 13.

[02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:55.960]
Michelle Gillen and Angela Ray and Kelly Craig.

[02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:58.000]
We can't separate those three 11 apiece.

[02:36:58.560 --> 02:36:59.420]
Like Simon's triplets.

[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:01.980]
Kelly's the pivot lady on that group.

[02:37:04.460 --> 02:37:05.760]
Maybe that's what happened.

[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:06.500]
He'd say nothing.

[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:07.980]
Maybe that's the deal.

[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:11.460]
Maybe Kelly, well, Bob Mayor 10.

[02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:13.560]
Lonnie Quinn is moving up nicely.

[02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:15.220]
And I haven't still known who the hell it is.

[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:16.160]
I'm glad I missed him.

[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:17.120]
He's got nine.

[02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:19.360]
Jennifer Sloppies got six.

[02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:20.440]
Elliot Rodriguez six.

[02:37:20.580 --> 02:37:21.220]
No speaking English.

[02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:21.840]
A key.

[02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:23.400]
I see Mrs. Got five.

[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:24.780]
Move his ass up there.

[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:25.940]
Old Koot.

[02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:27.640]
Al Sunshine five.

[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:29.200]
And I hate you with the Floridian by the way.

[02:37:29.200 --> 02:37:31.200]
If you ever eat a meal with the Floridian,

[02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:33.540]
I can only imagine what they're going to serve up on your food.

[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:35.500]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:37.720]
Alicia Lane two Brian or cross one.

[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:39.020]
And Miss Horkheimer don't have any.

[02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:39.920]
And you want to know why?

[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:41.040]
Because she's on PBS.

[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:42.460]
Does anybody watch PBS?

[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:42.960]
No.

[02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:43.320]
No.

[02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:45.400]
They might watch Frontline once in a while.

[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:47.260]
There's something really interesting on there.

[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:50.600]
But other than that, do you ever watch PBS?

[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:51.120]
No.

[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:51.560]
No.

[02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:53.460]
Miguel?

[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:54.880]
No.

[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:55.540]
No.

[02:37:56.440 --> 02:37:58.020]
In fact, there's a better chance I might watch.

[02:37:58.020 --> 02:37:58.640]
I'll stop and watch.

[02:37:58.820 --> 02:37:59.480]
There's something on it.

[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:00.680]
What are the call-ups?

[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:01.720]
What way am I used to be?

[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:02.460]
Is it still whammy?

[02:38:03.020 --> 02:38:03.760]
I'm not sure.

[02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:06.980]
No, you're not talking about PBS.

[02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:08.340]
You're not talking about Sesame Street.

[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:10.720]
Isn't that on PBS?

[02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:11.180]
Yeah.

[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:13.140]
Of course, that's on our house 24 set.

[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:13.640]
I see.

[02:38:14.100 --> 02:38:14.420]
Whammy!

[02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:15.880]
Get on it, sucks.

[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:16.320]
Yeah.

[02:38:17.460 --> 02:38:19.540]
Don't say that out loud though, because Bill,

[02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:20.660]
what's his name, I could have said.

[02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:21.280]
I still can't.

[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:22.420]
I got a middle block on that one.

[02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:23.480]
Is it?

[02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:23.900]
Bill tech.

[02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:24.580]
That's very good.

[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:27.800]
Oh, I got to have that.

[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:29.080]
Come on, boy, before the show.

[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:29.920]
It is?

[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:30.520]
Oh, W.

[02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:31.720]
Oh, W?

[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:32.760]
Oh, no.

[02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:33.800]
Trust me.

[02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:35.480]
I got, I'll allow theme.

[02:38:35.740 --> 02:38:36.060]
That's it.

[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:38.280]
No, it goes on forever.

[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:39.180]
Oh, yeah.

[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:40.200]
Oh, it's the whole bit.

[02:38:40.420 --> 02:38:41.120]
Yeah, I just put it on.

[02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:43.560]
Oh, was that, that it just goes on forever?

[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:44.200]
Yeah.

[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:45.180]
That's it.

[02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:48.360]
Oh, yeah.

[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:49.080]
Oh, yeah.

[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:49.960]
Oh, yeah.

[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:50.040]
Oh, yeah.

[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:50.340]
Oh, yeah.

[02:38:50.740 --> 02:38:52.120]
Never even knew we had that.

[02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:52.880]
That's great.

[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:55.240]
And the best part of it is it's one that we can still play.

[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:56.740]
So how many we got now?

[02:38:56.780 --> 02:38:57.660]
About third, man.

[02:38:57.820 --> 02:38:59.220]
Plus those cast and over bits I played.

[02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:00.360]
They boy, he's going to own me.

[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:01.560]
Man.

[02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:04.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:06.580]
Hope he's got a big truck.

[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:08.080]
What a lunatic.

[02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:09.080]
What a maniac.

[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:11.160]
What a, you know, you don't really send him off.

[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:12.720]
And it's years ago now.

[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:13.900]
It's got to be a few years ago.

[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.060]
Back when PD Lenny was called.

[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:17.100]
Not thought that missed a couple of years ago, because I was here.

[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:21.080]
Get a call one day from PD Lenny and our sales department begging,

[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:22.860]
pleading, oh, Paulie's coming.

[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:25.480]
And he's coming up with a clear channel.

[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:26.520]
And he wants out.

[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:27.920]
He wants to do the morning show.

[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:28.340]
Yeah.

[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:30.540]
And this is before there was any moa guarantee of that.

[02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:31.080]
Absolutely.

[02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:33.380]
This was after they blew up the worst team.

[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:36.260]
And he was trying desperately to force his way in.

[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:37.900]
And the answer then was no.

[02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:39.120]
And the answer now is no.

[02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:39.540]
Okay.

[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:41.680]
And he lies about it.

[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:42.880]
He just goes out there and denies it.

[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:46.040]
And then he makes it a story that I had Norm Kent try to get in on FM over there.

[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:47.220]
How the hell is that possible?

[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:48.400]
I'm going to work for a cheap channel.

[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:49.640]
Are they going to pay me any money?

[02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:49.840]
No.

[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:51.000]
What are we talking about?

[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.100]
Make some just crap like running into me at the Saras Polly.

[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:56.740]
Please get yourself some help.

[02:39:56.740 --> 02:39:57.360]
I have no life.

[02:39:57.380 --> 02:39:57.660]
God.

[02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:01.760]
Desperado, like I said, another one of those klingons, one of those wannabes.

[02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:02.580]
Obsessed.

[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:07.340]
WQA and hello.

[02:40:08.220 --> 02:40:08.860]
Like the Neil?

[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:09.680]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:10.680]
Is the Neil?

[02:40:11.140 --> 02:40:12.140]
It sounds just like Neil.

[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:15.540]
Neil, you know who Moe Howard reminds me of a little bit?

[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:16.300]
Who's that?

[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:18.640]
He's a character that came out in the, uh,

[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:20.500]
and I'm one of the midnight called powder,

[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:22.520]
starring, uh, J.C. Lopez.

[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:24.200]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

[02:40:24.820 --> 02:40:26.840]
Now see, this is a, this is a imitation.

[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:27.360]
Yeah.

[02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:29.500]
Yeah, this is an imitation, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:30.220]
How do you like that?

[02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:30.680]
Wow.

[02:40:30.980 --> 02:40:32.840]
Even the chronics have their own imitators.

[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:33.340]
That's amazing.

[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:36.120]
Very weak.

[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:37.220]
Keep, keep working on them.

[02:40:37.220 --> 02:40:37.880]
Man, you can do it.

[02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:38.540]
You can cut it.

[02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:39.640]
Very weak.

[02:40:40.060 --> 02:40:42.940]
I'm surprised that that guy's got the, the gargling gun.

[02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:45.060]
Now you got that mold thing there, which I don't have on mine.

[02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:46.620]
Yeah, that.

[02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:48.920]
Keep practicing powders.

[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:50.620]
One for you to work on speaking of Moe.

[02:40:52.500 --> 02:40:53.160]
WDQM, hello.

[02:40:53.900 --> 02:40:54.300]
Heal.

[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:55.040]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:55.700 --> 02:40:57.100]
I noticed the other day that, uh,

[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:00.160]
George needs to be having a obsession with the taser

[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:01.480]
versus the stun gun thing.

[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:02.040]
Yes.

[02:41:02.980 --> 02:41:03.740]
What is that?

[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:04.920]
What is his obsession with that?

[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:05.720]
Well, you ask him.

[02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:06.880]
What's your obsession with that, George?

[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:08.880]
There are tasers and there are stun guns

[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:09.800]
and there are two different things

[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:11.420]
and they are all confusing them.

[02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:13.060]
Why do you think that he's obsessed with it,

[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:13.180]
though?

[02:41:13.220 --> 02:41:14.880]
I find that an interesting choice of words.

[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:18.260]
The average person really doesn't care

[02:41:18.260 --> 02:41:20.040]
about the difference between a state by taser.

[02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:21.280]
Then why are you calling a button

[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:22.480]
and wasting our time with it again?

[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:24.800]
I didn't think we really wasted very much time.

[02:41:24.860 --> 02:41:26.340]
We talked about that for about how many seconds?

[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:27.360]
I'm turning it in man.

[02:41:27.460 --> 02:41:29.320]
No, this guy, this guy is bringing it again

[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:30.400]
because he has no other material

[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:31.240]
and because also,

[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:31.860]
I have no life.

[02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:32.040]
Right.

[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.080]
It was the farthest thing from my mind

[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:37.280]
when I sat my fat pimpley ass down here this morning

[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:38.660]
was tasers and stun guns,

[02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:39.800]
although quite frankly, sir,

[02:41:40.060 --> 02:41:40.940]
if you'd like us to come over

[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:42.320]
and maybe some Luca Bratzie there,

[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:43.200]
we'll show you the difference.

[02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:43.800]
Right.

[02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:46.260]
One of each in the Western charge.

[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:47.900]
I've forgotten about it already,

[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:48.980]
but obviously, uh,

[02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:50.060]
well, he was, uh,

[02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:51.360]
I'm glad he reminded you

[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:52.560]
because that would be bad.

[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:55.040]
Oh my god, more.

[02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:56.280]
This is,

[02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:56.540]
this is,

[02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:56.820]
this is,

[02:41:57.100 --> 02:41:57.160]
this is,

[02:41:57.160 --> 02:41:57.420]
this is,

[02:41:57.560 --> 02:41:57.560]

[02:41:57.640 --> 02:41:57.640]

[02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:57.720]

[02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:57.720]

[02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:58.420]
this is,

[02:41:58.520 --> 02:41:59.300]
this is,

[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:01.620]
this is,

[02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:01.740]
this is,

[02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:01.740]

[02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:01.820]
this is,

[02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:01.820]

[02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:01.820]

[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:05.280]
this is,

[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:21.340]
this is,

[02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:57.880]
this is,

[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:15.360]
this is,

[02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:45.380]
this is,

[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:46.200]
this is,

[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:46.200]

[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:47.060]
this,

[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:49.800]
this is,

[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:49.800]

[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:49.800]

[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:49.800]

[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:49.800]

[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:52.960]
I've got

[02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:04.400]
too many pills,

[02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:04.860]
can I eat them all?

[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:05.240]
So many morons

[02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:10.480]
Must fall in hell of virgin and stoke with no objection at all

[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:18.400]
Then the crap don't have the fault and the right wing is really get over and over and over

[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:22.860]
To operate wash pants by ragassum

[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:26.040]
Weapons of master's instructions

[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:28.160]
I'm dying on the hands

[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:30.760]
Only a ragassum

[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:34.160]
Weapons of master's instructions

[02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:45.380]
One fifty seven and five sixty wm here's a fact from Larry who says I don't care what anyone says about Kelly Craig

[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:51.520]
She's yummy. I've got a phone book. She can sit on any day. Larry says and probably more than that at any rate

[02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:55.940]
I'm starting to disappoint some of our colleagues here today. I guess that we're gonna devote the whole show

[02:44:55.940 --> 02:44:58.660]
We start time to the comments of some dumb jock

[02:44:59.780 --> 02:45:00.800]
That's that's the

[02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:07.800]
Buzz around the building that was that was the buzz huh? Yeah, that's right this morning

[02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:11.880]
Oh, yeah this morning and Moe was betting now you know, Roger's gonna talk about this all day

[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:16.280]
He's our resident packet. He's gonna be talking about junior sale because I guarantee I'll bet Kelly's life on it

[02:45:16.280 --> 02:45:21.460]
Yeah, that's something like that. Yeah, we talked about it for a minute. We are a unit that cares

[02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:27.760]
And I'm saying care the reason why I say care because it's so hard to let things go when you care about it

[02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:33.730]
Yeah, when you care about it. I would say love and then everyone say that you're a failure. Well, I'm not

[02:45:34.690 --> 02:45:36.210]
I'm not I'm not either

[02:45:36.810 --> 02:45:42.350]
Sure, whatever you say junior get the honey. I mean just stupid just idiocy and crap and it make it big

[02:45:42.350 --> 02:45:46.390]
Oh my god, I would be surprised at the whole rest of the day that there's wind up talking about that

[02:45:47.010 --> 02:45:50.190]
We don't get here a blockhead because you know, we're busy

[02:45:50.190 --> 02:45:51.910]
confagulating through those two hours

[02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:54.870]
But I sounded to me like at the end of the show

[02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:59.530]
He's gonna be hearing more about that next and all the oddie oddie oddie under the mad dog will talk about it

[02:45:59.530 --> 02:46:02.570]
Mad dog yeah, he'd be talking about guys who are lightening their loafers

[02:46:02.570 --> 02:46:08.110]
I'm sure about that he's a very handsome young man, right because it's part of that whole jock thing this whole macho

[02:46:08.110 --> 02:46:13.450]
I'm more mucher than you are and I slept guys and he asked with a towel and a shower is all this other stuff

[02:46:13.450 --> 02:46:19.110]
You know play all those games kind of like the stuff that went on at Abu Garib and probably still is going on

[02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:20.790]
You know kind of like that stuff all that factory

[02:46:21.890 --> 02:46:27.590]
It's amazing to me how many macho guys are involved in like you know, showering together a lot even when they're not even during the offseason

[02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:29.290]
That's the part that bothers me a little bit

[02:46:29.770 --> 02:46:33.350]
It's one thing after a ball game. You know, we got to get clean. You know like free winds figure

[02:46:34.750 --> 02:46:39.650]
But end drop the soap a couple of times and then of course that body wash comes in and real slippery bottles now

[02:46:40.350 --> 02:46:42.670]
And remember remember what they said in the bit

[02:46:43.390 --> 02:46:46.990]
You should like to feel relaxed once again. That's exactly what they said. Welcome

[02:46:48.250 --> 02:46:53.910]
Anyway, don't forget join QM in a marlins for a watch party go over there and watch it take a peek at it
