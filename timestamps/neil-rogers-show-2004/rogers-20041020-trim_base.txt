[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700]
Now

[00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.660]
I

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.660]
Supported for shelter that tragic day and to my surprise

[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.180]
Discussed in shame he let those sorties in the lady get away and shifted the blame

[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.720]
We're not doing my

[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.060]
Grunt

[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.580]
They're not the ones for what happened

[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.620]
They're not the ones for what happened

[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.120]
What's going on with this car?

[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.780]
They're not the ones for what happened

[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.500]
Where are we piling? I racked

[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.240]
The fence concert was all having fun

[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.400]
As we spread freedom

[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.080]
The point of the deal

[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.860]
There's plenty of problems and only just be some work

[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.520]
They be RGE and Hello Burton

[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.580]
Leave his peace and they are kids too dark

[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.860]
And the dueling mug works to support this guy

[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.320]
An advanced head of syphilis must be the reason why

[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.540]
They believe your choice is Jesus Christ

[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.180]
They're right

[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.580]
They're up you piling I racked

[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.320]
They're not the ones for what happened

[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.100]
They're not the ones for what happened

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.680]
What's going on with this rack?

[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.060]
They're not the ones for what happened

[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.220]
Boy George why do you hate so many vacation?

[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.740]
It's hard work

[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.360]
It's hard work

[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.280]
Everybody knows it's hard work

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.460]
We've got a lot of hard work

[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.320]
I see on the TV screens how hard it is

[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.000]
It is so hard

[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.100]
I play that again right now

[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800]
That was great

[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.740]
I liked it

[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.460]
I hadn't heard that yet

[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.100]
That bit?

[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.540]
Yeah

[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120]
Hey I got the new crap today

[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.420]
We're not mucking around

[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940]
We're putting it in the gear now

[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.620]
We're not holding back

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.840]
What's it mean by that monkey comment?

[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.380]
Let me ask you something

[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.920]
I'm looking at my poll

[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.280]
Maybe it's my computer again

[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.300]
Because you're always telling me well

[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.880]
You haven't refreshed and you haven't

[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.140]
Do you have it douche?

[00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.900]
Do you have it douche?

[00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.600]
What's the story?

[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.340]
Because I still see the old poll on there

[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.340]
We're having some internet problems

[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.940]
I don't know if Eric can hear us yet

[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.540]
Josh went out during the break and said to someone

[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.560]
Something

[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.840]
Yeah

[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.760]
But we were not streaming and might still not be

[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.760]
No we were streaming again

[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.020]
Well he said that we were but you never know

[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.280]
And what's Eric's fan-eric use up there again?

[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.640]
We already got a couple of facts saying that we're not streaming

[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.380]
And are we streaming now or not?

[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.960]
Because I don't know

[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.960]
I do like a really good show

[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.580]
If the people on the internet can't hear it

[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.460]
We have audio now

[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.700]
Okay we have audio now

[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.960]
Which means get the new poll on there

[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.920]
Eric can quick-dittle it around

[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.920]
Okay he'd air it did a great job on that thing yesterday for the polling places in Broward

[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.180]
Yes

[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.560]
I'm wondering though why we only had the Broward ones and after ones in date

[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.640]
That's the site

[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.260]
That's what comes up on the site

[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.580]
There's a different place for data

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.760]
I don't know what it is we have to go through more to research

[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.260]
Whatever

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.500]
But in any way we got not only the put all the locations on there but even the map

[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.040]
I mean it's number than sawdust it shows you exactly

[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.420]
I mean we did everything except like send a limbo to pick you up and take you there to vote for John Kerry and for Betty Castoroyle

[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.880]
And for prop 4 and against prop 3

[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.320]
So get with it

[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.420]
I mean isn't everybody in date voting for Bush anyways?

[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.000]
We don't know

[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.440]
In fact I got a great story about that coming up a little bit later on

[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.420]
Here's a preview of some of my bedtime stories

[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.380]
Well I got some good crap today

[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.540]
Oh early voting problems in Boka again

[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.960]
No rocking the Cuban vote from the nation

[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.840]
Well wonderful nation

[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.940]
You notice the only two things that they have left to talk about is that Kerry is too freaking liberal

[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.440]
And number two that he picked on Chinese daughter

[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.160]
Penny is still hooking with that crap

[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.680]
He's right

[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.760]
Well she was fair game they used that expression

[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.600]
And therefore it was obviously something that was pre-planned all this other crap

[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.360]
What the hell does that mean?

[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.460]
What she meant by saying she was fair game means that she's out of the closet

[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.980]
That there was no impropriety in talking about her being a dike

[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.440]
That's exactly what that means

[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.200]
But they're continuing to cater to the dumbest of the dumb

[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.920]
And the fact that they don't understand is they already got those people

[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.800]
They got them locked up

[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.660]
They got all the trailer track

[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.140]
Just look at that electoral map those red states again man

[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.420]
That's them

[00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.480]
Dumb as us

[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.580]
Okay let me vote on here

[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.840]
This is going to be tough

[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.160]
This could be the toughest pool I've ever taken

[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.640]
We've done this before right?

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.140]
Yes, yes we have been various forms

[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.480]
In various incarnations

[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.180]
How about those red socks by the way?

[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.680]
I went to bed because I did not do a great job avoiding this cold

[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.160]
I was definitely coming down with it

[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.460]
You know you get the scraps and the meek is in the sore throat

[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.680]
And I did a fine job of doctrine myself

[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.560]
And so I went to bed it was for nothing

[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.800]
And I see the red socks one

[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.080]
So I take back and I'm going to tell you right now Josh

[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.320]
Why they won these three games?

[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.820]
Why is that?

[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.720]
You see your life already because they got the impetus

[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.160]
They got the enthusiasm

[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.560]
They got gooseed up on a Patriots beat Seattle on Sunday

[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.520]
You noticed they hadn't won a game

[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.340]
They lost three in a row they got them blown out

[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.580]
I mean just in theory what was it?

[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.040]
19 to eight or something the day before?

[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.240]
All of a sudden here they come in a win three in a row

[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.600]
They've even up the world series

[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.180]
Even winning right there in New York a Jackie Stadium last night

[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.900]
And that's they can thank the Patriots in the Tom Brady and Bill Bellachuk for that

[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.160]
That's the undefeated Patriots who won two Super Bowls in the last three seasons

[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.640]
And won 20 games in a row as opposed to the Eurodolphins who are well

[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.860]
We've need to say now what was I just about to do here?

[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.600]
I just voted oh Boarding and Christians is taking the early lead

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.020]
That would be fine we go

[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.800]
How about the Jamaicans who are Boarding and Christians and also on the weekends Jewish

[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.980]
I don't want to say there's any hanky panky going over the election

[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.080]
This this story just they should give you a great idea of what they're trying to pull man

[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.900]
This is so amusing

[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.820]
Some absentee ballots distributed to Hamilton County voters don't include the name

[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.120]
Of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry local election officials confirmed yesterday

[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.480]
Yeah, they had a small mistake

[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.060]
You're like a Kerry's name off of there

[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.500]
So do you want to vote for Bush or Nader or a few other people that nobody ever heard of?

[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.500]
Or that's it? Or Bush

[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.420]
In fact probably they put Bush's name on it or a second time where Nader where uh, Kerry was supposed to be

[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.500]
Because of a printing error limited election officials believed only a few ballots in the force

[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.600]
They believe we don't know but that's what they're thinking

[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.420]
In the fourth park area absentee ballots recently mailed out exclude the Democratic presidential ticket of Kerry and John Edwards

[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.640]
It's a screw-up said Tim Berker

[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.640]
Chairman of the Hamilton County Board of Elections

[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.940]
This just feeds the paranoia that's out there

[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.000]
The tragic thing is that even though I think we have a very fair and accurate count here

[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.620]
This will cause people to question the accuracy of our operation

[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.060]
No kid

[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.660]
I think the reason we weren't streaming by the way is because Howard got off early at 1028 this morning

[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.060]
Yeah

[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.820]
I mean that's a good excuse I don't know what it's like

[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.420]
Or maybe because Robert didn't uh, maybe Robert didn't hit the button

[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.360]
Because maybe Duff was too busy hitting Robert's button

[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.600]
Although election officials believe only two voters have received the inaccurate ballots today

[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.600]
Berks said he's worried that the mix-up will open us up to all kinds of questions and concerns

[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.380]
No Schmidt

[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.320]
He also conceded that some may question whether the problem is a deal a bit or only a few ballots

[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.260]
I guess we'll never know

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.680]
But I'm happy we're talking about a very small number Berks said but it's something that should never have happened

[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.160]
Again no Schmidt is my comment

[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.640]
One of the voters who received the inaccurate ballots said today

[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.620]
She just couldn't believe it when she opened her absentee ballot on poll

[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.600]
And notice that Kerry's name was just missing

[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.240]
I'm sure it's just an oversight

[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.800]
Right?

[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.700]
Yeah

[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.560]
I know it's hard

[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.660]
I'm sure

[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.460]
I know it's something was wrong said the voter who asked not to be identified

[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.960]
But you wonder whether others maybe didn't notice it before they sent their ballots back

[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.920]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.920]

[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.520]
The printing error is the second major mistake to play Hamilton County's absentee ballots for the upcoming election

[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.580]
Earlier this month

[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:34.400]
Official scrapped 17,500 absentee ballots after Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell ordered presidential candidate Ralph Nader off the ballot

[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.260]
Because of invalid signatures on his candidacy petitions

[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.460]
Those ballots also have been tainted by the election board to scurry that the

[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.760]
Punched positions of Hamilton County Engineer Bill Brasshaw, one of the candidates for Ohio Supreme Court, had been switched

[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.980]
Nader's removal from ballots throughout Ohio also figures out the new problem that caused Kerry's name to be dropped

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.040]
See I didn't realize that the Nader's not on there

[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.760]
Good in seeking to remove Nader's name from some local ballots Hamilton County officials inadvertently struck Kerry's name instead

[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.460]
So in other words, I was right Nader was on air with Bush and it was Kerry that got knocked off

[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.280]
Well, at least they were trying

[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:13.000]
On the flawed ballots the words candidate removed appear on the line where Kerry's name should appear on the line below Nader's name

[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.540]
Where Kerry removed actually should have been printed remains so it had Bush and Nader and no Kerry which is really scary

[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:25.900]
Zined America maybe there and then the registrations the Democratic registrations that were turned up in Oregon we actually saw the pictures in the waste basket

[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.400]
Oh, that was just a disgruntled ex-employee ride

[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.700]
They've always got an answer for everything man

[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.640]
They've always got some bogus answer just like this crap with Theresa LaPour again

[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.960]
It's just like all the sort of bogus garbage going on in South Florida once again and it's only pre-voting now

[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.880]
It's only a little foreplay and he still can't get it straightened up

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.900]
Which of course when this kind of crap goes on this makes it very easy for them to kind of wait till two weeks from yesterday

[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.900]
Let's see which way the things are going and how many votes they need to fix a new Mexico and how many votes they need to fix up and Wisconsin

[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.800]
And how many need to fix up again in Florida

[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.740]
I'm sure that Glenda in the hood is working feverishly on it along with that fat ass governor yours

[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.580]
Don't forget Betty Caster for Senate and William Portante just say no to Mel Martinez that Nazi piece of crap

[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.900]
Yes, I'm proposition four

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.540]
Oh, the slots you ought to see the article that's in the at Harold and we talk about biased

[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.860]
They're so hysterical about those slot machines those one-eyed bandits who they're going to get you

[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.100]

From the point of a gun or spread in our brain

[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.300]
Democracy that these Iraqis want to show desperately now

[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.220]
Released to my calm Genji cold

You're gonna have me as Iraqo be free

[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.260]
Thank you Mr. Bush for just one thing

[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.040]

Car bomb on

[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.700]
You more get

[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.540]
Let me go to a 560 WQM happy Wednesday too

[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.060]
Look at that price of crude oils up almost a buck today 5420 as I speak

[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.860]
The Dow is down 63 points and the Nasdaq is down 3

[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.480]
By the end of the week the Nasdaq is going to be back at the 1800s

[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.820]
And pretty soon the Dow is going to be down hovering around 9000

[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.220]
Why can't you ever say something positive?

[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.420]
Jobs nobody's got jobs and the jobs they do have in our paint of fraction what they used to pay

[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.600]
Everything every single issue you look at like I said yesterday is crap

[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.820]
And you got Dale Waldtrup on there yesterday on CNN with Wolf Flitzkrieg

[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.740]
Making his big pitch for W

[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.240]
And at a shock that the NASCAR crowd is for W

[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.880]
That was one of the most I don't know whether to laugh or cry

[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.720]
One of the most amusing things I've seen in the years Dale Waldtrup

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.520]
Well you shake George Bush in hand and you're shaking hands with a real man

[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.660]
Yeah, yeah, draft Dodger cheerleader now one of them lily libert pinko bag

[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.520]
For liberals. Yeah. Oh, let's see. Oh, here's another one. You had this when you did the pull

[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.760]
Please add Republicans. I forgot about that. Yeah, you did this not that long ago

[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.920]
But that's okay something like that

[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.480]
Yeah, let's add that on there Josh. It'll give you something to do put Republicans on there please

[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.880]
How's that pull coming so anyway Wolf Flitzkrieg much to my amazement

[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.400]
Actually put his he put his feet to the floor a little bit Dale Waldtrup put his pedal to the metal

[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:41.060]
And he said well, what about the fact that John Kerry you know volunteered for service during Vietnam and the George W Bush

[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:47.020]
You know we'll join the National Guard and Walter's response was which is obviously scripted you know to give him all the little

[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:55.260]
The lines to use right the car is up with the course Bush is big on lines comes up with this crap about well that really speaks that

[00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:01.240]
That's an insult to the people in the guard today and Wolf Flitzkrieg amazingly stepped out of his Nazi boots long enough to remind him that

[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.580]
The people in the guard today 43% of them have been are now or will be in Iraq as opposed to back during the Vietnam war

[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:16.760]
When joining the guard was just another way of dodging the draft and his and his response was just like Bush's response on is he in favor of Roe v. Wade or repealing it

[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:22.820]
A non-answer he came back with well all I know was a George Bush is a straight shooter when you shake his hand in all that

[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:28.120]
And he's a great I love George Bush. That was his response which was really really well worth while having him on there

[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.980]
We'll get to that whole thing. I got a great story about CNN and about that thing that bulges and bushes jacket

[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:40.600]
I got some good stuff here today, but we better take a whole bunch of calls don't you think let's do that no let's look at the pool first

[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:47.160]
Which of these groups bug you the most born again Christian 60 we do that fact let's do this once a month just so we can get out of our system

[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.260]
126 votes born again Christians got about half of them I hate everybody 19 Cuban 16 WQM hello

[00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:02.000]
Hey, they all go out. How you doing all right all right? I remember before you said you're having an audio for any day

[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:08.460]
But you just say any 100 GA you don't say that no more. No, that's I guess that's what I have to do any K from GA

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.160]
Hey, but okay, thank you. Hey, these are good calls aren't they? The first guy like an overgrown child what happened to Howard?

[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:21.560]
Howard's still on you guys cut him off. We don't cut Howard off but when he says the last word the last breath

[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:27.580]
That's when the Stern show ends on this station. Okay, so give us a song to dance you emotional cripple simple than you that words Howard

[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:35.440]
Okay, that was the first call I'm getting worse from there, but I like taking a lot of these the bread and butter right right like line 9's my favorite QAM hello

[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.420]
How you doing okay? How you doing?

[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000]
Did you get my effects your facts about what saying what the whole question from yesterday about Republicans?

[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.520]
No, about a poll questions about movies everyone should see and I

[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.900]
Said that George George usually never did we get the facts George? We get this guy's back or remember any facts like that. I'm getting

[00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:03.020]
I said it again get with it now that movies everybody should see we've done that but more times than this stupid one we're doing today get

[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:10.900]
With it pal I recall seeing a facts like boy you people man are stiller than last year's Matsu get with it. Of course remember I did have to reset the machine this morning

[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.580]
So maybe he said it up. He probably said it you didn't get it because your machine was screwed up

[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.800]
I couldn't actually this morning either and then I went back to bed just to make sure I miss certain people

[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.880]
I certainly hope that those people get the message

[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.120]
This isn't like a couple of a day deal if they want to deal with anybody deal with you or they can call norm can't I'm not dealing with people

[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:33.960]
They want to ruin my day see that here's a great piece of philosophy and I really mean this if your wife ruins your day

[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.860]
dump the bitch if your kid ruins your day put them out on the street make them homeless

[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:44.360]
I mean anybody ruins your day just get get take them out of your life. Yeah, what life is too short to have people to ruin your day

[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:51.020]
What if they ruin like a whole years of your life? Well that case and then dump them like in the ocean will be good

[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.340]
FDA stops distribution of unauthorized flu vaccine from Canada

[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.460]
The federal government stops them central this is hysterical this is a panic

[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:09.060]
And I should put out that the people in Canada aren't too excited about this idea that the American public is going to start draining all of the drugs supplies from Canada

[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.200]
They're getting a little bit paranoid about that because they only manufacture a limited amount because there's only how many million people here

[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.680]
But third man in Canada

[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:26.040]
But nevertheless I saw this yesterday also on these certainly not news Nazi network about well you know the FDA hasn't really checked some of these vaccines from Canada

[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:32.520]
The FDA the same people that that approved viox and philidamide and all these other drugs that have killed millions of people

[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:39.100]
The FDA which is nothing but a sell out all the all the manufacturers of food manufacturers and all the other are the drug manufacturers

[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:46.880]
Anyway the federal government stopped some central Floridians from getting flu shots yesterday or today it says Wednesday and that's today

[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.900]
Because the vaccine was from a Canadian company not approved for use in the US

[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:59.240]
Unless it's Thursday and I don't realize you yet is it Thursday? It's Friday huh? Yeah right there about 6000 doses of the vaccine were to be given for free starting today

[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:05.020]
A clinics in orange seminal and ocular counties this senior is desperately trying to get shots amid a national vaccine shortage

[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:12.080]
FDA officials had no details about the mix up they were investigating how the unlicensed vaccines ended up being shipped

[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:18.360]
The doses were received Monday by Get Healthy Florida a partnership of Florida Hospital the Orange County Health Department and others

[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:25.560]
The vaccine came from Shire Pharmacicicles Group a British company that sold its vaccine to Vision in September to a Canadian company ID Biomedical

[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.640]
Get Healthy Florida bought its vaccines from Taylor's Pharmacy in Wooder Park

[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.100]
Sturr owner Alan Divers said he ordered doses through a major wholesale of McKesson Corporation

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:40.280]
Diver realized they weren't from eventist pasture the only authorized maker left for the US but still sent them to doctors offices

[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.360]
If get healthy Florida he didn't know how many doctors have received the files or what they've been given to the patients

[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.200]
If federal officials were negotiating with ID Biomedical to secure a small amount of doses in January said Lester Crawford acting FDA Commissioner and that's the end of the story

[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:59.660]
So in other words because the FDA hasn't put their squeal of approval on it yet therefore these old files that are standing in line

[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.260]
Holizing an 85 degree heat for hours and hours they're ready to pass out and croak right on the side

[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.320]
In fact did you see there was one woman had a hard attack died? You see that? Yes

[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.980]
Waiting for a flu shot you miserable bastard

[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.200]
Yeah 2000 people are gonna die because this idiot is not top of things

[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.840]
He screams he hoars he's always really good when he's prescripted and got that little thing in his ear but when he shakes your hand

[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.800]
Yeah when he shakes his hand you're talking to a real man and when he shakes it

[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.000]

Everybody, everybody all the time

[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.280]

[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.900]
Love at 18 and here's an interesting facts from Frank and Melbourne who says

[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.360]
Bush says no draft, okay then why is the Selective Service looking for draft board members

[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.180]
I close a copy of the Selective Service Information request page from their website

[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.080]
You can find it under careers like that touch careers for chicken hawks

[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:26.420]
If there's no draft plan then why they need for draft board members and anyway here's the second cheat that includes which is a copy of that

[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.880]
Local board membership information requested said local board members are volunteers appointed by the president

[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.940]
They play an important community role closely connected with our nation's defense

[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:43.180]
If a military draft becomes necessary approximately 2000 local boards throughout America would decide which young men in each community received a firmance, post-ponents or exemptions

[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:49.980]
From military service based on federal guidelines and if you're interested in receiving information and becoming a board member for the Selective Service

[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:56.280]
Please complete this form must be 18 years older since the US must have registered with a Selective Service yadi yadi yadi in the coson

[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.420]
How do you like that?

[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.320]
I guess it's just an exercise right just in case

[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.500]
Right who knows there might be a wort some day

[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.360]
Oh, now what's this other thing you just fact me this constitutional amendment?

[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:19.300]
Oh, I aborted it because it was long in other words it's a breakdown of all of the amendment one is the parental notification of a minor's termination of pregnancy

[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:30.700]
Which if you want these it's like six pages no, okay, I don't want all of these I mean the ones that it's obvious what you're going to vote against that right right and the second one

[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.480]
I have no idea what this is constitutional amendments proposed by initiative. I don't know

[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:41.340]
Oh, you're supposed to be on top of all of that too bad tell some of the just the cover page, huh, which is has them listed

[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.540]
We got bigger fish to fry, okay?

[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:52.920]
Charity halts Iraq work after age chief's kidnap aid organization carried a nationalist suspended separations and Iraq completely following the kidnapping of Margaret Hassan

[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.740]
It was announced today

[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:59.960]
Kara Australia confirmed it had halted all work in Iraq because of the kidnapping instead of expected a release of statement with the nowers

[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:08.520]
Kara Australia chief executive Robert Glasser told Australia's ABC radio our staff are not operating currently there and they're certainly not working there now in light of the current situation

[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.440]
He said Kara Australia did not know why she'd been kidnapped

[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:20.740]
She by the end of your saw the story she lived there for 30 years. Yes. So in other words it's not like she just went there to start doing these things

[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:26.660]
The good work she was doing and she'd been there for 30 years, but evidently you know, she's not a good time to be a non-Iraqi in Iraq

[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.920]
Right. She was born in Dublin holds dual British and Iraqi nationality

[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.240]
She was snatched just hours before she was driven to work in the west of the capital yesterday morning

[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:41.540]
Al Jazeera reported that an unarmed and unnamed armed Iraqi groups had a kidnapped Mrs. Hassan

[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.660]
So there you go. It continues the put your ring into beheadings and all these other things

[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:54.220]
I saw a great show on the biography channel last night about the Saudi royal family. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh my friends. Huh?

[00:26:54.700 --> 00:27:01.240]
Our buddies the Saudis baby. Bandar Bush. All of them good boys. I tell you one thing when bandar Bush holds hands with George W

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:25.760]

[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:25.700]
it down as it usually gets that though time here going on it.

[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:31.740]
We still got two weeks. I'll do a little bit of homework and find the the thumbnail sketch of each one of them or I'll just back some to you

[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.580]
Or whatever. Well, you got it all there. Yes, what I canceled it and it's coming through again

[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:43.320]
Here's a very much more important story the 911 secret in the CIA's back pocket. This is from the LA Times and Robert Sheer

[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:51.240]
He says it is shocking the Bush administration is suppressing a CIA report on 911 until after the election and this one names names

[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.200]
Although the report by the Inspector General's office of the CIA was completed in June

[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.300]
It hasn't been made available to the congressional intelligence committees that demanded it study the study almost two years ago

[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:08.020]
It's infuriating that a report which shows that high-level people were not doing their jobs in a satisfactory manner before 911 is being suppressed and

[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.480]
Intelligence official who has read the report told me adding that the report is potentially very embarrassing for the administration

[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.720]
Because it makes it look like they weren't interested in terrorism before 911 or in holding people in the government responsible

[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.820]
Act Award kind like what Richard Clark said

[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.220]
When I asked about the report representative Jane Harmon of California

[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:29.720]
Ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee said she and committee chairman Peter Hoekstra a Republican

[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.860]
Amishian said a letter 14 days ago asking for it to be delivered

[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.940]
We believe that the CIA has been told not to distribute the reports. You said and we are very concerned

[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.740]
According to the intelligence official is spoke to be on condition of anonymity

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:47.400]
Release of the report which represents an exhaustive 17 month investigation by an 11-member team within the agency has been stalled

[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:54.160]
First by acting CIA director John McLaughlin and now by Porter J. Misha Goss the former Republican House member and chairman of the intelligence committee

[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.520]
We recently was appointed CIA chief by president Bush Porter Misha Goss

[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.640]
The official stress that the report was more blunt and more specific than the earlier bipartisan reports

[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.880]
Produced by the Bush appointed on the other commission in the Congress with all the other reports

[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.900]
And 911 did not do is point to figured individuals and give the how and what of their responsibility

[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:16.260]
This report does that says the intelligence official the report found very senior level officials responsible

[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.840]
By law the only legitimate reason the CIA director has for holding back such a report as national security

[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.980]
It neither Goss Norma Gropons invoked national front before they start the job

[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:33.000]
Call him today tool free using the first time you never dream a call anybody else again call him at 1-800-248-5071

Where's our leaving over there this guy?

[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:29.620]

So no that invalidates your vote

It's 11-32-28-0560 QM Madball coming to two. Let's take a look at the poll so far

[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.860]
Which of these groups bugs you the most three hundred and sixteen votes

[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.080]
A born again Christians hundred and twenty Republicans 42. Let's move it up. That's zooming up the list

[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:26.080]
I hate everybody 37 QM 35. I like everybody 14. Well, goody goody African-Americans 12

[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:32.460]
Haitians 10 rednext nine French Canadians nine Jews nine Muslims eight New Yorkers four

[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.600]
But if they're at New Yorkers who also are Jews oh double

Catholics four and Jamaicans three out of three hundred and sixteen votes a lot of people

Out there not to like well, it's just you know, I mean you can pretend you like everybody and oh people are just people

[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.360]
Okay, what's the light?

[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.320]
Uh early voting problems reported in Boka again. This must be a mistake in it. It's just a joke

[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.600]
I'm sure comedy lies and I would think if we were getting zillions with this election going on less than two weeks away

[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.480]
Now we'd be getting zillions of calls from people who voted the last couple of days and

[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.200]
Have encountered either problems or no problems or whatever. Yeah, they're all the stuff going on

[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.980]
Let's call in C-SPAN and have them cover the show. Okay, so they can hear some of these neat calls

Spend some time last week picking crab apples from trees on the campgrounds and use them to cook up sweet jelly

[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:08.300]
The normal person will get punished for that, but the prison guards managed not to see her the inmate was quoted as saying

[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.880]
The crabby inmate the inmate went on to say that Stewart my daughter known it was wrong

[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.260]
Although other inmates have since advised her to refrain from stirring up any more treats

[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:18.940]
No

[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.700]
The post-sited a spokeswoman for the federal prison camp is saying that she was unaware of Stewart's exploits

[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.620]
Adding that it is unlikely that a prisoner were getting into serious trouble for such activity

[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:34.460]
It's a 105 acre compound with a lot of different trees and crab apples are amongst them said dawn's obo

Spokeswoman for the prison camp and if an inmate was seen picking them we would have a discussion with an informal discussion

[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.080]
Well, what I don't get it. What's wrong with picking apples?

[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.840]

[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:11.220]
What are they are crumbling man? It's such a beautiful thing to see they're crumbling fast

[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:18.620]
Sin Claire broadcasting under widening scrutiny over plans to wear a documentary about Senator John Kerry's war my wartime activities

[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:23.060]
Not 30 years ago said yesterday it would not show the program in its entirety

[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.160]
Conquerate enumerous and accurate political and press accounts

[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:32.780]
These Sin Claire stations will not be airing the documentary stolen honor and its entirety the Baltimore based company said in a statement

[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.440]
That's what they're saying now to cover the rest

[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.180]
Sin Claire said it would air a special news program on Friday called a POW story

[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:45.240]
Politics pressure in the media that would discuss the allegations surrounding Kiri's anti-vietnam war activities

Lehman brothers cut its 12-month price target from nine dollars two nine dollars from ten is a list

[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.460]
William Myers noted in a report that airing the documentary has no upside and only multi-dimensional

[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.180]
Downside for the company for example by alien eating advertisers and regulators

[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.340]
But that's not Sin Claire's only business problem or it's only experience with controversy

[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:24.580]
Sin Claire's financial laws were highlighted Monday and JP Morgan's decision to initiate coverage with an underweight rating that indicates

[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.760]
It's expected to underperform in its peer group

[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.740]

[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:47.800]

[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.660]

Retard yeah, we already put Republicans on there. Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, duh. Retard is good. We don't want to pick on the president. Okay. That's good

[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.160]
Want to put that on there or not? No

[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:28.920]
Okay, you had it on there. You had dumb people on your pool. I did. I think I don't think so well put it on there anyway

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.300]
Dumb people give these people a choice baby give what they want see that's the one thing you haven't learned yet

[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.280]
You're getting better every show, but you want thing you have it or give them what they want if they want crap

[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.960]
Give them crap. Give them tons of it. It's cheap. It's cheap

[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.760]
Give them tons of these phone calls. Maybe that's what they want. They don't want anything like my stimulate their brain

[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:54.380]
Oh my god. He's reading those stories. It's this cousin. We want to hear more about movies baby movies movies movies. That's what we want

[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.680]
Let me tell you again the ones who talk about that crap the most they are the ones who get it the least and the ones who pretend like the

[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.580]
Board of Education's who are leading a running away with our pool. They're the ones who are doing everybody

[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.720]
Because Board of Education is code for

[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.300]
closet pervert

[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:16.380]
I mean some of us perverts were out of the closet at least that's okay, but closet pervert aka hypocrite

[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.540]
413 votes which of these groups bugs you the most board again Christians hands down your past baby

[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:24.880]
154

[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.620]
37% of all of you say board again Christians screw them

[00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.710]
Republicans 59 I

[00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:36.990]
Hate everybody 44 humans 44 you still can't let go that Cuban thing man

[00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:41.550]
I like everybody 16 Haitians 15, but they sure have clean lawns

[00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.630]
African-Americans

[00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:46.210]
15

[00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:49.430]
Oh, wait a minute. Let's just move it up there into a tie with Haitians

[00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:55.710]
Maybe you ought to have ID cards for the dark folks Muslims 14 red next 13 French Canadians a dozen

[00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.250]
Jews 11 New Yorkers 10

[00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:03.970]
I would assume that most of the Yorkers and so forth not all but well, then we got a lot of Guido's too, huh? Yeah

[00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.110]
A lot of her Jew Yorkers that you make in five

[00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:14.450]
Catholics for and dumb people just went on a very good work Josh 423 vote on our suit pool

[00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:19.710]
I got an article here that the carry people aren't going to be too happy with me about but I you know

[00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.870]
I haven't I said that it's a pretty

[00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.690]
P-pore selection. Yes

[00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:28.690]
Doug Thompson writes the rant in the capital hill blue, which is now standing website that George doesn't like at all

[00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:34.950]
But he writes ain't much of a choice and I hate the echo. I mean naturally. I already voted for carry and

[00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.690]
Would have owed a hundred times if I had the chance at hope like hell

[00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:41.830]
He's gonna win by the way the latest Florida State by State poll. I should point out I forgot to mention this

[00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:46.190]
It shows 47% for bush 46 for carry and one or two for Nader

[00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.830]
But how do you like that? It's not within one percent a couple of days ago Bush had a four-point lead

[00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:56.370]
You know these are the daily and every couple of days they do these tracking polls state by state in the battleground states

[00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:03.590]
And also Iowa the latest one shows carry 47 bush 47 a Nader with four which is very disturbing

[00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.370]
You see you people are gonna vote for Nader

[00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:11.310]
How do you gonna do every vote for Nader is a vote for Bush make no at least in the battleground states and didn't Nader already urge

[00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.430]
Didn't he already say

[00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:16.150]
To the people I wanted to vote for him in the closed states in the battleground states

[00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:19.810]
They should vote for carry didn't he already say that? Yeah, sure. Let's say he said that no

[00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.430]
He did say that okay. It was months ago, but he said it

[00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:28.710]
Anyway ain't much of a choice right Stugthompson and the great capital hill blue which George hates that was I have the idea why

[00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.950]
Well, no, that's because they're not partisan. They rip both parties and they tell it like it is

[00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.890]
I don't know what you say that I've never said any kind of this sort just for the hell of it

[00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:41.350]
Okay, if George W. Bush had not turned the citizens of this country into an angry mob filled with hate and distrust

[00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:42.810]
This election wouldn't even be close

[00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:49.250]
God knows John carries not the answer to this nation's woes his legislative record of one can call it that would in the best of times

[00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.750]
Where nothing more than an asterisk in the history of the US Senate

[00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.750]
But this is hardly the best of times and carry through no accomplishment of his own

[00:43:55.750 --> 00:44:00.670]
Finds himself locked in a dead-heat battle for the presidency because many Americans hate Bush so much

[00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:04.390]
They're willing to rest the future of the nation on a lackluster liberal who never saw political position

[00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:05.290]
He couldn't change

[00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:08.930]
This is the dilemma we face in two weeks the choice between a reckless zealot

[00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:13.870]
Who's led this country to award can't win and a wish he was she opportunist who could lead a pack of cubs cuts

[00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:15.170]
I don't know her night camping trip

[00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.270]
If you think this ain't much of a choice you're right as campaign

[00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:24.370]
2004 winds down a mercant face of future that's cursed with four years of more of the same or more of the unknown

[00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:29.050]
Bush is the great divider a madman whose policies and actions have ripped this country apart

[00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:34.770]
The architect of the most divisive or since Vietnam the highest deficits in the history and administration who's lies dwarf

[00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.810]
Even those of our last great pervericator William Jefferson Clinton

[00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.750]
Carry unfortunately isn't a man on a white horse riding into save the day

[00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:46.850]
Given Bush's record a chimpanzee with an IQ of a two-minute egg could be leading the polls by 20 points

[00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.190]
I got to read that again. I love that. It's great. Love it

[00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:54.010]
Given Bush's record a chimpanzee with an IQ of a two-minute egg could be leading the polls by 20 points

[00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:59.690]
But carries many missteps and vacillating positions on issues leaves one wondering how he even got into Yale much less graduated

[00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:05.470]
This is a race between dumb and dumber numb nuts and dim dimwit tweedle d and tweedle dumb

[00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:10.390]
The only difference between carries campaign in a cubscot pack is that cubscotts at least have adult leadership

[00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:14.810]
And the only difference between the Bush administration and the same pack is that cubscotts don't have heavy artillery

[00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:19.770]
So what's a voter to do come November 2nd which will need to us most walk into the voting both the maker decision

[00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:22.010]
Dan good question with two weeks to go

[00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.330]
I still don't know who I'm going to vote for or even if I've got a vote

[00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.990]
The future of this nation could well depend on the decision all of us makes on that day

[00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:33.070]
Yet I can't help feeling any decision is fruitless because the mess of this country this country faces is beyond repair

[00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:39.450]

[00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:50.990]
Lottery's really a good bet

[00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:53.410]
Anyway

[00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:58.290]
Here's the facts from Jason who says I voted yesterday. No problems pine island and barbie polar bar

[00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.210]
Let me say it again go to nearrojers.com

[00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.450]
Erics done a fabulous job if you want to know where to vote and

[00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:09.070]
Click on the thing there. He's got the map and all of the sites the locations. It's a excellent job. Eric. It's about time

[00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:13.770]
Anyway, pine island and barbie he voted 40 minutes total even some of the poll workers knew what was going on

[00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:20.650]
Which is a shock some of the ones under 100 it said votes are stored locked up and under a video until November 1st

[00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:21.510]
No pre-county

[00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:26.630]
Two I'm still going to wait on a lesson day in my polling place to make sure my name is off the registration

[00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:32.110]
Have you voted early? I think it's a good way to double check that your vote was counted and three went to the carry rally at CB

[00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:37.610]
Smith Park 15,000 people their carry was great and Bobby Graham was great and that's great station thanks for the good news

[00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:39.510]
There is some good news there we now and then

[00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:44.090]
As opposed to some of the negative re turds that we got there in saw florida turds

[00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:46.250]
You turd that's the word

[00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:53.190]
567 05 60 check you're right. I got a huge pile, you know

[00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:57.210]
Yeah, I could have been on Howard's contest. I'm sorry. I remember he had that hammered contest

[00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:04.870]
Oh, yeah, I got a lot of these important calls in man. That's the meat and potatoes the bread and butter the peanut butter and jelly

[00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:09.710]
pound five sixty only for rising and singular wireless lines WQA and hello

[00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:14.730]
Neil God. Yes, sir speaking. Hey, I just want to report that I go to this morning at

[00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:17.250]
a camera library at

[00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:22.210]
How commercial and pile island and there was about a amount of 15 minute wait

[00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:26.290]
But as a light move very quickly and the poll workers were competent. They were

[00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:31.810]
The guy who was actually, you know, once you presented your credentials the guy who was actually putting people up to the

[00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:37.890]
Machines was very very good. He was excellent at the murder and once in another I voted yes on them and for

[00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.830]
Good and of course, you know voted for

[00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.710]
The person who's going to be the next president of the United States John Kerry

[00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:51.690]
And I would do everybody else to consider voting early it really does you know remove the

[00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:57.030]
The possibility of having crowded and and huge lines, you know on the actual election

[00:50:57.030 --> 00:51:00.330]
I think it's a great idea plus it plus I think it creates a lot of

[00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:06.150]
Advance excitement you know when you have two solid weeks and and then a lot of a lot of people when there's only one day to vote

[00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:10.490]
They find excuses, you know, they can't get out of work or there's too much traffic

[00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:14.210]
They've got every million excuses now. I think you get big turnout. Thank you

[00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.970]
Exactly. Thanks Neil. Thank you. Good job. Very good. It's a good job

[00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.970]
We did it all the way around. He voted yes on prop 4. He voted for Kerry and it's part of the article

[00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:24.290]
I read by Doug Thompson and I agree with most of what he put in there

[00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:26.250]
But the fact of the matter is you got it you got a choice

[00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.350]
I mean one of these people is going to be the president the next four years and

[00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.230]
Kerry's got to be light years ahead. I mean

[00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:34.070]
Is there any contest?

[00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:36.870]
Is it even close?

[00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:42.790]
But with an intellect the man who you know had some balls a man who went and served for his country while the other one was draft

[00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:50.230]
I'd you go with his heartless vice president who's busy. I only pick it on Mary Mary. He's a thicc and they're picking on Mary. Yeah

[00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:55.450]
They keep showing a clip by the way the interview with him and his wife when he was the one that brought it up in the first place

[00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:56.730]
months ago back in April

[00:51:57.150 --> 00:52:00.030]
About how his daughter is a lesbian and it's well known that she's a gay

[00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:04.670]
Leadership but that's why he disagrees with Bush on the anti gay marriage amendment and people ought to be able to do whatever

[00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:08.570]
The hell they want and that's okay for him to say it. It was okay for John Edwards to say it

[00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.390]
But now because they had nothing else

[00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:17.370]
That's what they're reduced to when he's last two weeks is here's this guy who's so liberal misjudgements by stubbornness and

[00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:21.790]
On one hand and then on the other hand we got they called my daughter would die. Can that that's it?

[00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:28.030]
That's a hell of a after four years in office those are two fantastic things to really be running on

[00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:35.210]
He's a bad man. He's too freaking liberal. Oh there's Bubba out the bubble is gonna campaign with uh

[00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:41.390]
Carry and Philadelphia next week. Did you see that I did and it's good. He's coming from Chapacua. He's gonna crank up his heart

[00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.010]
He's gonna steal the Chinese pacemaker just in case

[00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.850]
Somebody Q a and hello

Yes, sir. Oh, man, I can't believe I got you. Okay. I got four things first of all real

Um, you gotta talk about amendments amendment three because I'm studying to be a nurse and you have to talk about it

[00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:17.370]
It doesn't very important for the healthcare very important number three. I saw of

[00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:21.890]
Well, what do you mean is very important for healthcare? What does that mean? Well if if they keep

[00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:28.210]
Suing for a lot of money then then a lot of nurses are gonna aren't gonna be around and doctors are gonna be you know

[00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:33.450]
I'm gonna have a lemon three about the uh, yeah, I know which one it is independent

Yeah, I know her. I know that one

[00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:02.290]
5-6-7-05-60 pound 5-60 on the Verizon and singular wireless lines

[00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:06.270]
I'm telling you this early voting thing Florida. We're gonna have 50 million people vote of course

[00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:12.050]
We don't have nearly that many living in the state but that's okay. So anyway. Yes. I digested the amendments and here it is

[00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:16.910]
You want it? What do you mean you digest it? I read the whole thing. What it's about

[00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:19.650]
Wait, which one all of them?

[00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:25.630]
Are you already facts me that no? No, no, but I I went through and uh and here's the here's the rundown if you want to be real quick about it

[00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.270]
Okay, go ahead no one one

[00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:29.470]
No on two

[00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:30.950]
No on three

[00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:38.870]
Yes on four you're gonna get our Julio friend there upset we said no on three right no on three right yes on four

[00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:43.050]
No, wait a minute. What's oh four yes far as the uh the money for education the slots

[00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:50.350]
Yes on five, which is the guaranteed minimum wage amendment which only brings floor all that does is bring Florida up to standard with federal law

[00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:53.630]
Right so that people can get minimum wage in Florida who don't normally

[00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.050]
Yes on six, which is repeal that really silly

[00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:01.510]
high-speed reel the bullet train oh, but we love the bullet. What's the bit we got on that? What is that called?

[00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:05.910]
Oh, I don't know it's a book of rendez I know what is it called as I love that he'll tell me he'll tell me

[00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:10.790]
Okay, after the seven second delay yes on six you we already did that yes on seven and yes on eight

[00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:16.650]
Seven is the patients right to know about adverse medical incidents. That's correct. They do have the right to know

[00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.150]
Yes, they do and so yes on seven and eight

[00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:25.230]
The public protection from repeated medical malpractice. So obviously the answer on it is yes. Yes. Okay

[00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:31.350]
Says current law allows medical doctors who've committed repeated malpractice to be licensed to practice medicine in Florida

[00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:33.210]
Guess what I don't think so

[00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:37.010]
So they want to change that which just makes a little bit of sense to me

[00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:43.290]
This amendment prohibits medical doctors have been found out committed three or more incidents of medical about practice for big license to practice medicine in Florida

[00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:45.450]
Unless they came from Cuba with phony ID

[00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:52.730]
Is there a week that goes by that we don't find that there's somebody who's either practicing dentistry right

[00:55:52.730 --> 00:56:00.570]
Uh cosmetic surgery or open heart surgery. Yeah, who's not a brain surgery right not a real doctor. I kept an up

[00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:04.330]

[00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:06.770]

[00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:52.330]
We just don't put articles on it. I'm actually most of the articles that we put on there are pro carry and ripping bush and ass

[00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:52.750]

[01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:18.870]
Okay. Six. Six blood relatives of President Bush who support John Kerry's bid for the presidency

[01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:24.630]
have launched a website to publicize their sharp disagreements with Bush's policies. The site.

[01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:30.330]
Double it and we can put a link on our website to it. Okay. In fact, I would strongly recommend that.

[01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:40.230]
Okay. Bush relatives for carry.com. Pretty easy right? Okay. W.A.W. Bush relatives for carry.com

[01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:43.930]
consists of personal statements from a group of decidedly liberal second cousins of the President

[01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:49.350]
none of whom knows him personally all our grandchildren of Mary Bush House the sister of Prescott Bush

[01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:53.750]
that Nazi the former US senior senator from Connecticut and the father and grandfather of the

[01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:58.450]
two Bush presidents. The introduction of the site opens with a slogan because blood is thicker

[01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:02.830]
than oil in states as the election approaches we feel it's our responsibility to speak out about

[01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:07.150]
why we're voting for John Kerry and to do our small part to help America heal from the sickness

[01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:11.890]
it suffered since George Bush was appointed president in 2000. We invite you to read our stories

[01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:18.150]
and please don't vote for our cousin. Hillary House no relation to former Tiger catcher Frank House.

[01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:22.790]
Hillary House 39 a 30 year law student at the University of Washington put together the site with

[01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:28.330]
participation of three or six siblings Sheila House Tracy Cannon and Chris House. Oh let's take

[01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:33.490]
it to the house. Before our children of Mary Bush is son Francis House the turret now deceased

[01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:37.550]
who taught English at a prep school in Connecticut. It was the first president former president George

[01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:42.750]
a Herbert Walker Bush Genie House and Henry Kimsey House two children and other Mary's another

[01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:47.990]
of Mary's sons James House also provided pro-carry testimonials. The website was put up independent

[01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:51.970]
of the curry campaign Hillary House said adding that an email she's into the campaign about a month

[01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:56.950]
to go ahead and been answered. Kerry campaign officials in Washington state and Washington DC said

[01:03:56.950 --> 01:04:01.870]
they were unaware of the site Leah Yoon spokeswoman for the Bush Cheney campaign in Washington state

[01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:06.290]
to find a comment about the site. They're entitled their opinions as American citizens as she said

[01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:10.430]
the Audi Audi spoke to them for the Republican National Committee. Hillary House said she got the

[01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:14.750]
idea for the site when she heard that Genie House a past-run Wisconsin had briefly spoken to the

[01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:18.730]
Massachusetts senator at a curry event after he noticed her waving a Bush relative for Kerry's

[01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:22.950]
according to Hillary and her sister Sheila 49 a mental health counselor in Harwich,

[01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:26.470]
Mayes when Genie explained the House family connection to the Bushes and said they were an

[01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:30.270]
unblust enthusiastic about voting for Kerry the Democratic nominee jokingly suggested they

[01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:34.350]
start a website. Genie House declined a comment and her statement on the site she denounces what

[01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:39.370]
she describes as Bush's imperialist cabal and stated that her understanding of Christianity based

[01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:43.610]
on a concern for peace and social justice was not compatible with the more conservative brand of

[01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:48.370]
Christianity embraced by the right wing lunatic president. All the House family members writing on

[01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:51.990]
the site are sharply critical of the president. Hillary House said she didn't feel comfortable

[01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:55.490]
telling friends and acquaintances of her family connection to the president given his conservative

[01:04:55.490 --> 01:05:00.110]
views until putting up the website which was completed about a week ago. I was very quiet about

[01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:03.970]
my family relationships she said I was really really embarrassed to be related to the president.

[01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:08.990]
How do you like that? And who the hell can blame that? Lamer. That poor nice lady. We're going to

[01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:13.030]
say bitch. So there you go that's excellent be it we got that honor yet within minutes.

[01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:19.270]
Relatives for Kerry whatever the hell was calm. Smirking chimpy whatever. Now Pat Robertson was out

[01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:22.770]
with Paul Azon last night. I was unfortunate enough to see that for about three minutes in between

[01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:27.230]
any of the baseball game and I saw that the grinning goon ball on there and I thought to myself

[01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:31.830]
what the hell are they dragged his ass out there for again but it turns out that it was a good

[01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:37.470]
thing they dragged his ass out you want to know why? Why? Pat Robertson says Bush told me there would

[01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:44.630]
be no casualties in Iraq. Yeah he warned Bush of the toll in Iraq and the president's response

[01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:49.850]
were not going to have any a war where nobody's going to die. How do you like that? Not that this

[01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:54.890]
president don't know nothing about not that he's a chicken hawk right the founder of US Christian

[01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:58.930]
coalition said yesterday he told president Bush before the invasion of Iraq that he should prepare

[01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:02.950]
Americans for the likelihood of casualties but the president told him we're not going to have any

[01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:10.650]
casualties not even a Abu Gharram not even there Pat Robertson and ardent Bush supporter said he

[01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:15.170]
had that conversation with the president Nashville Tennessee before the March 2000s re invasion

[01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:18.910]
he described Bush in the meeting as the most self-assured man I've ever met in my life

[01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:23.190]
you remember Mark Twain said he looked like a contented Christian with four aces I mean he was

[01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:27.510]
just sitting there like I'm on top of the world Robertson said on the Paul Azon now show and I

[01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:32.390]
warned him about this war I had deep misgivings about this war deep deep misgivings and I was

[01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:36.870]
trying to say Mr. President you better prepare the American people for casualties Robertson said

[01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:40.890]
the president then told him oh no we're not going to have any casualties the number by the way

[01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:46.730]
last time I checked was 113 well God told them there wouldn't be any right well God lies because

[01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:50.070]
God also I remember a month ago told Pat that the election was going to be a blowout he mentioned

[01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:54.170]
this last night now he says it's going to be nip and tuck tight tight as to which his ass that's

[01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:58.490]
what he said Robertson the telephansionist who sought to be public and presidential nomination

[01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:03.070]
in 1988 city wishes Bush would admit the mistakes made I mean the Lord told me was going to be

[01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:07.310]
a disaster and be messy Robertson said meaning the war I warned him about casualties how do you

[01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:12.650]
like that I'm going to read those two sentences again 100 US troops have died another 8,000

[01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:16.170]
been wounded in the ongoing campaign with a casualty told significantly increasing last six

[01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:21.170]
months as the insurgency there has deepened asked why Bushes refused to admit mistakes

[01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:24.950]
on Iraq Robertson said I don't know this politics game you know you can never say you were wrong

[01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:29.230]
because the opposition grabs on to it see he admitted he screwed up you just can't do that

[01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:38.490]
even Pat Robertson says we're dealing with a dumber all of course he supports an enthusiast

[01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:42.790]
right because God forbid he should port a liberal senator from Massachusetts right right

[01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:48.590]

[01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:54.710]
speaker to that well this is a great fact from Andy which I'll get to eventually in a couple

[01:12:54.710 --> 01:13:00.710]
minutes to read it yes I did pretty good stuff oh and how come it is that you remember before

[01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:04.570]
the award they were saying oh well we got to be very careful because uh Saddam is going to

[01:13:04.570 --> 01:13:08.190]
attack our troops he's going to use those chem as they get closer to Baghdad they're going to get

[01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:11.690]
attacked with those chemical and biological weapons remember that right and then there was this

[01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:18.990]
great shock about oh gee that didn't happen why because he didn't have any oh Connie lies oh see

[01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:22.950]
they're in that up again they already found everybody whipped up into a frenzy oh Saddam's

[01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:26.430]
going to gas our troops and he's going to use those chemical and biological weapons as he gets

[01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:32.250]
desperate in order to well guess what he didn't have you commanders were off run anyway this is

[01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:35.910]
from a rolling stone and the reason I guess we didn't get see Josh as we threw you the other

[01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:40.170]
story just read about the bush world is getting on their good job but I was talking about the

[01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:47.570]
help I'm stone who should I vote for from high times oh no that didn't go on there that was uh

[01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:52.270]
the link you sent to me it was weird yeah well the problem is it's 45 pages and I guess you have

[01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:56.730]
no way of extracting like the first two pages out of that and cutting it off at that yeah good call

[01:13:57.970 --> 01:14:02.610]
so I'll just read the first two pages how's that fair enough or I'll just read all 45 I didn't

[01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:07.110]
I just print it out the first two it's the important part says who help I'm stone who should I vote

[01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:12.510]
for a short answer John Kerry long answer if you like the job George W Bush is doing his president

[01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:16.590]
you should go ahead and vote for him but if you ask high times that's a bad idea we think he lied

[01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:20.670]
about a rack being a war of last resort and that's too big a lie to let pass now maybe you have

[01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:24.730]
faith in the president and don't think he would lie about a war fair enough but first stop and think

[01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:28.510]
about America's other war the one we're fighting in losing in Columbia the one that targets

[01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:34.710]
and arrests cancer patients at gunpoint the one that's filling out filling our for-profit prisons

[01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:39.310]
the one that's denying first offense nonviolent postmokers college loans the one we know to be

[01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:43.410]
nothing but a big lie a lie that's going bigger and bigger since Nixon first took it as part of

[01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:50.010]
his election campaign in 68 the war on drugs let's say it plain the war on drugs is bullshit and

[01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:54.010]
a barically shea now more than ever the war on drugs is bullshit every dollar the Bush

[01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:58.590]
administration is spent on television ads blaming postmokers for 9.11 or paying Tommy Chong's rent

[01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:03.070]
is one dollar less spent to secure a port put body armor on a soldier hunt down or some have been

[01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:07.050]
logged in this seems obvious until you remember that the drug war is not about reality it's not

[01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:11.450]
about winning everyone knows it can't be won but it can continually sustain the drug warriors

[01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:16.010]
people like Bush's drugs are John Walters who consistently claims that marijuana is more dangerous

[01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:21.370]
than heroin in the 1980s junk area exposed the hypocrisy of these drug warriors while serving

[01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:25.330]
on the center for relations commission he headed an investigation that turned up extensive evidence

[01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:29.590]
of drug deals involving the CIA and the contra rebels in Nicaragua evidence that pointed directly

[01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:34.710]
to the drug farms hostages scheme at the heart they ran contra scandal carry wasn't afraid to take

[01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:38.210]
on the dirty dealers who won our nation's corrupt drug war just as he took on the corrupt

[01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:42.390]
masters of war in the Pentagon after returning from duty in Vietnam and in the other corner

[01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:46.710]
wearing red trunks we have George W. Bush who took the easy way out of name supporting the war

[01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:50.990]
he would let someone else fight with little help from daddy's friends after securing W. Aspart

[01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:55.450]
in the Champaign unit of the Texas National Guard Bush's father would go on to head the CIA during

[01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:59.770]
its freewheeling seventies days of military coups and international narcotics dealing and was

[01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:03.590]
promoted device president by the time the agency's contra connection was exposed by John Kerry

[01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:08.870]
meanwhile Bush Jr. spent the first half of the 80s getting wasted perhaps on some of his father's

[01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:13.130]
contra coke and the second half letting daddy's rich friends bail him out of failed businesses and

[01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:18.470]
making him managing general partner the Texas Rangers now he's our president last year seven hundred

[01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:23.450]
thousand people arrested for pot in the U.S. and Bush's justice department continued to raid

[01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:28.390]
state sanctioned medical marijuana gardens at gunpoint John Kerry has promised to end the raids on

[01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:32.350]
medical marijuana gardens immediately it will have a policy toward marijuana and other drugs that

[01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:36.770]
makes sense the alternative four more years of Bush's continuing disaster for the rights of

[01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:41.150]
pot smokers many other Americans but don't take our word for it and then it's got a link to other

[01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:47.170]
articles for example uh carries marijuana experiment the democratic presidential nominees be

[01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:51.050]
sat in support of a groundbreaking proposal from the University of Massachusetts and was to grow

[01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:56.970]
marijuana for FDA for medical marijuana research uh John Kerry to Rolling Stone September 2003 said

[01:16:56.970 --> 01:17:00.250]
I've met plenty of people in my lifetime who've used marijuana about the same amount of some people

[01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:04.830]
drink beer or wine or have a cocktail I don't get too excited by any of that Kenneth Straub former

[01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:09.450]
director of normal says there was no question that marijuana reform policies would be better served

[01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:14.070]
with someone else in office other than George Bush Ethan Neville and executive director of the drug

[01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:19.210]
policy alliances when it comes to the drug war the Bush administration is a disaster the marijuana

[01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:24.790]
policy project who graded Kerry a minus on marijuana policy said Kerry would stop the DEA raids on

[01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:28.890]
seriously ill medical marijuana patients as president Kerry has previously said he favors federal

[01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:32.670]
legislation to allow people with cancer aids and other serious illnesses to have medical marijuana

[01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:37.630]
with their doctors approval normal dot org says as a senator Kerry has been supportive of state

[01:17:37.630 --> 01:17:41.630]
wild medical marijuana reform efforts in his home state of Massachusetts he praised legislation

[01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:46.090]
approved by the Massachusetts legislature in 96 that sought to establish a medical i'm a

[01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:50.150]
medicinal marijuana therapeutic research program and most recently wrote a letter to the DEA in

[01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:55.090]
support of a University of Massachusetts emers proposal to manufacture marijuana for FDA approved

[01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:59.990]
medical marijuana we said it goes on and on on on high times dot com if you want to look up the

[01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:05.910]
articles 45 pages long high times dot com got it i got it i'm sure you do you are listening to

[01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:20.110]
me evil neo-rotters exclusively on five six eight and Bush I guess not I supported Bush after that

[01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:28.230]
project day I'm too much a prize disgusting shame he let the soldiers and the lady get away

[01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:34.750]
and shifted the blame to Saddam Hussein we're up to piling high back

[01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:45.210]
they're not the ones for what happens what's going on with this stuff we're up to piling high back

[01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:57.750]
people's cultures are having fun as we spread freedom to the point of our

[01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:05.650]
freedom we believe he's sending our kids to die and we're doing my words to support this guy

[01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:12.250]
in advanced state of stifles must be the reason why they believe George William is Jesus Christ

[01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:22.130]
we're up you piling high back yeah not the ones who are down what's going on with this

[01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:30.030]
right back we're up to piling high rock boy George what do you hate so many big patients

[01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:37.150]
you know it's hard work it's hard work everybody knows it's hard work we've got a lot of hard work

[01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:42.510]
I see on the TV screens how hard it is yeah I uh

[01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:51.010]
they just got a fades off into a netherland 1246 that was for George because you liked it so much

[01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:55.790]
the first time that's great anyway uh I just mentioned this for anybody out there who is thinking

[01:19:55.790 --> 01:20:04.230]
of voting for Ralph Nader don't in 2000 in the state of Florida Ralph Nader got 97,488 votes

[01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:10.230]
Bush allegedly won when they stopped the count at 537 okay Nader got 97 out of the percentages

[01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:16.790]
in Florida in 2000 because they pulled the Nader people 47% of the people said if they didn't vote

[01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:21.690]
for Nader they would have voted for Gore 21% for Bush and 30% said they wouldn't have voted at all

[01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:26.730]
does it take a genius to figure out that at two thirds of the votes that who went to Nader that's

[01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:32.170]
uh be 60,000 is a little more than 537 that Gore would have won Florida by a landslide and

[01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:38.470]
in this year's polling so far without Nader on the ballot those people who plan on voting for Nader

[01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:44.390]
51% said they would prefer Kerry 23% said Bush and 25% said they wouldn't vote at all if Nader

[01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:49.410]
weren't on the ballot so the same thing's going to happen again possibly and very probably very

[01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:53.670]
likely if you idiots go out there see you know those people are just like Nader himself that's why

[01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:58.010]
they were late to because they're stubborn they're like stubborn mules rhymes with fools

[01:20:59.890 --> 01:21:04.370]
here's a fact from JP lawyer listener who says as we sit in our churches on Sunday from the

[01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:09.690]
pulpit comes a booming voice espousing all the reasons why George W. Bush is the candidate for

[01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:14.610]
Christians and the Christian churches all over this country every single Sunday the defense for

[01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:19.350]
the war in Iraq is it will spread Christianity throughout the world and you notice there wasn't too

[01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:24.310]
long before we got in there that we had our gechkees going over there already I know yeah the missionaries

[01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:29.730]
who spent a lot of time in the missionary position anyway JP says I've had a Christian on my whole

[01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:33.950]
life and I am today but if the God that I worship approves of killing women children and elder men

[01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:38.170]
not to mention Americans and if that got approves of removing fathers from their children sons from

[01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:41.890]
their mothers and husbands from their wives for the sole purpose of spreading Christianity in the

[01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:46.550]
Middle East and that's not my God it's truly sad to watch these poor soul sitting in the

[01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:51.190]
pews on Sunday clapping and approving the words that come from a simple man's mouth religion is

[01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:55.510]
crept into their souls and distracted their capacity to think for themselves read study exploring

[01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:59.770]
you'll find that no God approves of this madness wake up Christians and smell the crusades

[01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:04.570]
when asked to name one single thing Bush has done for the good of the whole of this country the

[01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:09.390]
church going a bush supporting Christian darted the L darted forward in the old this is a war

[01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:14.430]
about spreading the word of those who need it most dear God I pray you don't bless this crusade says

[01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.330]
JP dear God I gotta get a hold of that one of these days

[01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:25.610]
the else huh I could email it to you yeah email it what am I gonna do with it then

[01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:31.110]
but that's right we should have we should have what's his name fix it come up here I'll burn

[01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:35.710]
in mess up my board no thanks and the facts as it says hey Neil I'm sending you this fact to

[01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:40.330]
inform you of a conversation I head with my father-in-law he's the type of person who sits in front of

[01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:44.050]
the couch all day and watch his television that's basically his only source of entertainment since

[01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:50.550]
he doesn't lift a finger if early all day as a result he watches Fox News all day long oh my God

[01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:54.230]
I had a conversation last night with him and he asked me who I was voting for which left me

[01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:58.430]
quite bitter once we were done these Republicans are so blind to the idea of George Bush and his

[01:22:58.430 --> 01:23:02.710]
Nazi regime that they live by it and swear by it if George Bush were to say I'm gonna end the

[01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:06.710]
world tomorrow because it's good for all Americans most Republicans would say you know what good idea

[01:23:06.710 --> 01:23:11.730]
they don't think their machines with the ignorance button jammed all this man was talking to me about

[01:23:11.730 --> 01:23:16.170]
the whole time was how great George Bush is and how John Kerry's a communist were Cubans so that

[01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:20.330]
topic always comes up with any democratic president for some reason he said that if John Kerry

[01:23:20.330 --> 01:23:25.110]
were elected Fidel Castro would rule down A1A with a fat cigar in his mouth with no worries at

[01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:30.130]
least we get about a cube anyway which in reality boggles the mind how someone can actually

[01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:33.770]
think like that he was also stating that it's the right thing to send all our troops to Iraq because

[01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:38.310]
we're defeating terrorism that way when in reality the troops should have spent more time here

[01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:42.670]
protecting our home then go off and fight for a pointless cause he kept repeating how we should

[01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:46.910]
keep sending American after American to Iraq to get the job done basically till the Iraq comes

[01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:50.470]
round to him there's nothing better than that there is no other way for these people they have

[01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:54.850]
simplistic mouse-like minds with no real capacity to think for what will truly benefit the greater good

[01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:58.990]
it's sad how all Republicans have forgotten the real reason why we're at war we're at war because

[01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:02.810]
we have to defeat the terrorists who attacked our homeland or some of it not said I'm

[01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:50.890]
thinking about that that was hate let's have another pot luck supper to plan our strategy or

[01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:56.990]
strategy for what for a freight and Cubans that was incredible well at least it gave him his

[01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:02.150]
cousin something to do anyway let's have a barbecue and right hey there you go WQAM hello

[01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:08.950]
hello but I hope it circumspect yes sir either and I just left an early polling right yes

[01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:15.310]
and um my first question was could you go anywhere you wanted to vote the counting as they told me

[01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:20.990]
yeah so I was a way to an hour and a half of that right but they gave you the sample ballot that

[01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:26.090]
explains all the amendments so you're just surprised when you walk in there right and that people

[01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:29.350]
should do their homework before they walk in otherwise they're going to be a token forever in a day

[01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:34.010]
to vote I think I think everybody you know who really wants to vote should go by one day pick this

[01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:38.630]
up take it home and study then go and make it educated right that that's right because it's like

[01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:41.970]
they got to go through the track it opens the racing form in front of the teller with 30 seconds

[01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:45.510]
to post time and he's studying the form you know you should do your homework ahead of time so when

[01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:49.550]

[01:30:55.570 --> 01:31:00.370]
isn't a rock here in the national has been talking and gave a few more details of how he was

how she was kidnapped yes tonight mirror out there in fact there are a lot of people afraid to even

[01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:07.670]
go outdoors but nevertheless so we're doing a hell of a good job George W Bush's brand of

[01:31:07.670 --> 01:31:11.450]
compassion doesn't please all the florist conservatives these days the limited Spanish proficient

[01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:16.190]
president's message isn't translating very well among Kubano americans even though Bush came to

[01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:20.090]
Miami bearing federal gifts of billions of dollars for storm ravaged residents of the hurricane

[01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:24.450]
state has continued to trumpet his support for the embargo against cashiers Cuba and has been

[01:31:24.450 --> 01:31:29.910]
saucying up his broken English with English speeches with broken Spanish on August 27th in Miami

[01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:34.570]
he said last weekend we're continuing to implement our strategy of la Verda the truth

[01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:39.830]
to see a carry speaking french by the way of that audience of Haitians the other day no he speaks

[01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:43.570]
fluent french I just mentioned that in passing oh he's a breed eating liberal from us the right

[01:31:43.570 --> 01:31:49.430]
that proves it probably eats french fries too and french toast thanks to Bush's man announcement

[01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:53.170]
of new regulations limiting travel between the u.s. and Cuba significant political divisions have

[01:31:53.170 --> 01:31:58.790]
taken root among here to four reliably republican oqb and americans as a consequence of the

[01:31:58.790 --> 01:32:04.050]
free policy changes if reduced by Bush's commission for assistance to a free Cuba Cubans would

[01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:07.850]
grow used to visiting family on the la isla at least once a year can now see the relatives only

[01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:12.490]
once every three years the commission also plays new restrictions on remittances monies family

[01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:16.390]
sent from the u.s. to other countries and change the definition of which family members are eligible

[01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:20.950]
for both visits and remittances dismissing the Latin American sense of family which includes

[01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:25.990]
distant relatives and favorably a more waspish North American one which emphasizes spouses sons

[01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:31.390]
and daughters parents and siblings these policies have divided divided the cuban political family

[01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:36.710]
by dividing the cuban genealogically a genealogical family when the president arrived recently

[01:32:36.710 --> 01:32:40.810]
of iami arena deliver a speech aimed at showing up support among older more conservative cuban

[01:32:40.810 --> 01:32:45.430]
americans greeting him outside were a group of younger highly educated 20 30 and 40 something

[01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:50.530]
cuban American protesters waving american and cuban flags and placards saying Bush don't divide

[01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:54.930]
the cuban family remembers a group such as cuban americans for change which opposes the travel

[01:32:54.930 --> 01:32:58.510]
and remittance restrictions for the same single might in this that has long to find the political

[01:32:58.510 --> 01:33:03.750]
culture said it in fake Spanish colonial streets a little havana for them the family crisis has

[01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:09.090]
a plan to the embargo and as a result the 40 plus a year embargo based unity fostered by aging

[01:33:09.090 --> 01:33:14.090]
ex al patriarcs and ex cia operatives are coming on glued the once monolithic wall of cuban american

[01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:21.150]
politics is cracking can you hear the crack oh is that that was nor smoking the election year

[01:33:21.150 --> 01:33:25.550]
volatility of coyote politics was previewed during the alien ganzales affair which galvanized bush

[01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:30.530]
and goryling cubans around the old guard republican embargo politicos to help bush to victory in 2000

[01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:35.370]
but the alien saga was only the most public seen in a political drama that will reach its climax

[01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:40.050]
when u.s born cubans and those who migrated after 1980 come to full political maturity as they

[01:33:40.050 --> 01:33:44.330]
register and voted the next decade it's already clear that the division between those who wanted

[01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:48.490]
to find the cuban family by continuing and tightening the embargo and those cuban americans wanting

[01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:53.090]
to unite the family by removing the embargo is permanent unlike the once-emovable institutions that

[01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:58.610]
built cuban american power the cuban american national foundation was once the star chamber of

[01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:03.310]
mimie politics back when it housed the desk of late jore hey mascarosa who's destroyed into the

[01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:07.870]
white house and helped shape u.s policy around cuban the rest of latin america mascarosa also

[01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:12.910]
held a hand in selecting people for crucial positions from local and state officials to the

[01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:17.550]
head of the powerful latin american desk of the state department today castrow foe jogar cia

[01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:23.210]
former head and current member of c a n f outlines the new contours of kai ocho real politic

[01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:27.610]
we're not single issue anymore and we care much more about uh things just than the embargo

[01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:31.410]
carcise has been outspoken about what he feels is the short-sightedness of the bush of

[01:34:31.410 --> 01:34:35.430]
administrations cuban policies i think that what bush has done best is to refine how he says

[01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:39.370]
viva cuba liberate in order to produce a short-term psychological effect that inspires people

[01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:43.530]
like by grandmother who is displaced from her home displaced from her family displaced from her

[01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:47.870]
culture displaced from her country says and a refrain heard with greater frequency along kai ocho

[01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:52.610]
garci adds unfortunately for the republicans many of us heard this four years ago and know that it

[01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:59.010]
means nothing beyond november changing on kai ocho baby although i would like to see when you

[01:34:59.010 --> 01:35:03.990]
like to see fidel draught alone the a1a with a big fat one in his mouth big fat one

[01:35:05.110 --> 01:35:09.890]
scary young rights in the guardian oh it's that the left wing guardian you know oh yeah

[01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:13.390]
well we're just sending all of that great propagated o'ahio and i hope they continue it

[01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:19.270]
suppressed the vote by any means necessary he says in the sixties police dogs and billet clubs kept

[01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:24.570]
black americans from the polls today's methods are more refined he said there's nothing like

[01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:28.910]
george bush let me try it again there's nothing george bush likes more than extolling the

[01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:33.410]
virtues of democracy in faraway places on october 8th during the second presidential debate he

[01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:37.910]
promised freedom is on the march tomorrow afghanistan will be voting for president apparently some

[01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:42.010]
afghans enjoyed the new freedom so much they voted for the u.s. surrogate hamad karzai several times

[01:35:42.010 --> 01:35:46.630]
over after the ink used to mark powder the voters thumbs were off by the middle of the day all

[01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:51.790]
fifteen of karzai's challenges had withdrawn freedom was not even limping let alone marching today's

[01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:56.250]
election is not a legitimate election said abduals satar sarat actor he and other discontent candidates

[01:35:56.250 --> 01:36:01.290]
had met in his house bush's national security adviser kandaleezza rice new better this election

[01:36:01.290 --> 01:36:05.270]
is going to be judged legitimate she said i'm certain of it when it comes to fixing elections

[01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:10.250]
the bush administration has a way of making the lame walk by monday and exit poll funded by the

[01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:13.510]
west government and conducted by the international republican institute which has licensed the

[01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:18.210]
republican party revealed karzai is a comfortable winner after diplomatic armed twisting by the

[01:36:18.210 --> 01:36:23.070]
west ambassador the fifteen challenges withdrew their withdrawals it was a miracle a few days later

[01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:28.010]
the final presidential debate bush would literally claim divine intervention if at in afghanistan

[01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:32.470]
i believe that the that the freedom there is a gift from the al-mighty he said back in the us

[01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:37.070]
however the al-mighty seems far less generous what she's enthusiastic to export democracies not

[01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:41.430]
match by his desire to defend it at home we just a fortnight to go to the presidential election

[01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:45.430]
efforts to obstruct and deny the vote especially in black and latino voters are intensify

[01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:49.350]
forty years after the civil rights act enshrined the franchise in the constitution of

[01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:53.990]
rafrican americans freedom is being crippled the group most likely to serve in a rakan afghanistan

[01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:58.370]
where they are sensibly are extending democracy and freedom african americans is most likely to be

[01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:02.650]
denied rights here in the u.s there's nothing new in this contradiction in the cold war when the

[01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:06.530]
u.s. lecture the eastern block on the delights of democracy black americans couldn't vote

[01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:11.490]
the issue of disenfranchised disenfranchised it doesn't affect only minorities the use of

[01:37:11.490 --> 01:37:15.410]
electronic voting in many states using machines that leave no paper trail and sent confidence

[01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:19.930]
that a fair election is likely or even possible into free fall once dismissed as the obsession

[01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:25.150]
of conspiracy theorists fear of fraud is now mainstream when your vote be counted as the cover of

[01:37:25.150 --> 01:37:29.210]
this week election protest already started fraud intimidation ledges in key states as the

[01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:34.070]

[01:37:39.090 --> 01:37:43.730]
republican ellen bogged it off on a seat in florida senate by just 12 votes out of almost 11,000

[01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:48.650]
cast according to state law there should have been an automatic recount more over 137 votes emerged

[01:37:48.650 --> 01:37:52.550]
blank but because the voting had been done by machine there was nothing to recount bogged

[01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:55.290]
off the seat the machines will be used the same ones that over a second

[01:37:56.890 --> 01:38:01.290]
sometimes these efforts bear the official imprimatur of local officials given the debacle in

[01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:05.230]
florida four years ago you would think the governor bushes brother jeb would be anxious to ensure

[01:38:05.230 --> 01:38:09.930]
that anyone who wants to can vote and studies introduced rule that registration forms should be

[01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:14.150]
rejected if a citizenship box is not complete even when people have cited oath on the same

[01:38:14.150 --> 01:38:18.710]
form declaring themselves to be US citizens meanwhile all how is republican secretary of state

[01:38:18.710 --> 01:38:22.730]
Kenneth blackwell attended when forced to rule by which only registration cards printed on heavy

[01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:27.250]
80 pound paper stock would be accepted claiming lighter cards might be shredded by postal

[01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:31.210]
equipment meaning that voters who have to re-register on heavier paper might not make it on time

[01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:35.510]
and last summer the chief executive of die bold which makes many of the voting machines said

[01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:38.510]
he was committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to bush

[01:38:39.610 --> 01:38:43.670]
african americans however rainly principal targetly republican campaign to block the voter like

[01:38:43.670 --> 01:38:47.830]
the sixties when black americans were barred from the polls by police dogs water cannons and billy

[01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:54.350]
clubs the means they are more refined occasionally the masked slips in july john poppah george michigan's

[01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:58.210]
republican state legislator till they republican meeting if we do not suppress the Detroit vote

[01:38:58.210 --> 01:39:02.470]
we're gonna have a tough time in a selection cycle Detroit is 83 percent black it doesn't take

[01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:07.070]
a genius to work out whose votes he was keen to suppress so far it's been mainly a mix of petty

[01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:11.330]
harassment and bureaucratic pedantry devised to imitate newly registered and poor voters a huge

[01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:15.970]
proportion of whom are black and latino take florida according to the washington post african americans

[01:39:15.970 --> 01:39:20.150]
and republican run duval county were the most likely to have the registration forms rejected

[01:39:20.150 --> 01:39:25.170]
while rejections for democrats outnumbered republicans by three to one in two thousand forty two

[01:39:25.170 --> 01:39:29.710]
percent of ballots rejected by duval county election board came from mainly black areas in

[01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:33.550]
Ohio mr black well also told election boards that anyone who turned up at the wrong polling station

[01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:37.990]
would not be able to cast a provisional ballot to be verified later the democrats successfully

[01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:41.890]
sued saying that the ruling would disavantage minority and poor voters who tend to move more often

[01:39:41.890 --> 01:39:45.890]
it isn't difficult to fathom what is driving these efforts which are being replicated

[01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:50.370]
throughout the country the best indication of how an american will vote is race more than 80

[01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:54.290]
percent of african americans voted democrat in the last election incapable of persuading them

[01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:58.850]
to vote republican republicans now seek to prevent them from voting democrat this task is become

[01:39:58.850 --> 01:40:02.910]
especially urgent because voter registration recently ended many states revealing that the voter

[01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:07.330]
roles in black and latino where is have swollen and far greater numbers than in republican precincts

[01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:11.570]
between the last election in august this year almost two hundred thousand additional black

[01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:15.790]
voters were registered just in florida so while these attempts are clearly racial in nature

[01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:20.010]
they're essentially partisan and motivation with apologies to amalcom x they're about winning by

[01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:25.030]
any means necessary republicans support democracy when democracy supports republicans but they're

[01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:29.470]
equally happy to do it without would to do without it when it's inconvenient it's always true

[01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:33.770]
abroad for Venezuela and the caragua of pakistan as Saudi Arabia now it's true at home from Detroit

[01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:38.230]
to do while county freedom is on the retreat and the man who was sued off his four years ago thanks

[01:40:38.230 --> 01:40:42.370]
to thousands of distant fries this enfranchised black voters is again leaving the chart

[01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:48.150]
you are listening to new Rogers it's close to 8 a.m

[01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:49.670]
uh

[01:40:53.030 --> 01:41:06.790]
that nice

[01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:12.550]
Oh

[01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:18.130]
and then

[01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:18.130]

[01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:26.070]
I really want to see you on the way to Seoul.

[01:41:26.670 --> 01:41:33.350]
Just where we are we are on the way to Seoul.

[01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:37.590]
Somebody with that name.

[01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:42.710]
The endorsement also will put Schwarzenegger and the state Republican Party, which officially opposes Prop 71.

[01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:51.390]
And perhaps with the Bush administration, which has limited federal funding of the research to pacify the right wing port again, the lunatics, the fetus squeezers, the embryo huggers.

[01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:55.710]
Man. Now what's this?

[01:41:57.430 --> 01:42:01.710]
Well look at that. These are the top advertisers that have ads cushioned around the Sinclair ad.

[01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:06.810]
Why? Do you understand that? I don't know.

[01:42:06.810 --> 01:42:13.530]
Ads cushioned around the Sinclair show that they're going to show Friday night on the most not all of their affiliates by the way they're going to carry it.

[01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:19.390]
Most now. They're back and off like they're backpittling like crazy. Hit them in the pocketbook maybe and they weren't like hell.

[01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:24.130]
Let's see. Arbise. What else? Circuit City.

[01:42:24.970 --> 01:42:28.070]
Full Mar Gunn and Pond in Tennessee. Hannah for Supermarket.

[01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:30.670]
He's in Portland. Huh? Some of these are for local.

[01:42:30.670 --> 01:42:35.430]
Right. I understand. Homemakers, Fredrician, Des Moines, I am pet food and Dayton.

[01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:44.030]
But I am as a national product once upon a child. When Mark Minneapolis, most of you, Flint, Michigan right away.

[01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:48.310]
I bet you. And Flint, Michigan, I bet you Michael Moore's bill excited about that.

[01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:55.870]
You ask cellular. Oops. And that's not ours. No. And Watson's in Kansas City.

[01:42:55.870 --> 01:43:01.930]
That's interesting. The only problem is most although maybe we want to put that on here so people can click on these links.

[01:43:01.930 --> 01:43:06.110]
It has links to the one to that. I can do that.

[01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:16.850]
So people can let them know how disgusted and grotesque enough so they are all though again. We just I mean the only one in Florida that I see on here is full Mar Gunn and Pond in Tela Hassee.

[01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:22.370]
And there are a couple of national ones on here like Arbise and Circuit City. But anyway, if you want to find if not, that's okay too.

[01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:24.550]
I'll leave that in your fine hands. I already said it there.

[01:43:25.150 --> 01:43:36.390]
Oh, we're fine. See now here comes which I threatened to read this earlier in the day and I keep putting it off. I have no idea why because this should remember how many times I've told you that when I go to Europe, which is about how many times a year.

[01:43:36.670 --> 01:43:42.590]
And I watch CNN International over there that that they really give you good news. I mean they read it more like the BBC.

[01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:48.830]
They don't suck up the administration. They don't have the buckle in Iraq and it's like a different network.

[01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:55.150]
But again, you don't see that stuff domestically. Well, here's the tip off by David Lindorf of CounterPunch.

[01:43:55.210 --> 01:43:58.870]
You said the scandal of George Bush's earpiece debate cheating device continues to grow.

[01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:05.510]
I just got a look at the full Fox tape of President Bush's May 04 joint news conference with French President Jacques

[01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:11.650]
Iraq. In that tape, as in several other tapes I've seen, Bush could be heard seemingly getting prompting from another voice.

[01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:24.430]
About 12 seconds into the piece, the leading voice says, and I look forward to working to and Bush comes in with, and I look work in and I look forward to work into the verbal slip of makes it clear this is no electronic echo or sound synchronization problem.

[01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:30.890]
At another point about a minute and 16 seconds into the tape, the leading voice looks out allowed exhale of breath. Bush does not follow suit.

[01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:34.290]
There's no preceding voice when a reporter has heard asking a question on Wednesday.

[01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:43.870]
Since writing my initial exposé in Salon magazine, I was dead usual request for interviews by local station news programs and talk show host, all of whom gave the story serious coverage.

[01:44:44.250 --> 01:44:51.010]
But no calls from National Radio News programs, not even NPR, which never did a piece only a commentary week late on its on the media program.

[01:44:51.570 --> 01:45:00.870]
On the big TV networks, the story was handled as comic relief. It made Letterman let on Comedy Central, but not the news programs, though they're the ones with the video archives which reporter should be combating.

[01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:05.490]
On the part of the national media. If it were just a matter of laudity news, just minute would be bad enough.

[01:45:05.770 --> 01:45:17.970]
But the fact that both the times of the post-Authanide, the public serious stories about the matter that they've destroyed broke, and that CNN sought as important enough to air it on CNN International, shows that something far worse is going on, the deliberate deep-sixing of a story embarrassing to the president.

[01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:27.350]
The White House and the Bush campaign for their park continued to dismiss questions about what Bush was wearing in the debates and other occasions by contributing the story to the internet, or that the internet.

[01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:34.890]
In fact, this has been the case with many of the important stories about the Iraq War and the Bush administration. The internet is proving to be where the real journalism is happening.

[01:45:35.150 --> 01:45:41.930]
Amen, David Lorndor, which is why we put these stories on our website, and why I spend all this time reading them and fumbling through them here on the show.

[01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:49.730]
Because if you expect to get the real news from CNN or Fox or MSNBC or the commercial networks, you can forget about it.

[01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:53.530]
As somebody I wouldn't know would say. You know who would say that? Who? Well.

[01:45:53.530 --> 01:45:56.610]
But, God about it. Whoever that is.

[01:45:58.210 --> 01:46:06.230]

Chewy and...

[01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:27.290]
Stop at the night!

[01:47:27.290 --> 01:47:33.790]
Child obesity is a national epidemic, but how can you teach your kids healthy eating habits?

[01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:37.430]
It's easy with low carb Mr. Potato Head.

[01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:41.270]
Oh, low carb Mr. Potato Head's ears are made out of bacon.

[01:47:41.530 --> 01:47:43.950]
And his feet are made out of lamb chops.

[01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:49.990]
Yes, all the parts of low carb Mr. Potato Head are made from all the healthy foods your kids should eat.

[01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:54.570]
Put in eyes made from steak or a mouth made from pork loin.

[01:47:54.570 --> 01:47:56.130]
Do we get to eat the potato?

[01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:58.230]
No kids, that has carbs.

[01:47:58.570 --> 01:48:03.790]
That's why you should never eat vegetables or fruit or bread or dairy products.

[01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:04.430]
Yay!

[01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:10.170]
If you want your kids to grow up healthy, don't get them toys like bicycles or fashion balls.

[01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.890]
Find them low carb Mr. Potato Head.

[01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:15.230]
Pull the makers of little ticandial plastic kids.

[01:48:15.670 --> 01:48:18.650]
132-560 WQM, here's the appol so far.

[01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:21.570]
What's your...what's in these groups bugs you the most?

[01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:23.310]
Born again, crit boy.

[01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.570]
Yeah.

[01:48:23.770 --> 01:48:29.650]
I hate everybody 71, Haitians 32, New Yorkers 31, which we thought would do better than that.

[01:48:30.110 --> 01:48:33.850]
African Americans 29, French Canadians 28, they are the worst.

[01:48:34.130 --> 01:48:37.470]
Oh God, disgusting, rude, nasty.

[01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:45.870]
Anyway, June 26, I like everybody 25, red next 24, Muslims 20, Jamaican 7-mon, and Catholics only 5.

[01:48:46.570 --> 01:48:50.730]
Well, first of all, I mean, you know, most Catholics think it's all a bunch of crap anyway, right?

[01:48:51.670 --> 01:48:53.250]
It depends, they're shaped.

[01:48:53.650 --> 01:48:54.390]
Well, it's super Dennis.

[01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:57.490]
Let's see, what's this fact you just say?

[01:48:57.550 --> 01:49:03.210]
I mean, it's becoming apparent the final smur against Carey is going to be more of yet, and I'm more of a vets alleging that his anti...

[01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:04.790]
You know what?

[01:49:05.490 --> 01:49:07.150]
That stuff is ancient history now.

[01:49:07.610 --> 01:49:10.390]
I mean, the fact that they even tried that in the first place and had some success with it

[01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:13.970]
is only a tribute to the lack of education in America, and that nobody knows any history.

[01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:19.790]
But I think that crap that happened 30 years ago, I think it's a little bit too late for that by now.

[01:49:21.230 --> 01:49:27.510]
Anyway, Jim goes on to say, in 62, I was 17, I was just like Bush, I didn't like the war, but I didn't like the early anti-war move, and either

[01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:32.650]
I had caused deferments, and when they ran out, my father had afraid it was a career officer in the National Guard, he found an opening for me.

[01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:38.970]
I even remember what the establishment was saying to defend the position in Vietnam, we'd have to fight the communist over there, they'll come here and kill us, son, for Middior.

[01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:44.370]
It was people like Carey and Perot that helped them legitimize the opposition of the war, and that's finally brought it to an end.

[01:49:45.010 --> 01:50:01.790]
It is of utmost importance that you and other responsible spokespeople work to get the whole story of the Vietnam era, and Carey's rule on behalf of all of us that went that war on the year, and after as many people were being land-based by the Bush propaganda machine, we can't let Bush manipulate history just to justify our continued development in another wrong war.

[01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:06.350]
God bless America says, Jim, thank you Jim, excellent point. Where is Jim? Jim is a somewhere.

[01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:20.010]
Well he's right, and I don't know what else I can say, I mean, you know, those of us who lived through it, it was a grotesque brutal war, we should have had no business being there in the first place, other than to defend the built multinational corporations, that was what that was all about.

[01:50:20.710 --> 01:50:24.570]
Again, yeah, like the Good Year Tire and Rubber Company, things like that, a lot of rubber over there.

[01:50:26.110 --> 01:50:28.210]
I mean, how can you have rubbers without Vietnam, right?

[01:50:28.590 --> 01:50:41.250]
But anyway, to make a long story short, as the 60s were on, and the hippies were busy getting shot at Kent State, but finally they persevered in more and more of them in the early 70s and finally brought it to an end.

[01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:47.030]
But it was only, I think Walter Cronkite, as far as the media is concerned, can finally be given credit. Why don't we have a Walter Cronkite today?

[01:50:48.110 --> 01:50:50.110]
I guess what, Dan, you ain't no Walter Cronkite.

[01:50:50.890 --> 01:51:04.310]
As you notice how quickly your horse wasn't in his decision, but I'll quickly CVS back the way from that story that we're going to have about 60 minutes about the felonious reasons for the war in Iraq, which would have been a hell of a lot more important than the one they showed that they got all the heat for about the guard, which everybody knows that anyway.

[01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:14.250]
But nevertheless, and of course it's very fashionable to talk about Hanoi, Jane, and about Joan Baez and all these other commies, sympathizers, pinkos, etc and so on.

[01:51:14.250 --> 01:51:26.190]
But all the atrocities, the me and I massacre all of these things are a part of history. They're well documented. We've butchered thousands and thousands and thousands of people, 58,000 American kids came home in body bags and again for what? For nothing?

[01:51:27.170 --> 01:51:28.610]
For absolutely nothing.

[01:51:29.770 --> 01:51:37.130]
Based on the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that was alive, Solan and Johnson can go in here and flex his muscle. See, Johnson would have gone down in history as a great president.

[01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:49.510]
So the Republicans have succeeded very well in taking this word liberal, making it a dirty word. The Pat Robertsons and the Jerry Fowell, while all the other right wing Christianistas, they've made it liberal.

[01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:55.150]
Oh, dirty word. What the hell is wrong with that? And this article points it out very well. He says, wasn't Jesus a liberal?

[01:51:56.490 --> 01:52:04.410]
Liberalism has been under assault for years now. The baddering of this grand political philosophy is all to the contemporary definition of liberal to the point that conservatives use it as a profane word.

[01:52:04.410 --> 01:52:14.890]
They use it to pay the political opponents, anti-god and anti-American. It's gone to the point that moderate liberal Christians are afraid to be open about their political leanings. Sadly, it even affects their conscience and choices as they end in the voting booth.

[01:52:15.330 --> 01:52:18.690]
This is especially troubling to me as a Christian evangelical minister who loves America.

[01:52:19.570 --> 01:52:32.750]
Liberalism is defined by Webster's third new international dictionary, a political philosophy based on belief in progress, the essential goodness of a man, and the autonomy of the individual and standing for tolerance and freedom for the individual from arbitrary authority and all spheres of life.

[01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:43.790]
I'm not sure why anyone would feel threatened by liberalism is defined by the dictionary. They're apparently they are apparently unaware of simply refused to acknowledge the long history of liberals who have labored for the betterment of society and the furthering of God's kingdom.

[01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:52.970]
The labor movement of the early 20th century was dated significantly when major Christian denominations got behind it. No average American would have a fair wage today if it weren't for liberal Christians and labor activists.

[01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:57.770]
Liberal Christians and civil rights activists fought and still fight against conservative America for racial equality.

[01:52:57.770 --> 01:53:03.310]
Child labor laws were enacted because liberals fought for them. Medicare and Social Security exist today because of liberalism.

[01:53:03.630 --> 01:53:07.710]
Bleeding heart liberals have long advocated for the homeless, the hungry, the less fortunate, the less enfranchised.

[01:53:07.930 --> 01:53:18.290]
The women of America owe liberals a big thank you for their almost equal rights. Tree hugging liberals fight for clean air and water standards instead of favoring industrial polluters and short term profiteering that destroyed God's green earth.

[01:53:19.630 --> 01:53:26.610]
Liberals believe in affordable health care for all US citizens. They also believe in higher taxes for the rich and lower taxes for the Middle Affairs that is American politics.

[01:53:26.770 --> 01:53:29.010]
We better do the break and I'll finish this when we come back.

[01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:41.210]
Play like men and they look like women.

[01:53:49.610 --> 01:53:58.450]
You be sitting watching the TV with the finger of their foot. Well, why come to know why come to know what Christians do for both?

[01:53:58.610 --> 01:54:05.130]
Be violent in the cold, why come to know why come to know what Christians do for both?

[01:54:05.410 --> 01:54:14.130]
Most are violent hasty from the faculty. They're telling facts of macaroni and cheese.

[01:54:14.130 --> 01:54:22.650]
Cut holes in the ditchy, just in case they reproduce. That's just about all they're allowed to do.

[01:54:26.670 --> 01:54:44.110]
Why come to know why come to know what come to know?

[01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:48.410]
Why come to know why come to know what Christians do for both?

[01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:57.510]
See that standing need and sit back down against you.

[01:54:58.050 --> 01:55:05.750]
They applaud you all down with a 12-pack of food. Live a life aboard a pop-to-head and you'll go.

[01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:09.370]
Got only smile and find food.

[01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:18.010]
I'm going to make my witness.

[01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:35.370]
I'm going to make my witness.

[01:55:35.650 --> 01:55:35.730]
I'm going to make my witness.

[01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:40.010]
Anyway, getting back to the end of this scary advance article wasn't Jesus the Liberally.

[01:55:40.090 --> 01:55:46.370]
He says Jesus was the ultimate liberal progressive revolutionary of all history, the conservative religious and social structure that he defied, hated, and crucified him.

[01:55:46.630 --> 01:55:50.630]
He examined his life and did not like what they saw. He aligned himself with the poor and the oppressed.

[01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:54.730]
He challenged the religious orthodoxy of his day. He advocated passive, his own loving, our enemies.

[01:55:55.150 --> 01:55:59.710]
He liberated women and minorities from oppression. He healed on the Sabbath and forgave adulterers and prostitutes.

[01:55:59.710 --> 01:56:06.030]
He associated with drunks and other social outcasts. He rebuked the religious right of his day because they embraced the letter of the law instead of the spirit.

[01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:12.350]
He loved sinners and called them to himself. Jesus was the original liberal. He was a progressive and he was judged and hated for it.

[01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:15.670]
It was the self-righteous religionist that he rebuked and he called them hypocrites.

[01:56:16.150 --> 01:56:21.070]
The primary issues of Christian liberalism were birthed when Jesus spoke the profoundly prophetic words found in Matthew.

[01:56:21.610 --> 01:56:27.070]
These scriptures revealed God's hearts for the poor, the sick, and other neglected people throughout our history. Matthew 31-46.

[01:56:27.070 --> 01:56:33.390]
Christians should read this text and judge for themselves which of the two groups mentioned there more accurately reflect the political parties of today.

[01:56:33.610 --> 01:56:36.390]
His liberalism lives on the day and the issues have not changed much.

[01:56:36.810 --> 01:56:44.250]
I'm glad the conservative Republican candidates advocated for the family and a few Christian issues, but we've got to quit pretending that they're the only ones that Christians should consider voting for.

[01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:53.030]
People shouldn't call themselves pro-life if they're only anti-abortion and yet feel or twinge of conscience over the unforeplication of capital punishment or war is fought for dubious motives.

[01:56:53.030 --> 01:57:00.150]
A true pro-life position cares just as passionately for the born as the unborn and views war as a last resort when all other options are exhausted.

[01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:05.530]
Christians should look for candidates that will work for issues that are of importance to Christ and that can be tackled legislatively.

[01:57:05.970 --> 01:57:11.030]
Sadly, most of those causes have historically been opposed ignored and minimized by conservative Republican policymakers.

[01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:14.070]
They seem to dangle the moral issues carried around election time.

[01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:20.710]
Then, even with the Republican-controlled White House in Congress, prove themselves powerless to do anything about those issues when they convened to legislate.

[01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:30.910]
Issues such as eliminating poverty at homelessness in America, true equal rights for all citizens, environmental protection, a fair minimum wage, affordable healthcare, lowering our infant mortality rate, all go into ten to just a name of few.

[01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:40.090]
I have some questions for the Christian right. Why even not held our current elected majority officials accountable for their failure to address the full spectrum of Christian issues? Why would you vote for them again?

[01:57:40.090 --> 01:57:50.550]
It's time for Christians of conscience to stand up to religious and political hypocrisy. Christians should proudly proclaim progressive values today and should advocate for the Christian liberalism that is our heritage and our legacy.

[01:57:51.570 --> 01:57:52.910]
And... oh my God, a hurry.

[01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:55.090]
Michael Mayo finally wrote a good call.

[01:57:55.330 --> 01:57:56.930]
It happens about once every how many years?

[01:57:57.030 --> 01:58:03.010]
About two or three times a year. Mike writes something because he's basically a sports guy that they shovel off into the other thing here.

[01:58:03.010 --> 01:58:10.070]
But at the Sun Sentinel, Michael Mayo writes, yesterday's Sun Sentinel, election 2004, blunders and wonders and outsies.

[01:58:10.630 --> 01:58:13.010]
Can you handle it? I can handle it.

[01:58:13.410 --> 01:58:20.710]
Amazing. He says, Brenda Snipes and her crew at the elections office have a whole year to get this 2004 presidential election right and they blow it right on the starting gate.

[01:58:21.170 --> 01:58:26.830]
So now we have problems again. If there are two phrases you want nowhere near each other, it's election problems in Broward County.

[01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:34.550]
By this point, after all we've been through after the 2000-Dubacle and Miriam Elephants reign of error, we were supposed to have solutions. Instead we have problems still.

[01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:41.710]
Nobody wants to use excuses and now we have to wonder with 15 days more of voting to go, how many more problems explanations will there be?

[01:58:42.330 --> 01:58:46.670]
Last week, with the first wave of absentee ballots, the problem was contradictory postage information.

[01:58:47.130 --> 01:58:50.770]
On Monday, opening day of early voting at 14 Broward sites, it was a computer glitch.

[01:58:50.770 --> 01:59:00.890]
Small consolation at the glitch wasn't with the distrusted electronic machines. This involved the computer system that was supposed to transmit voter information between the election department nerve center and early voting sites.

[01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:06.750]
So on the first day of early voting, the first images of people waiting and not voting. That should fill everyone with confidence.

[01:59:07.170 --> 01:59:13.510]
We were all disgusted, said Claire Stucker of Lottardale Lakes. Stucker 81 went to a library in Tamaract to vote for Gave Up After an Hour.

[01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:26.750]
You would think they would test everything beforehand to make sure it worked, Stucker said. At least work consistent, whether it's election systems or election supervisors or elections validating Broward's motto is, if at first you don't succeed, try try again. Stucker will try again today.

[01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:38.150]
Preeded to a very loud blast of the song, Learned or Fly by the Food Fighters, a rock group whose frontman despises Bush. A lyrical excerpt which I swear I'm not making up, hooked me up a new revolution because this one is a lie.

[01:59:38.150 --> 01:59:45.230]
You are listening to me, you ruggers. Exclusively on 560 in AM.

[01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:57.570]
I don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. That's kind of one of those exaggerations. Of course I'm worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden.

[01:59:57.690 --> 02:00:07.350]
We're using every asset at a disposal to get Osama bin Laden. I don't know where he is. I just don't spend on this time on it. I don't know where he is.

[02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:12.130]
I repeat what I said. I truly am not that concerned about him.

[02:00:15.090 --> 02:00:23.930]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to dominant people killed with the gas that we sold him.

[02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:36.910]
The first time a crescer nation and the only one that's going now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing. Forget about Korea and the notes they're talking about.

[02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:50.050]
The right wing is drilling it over and over into our head. That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:01:00.850 --> 02:01:11.570]
3,000 people killed are now forgotten. Let's exploit them instead. Hey, there's oil to be gotten going after Saddam too.

[02:01:11.570 --> 02:01:37.110]
Plankato, Osama, there's no longer mention of the name bin Laden but no one seems concerned of. Come be and complacent to leave an every word of this cartel administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right wing is drilling it over and over into our head.

[02:01:37.110 --> 02:01:43.410]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:01:53.910 --> 02:02:02.230]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying. We're all suspects now. Not the ash broth is saying.

[02:02:02.230 --> 02:02:10.590]
I have nothing to hide. Table talkers all are saying. I know, PD and cattle don't have any reservations.

[02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:37.430]
The right wing is drilling it over and over into our head. I have nothing to hide.

[02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:44.410]
Only I've racked myself when the mass destruction.

[02:02:50.190 --> 02:02:59.470]
Good morning. Our nation is proud of all our workers. So I will double the number of people that have lost manufacturing textile and other jobs.

[02:02:59.470 --> 02:03:09.850]
We must protect workers and small business owners from the family friendly, fairer, pro-growth system and increased frillous lawsuits that threaten jobs across America.

[02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:23.450]
With all these proposals, we'll provide American workers with a complicated mess filled with special interest loopholes and saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperwork and headache every year.

[02:03:23.450 --> 02:03:37.470]
Thank you for listening.
