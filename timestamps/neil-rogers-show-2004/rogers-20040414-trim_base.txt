[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420]
My heavy Ford Lutter James.

[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.100]
Here we got our new TV here baby.

[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.520]
Oh!

[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.660]
There's George Tenon who said...

[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.780]
This is so complicated.

[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.020]
Uh...

[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.020]
That's talking to me.

[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.480]
Hello!

[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.380]
Hello!

[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.500]
Hello!

[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.820]
I love all the residents!

[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.920]
Oh, who is this the maid?

[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.280]
No, this is the wife, Talia!

[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.420]
Braaa!

[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.740]
I like to speak to Tommy Metolia.

[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.600]
Hello!

[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.940]
Tommy Motora Residence!

[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.900]
Braaa!

[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.900]
What's going on?

[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.440]
Girl?

[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.400]
No, no, Talia!

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.380]
Talia, let me talk to the devil.

[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.180]
Please hold!

[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.480]

[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.240]
Tommy!

[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.880]
Yes!

[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.780]
Braaa!

[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.160]
Tommy!

[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.240]
What is this?

[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.740]
You got the phone!

[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.560]
Oh!

[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.260]
Phone!

[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.600]
Hello!

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.900]
Tommy Metolia speaking!

[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.100]
This is Michael Jackson.

[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.420]
You lost your job!

[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.960]
You lost your job!

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.880]
Oh, come on!

[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.760]
Hey, I didn't lose my job!

[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.260]
I stepped down!

[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.740]
Oh, sure.

[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.480]
However you want to paint the picture,

[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.000]
whatever you have to tell yourself

[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.540]
in order to save some sort of face you'll do it,

[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.920]
but you will lost your job!

[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.540]
Oh!

[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.460]
You know, actually it's kind of nice to hear your voice.

[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.080]
What?

[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.260]
It's kind of nice to hear anybody's voice.

[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.820]
What are you talking about?

[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.480]
Michael Jackson!

[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.540]
Yeah, can you hear that?

[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.140]
That's my Mexican wife, let me tell you.

[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.720]
It was cute for maybe five, ten minutes a day,

[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.520]
but if I got to stay home with her,

[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.440]
every day I'm going to go crazy.

[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.040]
I know, I know.

[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.840]
You're getting your justi-zerts,

[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.420]
Tommy Metolia, that devil.

[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.120]
All we do is eat Mexican food,

[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.200]
Jimmy Chungas, burritos, tostitos.

[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.440]
I got more gas than exonc.

[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.400]
And you deserve to have the bloat.

[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.980]
Listen, Michael, I'll resurface somewhere.

[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.580]
I'll start another label.

[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.000]
Sure you will, so you can destroy the career

[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.940]
of other budding artists.

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.980]
Are we going to Chevy?

[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.680]
Yes, honey, we're going to Chevy.

[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.740]
Thank you very much, Charlie.

[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.680]
Oh, jeez, if it's not Chevy,

[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.900]
it's Cheez-Cheez, if it's not Cheez-Cheez,

[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.740]
it's what's that drive in place?

[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.520]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.260]
I called to beret you,

[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.460]
and all I'm getting is dribbles and Jimmy Changa.

[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.740]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.480]
Admit it, I was the reason you were forced to be fired.

[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.620]
Right, I know, because I'm very, very, very devilish.

[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.540]
Ah, ooh.

[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.360]
I was a living in America.

[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.060]
I was a living in America.

[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.320]
You're living in America.

[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.040]
All right.

[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.940]
Hey, look, Mikey, I got to go, OK?

[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.920]
I got to take over the Taco Bell.

[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.880]
Debbie!

[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.700]
OK.

[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.440]
Chez, you want to come with us?

[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.520]
No, I don't want to be seen with you.

[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.680]
You are the devil.

[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.420]
So at this point, I am finding myself having

[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.940]
some sympathy for you.

[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.140]

[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.720]
All right, all right.

[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.840]
All right, I got to go, Mikey.

[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.040]
Let me tell you something.

[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.700]
If I were to fart right now,

[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.440]
half the neighborhood would go up.

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.740]
Don't do it.

[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.460]
Yeah.

[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.840]
Don't fart, Tommy.

[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.980]
We'll lose our license, baby.

[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.600]
1003 at 560 WQM.

[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.400]
The reason I played that, we got a Taliya story today

[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.640]
and a Michael Jackson story.

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.920]
Oh!

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.680]
It's not to lie.

[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.680]
But we'll get to those eventually.

[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.180]
Here's the most important story of the day.

[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.060]
It's a letter to the editor in a herald.

[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.780]
Oh, should I give the death count first?

[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.360]
I think 83 US troops killed in Iraq and April.

[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.060]
Nobody cares.

[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.980]
For American forces in Iraq, these

[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.400]
are the deadliest days of the war.

[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.200]
At least 83 US troops have been killed

[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.320]
in action so far this month.

[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.460]
But the most recent death announced yesterday.

[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.060]
Also this month, more than 560

[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.880]
have been wounded and two soldiers declared missing.

[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.520]
At least four Americans of Indians were killed.

[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.480]
One contractor was captured by gunmen,

[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.040]
six others missing and feared abducted.

[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.460]
And now, President E. Lysen, I says,

[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.280]
oh, we're fine.

[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.680]
Right, that's basically what he said.

[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.220]
I didn't watch it.

[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.980]
I saw about two minutes.

[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.460]
That was enough.

[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.460]
I can't take it.

[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.200]
I can't stand it.

[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.160]
Can't watch it.

[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.760]
He just makes me gag.

[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.780]
The number wounded so far in April exceeds the total

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.020]
for any other full month of the war

[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.060]
by more than 220.

[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.340]
Should I read that sentence again?

[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.700]
The number wounded so far in April exceeds the total

[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.180]
for any other full month of the war.

[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.120]
It's only the 15th by 220.

[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.620]
But, El Presidente says, oh, we're fine.

[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.260]
It was worth it.

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.920]
Bad month.

[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.720]
It was worth it.

[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.560]
We're going to have good months and bad months.

[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.020]
I like that idea.

[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.260]
What I had, politics, religion, money, and golf.

[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.200]
And professional victims, like our mothers,

[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.020]
both our mothers, professional victims.

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.120]
Oh my God, I thought you would never leave.

[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.680]
Oh, it's just a crap, man.

[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.020]
I just, she drives me up the wall.

[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.320]
Oh, speaking of my mother and your mother,

[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.580]
here's the letter Judith Cohen in Evan Tura

[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.960]
writes to the Miami-Hirl this morning.

[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.760]
You'll love this.

[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.060]
Listen, the heading is wrong word choice.

[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.880]
Ray Leslie Abravenel's April 9 column, New Yorkers

[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.180]
have planned to bore you over.

[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.980]
I was extremely disappointed in the choice of words

[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.440]
to describe the people who may frequent the ivy restaurant

[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.280]
in Evan Tura.

[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.440]
Oi!

[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.500]
The term Yanta is derogatory and bigoted.

[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.880]
The Yentas who subscribe to the Herald

[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.900]
frequent the restaurants and support upscale merchants

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.400]
are the ones who make Miami a desirable place to visit.

[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.600]
Why choose to offend asks Judith.

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.360]
Let me answer your question, Judith.

[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.020]
Yanta?

[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.220]
See, Yentas not just an offensive word, it also is accurate.

[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.600]
And not only that, but first of all,

[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.240]
how many Yentas are there really in Miami?

[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.860]
Evan Tura ain't Miami, honey.

[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.260]
But if you're talking about South Florida,

[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.520]
the Yentas are one of the reasons

[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.600]
that this place is so disgusting and despicable and obnoxious.

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.260]
Just like the Yentas who were gathered at Pompa No Park

[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.680]
last Saturday in the lobby there,

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.740]
screaming and hollering for their free programs.

[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.180]
That's a Yenta, okay?

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.360]
That's a Kvech.

[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.680]
Oh no, that's my mother, a professional victim.

[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.520]
But at any rate, is this perfect?

[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.820]
Oh, me.

[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.780]
Why choose to offend?

[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.100]
In other words, the truth hurts Judith and Evan Tura,

[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.280]
okay, you can't handle it.

[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.040]
It's obnoxious, it's disgusting.

[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.480]
The behavior is subhuman.

[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.000]
I wish I had her problem.

[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.860]
Don't be a Yenta, okay?

[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.520]
Oi!

[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.200]
Quit being like Cohen the barbarian times this show on.

[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.340]
Okay, here's the poor result from yesterday.

[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.280]
Well, before that, Patsy Kenzit, I have no idea who she is.

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.960]
But she's behind the beaten curtain.

[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.480]
If you're over the age of 65, if you're not a Yenta,

[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.060]
if you got 55 pieces of ID,

[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.420]
if you got 45 grand parents who will vouch for you

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.120]
and you never stole a free train, all of these things,

[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.760]
then you can take a little quick peek.

[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.960]
Keep your hands above the counter at all times

[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.900]
because John S. Cross's eyes aren't following you.

[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.700]
Oh, he said Clinton did it.

[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.000]
He did.

[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.580]
And then when they didn't believe that, he said the dog did it,

[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.160]
but he's dead so we can't testify.

[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.340]
He flew the plane in.

[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.620]
Buddy, buddy done it.

[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.840]
Maybe that's why the Lord's smoke, he was smitten by the Lord.

[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.700]
Don't forget he is risen, by the way.

[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.480]
The Lord is risen.

[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.380]
And just like a bad sponge cake,

[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.840]
he just fell right in again.

[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.440]
Yeah, he keeps falling down.

[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.600]
Somebody must have slammed the other.

[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.740]
He's kind of like Fatboy, he tries to rise in him

[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.220]
or he just keeps falling down until he gets that nice cane he's got.

[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.540]
Whoa, what a tub.

[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.240]
Patsy Kenzit.

[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.180]
I mean, I'm fat, but I just, what did I call her patty?

[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.360]
So patty, patty.

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.780]
I was thinking of Fatboy, why would I want to say patty?

[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.720]
Patty Kenzit is our lovely, whatever she is, naked naked.

[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.560]
Oh, no, don't let John S. Cross find out about it.

[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.300]
You have to be over the age of 75 to see it.

[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.200]
So don't worry about it, John.

[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.540]
She was born March 4th, 1968.

[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.460]
Howanslow, London, England in the UK,

[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.760]
which makes her 36, if my math is correct it is.

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.580]
Here's some of the films she was in.

[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.200]
Who's you daddy?

[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.160]
Shelter Island, celebrity naked ambition.

[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.400]
That was a TV made for TV.

[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.700]
Darkness falling, one and only, bad karma.

[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.460]
That's perfect for this town, bad karma.

[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.960]
Don't be a Yenta.

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.960]
Love's music loves to dance.

[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.280]
That was a made for TV movie, things behind the sun.

[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.680]
Aladdin, best, worst, the pavilion.

[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.100]
Janice Beard, 45 words per minute.

[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.580]
I don't know what that is.

[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.740]
It sounds a little strange to me.

[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.740]
Made for TV, a human bomb.

[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.940]
Oh, she's been in like, oh, brother,

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.580]
Zinn and lethal weapon too.

[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.840]
They're skipper.

[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.480]
Chicago Joe and his showgirl.

[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.040]
Does this mean we're married, Blue Turnado?

[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.420]
Blame it on a bell boy, full eclipse.

[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.080]
Bowie the video collection.

[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.760]
Bit or harvest, fall from grace.

[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.060]
Turn of the screw.

[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.080]
A turn of the, can't say that.

[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.880]
No, Moe.

[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.520]
Am I right?

[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.160]
Absolutely.

[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.420]
I am listening.

[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.020]
I'm this bonding with my close personal buddy this morning.

[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.460]
The a moment, and if I count my play my cards right,

[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.000]
I can miss him next two mornings as well.

[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.240]
Because the last thing I want to see early in the morning

[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.920]
is him.

[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.500]
Absolutely.

[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.520]
God, what a thought.

[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:15.940]
So what do you think?

[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]
Glue or tape?

[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.120]
I'm thinking he's not a snappy guy.

[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.500]
So we don't have the snaps on the forehead

[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.780]
like those other people do on radio.

[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.960]
Now they have a snap on piece.

[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.920]
I'm thinking like Elmer's.

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.100]
Elmer's glue.

[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.500]
I'm thinking spirit gum.

[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.120]
Spirit gum will be interesting.

[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.000]
Maybe we can get somebody to spirit him away.

[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.560]
I know Greg would be happy to see that.

[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.340]
The Holy Spirit.

[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:34.920]
Right.

[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.700]
The Holy Spirit is the risen by the way.

[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.300]
1971 votes on the poies today.

[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.620]
Which of these people are things?

[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.620]
This is we're going to do this every day,

[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.360]
the same question with different categories.

[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.500]
Which of these people are things you care about least?

[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.680]
Almost 2,000 votes.

[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.200]
Not too bad, considering everybody's

[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.700]
bailed out of this Schmidt hole.

[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.940]
How come I can still say that?

[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.620]
It's not a word.

[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.100]
Well, there's a lot of things that aren't a word.

[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.160]
I mean, if heart's not a word, part sound.

[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.680]
But anyway, the Pope wins 387.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.420]
Silly old, shaky man, who's like only a breath away from death.

[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.300]
The Pope 387.

[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.260]
Rush Limbaugh, 334, who's only a breath away from another oxy.

[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.300]
Kate Moss, 320, who's only a very thin breath away

[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.880]
from a felt falling to the floor.

[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.740]
Mira, they might be he 265.

[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.200]
I'm delighted to see that, because the NBA is pure crap.

[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.960]
It's not as much crap as golf, because they're actually

[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.000]
some athleticism involved.

[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.160]
Not too much, because you got 12 foot guys, with slam

[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.660]
a jam in a 10 foot high basket.

[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.600]
Not too tough, you know.

[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.020]
Game-erage 216.

[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.600]
Al Franken, 182, he's just awful.

[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.360]
Ralph Nader, 148.

[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.320]
He's the anti-Christ.

[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.240]
Miley Dolphins, 94.

[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.620]
Because nobody down here unless you're a fan of the Patriots

[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.960]
like some of us who have got better taste.

[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.380]
Nobody don't love the fins.

[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520]
Miley Dolphins, 94.

[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.700]
And the war in Iraq, 25.

[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.720]
That's almost enough to we needed 40 to counterbalance

[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.800]
to a swap for the hostage.

[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.480]
So we'll start with the first 25.

[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.620]
Just line up at about 230 outside.

[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.240]
We'll just have the bus waiting for you.

[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.680]
But whatever you do, when you get there to bag that,

[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.800]
don't be a Yanta.

[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.540]
I don't think it'd probably be good

[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.960]
I'd do to be a Yanta and bag that.

[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.820]
No, no.

[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.780]
In fact, I would change the head gear,

[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.500]
is what I would do.

[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.480]
Sure.

[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.120]
The more I see these stories,

[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.480]
you see the story about the little girl

[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.600]
that was being picked on.

[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.260]
I, yeah.

[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.420]
That was in Boyton Beach, I believe,

[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.360]
at some school up there.

[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.580]
And she had the, what do they call that?

[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.040]
Not the burka, but they have the,

[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.080]
what do they call her head gear?

[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:33.520]
Smatha.

[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.120]
Well, yeah.

[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.940]
It has a real name, I don't know what it is.

[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.300]
I know.

[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.900]
And I'm thinking of myself,

[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.160]
the whole world is,

[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.980]
I keep making a joke about that,

[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.300]
but really that's what it boils down to.

[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.340]
It's a battle of head gear.

[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.380]
My head gear's better than your head gear, you know.

[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.220]
And that's what it is.

[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.380]
I got the Yarmulkin,

[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.700]
no, I got the Pope with that beanie.

[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.180]
I got the, the,

[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.060]
the burka, the,

[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.460]
a Jerka, whatever whatever I got.

[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:53.840]
Right.

[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.460]
It's a battle of who's got that gear.

[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.120]
And of course,

[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.860]
we got the women behind the whole thing.

[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.320]
You certainly don't want to see those women.

[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.620]
I believe me.

[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.220]
Some of you don't,

[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.740]
you know,

[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.080]
no, no, trust me.

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.180]
The ones I'm telling you,

[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.080]
you don't want to see them either.

[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.100]
I don't want to see their feet anymore.

[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.760]
No chance.

[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.680]
You don't want to see nothing.

[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.540]
In fact, I'm not sure they got what you are interested

[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:10.980]
in the scene.

[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:12.960]
Five, six, seven.

[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.180]
Okay, here's the poll for today.

[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.260]
Which of these people are things you care about least?

[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.280]
Least?

[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.480]
Nazcar.

[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.860]
Thanks to our friend in South Carolina

[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.480]
who facts and that suggestion yesterday

[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.420]
and we got today.

[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.680]
Which of the, in fact,

[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.240]
you might see,

[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.720]
you make suggestions for tomorrow.

[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.220]
On the facts machine,

[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:27.820]
not on the phone.

[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.860]
We want important calls today about headgear and golf.

[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.500]
Which of these people are things you care about least?

[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.780]
Nazcar, horse racing,

[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.560]
CNN, Fox News,

[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.040]
MSNBC, Israel,

[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:38.920]
Donald Trump,

[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:39.760]
sports talk,

[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.540]
Ronald Palmer.

[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:42.780]
See, and I,

[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.140]
that great.

[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:43.800]
They're like all,

[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.900]
well, not all disconnected

[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.760]
because you got the three talking head networks.

[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.400]
But just,

[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.640]
which of these people are things you care about least?

[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.360]
Nazcar,

[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.460]
horse racing,

Israel,

[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.040]
don't be a Yanta.

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.720]
Donald Trump, sports talk,

[00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.320]
Ronald Palmer,

[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.480]
by the way, happy Jiveauis.

[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.320]
12 minutes after 10 at 5,

[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.200]
60 WQM,

[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.560]
by the way,

[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.820]
speaking of a human sacrifice,

[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.340]
Todd Rex sounds like a really good idea.

[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.560]
In fact, I'll dance.

[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.220]
I will come in and dance when there's a big flag outside

[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.160]
it says he is fallen.

[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.540]
That's an inhuman sacrifice.

[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.240]
Oh, brother.

[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.020]
You can't complain about the job that Todd's doing for his clients

[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:16.920]
because quite frankly,

[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.860]
he ain't doing any.

[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.380]
I mean, not a bad job.

[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.720]
He just ain't doing any job.

[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.060]
Talk about a slacker.

[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.820]
If you look up the drum,

[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.500]
slacker in the Websters on a bridge to Miriam O'Boy,

[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.580]
whatever her name is dictionary,

[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.200]
there she is, Todd Dreck,

[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.700]
in full regalia.

[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.980]
Are you in a really bad dead end job?

[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.440]
Are you underpaid and overworked

[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.180]
like so many of the underlings here at QAM

[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.160]
who get treated like crap?

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.780]
Maybe you'd like to get out of that rut.

[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.140]
You'd like to have a little self-respect

[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.280]
in some cashier course.

[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.360]
Well, you just don't have the cash

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.240]
or the four years of time to waste on college.

[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.020]
If this sounds like your situation at the moment,

[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.680]
if you're in a bad, bad rut,

[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.180]
and you'd like to hop out,

[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.180]

computer network professional career.

[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.480]
And the best part of the deal is,

[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.540]
they can do it by the end of the summer

[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.960]
just for short months.

[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.840]
1-866, fast train.

[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.600]
Don't forget to mention Todd Dreck told me to call.

[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.940]
What a life they could be called.

[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.680]
We're supporting you 5-6-8.

[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.820]
You way, yeah.

[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.020]
Nobody should talk to me on that way.

[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.660]
How are you talking to me that way?

[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.040]
I work here.

[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.220]
I didn't come here to be mistreated.

[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.000]
That's what I came in to work today.

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.840]
That's why I come in.

[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.340]
I'll let you know.

[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.600]
That's why I came in here.

[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.520]
I thought I don't want to go to lunch.

[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.360]
I don't want to go to lunch, George.

[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.760]
Where does he get off, talk that way to a working man?

[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.700]
Well, you take it outside.

[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.860]
We have people trying to do business.

[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.320]
That's what I came in here for.

[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.480]
That's what I'm trying to do.

[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.280]
I mean, I mean, just stop what I think.

[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.900]
I mean, just stop what I think.

[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.620]
That's not right.

[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.440]
Come on.

[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.220]
As long as I need you to get out of here.

[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:22.560]
I'm going to be a good guy.

[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.560]

[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.020]
Will you get out of here?

[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.560]
Will you?

[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.580]
I'm trying to run an office here.

[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.840]
Now, will you go to lunch?

[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.700]
Go to lunch.

[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.480]
Will you go to lunch?

[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.860]
Wouldn't you really rather have a few days?

[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.600]
A few days, fifty-nine, few weeks?

[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.400]
Now, for games of fifty-nine, few weeks?

[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.620]
A car with doubles as a bar.

[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.820]
I, as I really would, rather have a Cuban duet.

[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.140]
With all new Cuban engineering that converts a boat of a car,

[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.400]
into a boat, a ride on shore, luxuriously,

[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.880]
in a real juvenile canoe,

[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.680]
with tail fins high enough to sell you across the lanes

[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.820]
and into the sea as if it flows.

[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.380]
Wouldn't you really rather have a Cuban?

[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.260]
A Cuban, fifty-nine, few weeks?

[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.140]
Okay, but now for games of fifty-nine, few weeks?

[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.380]
A car that always was a bar.

[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.940]
It's 1017 at 560.

[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.720]
Hour from Broca.

[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.540]
WQAM.

[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.540]
Anyway, here's the facts I can't figure it out.

[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.200]
Marcelo and Pemberk Pines, who kisses my ass, which is fine.

[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.560]
I really love and enjoy your show.

[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.980]
I never communicate with radio programs,

[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.140]
but yours is the exception,

[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.760]
because it's the only sign left in our airway

[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.980]
that there's still hope for us in this crazy town and country.

[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.360]
I have this historical, puritanical junction.

[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.640]
You see that sign when I was coming in off the turnpike,

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:38.760]
right?

[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.200]
It makes sense.

[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:39.820]
Yeah.

[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.700]
If I may respectfully suggest an idea for a pole,

[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.560]
which I'm always wide open for poles.

[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.760]
One of the things that...

[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.040]
I can't make this out.

[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.480]
It's got to get some ink, man.

[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.760]
Get some ink, Marcelo.

[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.960]
That struck me as unbelievable when I moved to Miami.

[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.180]
It was the fact that almost anybody can get their own street name.

[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.320]
Any other city, the world streets,

[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.540]
are named after national heroes,

[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.960]
world-renowned artists, philosophers, other intervals,

[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.580]
like presidents, for example.

[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.300]
And how many would they do have all those presidents' names?

[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.040]
Here in Miami, however, we have Jose Conceco Street,

[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.760]
Emerson Fidipaldi Street, Jorge Mascanosa Boulevard,

[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.320]
Christina Sarraeglegi, I don't know who that is.

[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:18.920]
See a pattern?

[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.400]
The criteria here is different.

[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:20.860]
Right.

[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.320]
As long as it's a spik-less name, then it's okay.

[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.620]
It has to be a Cuban.

[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.240]
Alex Picania.

[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.400]
Alex Picania.

[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.720]
Ronald Reagan.

[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.520]
Ronald Reagan Turnpike.

[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.040]
He'd be a Cuban or a white thing.

[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:32.580]
That's a statement.

[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.400]
No, no, no, no.

[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.800]
There's a Ronald Reagan avenue.

[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.520]
Alex Pincas Picania.

[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.720]
You notice I say, and George yesterday really hit the jackpot.

[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.660]
He didn't realize how big he hit the jackpot.

[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:04.160]
He said, I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:04.680]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:04.680]

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.300]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:05.500]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.140]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:06.800]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:06.940]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:07.900]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.860]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.140]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:11.640]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.360]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.360]

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.360]

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.360]

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.360]

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.360]

[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.480]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.100]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.100]

[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.640]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:28.640]

[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.220]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:29.620]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:30.580]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.040]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.840]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.220]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.340]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:35.940]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.080]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:39.800]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.140]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:58.560]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:58.800]
I'm not going to say anything.

[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:58.800]

the most obnoxious, the most disgusting,

[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.720]
the most unacceptable,

[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.540]
and I guarantee you that there isn't

[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.540]
anybody in this building,

[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.920]
anybody who wouldn't kiss the ground

[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.400]
if they could find some amazing way

[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.500]
just to make him disappear.

[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.300]
I'm listening.

[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:56.740]
I'm listening.

[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.780]
Just to make him go to the list.

[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.240]
Just to find a bucket of money.

[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:00.780]
Oh, look at this.

[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.700]
Here's the money to pay off.

[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.960]
Oh, how are you, David?

[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:03.320]
Bye.

[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.120]
Have a great life.

[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:05.960]
You know that.

[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:06.500]
Yeah, I do.

[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.040]
I'm going to do this.

[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.540]
Which is why Greg keeps feeding

[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.820]
very Jackson all those lines about,

[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.080]
well, if we could just find a way to

[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.120]
put Howard Stern in a morning.

[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.640]
And of course, every time Moa here is

[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.940]
that he's like probably hyperventilating.

[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:16.640]
Right.

[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.380]
It's like, if I can best he's having

[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.380]
don't I have a heart attack?

[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.840]
I mean, how could you put Howard Stern on there?

[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.400]
I'm working here.

[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:23.580]
Yeah.

[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.480]
And that's your only reason he doesn't.

[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.640]
Anyway, how did I get off on that tank?

[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.460]
See, that doesn't take me much to get

[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.680]
to going on him because he just,

[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.640]
he's just a creep.

[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.380]
He really is.

[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.380]
And my point being, Moa, you've just,

[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.540]
you've just done too many vicious,

[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.520]
nasty, hateful,

[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.660]
destructive things.

[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.520]
And most of them failed, by the way.

[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.660]
I mean, he did get Carolyn off at

[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:44.400]
that show, but of course,

[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.700]
she's got the inside in this place.

[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.200]
So she's over it down the hall of power.

[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.840]
He got beast off that show,

[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.760]
but he's got the inside of a clearance.

[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.220]
So you'll never see him dumping out here.

[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.540]
He got Zach off the show,

[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.860]
which means Zach can do his other job

[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.920]
and hang around with all the hookers,

[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.000]
strippers at night.

[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.580]
And, you know, I can sleep a little extra late.

[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.160]
So, and I will say this, you know,

[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:04.900]
what's his name?

[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:05.540]
Shy.

[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:06.520]
Shy.

[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.540]
He's a new producer that he had brought down

[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.920]
from his pyzons up in New York.

[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.260]
He seems like a pretty good guy.

[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.200]
He was sitting in a bullpen there this morning.

[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.300]
And I thought, and I met him yesterday.

[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:14.980]
And I thought to myself,

[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.800]
how does a guy who's like, seems like normal?

[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.380]
I mean, I could understand, like Scott Jr.,

[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.500]
or one of those people, like, you know,

[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.320]
with the eye of the sky.

[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.840]
But how can this guy possibly,

[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.220]
it's just going to be a matter of time, isn't it?

[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:28.300]
Yes.

[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:29.860]
And?

[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:30.420]
Yes.

[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:31.460]
Or that.

[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.300]
It's already happening?

[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.880]
No, nothing like that, necessarily.

[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.740]
If something were to happen, we wouldn't know about it,

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.860]
because Shy ain't the kind of guy.

[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.300]
He's a little guy that would let it fly.

[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.140]
He's a little gun shy.

[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:41.880]
Right.

[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.080]
He'll keep it to himself.

[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:44.460]
Yeah.

[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:44.980]
He'll keep the job.

[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.680]
I can't tell if he starts festering.

[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.860]
He'll start boiling over.

[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.720]
Till it gets to the point.

[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.320]
The point.

[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.940]
Critical mass.

[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.420]
And then, of course, there's Geldie,

[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.560]
who, uh, Belly X behind the most back to me

[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.360]
and everybody else, but...

[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.240]
Well, maybe with a couple of drinks.

[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.100]
Let's take him up for a beer.

[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.100]
Who Geldie?

[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.740]
I hear Geldie's little shy, too.

[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.020]
And if you had a voice like that,

[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.040]
you probably would be as well.

[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:05.920]
Anyway, well, look at that.

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.380]
Polls got some votes on here already.

[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.140]
Which of these people are things you care about least?

[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:10.940]
The least?

[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.240]
NASCAR 38.

[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.720]
Jocostell would be upset about that.

[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.240]
Any updates on Jocostell?

[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:16.000]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:16.820]
No.

[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.580]
Hey, call me, Joe.

[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.980]
He hasn't heard a word from them.

[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.640]
And again, that was just, yes.

[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.060]
Just posturing for the public.

[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.420]
Just like this dog and pony show with these 9-11 hearings.

[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:25.720]
You know?

[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.520]
Like you said, it's for the families of the 9-11 victims

[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.500]
to pacify them.

[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.580]
But it's not going to accomplish anything.

[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.100]
They're going to find anything out there.

[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.860]
It's just the blame game.

[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.320]
That's all.

[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.920]
Well, you did this and bushed it,

[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.080]
that intended to this and the FBI are incompetent.

[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.260]
Well, that's, we all know that already.

[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:41.500]
Right.

[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.020]
You know?

[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.500]
So what are we going to do about it?

[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.400]
That's the obvious question.

[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.960]
What are we doing as opposed to having all of these geniuses

[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.180]
sitting there and showing us, pontificating how Bob Kerry knows this

[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.600]
and Richard Van Van Eastay knows that.

[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.860]
And Jim Thompson say, Bush, you know, Sikha Fant.

[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.680]
NASCAR 39, Donald Trump.

[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.860]
You know what I didn't say liquor because I can't say those things together anymore.

[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.720]
NASCAR 39, Donald Trump 25, Israel 18.

[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.760]
If you do go to Israel, don't be a Yenta.

[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.800]
Don't be a sitting target.

[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.500]
He's moving around.

[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:17.700]
Arnold Palmer 16, sports talk 10, horse racing 9, Fox News 6, MSNBC 2 and only 1 for CNN.

[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.340]
CNN's on right now.

[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.320]
We need 126 total votes so far in that poll.

[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:22.940]
It's important.

[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.300]
27 after 10 at 5, 60 WQA,

[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.080]
Pompadot Park Racing in Poker.

[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.740]
That's important feature only the only nighttime horse racing in town in the entire state, as a matter of fact.

[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.080]
Come out to Pompadot Park for a night of excitement watching Wager and Live Harness Racing or come play Poker.

[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:42.820]
And I guarantee you, anybody listening to me right now, if you come up to the Siford dining room, I guarantee you'll be the youngest person there.

[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.120]
Coming this Saturday, April 24th, Pompadot, what?

[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.280]
I don't even know who I'm talking to, but in a way, who it is, they'll be one of the youngest people in the club.

[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:58.500]
I had, but when you get to Pompadot Park, Dick Feinberg and Steve Olframi, you do not be a Yenta or they'll hook you up with Wally Hennessey.

[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.060]
Coming up Saturday, April 24th, now let's see, that's a week from this Saturday.

[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.360]
Pompadot Park will present National Recording Artist, Eddie Cornedius, who will perform his hits too late to turn back now and treat her like a lady.

[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.460]
Remember Cornedius brothers and sister Rose? Yes, that's him.

[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.860]
Plus, there'll be hot action magazine motorcycle show too.

[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.660]
And I can't wait till Gary Puckett and you and Gap Show up.

[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.600]
Located just a half mile, in fact, they're taking all the artists that Gull Street wouldn't take anymore.

[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.060]
Located just a half mile from both I-95 and the Turnpike, Pompadot Park is easy to get to.

[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.900]
And best of all, Pompadot Park features free admission and free general parking every day.

[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.980]
Now we're talking South Florida's language.

[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.580]
Live harness racing in the Polk Room is open every Monday, Wednesday, like the night Friday and Saturday.

[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.440]
Polkers starts from noon and goes on till midnight and live racing gets underway, nightly at 7.05 p.m.

[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:47.300]
And it's for a cymbal casting's concern. You can't beat it because Pompadot Park is open every day.

[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.200]
Seven days a night's a week with the best in harness, thoroughbred highlight action all across North America

[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.260]
for you to watch and plunge your guts out. Watch out for Ray McClean Jr.

[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.520]
Pompadot Park, a block south of Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline, Rotor-Don, McElroy,

for the current race schedule called 9.5.4 or watch out for Dave Wall.

[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.640]
He just turned 90. 972.2.2.000 or go on the web at Pompadot Park dot com.

[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.880]
Horsepower you can plunge on at Pompadot Park, post-time tonight, 7.05 in the P.M.

[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.300]
It's just between more 5.6.2 a.m.

[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:25.380]
Those annoying curbs, a Sikh trying to rip the world of Hindus, are a Christian wanting to eliminate abortionists.

[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.480]
There's only one place to shop for all your religious weaponry, religious weapon supply company.

[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.040]
ill-menored tacos for a semi-professional radio station,

[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.880]

[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.940]
Whatever happened to Jim Scholar,

[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.300]
that's our poll question of the day.

[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.000]
We never heard of him, he just disappeared,

[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.280]
right? Vanished off the face of the US palm less than ever.

[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.000]
Another radio-casually man just vanished,

[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.800]
just disappeared. No, the radio-casually

[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.300]
I sort of been Lee Fowler, he's still dead.

[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.120]
You never met Lee Fowler, did you?

[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.640]
No, never, never. Why you didn't say anything?

[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.300]
Oh, then now that's bad,

[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.540]
that's a terrible thing to say,

[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.620]
but it happens to be true.

[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:24.840]
What?

[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.260]
Walmart sells anti-smot DVD players,

[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.400]
and somebody just facts this in.

[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.480]
Thank you very much, by the way,

[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.580]
just facts a bunch of stuff in,

[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.180]
especially poll suggestions.

[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.040]
Walmart is selling the world's first DVD player

[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.020]
that can seamlessly skip over violence,

[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.200]
swearing, new to the other potentially offensive movie content,

[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.640]
the $79 unit features technology by ClearPlay,

[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.820]
and is manufactured by Thompson Inc. RCA brand.

[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.280]
This product comes in a wake of the Super Bowl halftime controversy,

[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.860]
as well as the FCC Firewing Clear Channel,

[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.240]
for a decent content of the day.

[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:14.880]
It's a lot of interest in sensitivity in the topic,

[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.740]
around the topic of potentially offensive media content.

[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.980]
It's called censorship.

[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.920]
Alive and well in America, okay?

[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.420]
Got a lot of soldiers are dead,

[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.420]
but censorship is alive and well in America.

[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.360]
When in doubt,

[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:27.980]
bleep it out.

[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:28.220]

[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:28.220]

[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:28.740]
Right?

[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:29.480]
Right.

[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.860]
You got a hole?

[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.640]
Well, don't be a golf bag.

[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.540]
Anyway, RCA's player is the latest in the development

[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.980]
of the legal battle between the Salt Lake City-based software company

[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.980]
in Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese,

[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.480]
and Steven Satterberg and other members of the director's guild

[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.020]
of America filed suit against ClearPlay.

[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.580]
September 2002, when the filtering product was available

[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.640]
as a computer program,

[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.920]
the legal proceedings are still underway in Colorado,

[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.140]
both sides waiting for a ruling.

[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.340]
The DGA for its part,

[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.180]
directors' guild of America,

[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.180]
stick into its guns.

[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.360]
ClearPlay's software edits movies to conform to ClearPlay's

[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.040]
vision of a movie,

[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.240]
instead of letting audiences see and judge for themselves,

[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.660]
what the writers wrote, what the actors really said,

[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.400]
what directors envisioned a DGA.

[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.600]
This is like a blockbuster all over again, you know?

[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.560]
Waterdown movies for simple ins with very, very weak minds,

[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.000]
like the religious nuts.

[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.100]
Isn't that interesting?

[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.320]
How the same people who are offended by everything

[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.560]
generally tend to be the religious nuts, very weak minds.

[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.680]
You know, they've been brainwashed,

[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.920]
and he has risen and he is falling,

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.240]
and he's working on these falling.

[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.220]
How do you know to be offended,

[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:31.760]
unless someone's watching.

[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.840]
I guess if he popped a vibrate, he might quit falling so much.

[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.980]
But at any rate, what?

[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.740]
How do you know to be offended?

[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:37.920]
Unless the preacher may know you.

[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.500]
He only knows you.

[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.960]
It's just like that Supreme Court just has said,

[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.260]
I don't can't define pornography,

[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.880]
but when I see it, I know it.

[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.980]
When I hear all the time.

[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:45.820]
I hear it.

[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.640]
For example, that's pornographic.

[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.360]
I'll tell you who else is really pornographic,

[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:49.840]
and I've seen.

[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.540]
Howard from Boca.

[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.140]
That's another one.

[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:52.660]
Believe me.

[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.800]
Make no mistake about it, right?

[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.360]
Absolutely.

[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]
Even he knows it.

[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.480]
I don't want to go through that song in the dance again.

[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.980]
Every time I come down here, it's the same thing.

[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.800]
There's a part of me that would,

[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.020]
I know you don't believe this.

[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:04.960]
I don't believe it.

[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.040]
I would like to like him.

[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.620]
Because you're a softie.

[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.360]
You're a nice...

[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.000]
No, no, no, that's not.

[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.340]
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.380]
I would like to like him because I still see that part of him.

[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.920]
I mean, he's got a great voice.

[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.080]
He's capable of being something that he just isn't.

[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.640]
He's obviously too early and going to change.

[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:22.740]
But he's capable.

[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.140]
Oh no.

[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:24.580]
There's...

[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.880]
The ingredients are in there somewhere.

[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000]
They're just like all jumbled up.

[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:27.500]
See what I'm saying?

[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.620]
He can't see that part of him because he's got it covered up.

[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.640]
Is that what it is?

[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:31.960]
Well, he was pretty...

[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.140]
Look pretty snappy the other day.

[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.760]
All the one of the snaps was like kind of loose.

[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:36.460]
I think it's magnets.

[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.080]
Yeah, you got to snap both sides down.

[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.160]
Otherwise, it starts to flopping around a little bit.

[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.300]
You look kind of...

[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.460]
FAAAINING!

[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.300]
5,6,7,0,5,60,

[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.000]
Pound 5,60 on the 18.

[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.880]
See, it's good that we can't play those fart sounds

[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.040]
because we got so many useful things on the bottom line like...

[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.860]
Yeah, like that.

[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:51.460]
Yeah.

[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.800]
I mean, that's better than all the fart's put together.

[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.020]
Anybody agree with that?

[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.220]
In fact, when Gully fart, that's the sound of me.

[00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:58.920]
Oh, now I shouldn't have said that.

[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.200]
Oh, you just really find the sound.

[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.020]
See, not a golf hole I am.

[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.260]
Yeah.

[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.480]
When Gully cuts the cheese, it sounds like...

[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:06.860]
Like that.

[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.800]
So, a Michael Powell and Michael, uh, whatever cops and all you other

[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.200]
award cops up there at the FCC.

[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.040]
Guess what?

[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.180]
Gully just farted.

[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.400]
See?

[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:17.900]
Prove it.

[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:18.540]
Prove it.

[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:18.800]
Okay.

[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.620]
Take a sniff.

[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.520]
I don't smell nothin'.

[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.620]
Yeah, sniff this.

[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.880]
Which of these people or things do you care about least?

[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.060]
274 votes.

[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:30.520]
NASCAR's got 80.

[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.820]
What a pile of crap that is.

[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.540]
Good choice, folks.

[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.640]
Donald Trump 56 is in Q56.

[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.740]
Israel 35.

[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.120]
Don't be a Yenta.

[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:40.460]
Oh, boy.

[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.020]
Arnold Palmer's got...

[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.080]
So, Arnold, Mr. Palmer, what did you do all your life?

[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.060]
I played golf.

[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.140]
I keep thinking of that over and over and over again.

[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:55.020]
And of the golf holes in this industry who over the years have made these people celebrities.

[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.400]
No, I'd like to be able to.

[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.980]
How can you be a celebrity when you play golf?

[00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.400]
I don't care if you shoot a 53.

[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.140]
I mean, I don't care what it is.

[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.440]
What difference does it make?

[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.720]
You're still playing golf.

[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.560]
Wouldn't you like to be rich by playing golf?

[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.920]
Wouldn't you like to be a famous miniature golfer?

[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:09.920]
Yeah.

[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:10.360]
Yeah.

[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.660]
For a million.

[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:12.060]
Right.

[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.040]
And then Moe and Dallas sports holes on his station,

[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.320]
the golf holes can come on.

[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.260]
He's the greatest miniature golfer.

[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.120]
Did you see that shot on the 13th?

[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:20.340]
Wow.

[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.800]
That was on the 7th.

[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.640]
I don't think they have like 18 holes in miniature golfers like Neyne, I believe.

[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.460]
I like, you know, Airhockey and Fuseball.

[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.320]
That's proper group where how many holes there are in miniature golf.

[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.120]
Yeah. Thanks, Robert.

[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:30.200]
You like what?

[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.360]
Airhockey and Fuseball.

[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:32.680]
What'd it be?

[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.780]
It's called the Brawl and Hockey in the last night, by the way.

[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.320]
What a shame about the covalent of getting sliced in a hand.

[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.040]
They're running it with his own teammate in Boston.

[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.000]
Squirtin' and Golden and double overtime there.

[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:41.780]
Beatin' Montreal.

[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:42.500]
That was a shame.

[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.560]
Cause I'm like seeing Boston get eliminated.

[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.200]
Get him out of there.

[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.680]
And then how about those Nashville predators?

[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:48.420]
All right.

[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.820]
That's my new team.

[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.580]
I'm main man.

[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.340]
Well, at least in that conference anyway.

[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.120]
Shutting out Detroit 3-0.

[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.620]
They tied up the series to a piece.

[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.640]
Leafs and Ottawa tonight in Ottawa.

[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.340]
I sure George will be watching that.

[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.000]
Calgary Shutout Vancouver 4-Zit last night.

[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:03.700]
What was the other game?

[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.420]
And San Luis got beat by San Jose 4-3.

[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.980]
But I was really tense at the end, man.

[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.060]
Right down to the wire.

[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.120]
On your hockey intensives.

[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.920]
I heard mandates yesterday going on.

[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:13.680]
Hey, mad dog.

[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:14.160]
I love you.

[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:14.800]
You're a great guy.

[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.180]
But forget about the hockey talk.

[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:16.560]
Okay.

[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.940]
I mean, coming on to your and saying,

[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.660]
well, let's talk about something I know nothing about.

[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.400]
And then try to explain how nobody else cares about it anyway.

[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:23.680]
Just forget about it.

[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:24.040]
Right?

[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.640]
Forget about what?

[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.140]
Hockey.

[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.300]
You already have.

[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:27.520]
Yeah.

[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:28.540]
Unless it's air hockey.

[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.500]
He's going on about how he can't imagine that anybody could name even one NHL coach.

[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.580]
And he said, well, Scotty Bowman, I guess he ain't around no more.

[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.840]
How about Doug McLean?

[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.060]
Well, he ain't to coach no more Columbus.

[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.520]
And rightfully so.

[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.460]
But what can I say?

[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.260]
It's very sad.

[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:48.880]
And there's a big puff piece about the Panthers in the paper again here this morning about how they got 70%.

[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.020]
They're leading the league 70% of their season tickets from last year.

[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.360]
Every newd already for next season.

[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.040]
Of course, they're going to be in next season number one.

[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.580]
And number two, they only had seven or eight thousand season ticket orders.

[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.700]
And under eight thousand.

[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.120]
So 70% of eight thousand will be what, 56 hundred.

[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.520]
Last time I checked.

[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.180]
So in other words, just over 5,000 season tickets have been sold for next season.

[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.980]
Which they're going to be in next season very likely.

[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:10.720]
It's pretty unlikely.

[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.300]
So if anybody's got any money that they want to send over to the Panthers,

[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.180]
they'd like to hold on to it for a while.

[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:16.900]
What?

[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:17.800]
They'll keep it safe.

[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.620]
Or better yet, we'll keep it safe for you.

[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.500]
We'll see it on it.

[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.340]
We'll let Eddie Kay take some investment.

[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:23.180]
We'll let interest accrued.

[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.380]
We'll let Eddie Kay take it to Highly.

[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.100]
I'll take some to Pompato Park a few thousand.

[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.620]
And we'll quadruple it for you.

[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.300]
Or buy a big baby.

[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.360]
Maybe now we might have a bad run, but you never know.

[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.360]
WQA, hello.

[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:33.620]
Hi.

[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:37.340]
A little shriller today, Ron.

[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.620]
Not right off the bat.

[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.520]
Take a couple of pros at, lay down in the couch.

[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:41.900]
Okay?

[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.380]
Have somebody stick that thermometer in where the moon don't shine.

[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.280]
And then call us back later.

[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:45.560]
Not.

[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.240]
Don't ever call us again, Ron.

[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.100]
We're going to send the word police to your house to beat the living snot out of you.

[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.900]
They're going to hit you right in the forehead.

[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.060]
WQA, hello.

[00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:58.500]
QAM.

[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.420]
Yeah, how you doing, Uncle Mel?

[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.100]
Okay, sir.

[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.820]
I don't know if you noticed this story in the paper.

[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.180]
Yeah, they made me sick in the daily news in the daily news.

[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.420]
Nav owner of burned pups.

[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.120]
A New Jersey man was busted yesterday for sending two of his puppies on fire.

[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.140]
Oh, Jesus.

[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.980]
Ronald Fredrickson's charge of animal cruelty.

[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:24.160]
Fredrick's acknowledged placing WD 40 on the heads of two puppies and lighting them on fire.

[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.320]
How many, how many animals, wait a minute, how old is this guy?

[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:28.880]
Does it say?

[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.840]
Does it say how old he is?

[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.280]
No, it doesn't get an age.

[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.180]
This is an adult.

[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.760]
This is somebody over the age of three.

[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:39.720]
Yep.

[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:46.760]
When the SPF-CAA just in case of a right in Frederick's house, they found a 12-month-old black lap named Shadow,

[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:52.720]
which surveilled burn to the his, cowpened those, topping an 18-month-old mixed breed had left serious injuries.

[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:58.800]
Both dogs and now receiving medical treatment in Frederick's, because in Ocean County jail, $5,000 fell.

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.860]
I wish they would let him out.

[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.960]
In fact, what we ought to do is take all the dog lover.

[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.520]
All the people who don't pit bulls just to surround his home for a few weeks will form a hospital.

[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.600]
How could people be so sick?

[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:11.320]
I don't know.

[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.240]
People do something to people, okay, but animals will.

[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.740]
Well, are animals for children or women? How about that?

[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.060]
People are things who can't defend themselves, right?

[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.520]
It's a pretty sick world, Uncle.

[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.500]
They can be left during the day.

[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.760]
Okay, have a great day of life, Pally.

[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.280]
Very uplifting, Kyle.

[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.740]
I mean, it's, you know, we need to know about those things.

[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.860]
We don't like hearing them, but we need to know about them.

[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.400]
Just like this door here, we need to know about it.

[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.080]
It's also depressing.

[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:38.160]
Preach tells lawmakers in Colorado not to emulate JFK.

[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.920]
See, one thing about you, people with a Catholic church, especially the people in the hierarchy,

[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.440]
mind your own damn business.

[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.260]
That's my whole suggestion.

[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.140]
Mind your own damn business.

[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.120]
Remember the Inquisition?

[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.020]
Yes, they didn't close that office.

[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.640]
A Roman Catholic priest in Colorado caused a stir on the house floor, the state house floor, too.

[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.240]
They, when he urged lawmakers to let religious faith guide their votes,

[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.420]
and be the antithesis of John Kennedy.

[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.920]
I can't imagine too many priests could say antithesis.

[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.700]
Well, not without this.

[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.200]
Right. While delivering the chamber's morning prayer,

[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.360]
the Reverend Bill Carmody said too many politicians have followed the example

[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.360]
of the nation's first Catholic president by pledging to separate their faith from politics.

[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.480]
Almighty God, please change and convert the hearts of all the representatives in this house,

[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.780]
he said, may they be the antithesis of John Kennedy, may they be women and men of God,

[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.660]
and may their faith influence in God every vote they make, he said.

[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.240]
How sick.

[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.160]
Representative Alice Madden, the Democrat took the floor, and denounced the prayer,

[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.320]
saying it was unfair attack on the Democratic president, meaning Kennedy.

[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.120]
In an interview, Madden said Kennedy had made his decision to separate his faith in his politics

[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.300]
in the midst of anti-Catholic bigotry.

[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.040]
Representative Bill Sinclair, I can't even say it.

[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.360]
Republican-defendant, brahminer, telling lawmakers the prayer was not an attack on Kennedy.

[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.020]
We're ridiculous.

[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.120]
In a telephone interview later, Carmody acknowledged that Kennedy faced opposition

[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.000]
because he was Catholic, but he should have stood up for his church's beliefs.

[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.200]
This figurative would have died eventually. We wouldn't have politicians who advocate their faith to be politicians

[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:01.900]
had Carmody.

[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.120]
A past of a church near Colorado Springs.

[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.240]
And of course this all ties into the churches.

[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.200]
John Kerry was okay in the Senate. He was in the Senate for how many years?

[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.360]
About 30, 100 years. And it was okay because he was just one of a hundred U.S. senators.

[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.500]
So the Catholic church just kept their mouth shut.

[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.960]
Even though his position is out of portion, all of these other issues were no different than that is right now.

[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.700]
But now that he's running for president, now all of a sudden the Pope says this,

[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:29.160]
and the Archbishop in Boston says that, and they shouldn't give him communion.

[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.000]
And let's take a, you know what they're going to do? They're going to give neco-wafers next time they said.

[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:33.920]
Around his neck?

[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.280]
Neco-wafers. That's probably what they would like to do.

[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.800]
1057 at 5, 560 QIM.

[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.120]
My life and love. This is 480560.

[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.940]
You ain't too way.

[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.920]
Got two sets of lips.

[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.960]
Every day's a new morning.

[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.540]
We have a yellow light.

[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:05.400]
Oh my god.

[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.280]
All I need.

[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.600]
They have something to hide.

[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.060]
I know they.

[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.820]
They do they have knives.

[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.840]
What's really handy?

[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.060]
Kind of.

[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.380]
It's from the youth.

[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.520]
Like a yellow light.

[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:21.520]
The signs.

[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.400]
The corporate be a liar.

[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:29.380]
And that's why we have a yellow light.

[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.860]
I got to explain.

[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.840]
And the name of what these lights do.

[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.640]
What these lights do.

[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.640]
Which is at his desk.

[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.500]
With a set of clothes.

[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.760]
And the noodles are food.

[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.720]
Food for you.

[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.600]
And day to night.

[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.360]
And one in ten years.

[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.460]
And a way.

[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.400]
Have a yellow light.

[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.100]
And a night.

[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.380]
Something they can survive.

[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.380]
We have a yellow light.

[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.340]
A big, big, big, big.

[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.400]
One in ten years.

[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.360]
One in ten years.

[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.400]
And a day.

[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.420]
Have a yellow light.

[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:12.280]
Something they can survive.

[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.620]
We have a yellow light.

[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.080]
A big, big, big, big.

[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.400]
One in ten years.

[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:22.420]
And a day.

[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.420]
Have a yellow light.

[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.440]
Something they can survive.

[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.880]
We have a yellow light.

[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.160]
A big, big, big.

[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.280]
Yeah, I love that one.

[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.080]
That's the expirated version there.

[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:38.500]
It just died.

[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.440]
I had the good one up in Toronto, but you don't have it.

[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:40.780]
Too bad.

[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.440]
1102 at 560 WQA.

[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.060]
Am I, you know, for here at any schlock?

[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:45.820]
We don't care, right?

[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:47.120]
Just toss it in there.

[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:47.760]
It's the schlock shop.

[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:48.180]
Right.

[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:53.020]
Don't forget politics, sports, religion, and money.

[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:53.880]
And golf.

[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:54.680]
And golf.

[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.380]
So here's the Michael Jackson story.

[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.000]
What we should probably take this one call.

[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.520]
WQA and hello.

[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.040]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:02.380]
Pretty good.

[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:03.560]
Hey, how's it going?

[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:09.680]
Listen, I wanted to call and just comment about Ask Cross comments yesterday.

[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:10.200]
Yeah.

[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.580]
I saw it and I could not believe that he...

[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:13.460]
He's all clean and spoiled, man.

[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.480]
He blames, he blames, completely.

[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.280]
And then he says, he doesn't have enough resources.

[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.000]
He said that they asked for all this money.

[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:20.820]
Did he get the money?

[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.000]
And that's why he failed.

[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:22.620]
Mm-hmm.

[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:23.060]
Amazing.

[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.460]
Just remember, John Ashcroft locked his senate...

[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.420]
...relection to a dead man.

[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.760]
So just keep that in mind, okay?

[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:29.840]
Oh, man, this guy...

[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.200]
And then...

[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.140]
I say cover his ass up with that cloth.

[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.760]
With that drop cloth he uses for the statues.

[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:34.960]
Cover his ass up.

[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.760]
I could not believe that he did it.

[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.320]
And then during yesterday's...

[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.600]
Why are you watching that crap, though?

[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.900]
I mean, what are you going to get with it?

[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.240]
Okay, it's just a dog and pony show.

[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.040]
It's just the right time.

[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:43.720]
You know, you're right.

[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.580]
I mean, it's the same thing.

[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.040]
Go watch some porn movies.

[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:46.940]
Do something constructive.

[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.660]
You know, all I can hope for is...

[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.800]
Go watch David this deer field while you're still in buy it.

[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.660]
Are you done?

[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:52.420]
Yeah.

[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:52.840]
Okay.

[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:53.560]
No, we're done.

[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.900]
You kept interrupting the man.

[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.000]
Well, because I'm trying to lighten it up a little bit,

[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.560]
he wants to make this into light bulb show.

[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.280]
I'm not going to do that.

[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.760]
I'm not going to do, you know...

[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.020]
It's just...

[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:05.940]
What's the point?

[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.600]
Every now and then I get, you know, sucked back into that old...

[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.960]
...with that stop FCC down.

[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.160]
We're not going to change the world.

[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:12.880]
It's a radio show.

[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.120]
We're trying to give you a fuck...

[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:14.740]
...a few laughs.

[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.400]
A few...

[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.320]
You know what I was going to say?

[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.060]
A few yaks came out as one way.

[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:21.060]
I just dumped myself in.

[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:21.600]
Wow.

[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.040]
Holy cow.

[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.800]
What's the contraction of a few yaks?

[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.700]
Don't say that, of course.

[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:27.640]
It's five times fast.

[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.040]
Why didn't really say that?

[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:29.520]
It was close.

[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.020]
It was close enough to make my finger move to that...

[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:33.680]
...but real quick.

[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.600]
Oh man.

[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:35.500]
Too close.

[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:35.860]
It's over.

[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:36.500]
Wow.

[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.720]
I think that was an active...

[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.600]
Yes, me.

[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.120]
What do you think?

[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:40.660]
Yeah.

[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.120]
Anyway.

[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.120]
What was I trying to say?

[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.120]
Oh yeah, I mean, don't...

[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.480]
I'm not going to get sucked into that.

[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:46.660]
I'm sorry, sir, but, you know,

[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.160]
if you're wasting your time watching that,

[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.120]
I could have liked you.

[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:49.960]
Now, here's George Tennant.

[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.480]
Well understood between us.

[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:52.840]
Good.

[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.520]
New Jackson abuse claims, bro.

[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.740]
And I don't want to get too nosy either.

[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.520]
We don't want that real New Yorkie guy calling.

[00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.620]
And how come you're so nosy?

[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.480]
You know, mind your own business.

[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.380]
Get your own show.

[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:08.120]
LA police are investigating new allegations of child abuse against pop icon Michael Jackson from the 80s.

[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.060]
According to a police statement,

[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.560]
one of the singers lawyers said yesterday he expected the stir would eventually be proved false.

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.740]
Well, what a surprise that is.

[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:21.100]
The one paragraph police statement said police were contacted by LA County District of Turtees office a month ago.

[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.740]
The victim alleges the act to replace the city of LA in the late 80s.

[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.620]
The department's juvenile division child protection section is currently investigating the allegations.

[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:37.000]
LAPD public information officer Jason Lee told CNN the department would release no further details about the investigation or the allegations.

[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.920]
Or the organization.

[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.440]
So there goes more Michael Jackson problems.

[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.480]
Is there any question, any doubt?

[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:44.740]
No.

[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:53.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line, which of these people or things do you care about?

[00:54:53.960 --> 00:55:02.280]
Least least 345 votes NASCAR 105 Donald Trump 72 Israel.

[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.780]
39 Arnold Palmer 35.

[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.020]
Oh God.

[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.060]
What a great American.

[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.020]
What a great blue nose golf hole area.

[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.000]
That is old cream.

[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.160]
He's in tears.

[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.120]
He's sobbing.

[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.420]
It's his last masters.

[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.400]
Seriously, you people in the media who have elevated these people to anything more important than a janitor.

[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.640]
In fact, the janitor released a good job.

[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.480]
He's the place clean.

[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.400]
And doesn't expect other people to follow him around and clean up his mess.

[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.360]
Like all these golf holes.

[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.820]
You've been ever been into a game like cards like pinnacle, magiang or anything like that.

[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.980]
Oh, very briefly.

[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.880]
It would be great to be able to just be a millionaire by playing my genre.

[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.580]
I think it would be good.

[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:44.040]
All these millionaires in hell and the other play my genre.

[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:46.700]
Look at the way she handled those tiles.

[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:50.800]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:51.640]
Piles of tiles.

[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:52.840]
Yeah, no, the piles, parlor.

[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.800]
Look at the way she handled her pile.

[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:54.340]
Oh, sorry.

[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:54.960]
I can't say that.

[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:55.180]
No.

[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.660]
Israel 39, Arnold Palmer 35.

[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.900]
He probably don't like Jews either.

[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:00.800]
He don't like anybody else.

[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.640]
Horse racing 32.

[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:04.980]
Fox, Jew, a news 28.

[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.120]
The Antichrist, the Fox news.

[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.920]
Sports Talk 27.

[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.420]
MSNBC 4.

[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.160]
Only four people, you know, care about it.

[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.420]
They just don't even know what it is.

[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:15.660]
Right?

[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:16.980]
What is what?

[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:17.680]
Exactly.

[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.260]
And CNN only 4.

[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:20.980]
Because everybody, nobody knows like CNN.

[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.260]
Even though it's certainly not news.

[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.620]
It's nothing but sugar coated propaganda.

[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.960]
Can we do commission a group?

[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:26.640]
Well, that's good.

[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.500]
It's a dog and pony showed all waste my time with it.

[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.340]
I don't want to hear Janet Reno said this.

[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.720]
And this one said that.

[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.540]
But it'd be better move out of where you don't care.

[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:37.780]
Right?

[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:38.260]
Right.

[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.840]
It's a little here.

[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:40.720]
No.

[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.660]
The people asking the question.

[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:42.380]
No, let's start.

[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.660]
I mean, it's so obvious.

[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.300]
So what a schlock government we got about how everybody's too busy bickering with each other.

[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.540]
They don't care about protecting the public.

[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.180]
They don't give a crap about your lives.

[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.180]
All this baloney about a politicians care about your lives.

[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.460]
If they cared about so much about your lives, how come the neocons aren't over there fighting the Iraqis?

[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.000]
Instead of sending all the kids over there.

[00:56:59.040 --> 00:56:59.400]
Shut up.

[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.120]
Or you're raised.

[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.860]
I'll be out of here soon.

[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.640]
Dominic QA, hello.

[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.260]
Not there.

[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:05.840]
I'm line one.

[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.540]
Line one has got a real problem.

[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.140]
And that one's the chigger in the wood pile.

[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:10.880]
WQA, hello.

[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:13.720]
WQA, hello.

[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.780]
I already had you around three hours this morning.

[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.560]
Mo cut the crap.

[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.640]
Hey, did you guys figure out the capital of Brazil yet?

[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.340]
Say, oh, Paulo.

[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.280]
It's Brazilian, my friend.

[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:24.700]
Oh, really?

[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:25.460]
Yeah.

[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:26.880]
Well, don't get me looked at about it now.

[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.620]
You don't have to get there.

[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.800]
Well, what's the capital of New York state?

[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:32.800]
Uh, yeah.

[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.120]
Right.

[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:33.600]
There you go.

[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:33.840]
See?

[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.800]
See, this is the problem in this town.

[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.800]
We got people running around in Northern Capital of Brazil,

[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.340]
which nobody gives a flying crap about.

[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.480]
But the capital of New York, Albany, man.

[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:42.280]
What are the tri cities?

[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.020]
Albany's connected to the Inutica?

[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:44.980]
I know that.

[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:45.440]
Yeah.

[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.440]
Because it's in North America.

[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:46.840]
Right.

[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.640]
Because it's in North-Aids, an American city, okay?

[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.880]
We're an American band, and it's an American city.

[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.000]
Got it?

[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:54.720]
Get it.

[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.260]
And quit worrying about all this spit crap, okay?

[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.220]
Enough with that stuff.

[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.680]
This town is just drowning in a sea of that garbage.

[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:03.800]
Drowning in it.

[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.700]
In a gigantic septic tank of professional spished up,

[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:09.380]
and I'll give you the best example I can.

[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.920]
That CMQFM garbage, which nobody has any idea what they'll

[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.300]
or plan.

[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.460]
I am Celia, who's in there, I am dead now.

[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:15.620]
Good.

[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.440]
I remember when I was alive.

[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.340]
We hate you, Celia.

[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.220]
I really, really, really, really, really, really.

[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.640]
I don't know, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.360]
I can't, right.

[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.000]
She couldn't sing her word of a paper sack,

[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.400]
although she was a snappy dresser.

[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.880]
Maybe she wore a snap-on.

[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.320]
I don't want to say snap-on.

[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.260]
What could we say that?

[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:32.420]
No, no, no.

[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:32.620]
Wait.

[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:36.180]
Nine minutes after 11, hey, you think you got a snap-on, Mo?

[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:36.640]
Absolutely.

[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.260]
He's got a snap-on, but it ain't a wig.

[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.840]
That's what Gildy said.

[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:44.540]

[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.200]
It's the only one mortgage from financial group.

The benefits are incredible.

[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.120]

[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:55.160]

Get that new low interest rate in just 1.25%.

[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.560]
If you have $100,000, loan your pages $334 a month.

[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.220]
If you have a $200,000 loan your pages $668 a month.

[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.020]
What's not to like?

[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.400]
And don't forget, once you get a, or obtain,

[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.960]
once you refinance, you get you no home mortgage from financial group,

[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.000]
you'll never, ever pay closing costs again.

[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.760]
So call them toll-free, 1-866395-Lend.

zero underwriting costs, closing costs,

[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.220]
and when you moved another property.

[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.740]
Get that new low rate or financing rate of just 1.25%

[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:36.100]
with the only one mortgage from financial group.

[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.360]
Here's that toll-free number.

[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.140]
One more time for those of you who are mighty slow.

[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:41.760]
1-866395-Lend.

[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.780]
That's 1-866395-LEND.

[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.780]
The Renequal Housing Lender, restrictions apply, rates,

[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.420]
subject to change monthly, 4.21 APR.

[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:54.560]
My and local, this is 4.205-60.

[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.700]
We're in way, yeah.

[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.700]
So I can tell you now, when the mortician lifted up my skirt,

[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.660]
he said, oh, li-ba-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.580]
He didn't do anything down.

[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.640]
I could not handle like a cow.

[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.360]
Like a cow.

[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.040]
Like a cow.

[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.540]
And another thing.

[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.760]
The animals and the me would have been a big star by now.

[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.880]
You, that little bitch, sweet voice.

[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.280]
How do you expect to get anywhere a little beauty-puked?

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.700]
If we see you.

[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.740]
And I think I'm sitting in the other house.

[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:21.960]
I don't know what this is.

[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.440]
I'm going to get 3500 right back.

[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.860]
I'm going to get a hot pot.

[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.960]
Good morning, dear you.

[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.320]
Yeah, what a pot.

[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.840]
Good morning, hey you.

[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.440]
What a white thing.

[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.820]
I'm when I see you.

[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.680]
I want a dime.

[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.400]
You're a pectorine.

[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.000]
No toenail cheese or roll.

[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.920]
It's me in a coma.

[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.560]
And going to my car.

[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:57.460]
Why are you, why you're a smack you?

[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:58.940]
That's me.

[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.580]
I know my smell attracts you.

[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.000]
I know.

[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.100]
But unlike that you.

[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.940]
You still got to jump.

[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.760]
I feel just like that you are.

[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.460]
My kid brother.

[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.080]
And when you need to another.

[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.060]
That's why you are still not buying.

[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.500]
Duh duh duh duh duh.

[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.880]
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.

[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:37.200]
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.

[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.440]
Duh duh duh duh duh duh.

[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.140]
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.

[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:46.200]
I want to show you.

[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.820]
And I can't.

[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.900]
Can't wait till it's over.

[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.360]
Not all right.

[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.980]
That's enough.

[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.020]
It's 11.15 at 5.60.

[01:01:59.240 --> 01:01:59.880]
Hour from Boca.

[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:00.500]
WDQ8.

[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.380]
Sir, here's the fact I'm Sean from McCrill Springs.

[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.140]
Not to be confused.

[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.440]
He says with Sean from Hollywood.

[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.920]
That sends us all those great poor ideas.

[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.320]
He says I think I have an idea to pass along to Bocabrion.

[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.080]
Last week when you were having the alarm problems at Toronto

[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.600]
and care playing the guilty scream over and over again.

[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.760]
Had me laughing so hard and have Bocabrion

[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.880]
do a car alarm parody,

[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.560]
which we already discussed that last week.

[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.320]
But that's okay Sean.

[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:21.840]
You're a little late.

[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:25.540]
The makers of the big black guy named Ben a car alarm.

[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.500]
Using guilty.

[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:28.840]
That's the car alarm.

[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.420]
Somebody already 75 suggestions already on that.

[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:31.880]
Thanks Sean.

[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.300]
Good idea.

[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.160]
I'm sure he's working on it right now.

[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.580]
And the a bit too.

[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.100]
Which of these people are things you care about least

[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.820]
where I'm asking today on the Arrangers.com.

[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.400]
That's our poll question of the week with a different nifty list of

[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.740]
unconnected crap every day.

[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.200]
There's nothing worse than unconnected crap.

[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:49.700]
NASCAR 120.

[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.720]
Donald Trump 82.

[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:54.100]
Israel 43.

[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.720]
And Quip Hill and that fence already will you?

[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:57.780]
No.

[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.600]
At least get an Arab contractor please.

[01:02:59.840 --> 01:02:59.900]
No.

[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.920]
Horse racing 42.

[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.380]
Arnold Palmer 40.

[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.100]
Oh Arnie.

[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.540]
Arnie what are we going to do without you and Augusta?

[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.220]
What are we going to do?

[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:09.720]
Sports talk 33.

[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.480]
Fox News 29.

[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.220]
MSNBC 4.

[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.500]
And CNN 4.

[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.180]
See in Canada they don't care about golf.

[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:17.340]
They only care about Mike Weir.

[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.700]
Because he's Canadian.

[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:19.480]
He's a golfer.

[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.980]
He's Canadian A.

[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:21.860]
He's weird.

[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.000]
You never heard of weird Mike Yankevick?

[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:24.420]
No.

[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.520]
Oh you see about how weird owls parents both died?

[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:27.220]
Yeah.

[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.620]
And at the car alarm.

[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:28.940]
Yeah.

[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.020]
And that's that poisoning.

[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.480]
They probably heard one of his records.

[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:33.280]
They probably heard one of those records.

[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:33.680]
Yeah.

[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.480]
It was just like what's his name?

[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.040]
Jason Williams dog suicide.

[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.240]
Oh and you think they're going to grab the charges on Jason Williams?

[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]
Did you see that?

[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:43.400]

[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.360]
They might say oh wow wow you know we know you kill them but they did this wrong.

[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.020]
They did that wrong.

[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.060]
So on a technicality return you loose and go back and start your career all over again.

[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.000]
And shoot somebody else.

[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:54.900]
Shoot some other people.

[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.060]
It's a man you talk about justice.

[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.800]
There ain't no justice in America.

[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.360]
That's why the smart people go see.

[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.580]
Don't call your own.

[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.060]
That's right.

[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.820]
He's the only one you're going to find justice.

[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.680]
Maybe Dave Justice but even what's your name?

[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:09.580]
You know dumped him.

[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.240]
Halley.

[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:18.240]
Let's see NASCAR 120 Donald Trump 82 Israel 43 horse racing 42 Arnold Palmer 40 sports talk 33.

[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.480]
33 that's eight.

[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.080]
What is it?

[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:26.740]
34 now 8.3% of this audience say they care least about sports talk and I say well that's a good idea.

[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:27.520]
I vote it for.

[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.900]
No I voted for what did I vote for?

[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:30.620]
I don't know.

[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.140]
I'm not.

[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:31.560]
Arnold Palmer.

[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.140]
I know I'm milled.

[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:39.300]
I'm the every day that I live I become more and more anti golf and the whole ambiance of this.

[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.660]
It's a sickness.

[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.360]
And yesterday now here's keep in mind.

[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.060]
Here's our good post personal buddy macho.

[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:46.300]
Jim.

[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.880]
I'm not going to mad though.

[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.720]
You just can't do that.

[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:49.040]
But.

[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:54.640]
I hear him waxing eloquent about what wonderful guys these are.

[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.680]
And unlike team sports where even if you play like you know.

[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:04.800]
I don't know what the point was in other words in golf if you if you don't play well you don't cash a check.

[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.400]
Well the same is true in tennis.

[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.100]
Right.

[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.540]
At least even you would admit that tennis tennis people are athletes.

[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.980]
That there's some athletic involvement in tennis.

[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:13.820]
You have to move up.

[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.160]
Try.

[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.060]
You have to move a little bit.

[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:15.620]
It's tough.

[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:22.960]
When you watch a great tennis match even I can be transfixed with that especially if like our good buddy is playing what's his name in the court of cova and the erotic.

[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.220]
Andy Cornicova.

[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.640]
But at any rate but I mean golf.

[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.780]
This is an athletic endeavor.

[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.140]
It's a game.

[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.340]
It's a silly ask.

[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.460]
Game on the weekend.

[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.580]
It's a blue nose is a well but they walked the course.

[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.420]
Well gee that's some real heavy duty athletic skill man.

[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.120]
Yeah.

[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.700]
You've got to have some real skill to do that to be able to walk that course.

[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.120]
When you go to Disney World you got to walk from one ride to the other.

[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.940]
Well how about let's put some Disney crap on here.

[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:51.420]
What do you say?

[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:51.880]
Sure.

[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.780]
In fact right after the show today I'll arrange it.

[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:56.620]
What they call it.

[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:59.320]
I'll make a good call to.

[01:05:59.340 --> 01:05:59.880]
I sure.

[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.180]
That's a good thing I did that right there.

[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.780]
409 on it and let's see MSNBC4 and CNN4.

[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.120]
Everybody's glued to CNN because they think it's really a news place which it's not.

[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.260]
Well there's a what's his name?

[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.300]
The plans may be long-range plans but.

[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.700]
Bob Franken not to be confused with Al Franken all they both have equally boring personalities.

[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.540]
What a shame about that Al Franken thing huh.

[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:29.820]
Oh well you knew it you call it if they had real broadcasts put it together put real broadcasters on here and Michael more even though he's not a real broadcaster.

[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:35.140]
There's a guy with a great enough sense of humor he's glib he's right outspoken he's a askicker he would have been great.

[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:39.900]
There is the guy to put on not Al Franken maybe put out Franken on with somebody who is a broadcaster.

[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:45.620]
Oh heaven is a guest once in a while just like those little red jocks that they have on it on this station in the morning.

[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:45.960]
Absolutely.

[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:50.140]
Oh man and what is this thing that I want to rejoins this must be a clear answer.

[01:06:50.140 --> 01:07:04.480]
I don't want to stir up into station too much but what is that in fact Miguel was in there with you and the three of us like be we're looking at each other was like eight nine fifty seven and Joe is playing at the closing theme which really is depressing by the way closing time.

[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:13.000]
And and then they got some like that on the rejoin they got some really lame ass so called comedy with that somebody in this place thinks is funny.

[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:19.380]
Oh my god what was that I don't know what I heard.

[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:26.040]
So there must be a clear answer to try to amuse up the station out of trying to make sports talk to butch it up a little bit make it really.

[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:26.300]

[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:27.820]
It's funny.

[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.260]
Yeah.

[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.880]
Right that's right now that Howard Spurman on the more anymore where you just have a few funny drop in.

[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.220]
Yeah.

[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.580]
Let's deal some of the old dropping in fact I mentioned a mother going to start playing every five or two minutes.

[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.980]
I think it will only bring more people to bring a lot of people to sports if they play a lot of those.

[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:54.720]
Now speaking of these dog and pony show hearings that we're talking about the head of the CIA George Tennant where you talk about a lightweight he's bad in the FBI people.

[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.420]
FBI people are being prison.

[01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:57.980]
Yeah.

[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:04.440]
I said let the mafia guys out let the put the FBI people in there the mafia people at least want to give us a good time or else.

[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:13.960]
So anyway George Tennant says a time what is it on that day nine eleven two thousand one this is written so poorly on the show.

[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:22.660]
You can see in his website they should be shot to it says the United States was in effect unprotected on nine eleven two thousand one you hear that in effect they were unprotected and.

[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:34.300]
I really appreciate when the director of the CIA makes this public announcement for the world here like Osama and all the al-Qaeda people I want to kill us and that the country needs five years to mount the clandestine service it needs five years.

[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:42.240]
So in other words basically held up a big sign over said it says all you terrorists out there if you want to come and get us you got five years to do it because we are unprotected.

[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.960]
We are as useless as as boobies on a pencil.

[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.840]
I couldn't use boobies on a pencil.

[01:08:48.940 --> 01:09:04.540]
I bet you could and I'll tell you where you can put them to it a little later five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a eight TNT you want boobies man just walk around just open up the door look out in the hall you'll see plenty of boobies trust me when I tell you in fact there's probably boob shambies out there no he's in Puerto Rico.

[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:12.960]

[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.740]

[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.760]

[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:17.920]

[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:17.920]

[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:17.920]

[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:18.840]
Thank you.

[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:18.840]

[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:18.860]
Thank you.

[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:19.480]

[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.360]
Thank you.

[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:44.020]
Thank you.

[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:44.020]

[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:44.020]

[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:44.020]

[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.320]
Thank you.

[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:45.340]
Thank you.

[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:45.660]
Thank you.

[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:46.680]
Thank you.

[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.120]
Thank you.

[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:47.320]

[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:47.320]

[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:47.940]
Thank you.

[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:47.980]
Thank you.

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:49.460]

[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.040]
Thank you.

[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.120]
Thank you.

[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:55.120]

[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:55.120]

[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:55.720]
Thank you.

[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.000]
Thank you.

[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.200]
Thank you.

[01:14:59.200 --> 01:14:59.260]
Thank you.

[01:14:59.260 --> 01:14:59.260]

[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.040]
Thank you.

[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:00.760]
Thank you.

[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:00.960]
Thank you.

[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:01.040]

[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.240]
Thank you.

[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:05.340]
Thank you.

[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.120]
Thank you.

[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:07.460]
Thank you.

[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:07.960]
Thank you.

[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:09.080]
Thank you.

[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:09.800]

[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:09.800]

[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:09.840]

[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:10.580]
Thank you.

[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:10.680]

[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:11.680]
Thank you.

[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.120]
Thank you.

[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.100]
Thank you.

[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:17.840]
Thank you.

[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:18.920]
Thank you.

[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.100]
Thank you.

[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:29.180]
And, dear audience.

[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:48.900]
The manual is to process a specific technique.

[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:48.900]

[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:48.900]

[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:48.900]

[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:48.900]

[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.040]
I'll help no new go-ho

[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.680]
And stop all of that Hawaiian air

[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:57.140]
From all the crazy hoolly hoes

[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:00.400]
Go back to Cuba with your pop ball

[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.080]
Where you can play in the mud

[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.920]
We'll pack the beans and then roll out us

[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.740]
Just go away, we're all fed up

[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.220]
And the young ones are less

[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:16.140]
Why don't you go home?

[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.020]
I have no life

[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.380]
No, no, no, no

[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.820]
Tell the young ones are less

[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:22.620]
Go home and leave us all alone

[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.920]
Maybe only see, I don't want to go back

[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.600]
I like shopping for three toys better

[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.320]
You've got your Pokemon t-shirt

[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.140]
And you're making us hear

[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.640]
You've had your fun, now start packing

[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.800]
So they can get you out of here

[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.420]
It's at the point where we can't stand it

[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.540]
Everybody's had enough

[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.920]
And I've all the hoolly hoes and cracker

[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.640]
Absolutely

[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.960]
Who could say that this far enough?

[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.400]
Hey hey hey, the young ones are less

[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.360]
Why don't you go home?

[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.680]
I have no life

[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:12.940]
No, no, no, no, no

[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:13.900]
Tell the young ones are less

[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.860]
Go home and leave us all alone

[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:20.840]
Maybe only see, look, they're giving away free SNH green cards

[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.800]
Can I have one?

[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.600]
Oh, that's the windows where they drive us like this

[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.220]
They've wanted a girl running public

[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.640]
They've wanted a truck too

[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.840]
Having some real problems there to legislate you

[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:37.220]
One of the problems they discovered

[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.680]
How do we trace these people and find out who they are?

[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.840]
The other problem is that nobody likes the idea

[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.020]
Right, on either side

[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:49.180]
But other than that, Jen Bush says he's a great idea way to pander

[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.100]
You don't know who he's pandering to but he's like been it over backward

[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:58.360]
Let's get the staff contortionist and chiropractor up there to tell Asi before it's too late

[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.840]
Before he twist himself into a pretzel

[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.980]
And the Bush family we know don't like no pretzels

[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.160]
Well, they do, they just pretzels don't like them

[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:10.000]
Man claims doctor operated on the wrong eye

[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.280]
Look at somebody just facts this in from the New York Times so it might be true

[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.180]
Suspected Taliban kill seven Afghans

[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.660]
People like it is not hounds

[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.600]
Oh yeah, and somebody jokes on the bottom here

[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.800]
I thought we liberated Afghanistan

[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.680]
Here's a good joke, it comes your show off

[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.560]
By the way, what kind of a station is the big...

[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.840]
Oh, what is he doing?

[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.560]
I mentioned that this morning everybody looks at me like

[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.520]
Well, what are you talking about?

[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.800]
He doesn't do the sports format they do

[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.060]
He's got his own format, his own station, his own gig

[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.980]
I don't know what goes on with him

[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:44.620]
He is just awful, he's a good guy but I mean on the air he's just horrible

[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.840]
I know the Humper just can't stand him on the air

[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.080]
Boy, he sure you got it right Hank, you got your thumb on it

[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:50.980]
He's brutal

[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.140]
And talk about somebody who takes it deathly seriously I mean

[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.280]
He talks about it with that like everything is so...

[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:58.700]
You know what I mean?

[01:18:59.120 --> 01:18:59.360]
No

[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.720]
Intense, intense like it means something these games

[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.980]
But then again he pays his own way to the NFL combine

[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.400]
So what does that tell you?

[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:08.660]
Is that farm equipment?

[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:09.320]
Yeah

[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:13.440]
You better watch he's gonna run that tractor right over your ass if you don't cut the crap

[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:16.440]
The big...

[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.520]
I remember CKLW, the big eight, we got the big eight instead

[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.920]
Yeah, popping somebody was jingles, okay

[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.020]
I wish I had that documentary

[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:26.660]
CKLW hit bomb

[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:31.800]
I taped it but I didn't save it from Canada History Channel about CKLW and Windsor to Troy

[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.040]
But...

[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.840]
My music CKLW

[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.840]
Boy, I tell you one thing if they still would have had that sound

[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.160]
They'd probably still be pumping out the hits on the big eight

[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.480]
And then of course the Canadian government to CRTC said

[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.720]
Well you got to have more Canadian content on there, eh?

[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.340]
Got a 50% Canadian music

[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.460]
Yeah but we can't play Ann Marie all day long

[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.360]
And Rush

[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.760]
Right, oh this is before Ryan

[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.620]
This is long before either Rush

[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:57.820]
The group for the Pillpock

[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:58.300]
Guess who

[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.160]
Right, guess who they could have played

[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.800]
Now this is also before the...

[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.460]
Well whatever

[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:03.900]
When was the guess who?

[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:04.900]
80s?

[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:05.660]
Guess who?

[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.160]
No, 60, late 60s

[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.960]
And 70s, 70s yes

[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.480]
Oh, they could have played the guess who you were right, well I'm sure they did

[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:13.620]
Anyway, this is pretty depressing

[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.720]
Here's a facts from Pete and Country Club of Miami, here's a reply got from Bill Nelson

[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.520]
Another form letter

[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.100]
Dear Mr.

[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.320]
Thank you for contacting me regarding Indecent Broadcast, I appreciate hearing from you and respect your views

[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.040]
Form letter

[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:35.640]
As you know recent media events have prompted a serious debate on what constitutes appropriate content on nation's TV and radio airwaves

[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:42.540]
Potential action by Congress and the FCC proposing harsher penalties to punish incidents of broadcast indecency

[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:47.060]
Is causing concerns that broadcasters rights to free speech may be impacted

[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:49.580]
What an other understatement senator of Bill

[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.640]
While I share the concern about broadcast indecency I believe we all have the right to express our views

[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:59.740]
After all the right to speak freely is a basic tenet is that a George tenet of our democracy? However

[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:12.320]
I believe that the FCC legislative bodies and media entities have the responsibility to ensure that an appropriate balance is made between the right to free speech and decent standards for broadcasting content over the publicly owned airwave

[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:19.380]
As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over the FCC I'll be participating in hearings on this subject

[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:23.980]
I'll continue to monitor the debate and the progression of related legislation and we'll keep your views in mind

[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:28.000]
Your communication is important and will enable me to serve you better in the Senate since silly Bill Nelson

[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:34.700]
Well that's not a bad response you know it's a form letter but not bad it's just crap, bland, generic

[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:37.980]
Yeah well what do you want it to be?

[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:38.760]
Stingy

[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:39.520]
It's a puzzle

[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.660]
Oh you're right

[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:41.620]
Tim and Vigor

[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.340]
Oh man you got a sense of humor or a word

[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:51.120]
So I'd be bombarding since he of course is an un-E Senate Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over the FCC

[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:56.260]
Over these word police Nazis that we got now who just keep making it up and expanding and expanding

[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.340]
See this is what a lot of you people don't understand

[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.400]
It started once upon a time which they had no business in doing it

[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.060]
In fact I got a great story here if I quit bablin I'll get to later on eventually

[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:10.780]
Oh yeah Bob Bachelors the FCC working hand in glove with the Republican Party, good story

[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:19.960]
But back in the FCC act of 1934 they were a regulatory agency to regulate the technical aspects of broadcasting period

[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:26.320]
There was nothing in the FCC act of Congress of 34 that gave them the authority to like start being the word police

[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:32.860]
Then a few radicals like Jesse Holmes, radical right wing lunatics and then this idiot out there in a Kansas Sam Brown back

[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:36.060]
And a few others they just keep egging them on and imploring them

[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:41.440]
Oh you got to pass more laws and pass more bills so that we can clamp down to get all this filth and disgusting crap off of here

[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.560]
So we can censor anybody we don't like

[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.620]
Which that's what it really is all about

[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.900]
And so they just they make it up as they go along

[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.180]
First it was George Carlson seven words

[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:55.440]
Then it was the thing with indecency sexual activity, expatory organizing

[01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:00.000]
Now we got a new list of words, now we got fart sounds, now we got this and we got that

[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.260]
And we got 80 million reasons why you can't entertain anybody or have a sense of humor or do anything anymore

[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:08.240]
So forget double entendre and double entendre and triple entendre

[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.720]
They really hate quadruple entendre

[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.500]
Man they get the English stuff so hard about that

[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.880]
Oh I heard a man dog say the P word yesterday P.I. word

[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.380]
Hey no hominins either

[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:21.040]
I don't want to be telling on my colleagues but what's good for the goose is good for the gander

[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:25.460]
I guess you missed it Claire it's okay because I was driving home and I heard him say something about P.I. or something

[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.760]
Well maybe we're starting about that movie pin maybe left the in-off

[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.020]
Or insurance

[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:31.680]
Yeah

[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.900]
Or maybe we're starting about P.I.P picking and peace insurance for nose pickers

[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.680]
What is this thing that somebody just affects me about oh

[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:45.820]
When you stop already okay we're not going to save the world from right wing lunacy on this radio show

[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.980]
Okay you're killing me with this ponderous stuff

[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.140]
Here's some already pressing stuff I just said it

[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:56.520]
Suspected Taliban fighters have executed seven Afghans including five government officials

[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.160]
In Southeast United Afghanistan or the Pakistan border residents and officials say

[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:06.740]
Gunman stopped the car carrying the seven in Bar Mal district of Pakhtika on Monday open fire they said yesterday today

[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.280]
A woman and child were killed along with five local officials

[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:13.700]
See we didn't take care of Afghanistan just like we didn't the other time and we lied a lot

[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:18.560]
And the Taliban are regrouping and they're killing people and yada yada all of these things

[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.600]
And if we could have taken the hundreds of billions that were going to spend in Iraq before we're done

[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:26.580]
And worried about finishing up an Afghanistan and he really eradicating the Taliban

[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:32.920]
And looking for the real evil doers like Osama and his crowd and Mullah Bala Omar then we might have been able to do something

[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:39.360]
As opposed to continuing to make excuse as well this one did this and it was all Bill Clinton did that then

[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.340]
But it's just a bunch of window dressing in the public says oh this is really riveting

[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:48.500]
This is really riveting and you hear what John Ashcroff said you hear what kind of leases said you know

[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.180]
I mean I put that stuff on her last week with the music in the background just to kill some good time work like a charm

[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:59.700]
Yeah, anybody good today? No, just George Tanya, which we already heard George said what's he gonna say now?

[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.460]
He said hey come and get us because we got five years before we'll be ready come and get us now

[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:09.640]
And that's basically what that amounts to what's that bit by our friend about the the Taliban you know

[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:15.160]
Listen to the latest troop movements on CNN you know, you know our friend did the Arab stuff

[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:17.880]
Bruce, yeah rock Bruce, yeah rock what's that one called?

[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.120]
Good question Taliban rock something like whatever it's called

[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:31.360]

See him. All right nice going. Jai lobster fest is back at the emerald coast if you've never been there

Start out with six different kinds of soups. You can have a couple of them or all of them if you're real pig

[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:01.380]

Love until doing at 560 WDQ and happy Wednesday too, you man. It's Humpty wouldn't be something if we tried to do that all one two hour with the comedy bits now

[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.400]
It could be about 115

[01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:19.180]
What do you mean by that like as soon as you have to dump one just fire it off another one

[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:19.700]
Oh

[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.340]
Just have a lot of them locked and loaded you know

[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:25.620]
I'm trying to think of when it starts out like real bad. Oh, I know

[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:27.900]
I know

[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:30.660]
I know because I think we have the unescribable. Yeah

[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.120]
Here's one right

[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.160]
That's it that's the end of that then we go do it another way

[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:43.420]
Okay

[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:47.920]
Until we can play one in one

[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.140]
Yeah, well I remember back in the day

[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:56.420]
We can play all of these back when we used to be a lot of fun

[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.320]
But we're just a grindin' them out now

[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.220]
We're just squeezing the cash out of this joint. That's all

[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.500]
So you didn't know that was the bonnicks?

[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:02.880]
No, I did not

[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.420]
Well, it's just making up new words all the time

[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.500]
No, but I want to hear white. I never heard any black person say that

[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.340]
I don't know that white people don't see you bonnicks or words and pick it all up

[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:12.740]
Because they want to be I don't know, they want to keep you up to date

[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.500]
In this day

[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.660]
Yeah, because this is a new one

[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.220]
Because you know how I was supposed to back in the day

[01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:18.280]
Because you were confused when I said

[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.600]
I think you're wrong

[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.240]
I don't think black folks say a back in the day I'm trust me

[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.160]
Huh? Trust me

[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:23.620]
Really?

[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.240]
It's back in the day

[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.660]
It's in rap songs that it's rap talk

[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:27.520]
Oh, it's rap talk

[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.360]
Like old school

[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:29.520]
It's not going to happen, it's going to be a dog

[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.220]
I rap

[01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:32.460]
So you know, gaming is something something something something something you know

[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.880]
You took that the wrong way

[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:34.580]
I'm the old dog

[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.220]
We got the mad dog, little dog, the big dog

[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:37.080]
I'm the old dog

[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.060]
So, uh, then we got the how dog

[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.460]
It's like somebody asked you if you're thirsty

[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.280]
Yeah

[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.760]
You're not, you say I'm straight

[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:46.800]
No I don't say that

[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.220]
Well no, but that's, what is said now

[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:50.120]
By whom?

[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.260]
Why people say that?

[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.100]
The youngsters, the people who

[01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.040]
People who pull the young punk

[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.080]
They want to be like uh

[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.640]
I'm radical man, I'm hip, I'm cool, I'm rap rap rap

[01:32:58.640 --> 01:32:59.560]
I don't know how it goes

[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.620]
It don't pop like you did when you were young anymore either

[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:02.760]
That's what you think

[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:03.860]
Let's cut a rug, daddy-o

[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:10.600]
Oh, anybody that says cool, of course, cool never disappeared.

[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:11.180]
That's a problem.

[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:12.260]
Cool is timeless.

[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:15.840]
And of course, there are some people who everything no matter what you say, hey, it's raining

[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.200]
out there.

[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:16.480]
Cool.

[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.140]
Somebody just got killed on 441.

[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:19.540]
Cool.

[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.820]
No matter what, they just drop bombs at home.

[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:22.360]
That's cool.

[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.240]
They drop the yellow on cool.

[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.300]
No, no, it's just cool.

[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.060]
Cool.

[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:26.580]

[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:27.040]

[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.100]
Bob Bachelors says is the FCC working hand in glove.

[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:32.920]
We haven't taken enough calls before I get to this.

[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:36.220]
I don't want to get too newsy, but I do have some important things to pass along.

[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:39.300]
Not for the audience, but just for myself to make it feel like I did something.

[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:40.640]
Oh, really?

[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:42.120]
I mean, look, look at this.

[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:47.180]
I'll never get you any of this stuff, but I sit there with my new brother Fax, a copier

[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:47.440]
printer.

[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.380]
That's a nice number.

[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:50.220]
Yeah.

[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:51.180]
No, seriously?

[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:57.240]
It's the brother MF, or we can say MFC back up, 4800.

[01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.460]
That is one fine machine.

[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:00.760]
It's about 275 bucks.

[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:01.260]
Yeah.

[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:01.740]
Black and white.

[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:03.380]
But, you know, who would have wants a color printer?

[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:03.820]
It would.

[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:04.220]
Cool.

[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.120]
It's cool.

[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.460]
Now, back in the day before they invented those.

[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:10.980]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:11.980]

Yes, sir.

[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.420]
What's the poll again?

[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.920]
Because I just tuned in.

[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.260]
What do you mean, what's the poll again?

[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:16.880]
I don't understand.

[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.740]
Something about who doesn't like people or something?

[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.360]
Yeah, who doesn't like colors like this?

[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:22.740]
All of us.

[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:23.820]
We don't like colors like that.

[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.080]
Okay.

[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.060]
We don't like people that call them.

[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:25.660]
What's the poll?

[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.960]
Go to your computer, okay?

[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.280]
That was wrong with you.

[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.320]
Or listen to the show.

[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.780]
See, you know what frustrates them is that this all this week.

[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:33.700]
Now that I told them, I'm making my own list.

[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:34.200]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.340]
Yesterday they were trying to do additions to it.

[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:38.300]
It would be like, which was your favorite president?

[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.240]
We list all of them.

[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.820]
And then they tried to add other ones on.

[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:42.160]
You know, like if we had them all on there.

[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:42.860]
What about rock felli?

[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.260]
Yeah.

[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.160]
What about Bill Gates?

[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:47.320]
What about V Gates?

[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.120]
Which of these people are things you'd care about at least?

[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:52.580]
That's our poll, okay, Pally?

[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:53.360]
That's our poll.

[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:53.980]
Get with it.

[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:56.260]
NASCAR 165.

[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:57.480]
Donald Trump.

[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:58.420]
120.

[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.600]
Horse racing 61.

[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:02.340]
Israel 56.

[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.600]
Arnold Palmer also Q 56.

[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:07.780]
CKLW.

[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:08.940]
Buckham's down.

[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.220]
Sports talk 43.

[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.420]
7.7%.

[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:12.840]
Care least.

[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.860]
They don't want to hear all these scores.

[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.720]
And they certainly don't want to hear the big.

[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:16.960]
Oh!

[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.700]
I mean, he may be the nicest guy in the world.

[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:19.680]
I don't know very well.

[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:26.240]
But the approach that he takes to the whole thing is so humorless, so deadpan, so deathly serious.

[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.100]
And I really think he believes that.

[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.360]
That's what scares me.

[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.840]
You know what better than I do.

[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:33.080]
Yeah.

[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:34.500]
And am I wrong?

[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:36.100]
Nope.

[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.660]
Well, that's scary.

[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:44.080]
How can anybody that's lived more than a week, uh, take all of that cockarai so seriously, man?

[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:45.960]
He's just, I don't know.

[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:48.580]
He's like, oh, and the big news from Puerto Rico.

[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:56.860]
I mean, he just approaches it would like the fact that every pitch, every scratch at a crotch, every, every part of every game is so freaking important, man.

[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.460]
He's passionate.

[01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.380]
Oh, really?

[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.760]
Sports talk, I said, you know, better than I do.

[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:09.960]
Sports talk 43, Fox News 42, MSNBC 6, and CNN, still got only four out of 553.

[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.620]
So if you do the inversion layer, then you turn them upside down.

[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.100]
They were glued to, which is sad.

[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:18.320]
But then again, they don't get the BBC, or even the CBCA.

[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:25.940]
So that's what they have to count on for news is that sugar-coated propaganda, with that simple idiot that, uh, solid-eddle Brian.

[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:29.940]
I'll tell you who I'm starting actually like a little bit.

[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:31.380]
That Judy Woodruff.

[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.180]
Jack Caperti.

[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:32.640]
Oh, okay.

[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:33.760]
Yeah, on occasion.

[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:34.280]
He's okay.

[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:37.380]
He has some lucid moments, you know, he's like me. He's getting along in the tooth.

[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:40.280]
But he has some lucid moments where he really kicks ass.

[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.280]
I mean, he's really ripped the crap out of Bush's so-called press conference last night.

[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.080]
Good. You go, Jack.

[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.000]
He ripped him an ass.

[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.000]
I was like, I'm gonna lie.

[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.220]
He said, what did he tell us?

[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.680]
He said the same stuff he's been saying in these speeches all over.

[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.080]
He said, there was nothing new in there.

[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:53.500]
Why didn't he answer the questions?

[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:55.740]
He was, I couldn't believe it.

[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.700]
Because he doesn't know any answers.

[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.440]
I mean, this is on the certainly not news network, which are the AOL time-order people are getting fined by the SEC

[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:05.060]
because they had $400 million of revenue that turned out to be bogus, but they know.

[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.240]
What's $400 million?

[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:06.760]
Yeah.

[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:07.800]
Between friends.

[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.260]
What was $400 billion?

[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:10.160]
Well, I don't know what it was.

[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.200]
They probably don't either.

[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:15.540]
It's kind of like the Parmolod people in Italy.

[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.620]
That's how $14 billion disappeared.

[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:18.920]
Well, I'm sorry, I was 17.

[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:19.860]
I was 18 billion.

[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:22.560]
Well, what's 18 billion Italy, huh?

[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.760]
Right, when you talk about the big number.

[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:25.960]
I bet you still have your burlaskoni's got that much in small change.

[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:26.820]
That is a mattress.

[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.900]
And by the way, we got to go to the mattresses now.

[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.160]
What does that mean?

[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:32.080]
What?

[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:33.320]
Go into the mattresses.

[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.060]
You don't know what that means?

[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:35.360]
No, but where did it come from?

[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.080]
It came from in a mafia when there were wars between the families.

[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:39.680]
Yeah.

[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:44.580]
They had places like in old factories and places where they had all these mattresses,

[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:48.560]
and all the mobsters would hang out there and they would sleep there and they would live there

[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.740]
and they would fight to hide from the other families.

[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:51.960]
Go into the mattresses.

[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:52.860]
You didn't know that?

[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.980]
No, I didn't know where I came from.

[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:54.860]
I can't believe I knew something.

[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:55.300]
You didn't.

[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:55.760]
That's a miracle.

[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.760]
I mean about that anyway.

[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:57.600]
I know a lot of things.

[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.600]
Not that you want to know them.

[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:00.060]
Better side.

[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:00.980]
Yeah.

[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:03.700]
Come on.

[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:04.340]
Come on, bro.

[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.480]
That's what I said when I swear.

[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.060]
I can't swear anymore.

[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.600]
I'm a soulmate, grandchildren.

[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:14.160]
And I will not be in the want to break the peace we made today.

[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:15.380]
All right.

[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:16.400]
Oh, where's the rest of it?

[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.300]
That's my goal in life.

[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.740]
I want to know the entire dialogue of Godfather.

[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.660]
Not two and three.

[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:21.460]
That's asking too much.

[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.760]
Somebody set you the script a while back.

[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:24.040]

[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.980]
I can just watch it over and over again.

[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:27.440]
Slow more.

[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:27.880]
Free screener.

[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:28.880]
I can write it out.

[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:29.740]
You're right.

[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.540]
We have the script.

[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:31.780]
It's different from the movie.

[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:32.700]
I don't want that.

[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:33.840]
Parts.

[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.760]
Because you know how sometimes they wind up ad libbing.

[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:36.820]
I haven't even a madoka.

[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.460]
But they forget their line and they just leave it in there because it works fine.

[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.880]
It's always great when you go to the theater, when you go to the Godfather and I mean back in the day.

[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:51.960]
And there are people talking out loud because the one knock you can make on the movie is that the dialogue is very hard to hear and understand at times.

[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:52.420]
At times.

[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:52.780]
At times.

[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:53.240]
Right.

[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:55.640]
Especially in the opening there.

[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:57.620]
It's very dark and there's what's his name.

[01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:58.160]
The undertaking.

[01:38:59.100 --> 01:38:59.740]
Bonne santa.

[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:00.500]
Bonne santa.

[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.920]
What have I done to make you disrespect me?

[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:02.120]

[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.460]
Never came to a house for a cup of coffee.

[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:04.740]
Why?

[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:05.640]
Because you were afraid.

[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:06.500]
Right?

[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.000]
Yeah, the police to protect you.

[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:08.180]
Right.

[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.440]
You didn't need friends like me.

[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:09.900]
That's right.

[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.920]
But if you came to me, the same must.

[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:12.820]
Oh.

[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.460]
They seem not paying way to pull up on the rear.

[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:17.000]

[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:20.720]
All right, listen, I know how to capture those runaway.

[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.760]
This is Brian orcross.

[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:23.120]
Donnie.

[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.200]
Got a lot to do.

[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:24.380]
Yeah.

[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:25.700]
Speaking of Brian orcross.

[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.180]
Wow, what a great thing to be back in town for a very brief time.

[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.700]
Yesterday the way he was out of control.

[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:31.700]
You saw the story.

[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:31.700]

[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.920]
Have you seen the story as we had the tornado warnings?

[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:35.080]
This is how.

[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:36.640]
That's how people.

[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:37.360]
Yeah.

[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:38.920]
I am maniac, man.

[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:39.380]
Where is it?

[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:41.480]
I wanted to give you the real thing here now.

[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.160]
You know, thanks.

[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.300]
Well, she is just a wild and I thought he was the weather history of specialists.

[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:48.160]
Storm specialist.

[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.540]
He's the storm history weather specialist on channel.

[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:51.200]

[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.820]
The great hyperventilator, Mr. orcross.

[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.200]
I'd love to see him duke it out with the Miss Kamal, man.

[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.220]
Can you see them get into a hissy fit slot fight?

[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.040]
Hey, spring in the savings right now.

[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:03.780]
It's saved like never before in a great new car.

[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:06.260]
Truck from Armstrong, Toyota of Homestead.

[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.220]
They're on US 120 minutes after the 836.

[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:11.780]

[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.660]
So is this a Marie book?

Here's what I'll do.

[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.520]
I'll wear a kit.

[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:27.240]
With nothing on your knee.

[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:28.720]
Where's the sheet?

[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:31.160]

[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:34.520]
I have no life.

[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.960]
Okay, we got another bomb hit the shirt and hotel unpacked it.

[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.620]
Do not be making a book in any long trips of the shirt and the bag.

[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.780]
Because they're just to help.

[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:44.120]
Last week they able to shot and they didn't do too well.

[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.760]
This they just did it again.

[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.320]
We're not getting too much information.

[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:49.600]
We're not getting anything from your favorite news network.

[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:50.000]
CNN.

[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:51.540]
They're oblivious.

[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.600]
They're putting on a bunch of old crap is what they're doing.

[01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:58.200]
All in that job is in circle for a possible move on Al Saadar.

[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.120]
You know, Mook Taba.

[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:02.400]
Whatever the hell his name is.

[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.400]
Isn't it Mohammed?

[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:04.100]
Are they all Mohammed?

[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:05.620]
No, his name is Mook Taba.

[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:06.120]
Oh.

[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:12.460]
And of course, if we're actually going to get it because he goes into these mosques and he surrounds himself with thousands of his supporters.

[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:14.340]
Right.

[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:14.860]
Right.

[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:18.100]
So it creates a little bit of a logistical problem for us.

[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.660]
Well, no innocent bystanders will be hard.

[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.100]
So if we're going to get him what we're going to have to do is kill some people.

[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:23.380]
Right.

[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:25.420]
Isn't that what we've been doing over there?

[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:26.020]
Kill some people.

[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:26.240]
Right.

[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:27.220]
R's there.

[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:28.120]
One over here.

[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:28.660]
A few over there.

[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.340]
Not a pain in the ass innocent bystanders.

[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:30.940]
Right.

[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:32.020]
He'll be more than scared away.

[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:33.140]
Oh, look at this.

[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:38.140]
Here's somebody sent me a couple of blank pages on the facts that's good, very good job from on hold productions.

[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:38.700]
Oh, here's.

[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:39.940]
Here is the link.

[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.140]
I don't understand why he sent three pages to send me.

[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.360]
Oh, Charles and your field beach.

[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:44.280]
You're slipping, Charlie.

[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:47.060]
He's under a lot of pressure and I've been back in town for a while.

[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:51.080]
He says, here's the link that will take you directly to the original script of the Godfather.

[01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:54.720]
I got it simply by bringing up Google and typing in Godfather's script.

[01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:57.140]
You can find the script for many major motion pictures this way.

[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:58.660]
I don't want that, Charlie.

[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.300]
Thanks anyway.

[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.980]
I'd rather watch the movie over and over and over again to get the inflection right.

[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:04.600]
Right.

[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:05.020]

[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.160]
Reading it off a page, don't do it.

[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:07.740]
You got to hear it.

[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:09.440]
Johnny Fontay will never get that movie.

[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.840]
I don't care how many day go, Jenny, what grease ball, gum vise, come out of the woodware.

[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:14.240]
Absolutely.

[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:15.160]
I'm German Irish.

[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:17.700]
Well, let me tell you something, my crud, Nick Friend.

[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:19.940]
I'm going to make so much trouble for you.

[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:20.980]
You'll know what it is.

[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:21.800]
The world's coming lower.

[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:22.580]
I have not threatened.

[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:24.700]
I know almost every big lawyer in New York.

[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:25.520]
Who the hell are you?

[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:26.340]
Who the hell are you?

[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.140]

[01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.320]
He's now starring in Horseheads, New York.

[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:35.800]
Which of these people or things do you care about?

[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.160]
There is a place called Horseheads, New York.

[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:37.780]
Oh.

[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:43.280]
And 20,000 troops came home in a week end or what does it say about it for you?

[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.640]
But they may have to stay down in the three months.

[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:45.640]
They lied to him.

[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:46.660]
Not again.

[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:48.780]
Yeah, they're looking for it.

[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:49.840]
They got the date marked in the calendar.

[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:50.660]
Oh, guess what?

[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:52.520]
Get another calendar, mark another date.

[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.420]
Because you got another three months and then they will decide again.

[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:56.680]
Maybe another three months after that.

[01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:57.460]
They wouldn't say this year.

[01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:57.980]
Right.

[01:45:58.940 --> 01:45:59.740]
Good planning.

[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:00.480]
Nice going, W.

[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:02.440]

[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.900]
We're doing fairly well considering.

[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:06.740]
Considering that the world.

[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:08.500]
I don't understand one thing.

[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.880]
Yesterday, well, when Boca came in, he said,

[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:13.960]
Boca is like a ghost town and there's nobody here.

[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:15.320]
Here in the building and there's no.

[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:15.440]

[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:16.220]
And well, both.

[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:19.160]
And this morning, I came in here and it was like,

[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:21.240]
I'm not coming fairly early, but geez.

[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.220]
It's like, what?

[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.220]
I thought the holiday thing was all over with.

[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:26.520]
They've been having these meetings around here.

[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:28.580]
So that's me about what?

[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:29.320]
Meetings about what?

[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:29.740]
I don't know.

[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:30.480]
I'm not included.

[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:31.520]
Who's having a meetings?

[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.220]
Well, that just came out of one.

[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:33.880]
Let's ask him.

[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:37.340]
I don't think we want to hear about what that was all about.

[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:38.140]
Not on the year.

[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.620]
Which of these people or things can you care about least?

[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:44.100]

Almost 8%.

[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.280]
How do you like that?

[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:02.520]
Clear.

[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:03.100]
It's a by the way.

[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.100]
Get off those horrible things off the year.

[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.520]
Those rejoins they're doing on the sports shows.

[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.200]
Those attempt people, attempts at comedy.

[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.960]
Man, that stuff is caca, man.

[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:11.920]
It's horrendous.

[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:12.540]
It's awful.

[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:17.560]
MSNBC 6 and CNN still got only four out of 600 and one votes.

[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.420]
They trust MSN CNN.

[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.240]
Even OcN right now is good.

[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.240]
Of course, we'd like to see other countries.

[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.800]
That bitch on here from the Pentagon.

[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.680]
They'll even know that the shirt and hotel got hit again.

[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.220]
I don't have time to do this before the break.

[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:35.180]
Don't let me forget this article about the FCC and the Republicans and all this stuff that's going on.

[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:36.160]
Nothing's going to change anything.

[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.120]
Also, panel says, Borsar repeated warnings.

[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.300]
I got time for that.

[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:41.840]
And Brittany.

[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:44.280]
Brittany may get her own reality TV show.

[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:45.100]
Naked.

[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:45.760]
Well, maybe not.

[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.020]
Well, back in the day, she might have been naked.

[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:49.040]
But not even not no more.

[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.060]
Not since that Janet Jackson deal.

[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:52.720]
Depends on the channel.

[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:54.360]
She wants to show it.

[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:56.060]
And somebody, oh, you kidding me.

[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:57.280]
She's anxious.

[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.020]
And we want to see it.

[01:47:58.260 --> 01:47:58.720]
Hot to try.

[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.540]
Brittany Spears naked in Pompadot Park in our Hot to Try celebration this weekend.

[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.160]
Whenever you something.

[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:04.740]
See you.

[01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:07.660]
I mean, Brittany is sisters and brothers Rose.

[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:08.860]
Joe and Pete.

[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.740]
But at any rate, it's the best we can do on a low budget.

[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.900]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:15.680]
Here's the ideal.

[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:21.880]
By the time a CIA briefer gave president Bush the August 2001 president's daily brief,

[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:26.000]
the PDB, headline, Bin Laden determined to strike in the U.S.,

[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.600]
the president had seen a stream of alarming reports, alarming reports on al-Qaeda's intentions,

[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.280]
so says this morning's Washington Post.

[01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:36.000]
So, advice president Cheney and Bush's top national security team,

[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:40.680]
according to newly declassified information, released yesterday by the commission investigating 9-11.

[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:45.480]
In April and May of 2001, for example, the intelligence community headlines some of these reports

[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.040]
been laden planning multiple operations, been laden networks plans advancing,

[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:51.380]
and been laden's threats are real.

[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.300]
The intelligence-ecluded reports of a hostage plot against Americans

[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:59.020]
had noted that operatives might choose to hijack an aircraft or storm a U.S. embassy.

[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:01.520]
Without knowing when, where, or how the terrorists would strike,

[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.560]
the CIA consistently described the upcoming attacks as occurring on a catastrophic level,

[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:09.320]
indicating that they would cause the world to be in turmoil,

[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.120]
according to one of two staff reports released by the panel yesterday.

[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.460]
And that bitch Condoleez goes on and says,

[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:18.340]
well, you know what, I mean, we knew al-Qaeda was bad,

[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:21.820]
they were evil doers, but we didn't have the exact time place and date.

[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:27.060]
They didn't set a telegram saying, hey, be waiting for us over here on the street corner,

[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:30.320]
like those geniuses that were shooting up the cars, you know,

[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:33.380]
now, hole in the Mohammed shwarts.

[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.960]
Reports similar to these were made available to President Bush in the morning meetings

[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.700]
with George Tendon, the commission staff said.

[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:42.780]
The information offers the most detailed account of, to date,

[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:45.820]
of the warnings the intelligence community gave top Bush administration officials

[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:47.900]
and it provides the context in which the CIA,

[01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:50.500]
a brief report together, a memo on Osama Yomamovid Laws activities

[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.240]
and the August 6th brief for Bush.

[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:56.660]
So if the Clinton people wouldn't have had to be tied up with Monica and a blue dress

[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:58.840]
and the stains and all that crap for like two or three years

[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:00.920]
and a $70 million they wasted on that,

[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:03.360]
and if the Bush people wouldn't have been so intent on worrying about

[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.520]
when, what, where we got to be able to invade Iraq,

[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:07.680]
what excuse are we going to use, et cetera?

[01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:10.800]
And of course, the drug, the war on drugs,

[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:12.780]
and the war on porn,

[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:15.340]
and the war on all these other real evil things in the cuttings.

[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.820]
And the war they could statues, and the word police, all of these things,

[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:21.560]
maybe then maybe something might have been done.

[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:27.900]
I mean, when the FBI's got two of the guys addresses and phone numbers,

[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:30.480]
phone numbers, they're going to give them a call, say,

[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:32.780]
well, what, what date are you planning these terrorist attacks?

[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:33.760]
Okay, thank you. Yeah.

[01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:35.460]
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:38.220]
We had a couple of interpreters, but they were fags, so they got fired.

[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.140]
Yeah, we had to get rid of them.

[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:41.620]
Arab-speaking faggots.

[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:42.640]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:43.640]
Schmacht the Hid.

[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:47.480]
10 past noon at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:51.500]
Bush, Mr. Attorney General, Governor, thanks very much for joining us.

[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.420]
Oh, my other thing is he's the former Governor of Pennsylvania.

[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.040]
Yeah, we know.

[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:55.700]
He's boring as you are, Wolf.

[01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:58.520]
Hey, if you didn't did, in job like Wolf Blitzkrieg.

[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:00.320]
Oh, he's good, he's a man.

[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.340]
Whatever they're paying him, it's too much, you know what I mean?

[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.080]
I tell you how many dollars a week I'd pay him.

[01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:05.980]
But third, man.

[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:08.320]
If you, that's all you're making, maybe you're underpaid overworked.

[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:09.120]
How'd you like to get yourself?

[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.120]
If Todd Wreck doesn't give me some copy tomorrow, I know.

[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.360]
Most seriously, I am going to burn this an effigy of him.

[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.080]
I'm going to burn a statue, and he is the worst.

[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.680]
There is nobody I have never in all the years I've been in this business.

[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:22.800]
I've worked with anybody.

[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:26.440]
In addition to which I've never worked with people who just don't care

[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:30.260]
who won't make these people responsive, who will not hold their feet to the fire.

[01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:32.060]
Wouldn't you love to hold his feet to the fire?

[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:33.540]
Because he's even shorter than you are.

[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.780]
You tower over him, his feet?

[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:37.920]
No, no, no.

[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:40.120]
We are, his ass, when you like to hold his ass to the fire?

[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.440]
Talk about that thing burning roids.

[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:43.700]
Too bad we can't play that in no more.

[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:47.060]
Anyway, if your job sucks, if you don't have a paycheck, it's where they mean.

[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:48.060]

[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:34.180]
UA.

[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.400]
So, it was the greatest piece of ass I ever had.

[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:40.960]
I'd have had them all over the world.

[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.260]
Ah!

[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:51.160]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to dom a people killed

[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:53.740]
with the gas that we sold him.

[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.680]
First time a gracer nation and the only one that's going,

[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:02.060]
now more blood will be spilled to get that oil going.

[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:06.840]
Forget about Korea and the nooks there toe to namba.

[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:13.580]
Right wing is drilling it over and over and to our hips.

[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:14.180]
Ah!

[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.900]
That iraq has some weapons of master's traction.

[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:21.100]
I've got it.

[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:32.980]
3,000 people killed.

[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.680]
I'm now forgotten, let's exploit them instead.

[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.280]
Hey, there's oil to be caught in.

[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.360]
Going after satan too.

[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.060]
Plankato's sama.

[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:45.600]
There's no longer mention of.

[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:49.700]
Unnamed bin Laden, but no one seems concerned all.

[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:54.540]
Humphie and complacent, believe in every word of this cartel

[01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:59.500]
administration that controls us by fear through leading a manipulation

[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:06.960]
and a right wing is drilling it over and over and to our hips.

[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:13.220]
That iraq has some weapons of master's traction.

[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:14.740]
Ah!

[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:28.080]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.

[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.080]
We're all suspects now, not the ass croft is saying.

[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:34.000]
I have nothing to hide.

[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.260]
Tables, paughters, all are saying.

[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:40.180]
Blind obedient cattle don't have any reservations.

[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:44.660]
Out of provoked battle and world annihilation.

[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:48.540]
Old regimes must fall in halivergent and stoke,

[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:50.600]
with no objection at all.

[01:54:50.980 --> 01:55:00.820]
Timber crams don't have the balls and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our parade watchtons.

[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.240]
I rack has some weapons of master's traction.

[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:08.280]
Oh my god.

[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:14.480]
Only I rack has some weapons of master's traction.

[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:23.900]
From 18 to 560 WQM, Fox viewers most misinformed.

[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:25.140]
What a shock.

[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.000]
Are you surprised?

[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.460]
Did a different study?

[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:29.220]
No, it's the same old study.

[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.660]
But back in the day when they did the first time.

[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.640]
Viewers of Fox News are the most misinformed.

[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:37.540]
The National Survey reported October 2nd.

[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:40.180]
October 2nd, this is from 11-11-03.

[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.840]
If you're going to fax me stuff, at least have it sometime in my lifetime.

[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:46.020]
God, why it's not that long, go right?

[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:47.740]
That's that low.

[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:57.960]
The PIPA Knowledge Network's poll of $3,334 found that 67% of Fox viewers incorrectly thought US had clear evidence that Sodom was working with Al-Qaeda.

[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:14.460]
Compared with 56% of those who were allowed on CBS, 49% NBC viewers, 48% for CNN, 45% for ABC, 40% for readers of newspapers and magazines, and just 16% for PBS-slash NPR people.

[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:19.260]
Fox viewers also led misconceptions about, in other words brainwashing is what they're talking about.

[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:19.460]
Right.

[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:40.640]
Fox also led misconceptions about Iraq's weapons and mass destruction is 33% believed wrongly that the US had found WMDs in Iraq, followed by 23% for viewers of CBS, 20% for NBC, and CNN, 19% for ABC, and just 17% for PBS-slash NPR, 11% for people who read, print readers.

[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.020]
How do you like that?

[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:45.780]
Yeah.

[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:47.560]
You're gonna like this.

[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:52.280]
Minister dies from snake bite during Easter Church, or you're right.

[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:54.100]
How do you like that?

[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:54.640]
A lot.

[01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:02.960]
Rose Hill, Virginia, the minister of a church in far south ways, Virginia has done after being bitten by a snake during church services.

[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:04.380]
He has fallen.

[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:07.580]
He ain't rising no more.

[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:08.180]
I'll tell you that.

[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:11.220]
In fact, that's what they were saying about the snake.

[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:12.600]
Oh, look out for him. He's risen.

[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:19.920]
Authority said it reverend Wayne Long of Rose Hill was bitten by a rattlesnake Sunday afternoon and refused to seek medical treatment.

[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:21.500]
He died early money at his home.

[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:22.960]
He refused to seek medical treatment.

[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.800]
Faith will heal him.

[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:25.160]
Not.

[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:30.060]
Lee County Sheriff Kerry Parsons says long was a minister with a Pentecostal church.

[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:31.160]
Well, that explains that.

[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:33.420]
Where members practice serpent handling.

[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:34.840]
They wrestle with them snakes.

[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.960]
Back in the day, I could say something about that, but I can't know anymore.

[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:43.420]
Parsons says long was holding a rattlesnake during an Easter service when the snake bit him on the back of a finger.

[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:48.720]
He says the congregation prayed for the minister, but no one, including Long, saw a medical treatment.

[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.120]
They're sure since he doubts any charges will be filed because his words it's their belief.

[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:54.060]
Why aren't they gonna charge the snake?

[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:55.400]
They also drink straight night.

[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:56.620]
Do they really?

[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:57.480]
Yes, they did or what?

[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:00.200]
To show how God will not let them die.

[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.080]
Oh, all right.

[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.180]
So God must have been picked off of him.

[01:58:03.220 --> 01:58:06.780]
To show just how strong you believe the more you drink, the more you believe, right?

[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:07.300]
Right.

[01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:08.800]
So drink a lot.

[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:11.280]
If you really believe you put a gun in your mouth.

[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:12.800]
Yeah, and pull the trigger in.

[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:13.240]
Yeah.

[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:14.280]
Just like that dog.

[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:17.900]
Maybe Jason Williams dog was a Pentecostal dog.

[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:19.200]
Could have been.

[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.260]
He was just testing his faith in the Lord and that's oh geez.

[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:24.760]
I hate when dogs off themselves like that.

[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.460]
560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.480]
Got many, many open lines here, man.

[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:35.700]
We're doing screenless all this year.

[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:37.420]
Maybe next year we'll put them on hold.

[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:37.820]
What do you think?

[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:39.760]
I'm lucky.

[01:58:40.620 --> 01:58:41.360]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:42.860]
Yeah, I'm John.

[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:44.380]
Hi, John.

[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:47.980]
I want to talk about local politics.

[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:50.140]
Well, I'll talk to somebody else about it.

[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:58.500]
Oh man, the pain is so where is my strict eye when I need the most?

[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:00.260]
Over there in that meeting yard.

[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:00.580]
Give me a glass.

[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:01.560]
Give me a jug full.

[01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:04.060]
Oh, now back in the evening, we could say something about that too.

[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:06.920]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:08.220]
Hello, Neil.

[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:08.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:10.220]
Hi.

[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:11.040]
Hi.

[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.660]
This is one of your favorite PO officers up here in Boyn Beach.

[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:16.160]
All right.

[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:17.460]
Got a quick question.

[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.060]
I'm on Amazon.com.

[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:21.700]
You know they got to wear 11,000 books about 80s.

[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:22.720]
And?

[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:26.580]
And I'm trying to find that one that you recommended a couple years ago, because I've been on Amazon.

[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:27.420]
Charles Templeton.

[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:28.840]
What's the name of it?

[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:28.960]
It's a guy.

[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:29.700]
Farewell to God.

[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:31.400]
Farewell to God.

[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:31.800]
Right.

[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:33.680]
Okay, that's all I need to know.

[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:34.440]
Thank you very much.

[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:35.160]
You're a love of it, Pali.

[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:35.900]
All right.

[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:36.860]
And a quick being a heathen.

[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:37.240]
Thank you.

[01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:38.500]
Farewell to God.

[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:40.380]
Oh, I can't wait for that day.

[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:41.280]
Oh, hallelujah.

[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:43.200]
I'm thinking I'm planning now.

[01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:44.200]
It's only two and a half years away.

[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:46.820]
Plus, you see, here's the way I do it to keep myself going.

[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:51.780]
I think about those two months in a summertime when I only work two days a week.

[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:52.100]
Right.

[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:53.220]
July and August.

[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:55.840]
So we got like what, two of those?

[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:57.080]
Correct.

[01:59:58.700 --> 01:59:59.340]
Or three of those.

[01:59:59.360 --> 01:59:59.840]
No, three of those.

[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:00.220]
Three of those.

[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:01.660]
So there's six months right there.

[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:03.460]
So now it's that a two and a half years.

[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.000]
Now all of a sudden, it's two years.

[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:06.320]
Just like that.

[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:11.460]
And then, and then there's the six year weeks of your six years of week vacation I get.

[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:12.540]
Mm-hmm.

[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:14.660]
So six weeks times two and a half is what?

[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:15.080]
15.

[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:16.000]
Last time I checked.

[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:16.200]

[02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:20.360]
So 15, which is like another, uh, almost a third of a year.

[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:22.720]
Now we're down like, uh, you're in the two thirds.

[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:24.400]
See?

[02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:25.420]
See the way this is going?

[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:28.420]
Then you get those holidays, you know?

[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:30.820]
You get the major holidays and a couple of the Jew holidays.

[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.780]
Now we're down to like about maybe a year and a quarter.

[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:33.700]
Keep siphoning.

[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:34.340]
You'll be talking tomorrow.

[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:34.880]
Right.

[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:35.340]
Bye.

[02:00:36.740 --> 02:00:37.300]
See ya.

[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.420]
See ya, Galdi.

[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:39.540]
Bye-bye.

[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:40.440]
Bye-bye.

[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:47.220]
Maybe we could have Galdi and Justin think about what little, uh, we're contest going here.

[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.240]
Bye-bye-bye.

[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:51.300]
Bye-bye-bye.

[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:51.660]
Bye-bye-bye.

[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:52.280]
Bye-bye-bye.

[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:54.100]
I love it.

[02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:56.140]
So where the hell is Galdi really?

[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.960]
Okay, he gets a can or something going on.

[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.240]
He's probably looking for a job.

[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:01.560]
It's just on vacation.

[02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:02.280]
No, he's not.

[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:05.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:06.820]
Let's pick up, uh, some story.

[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:08.580]
Okay, that's what they like in these sports nerds.

[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:10.280]
Oh, yeah, well you can make up anything you want.

[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.020]
Clear it to your idiot.

[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:12.020]
Okay, you're so sad.

[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:12.980]
He makes me want to cry.

[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:14.900]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:15.920]
Hey, Neil.

[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:16.520]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:17.520]
How you doing, man?

[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:17.980]
Pretty good.

[02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:19.380]
Welcome to Children Playing Radio.

[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:24.960]
Uh, is your post about things you, uh, uh, think about the least or whatever?

[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:25.360]
Yeah.

[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.880]
Yeah, I would have to say it's Jan and Spoops.

[02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:28.980]
Oh, I'm good.

[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.140]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.840]
Pound 5, 60 on EAT and T and for I, me too.

[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:34.560]
Generino?

[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:36.160]
Yeah, Generino's Boobies.

[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.640]
In fact, wouldn't that have been something during a hearing yesterday,

[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:41.400]
if she had said, I'm going to show that Janet Jack to think of it.

[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:43.340]
There's RIPTAA, one of those red-oh, man.

[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:43.860]
Oh.

[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:45.140]
Woo.

[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:48.120]
I think, I think emotions might have been sagging at the hearings.

[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:49.900]
And that wouldn't have been all.

[02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:52.240]
Man, oh, man alive.

[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.300]
Can you just see that now?

[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:54.280]
No, thank you.

[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:57.480]
And then when he starts seeing that thing shaking like her hands, you know.

[02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:58.080]
Oh, no.

[02:01:58.420 --> 02:01:58.840]
Oh, yeah.

[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:00.220]
That's nice.

[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:01.980]
That's fantastic.

[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:04.220]
Shake just like a bowl full of gel.

[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:05.440]
Anyway.

[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:07.220]
658 votes.

[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:10.020]
Which of these people are things you care about at least like that last call?

[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:17.260]
NASCAR 196, Donald Chump 136, horse racing 75, except of course for Pompino Park.

[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:21.580]
Israel 66, Arnold Palmer's 60.

[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:23.940]
He only wishes he could see 60 again.

[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:25.280]
But then again, so do I.

[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:28.620]
Fox News 59, Sports Talk, Q56.

[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:30.260]
Now, how appropriate is that?

[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:32.000]
Perfect.

[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:34.740]
56, that's 8.5%.

[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:39.000]
8.5% of this audience said they just can't stand sports talk.

[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:42.540]
MSNBC 6 and CNN still got only four.

[02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:46.000]
The number of votes keeps rising dramatically here.

[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:49.300]
658, but CNN man, they know what they love it.

[02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:50.520]
They trust it, which goes to sure.

[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:51.260]
It's a problem.

[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:53.520]
PBS and PR.

[02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:55.900]
If you want to learn something, go online and read.

[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:56.760]
Go on our website.

[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:57.780]
Read the bedtime stories.

[02:02:57.780 --> 02:03:00.920]
You'll find something out like, well, I don't have time to make it a part of your young hero.

[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:01.940]
You forget to remind me.

[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:03.000]
Oh, yeah, read that thing.

[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:04.860]
To a read this thing about the FCC.

[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:07.660]
And I, you know, something I don't want to get even.

[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:09.000]
I've done my thing, you know.

[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:09.600]
Right.

[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:10.580]
But what's the point?

[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:11.520]
But where can you do?

[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:12.600]
Not much.

[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:14.500]
But I will read that story if you remind me.

[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:15.400]
Okay, don't forget.

[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:21.820]
When 26 past noon back in the day, I would remember myself, but I'm getting to be very long in the tooth right now.

[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:22.960]
Where did that expression come from?

[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:24.040]
Your teeth don't grow long.

[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.140]
That's not ebonyx.

[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:26.600]
Actually, I think they do.

[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:27.380]
What?

[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:28.160]
Grow longer?

[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:29.260]
Your teeth grow longer?

[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:31.060]
Your nose and your ear don't grow.

[02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:31.840]
Your teeth don't grow.

[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:32.940]
Your teeth are like solid.

[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:33.760]
How do you explain, Jayden?

[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:34.540]
How do you grow?

[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:36.620]
Some dead.

[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:39.700]
You know, you've never seen that grow anymore.

[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:40.100]
I'm your TNT's not growing anymore.

[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:40.580]
No, no.

[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:41.600]
Or any less.

[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:42.660]
Yeah.

[02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:45.540]
And get those long teeth.

[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:47.260]
They get from a dog.

[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.760]
As Bella, I think what they do is they have like a dog thing like the dogs get long.

[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:51.260]
Oh man.

[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:52.000]
K9s.

[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:53.620]
Do you ever see a golden retriever's teeth?

[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:54.100]
Yes.

[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.660]
Man, it's good thing they're real gentle and gentle.

[02:03:57.280 --> 02:03:58.020]
Oh man.

[02:03:58.280 --> 02:03:58.280]

[02:03:58.380 --> 02:03:58.880]
It's smartly.

[02:03:58.960 --> 02:03:59.240]
They think they're real.

[02:03:59.240 --> 02:03:59.240]

[02:03:59.240 --> 02:03:59.240]

[02:03:59.240 --> 02:03:59.240]

[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:02.020]
They're like a little 10 pound dog.

[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.460]
They want to grab a bone away from them.

[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:07.900]
That's when you see those gentle, wonderful breed of dog.

[02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:08.940]
You know, like that.

[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:10.880]
Oh man, he just gets psychotic.

[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:14.040]
When a little piece of crap comes dancing around,

[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:16.820]
if you give both dogs a bone,

[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:19.420]
the little one is never happy with the one he's got.

[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:20.320]
They're like winded.

[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:20.780]
Right.

[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:21.200]
That is real.

[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:22.280]
I want yours.

[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:24.320]
I don't want it.

[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:25.440]
I want yours.

[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:26.500]
Yours is better.

[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:28.520]
But it's the same, now yours is better.

[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:30.240]
I want it because you had it.

[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:32.160]
And then of course the big dog was, ah, like that.

[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:35.080]

[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:01.540]

Keep it in the Stone Age, put your burger on today.

[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:31.020]
And once he be the Saudi-Paks American way, pay the tower or Michael Powell, the site of Janet's T.

[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:39.660]
Makes him Howard, just by buying his physician that he got through nepotism, what a spoiled incompetence work.

[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.360]
12-32-5-60.

[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:44.320]
Here's the facts from hysterical even, Kielargo.

[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:47.120]
Calm down, Eve. Calm down a little bit, okay?

[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:49.620]
A little bit too over the top, too worked out.

[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:54.800]
She says, did you see the new ultimate reality show last night on TV was called W Speaks?

[02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:56.880]
Unfortunately, that's the ultimate reality.

[02:06:57.060 --> 02:07:00.480]
We're all living it, and I don't know about you, but it scares me, schmittless, she says.

[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:04.340]
Just calm down.

[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:07.980]
Vote several times in November, and hope for the best, right?

[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:13.460]
What's the point of getting all like, you know, when in question or a doubt, run in circle screaming shot?

[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:16.540]
I just can't deal with those people. Calm down, Eve.

[02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:18.400]
Or she's in Kielargo, what do you expect?

[02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:21.580]
She's out of touch, and probably just as well.

[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:27.200]
Bob Bachelorette's is the FCC working hand in glove with the Republican Party.

[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:28.980]
Don't forget to read that article about the FCC.

[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:34.520]
He's author of the 1900s and editor of the forthcoming book, what's the forthcoming book?

[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:41.400]
Oh, there it is. I'll call the basketball in America from the playgrounds to Jordan's game and beyond.

[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:44.320]
What's that got to do with anything? What's that got to do with golf?

[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:49.400]
Each week about 40 million households tune into CSI crime scene investigation,

[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:54.580]
featuring these cerebral gild grissom, or CSI Miami with a compassionate Horatio cane,

[02:07:55.040 --> 02:08:00.600]
the success of the franchise is both of the CBS fortunes for several years, a CSI New York is even in the works.

[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:05.900]
In addition to familiarizing the public with various lab tests, chemicals and other tricks of the crime scene trade,

[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:11.600]
viewers also get a realistic computer reenactment of various violent crimes, a kind of inside the body view of death.

[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:18.200]
A recent show for example depicted a bullet rattling around a victim's skull, then lodging in her ear with accompanying sound effects.

[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.620]
Is this in decent programming?

[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:27.100]
Depending on the viewer's squeamish level, a reasonable argument can be made that these scenes are more indecent than either Janet Jackson's breast,

[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:29.940]
or remarks made by radio personality Howard Spurm.

[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:36.720]
Should Congress the FCC, the Bush administration, and various pro-sensorship advocate groups target CBS, and its top-rated shows?

[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:45.160]
Since Jackson's ill-fated super-will-have-time wardrobe malfunction, the nation jumped on the indecency bandwagon perhaps like no time in its history.

[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:50.520]
Suddenly, the laws that have been placed for years are being revamped, and fines increased geometrically.

[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:58.000]
In the first three months of 2004, the FCC leveled indecency fines totaling more than a million dollars according to the Center for Public Integrity.

[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.140]
This amount exceeds the previous nine years combined.

[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:10.360]
Fines and not only becoming more frequent are getting costlier, rather than hand out one fine, regulators are penalizing each utterance of deemed illegal.

[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:18.340]
A recent published report in Trade Magazine Broadcasting and Cable reveals that the FCC is going to find infinity broadcasting more than a hundred thousand for a Stern broadcast.

[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:24.100]
This round of fines will add to the nearly two million already paid by infinity for Stern's show since 1995.

[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:35.500]
And, for the upheaval, the House voted 391 to 22 in favor of the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which increases the maximum fine the FCC can hand out from $27,500 to a half a million dollars.

[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:45.000]
More importantly, the new legislation enables the regulatory body to find entertaining directly, not just the companies they work for as current guidelines stipulate the Senate has yet to vote on this bill.

[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:59.260]
It's not much of a stretch to see the political motivations behind this movement. In general terms, the kind of people who support restrictions against the decent programming, our voters George W. Bush is seeking, while those who don't want limit-free speech are usually a democratic challenger, John Kerry's camp.

[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:03.840]
From a bigger picture perspective, though, these changes lay this down a slippery path.

[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:12.180]
The issue at hand is adding to attempting to adequately define indecency profanity of sending other terms used to label art and expression.

[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:22.840]
The FCC's indecency, for example, hinges primarily on sex, decrying language or material that in context depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as measured by the...

[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:31.440]
The problem is that the FCC has developed its own universal definitions for these terms, but they fly in opposition to the idea-free speech was a defiant, which is a defining American trait.

[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:37.280]
People simply do not want a governing body or anyone really telling them what they can or cannot watch, listen to or read.

[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:47.080]
Established by the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC regulates interstate and international radio, television, wire, satellite and cable communications.

[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:58.640]
However, during the Great Depression, it had a simpler charter to ensure that radio, today's latest technological innovation, served the public by broadcasting valuable government information like weather reports and educational programming.

[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:09.240]
Here's the weather. The scope of the FCC seemed clear, but a clause-nits charter related to the notion of public interest gave the regulatory body almost unlimited power.

[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:22.540]
In exercising this power, the FCC concentrated on fraud and enforcing standards of decency, this far-reaching power was backed by Federal Pills Court in 1975, which declared Congress has made the FCC the guardian of that public interest.

[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:37.980]
Despite the government's decision, social norms changed and performance such as comedian George Carlen fought back. His indecency case went before the Supreme Court in 1978, the Supreme Court ruled against Carlen, effectively banning the seven swear words from big broadcasters when children could hear them.

[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:45.700]
The challenge in today's battle is that supposedly non-political enforcement of FCC regulations sniffs of a political agenda.

[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:57.700]
FCC Chairman Michael Powell is particularly suspect, considering that he's son of Secretary of State Colin Powell, the bipartisan commission appears to be waging a political witch hunt, which has both sides of dispute in an uproar.

[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:05.420]
Critics contend that a bit of pandering to conservatives, especially in the name of saving children from indecency, helps the current administration and its reelection efforts.

[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:13.600]
As soon as the report surfaced about possible fines against Stern, he told his audience that the battle was political since he had recently started public and criticizing Bush.

[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:20.840]
In a title lesson, both the radio personalities approximately 8 million listeners could have consequences if properly, if properly mobilized.

[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:27.860]
Ironically, for all the bluster coming from the FCC, the regulatory body really has very little power over what people view.

[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:40.400]
Its jurisdiction is limited to broadcast television and radio stations. Yes, the FCC may succeed in removing Stern from the airwaves, but can do little or nothing about cable TV, satellite radio, the Internet, other forms of media outside of its boundaries, so far.

[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:43.420]
So where does Janet Jackson's breast fit into this mess?

[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:54.660]
Like the Lukao crystal violet grissom and cane used to detect trace amounts of blood at the CSI crime scene, Jackson's ridiculous plea for attendance and services as an accelerant giving today's pure, tentacle crusaders,

[02:12:54.660 --> 02:13:03.600]
reasoning to go after people in ideas they don't like. Think of what you can see her latest see, think of that when you see her latest CD on the shelf when you walk into the election booth in November.

[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:07.300]
What do you say?

[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:12.420]
One of the parts that I liked is about the FCC wasn't created for that in 1934.

[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:15.480]
It was though everyone could have a place on here.

[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:23.240]
Right. You know, you fill out your little, are you doing your community service? Are you putting the weather on? You have some public service programs on the weekend when everybody's asleep doing your EBS.

[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:30.600]
Right. That's right. You're not running 85,000 watts when you're supposed to be running 500. If the answer is yes, you're okay.

[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:36.620]
Think of there was a federal print commission who would put up with that to censor newspapers, textbooks, and cycle.

[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:40.960]
You will put up with it if they decide that you will put up with it. They have that. They have a right.

[02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:50.720]
20 to 1 at 560 WQAM as the beat goes on. Hey, let me just say it again for my good friend Troy at Balance for Life. Your food is excellent. Your program is sensational.

[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:52.340]

Stop. I'm as big as a house. I don't want any extra food. The food is delicious.

[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:14.780]
You're love balance for life because they bring you a little black sack. In fact, maybe they ought to bring you the black sack instead of me. I don't want it. I don't want it.

[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:16.680]

My, my, and local, this is 43560, way to A.M.

[02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:55.480]
I took a call from the Ipanics. They say the future needs right for me. Now I can't get snow job because I don't got no literacy. I was talking like an old Negro.

[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:09.240]
I can't do nothing. But my heritage says that's okay. Change my name to shoot. Roll. Try to do Santa Coda in a Cadillac.

[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:37.620]
I remember when I was dealing all the white men's cars hanging outside the building their boss grind the blues my father teeth white devil's got snow job for the entire.

John in South Carolina remember he faxed yesterday so you just read his car but not leaving well enough alone see

[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:25.260]
Can't leave well enough alone today. He faxes and says and I really am so sorry John because I try to be a good guy

[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:27.000]
And as car was not only a good suggestion

[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.420]
It's went into pole, but he's not happy enough with that. It's got the pole position

[02:19:30.420 --> 02:19:34.760]
It says I know it's your pole thing, but I just thought of one if you don't mind well. I do mind

[02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:36.340]
Especially when it's this

[02:19:37.580 --> 02:19:41.000]
It says being that bush couldn't remember in other words he wouldn't answer the questions

[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.860]
I sense what he's trying to say being bush couldn't remember how about a pole of the biggest mistakes

[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:50.320]
He's made since being an office. We don't have that much room on the pole okay, John the time to build it right

[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:56.800]
There isn't that much time left especially if he gets elected again believe you me if they steal another one

[02:19:58.060 --> 02:20:01.460]
Does anybody believe the election results are gonna be like the emissary now?

[02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:03.580]
Now

[02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:07.260]
Bob and Talahassee as a explanation are dilemma about teeth

[02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:12.360]
You have a dilemma about getting long in the tooth. Oh that one

[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:17.900]
He says the reason we go along in the tooth is because as we age our gums recede

[02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:19.940]
Your teeth don't get longer

[02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:22.700]
Just that you're it looks like they are

[02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:27.520]
And pretty soon it comes up where your eyebrows used to be he's right. That's why Moe looks like that

[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:32.780]
Because look like it like old people have long teeth. I'm listening. That's good. Keep you off the streets Mo

squeeze the bag once for us

[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:38.760]
Now back in the day we could make the sounds the most squeezing that bag but not no more

[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:42.040]
That's the sound he's making. So we make it with our mouth

[02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:43.060]
No

[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:49.380]
You can do a little raspberry once. Oh, that's it. That's as close as you can come no fart sounds where did that come from?

[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:50.980]
Oh, we just made it up. Yeah, they did

[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:58.820]
I don't like those two bag words to right the uh golf bag and golf hole. They just made those up and even pulled them right out of their

[02:20:58.820 --> 02:21:00.180]
I'm gonna tell you the a

[02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:00.580]

[02:21:07.380 --> 02:21:10.320]
I know but especially if you're in a spent time in Canada a

[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:14.000]
Whole a day keeps the groundhog away

[02:21:14.660 --> 02:21:15.940]
That's what they say

[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:22.320]
Leafs and Ottawa tonight game of four that series boy at least could somehow steal this one man being good shape

[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:26.180]
Being the driver suit in that series. It's serious. Ottawa is choking and gagging again

[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:31.360]
They can't beat any the eagle baby keep him alive and healthy so we can't say that figure a speech either anymore sad

[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:34.280]
He doesn't know his ass from uh from a

[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:41.280]

Random Sandler

[02:21:46.300 --> 02:21:51.940]
He doesn't know his groundhog from a hole in the well whatever it is. I don't know. You just said it. What you just said a

[02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:53.040]
hole

[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:55.520]
5

[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:55.760]
6

[02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:57.380]
7 oh, I mean that's just

[02:21:57.380 --> 02:22:03.000]
Seriously, I can't deal with people in our soul. No look at I mean if you're that nervous about a Duffin curse

[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.800]
You should just go home. Okay. Go home. I have a good time. I can't even imagine what you'd be doing with each other

[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:13.640]
But just go do it. Enjoy it laugh a lot, you know, but uh, oh please

[02:22:14.460 --> 02:22:17.180]
I mean you talk about carrying things to an extreme

And that's my bad. I mean I told you I asked them uh and no man

[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:25.980]

Wednesday, Tuesday, Saturday, no

[02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:34.920]
Right none of these things all we can do is give balls for us

[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:38.620]
And then put the big money to talk very seriously about

[02:22:38.620 --> 02:22:41.280]
Seriously, I thought he was gonna have a stroke this morning

[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:45.120]
He was so like whipped up about this stuff. I mean it's one thing to be enthusiastic about your work

[02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:51.480]
Right, but he takes this stuff into most humorless. I mean like like he's delivering earth shattering news

[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:54.720]
Man, oh man, oh man big

[02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:55.660]

Talk about being in bed together. They give a new meaning to it

[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:17.420]
Which of these people are things you care about the least? I just got to do that

[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:21.740]
Might just want to make sure they understand the poll. They don't get it. No, I think they're starting to get it

[02:23:21.740 --> 02:23:24.660]
You think by Friday they should get a real good

[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:27.840]
I was beginning to getting it Britney's getting real for TV series

[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:31.780]
Is broadcast television ready for Britney Spears? No

[02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:38.920]
Representatives for the pop princess are shopping a reality series featuring backstage footage of her life on tour

[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:43.760]
Now we're sure as hell not gonna have to see it with that little twerp are we?

[02:23:44.460 --> 02:23:48.120]
Or that redneck from Louisiana that she supposedly was married to for about 10 minutes

[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:52.680]
Being pitched with a pun style title on tourage

[02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:56.000]
Or neckhute on to rise I get it. I

[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:03.980]
The series would follow the lives of spears and her fellow dancers on the upcoming European leg of the onyx hotel tour

[02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:07.620]
Her steamy concert series. Oh, I think you can forget about this

[02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:16.800]
On to rise is being described as a cross between MTV's the real world and 1991's Madonna truth or dare

[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:20.980]
Spears would I remember that do you yes and

[02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:25.560]
Well, what the truth are there moving. Yeah bad. Oh, well, what a surprise

[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:31.000]
Spears would narrate even wheeled a digital camera. Oh, I can't even imagine where she'd put that

[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.860]

[02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:38.460]

The six week shoot oh, excuse me

[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:54.620]
The six week shoot would produce six episodes the spears team would hope to have on a year as early as the summer

[02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:58.540]
Presumably providing a boon to the already healthy ticket revenue. She's generating

[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:03.960]
Spac speaking of boon. I think we're more likely to get a reality series featuring Pat Boone and Britney Spears

[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:06.140]
Speaking of boon or maybe Debbie Boone

[02:25:06.860 --> 02:25:11.480]
No word on whether any is a particular network exposed to a deal but the front-mining network will have to act fast

[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:15.960]
Spears European tour kicks off in London April 27 another potential hitch

[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:10.540]
But as an embortion his loyalist realized it would have been foolish to retaliate against Saudi Arabia for the 911 attacks

[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:15.280]
So we occasionally provide funding for attacks upon your country do you mind?

[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:16.080]
Yeah

[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:21.620]

Jack whatever he is

[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:43.280]
I can't believe that he's a golf guy and I just it just is so in it

[02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:45.820]
It's just to make any sense you know

[02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:47.820]
I don't I got friends

[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:50.240]
It would be like if you keep in here one day all dressed up

[02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:55.380]
You know I can lace in nylons and stuff it just you know that would make more sense would it he's a jock right

[02:30:55.380 --> 02:30:57.980]
Oh, that's right he takes showers with other guys

[02:30:57.980 --> 02:31:04.200]
But I mean this idea of a golf oh, it's just so ponderous. It's so boring so hot

[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:06.220]
Right here

[02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:10.120]
Yeah, well, my anywhere when they play when I have the big tournament generally

[02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:15.800]
And like I said Canada the only thing if Mike we're like Mike we didn't make the cut in the masters and that's the end of that

[02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:17.520]
We don't care about any of the rest of it

[02:31:18.160 --> 02:31:20.280]
Work too busy with the stand-up playoffs baby

[02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:23.400]
But he did have a good point yesterday when he's channel surfing

[02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:26.480]
You don't stop on a hockey anymore. That's the NHL's fault. That's Gary Batman

[02:31:26.480 --> 02:31:29.840]
That's Bob Goodenow. That's a bunch of idiots who don't know how to promote their game in this country

[02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:31.980]
I hate to break the news to you boys and girls

[02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:35.040]
But other than a few of the like the original six teams like Boston Detroit

[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:39.300]
New York meaning the Rangers which don't have no team and Chicago which don't have no team

[02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:42.760]
But other than that the hockey strictly a Canadian sport and European

[02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:49.920]
It's a regressing it's making jargon and if they're dumb enough to like I have to lock out next year and have no season

[02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:51.120]
Well, good luck to them

[02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:54.960]
Good luck to them good luck to Rimmer good luck to Jeff Cohen

[02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:59.940]

[02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:04.840]
caffeine-free diet Pepsi to combine say hi. Yeah, I think that would be fine

[02:32:04.840 --> 02:32:08.720]
Just don't bring any food with you. No, but he can bring some caffeine-free diet soda when it comes by tomorrow

[02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:13.660]
That Pepsi not coke. We don't like coke on a show. Oh, no coke Pepsi no coke

[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:16.920]
I think the president though if he had a choose he likes coke

[02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:21.020]
Better than Pepsi. Yeah, and rush. He's a popper. He blows

[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:25.340]

No, seriously, what the hell was that all about? Let me talk about flicker go take a quick run and look out that window out there

[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:52.980]
I mean if this is going on again today, I thought wow, you know, it's just a couple of really bad days

[02:32:52.980 --> 02:32:57.900]
It's my bad luck. I brought the storms in the rain everybody's been telling how beautiful the weather is here and

[02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:03.280]
Yes, they were like 87 degrees first of all way. It's like the summertime already hot human

[02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:07.980]
Partly cloudy. So what the hell was that just us was that an act of God?

[02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:10.600]
Oh, God, oh

[02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:14.240]
A five-year-old girl is in stable condition

[02:33:14.240 --> 02:33:19.620]
The day after she was discovered by highway workers knew the seat of a car crash and killed her mother about 10 days ago

[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:26.720]
Ruby Bustamante survived by drinking Gatorade and eating dried noodles found in the car. This is this is amazing

[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:27.480]
And then

[02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:34.980]
Got till he beat police believe normal Bustamante 26 drove off a highway near Bannon, California about 70 miles east of downtown LA

[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:38.080]
plunging 400 feet over the guardrail to her death

[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.040]
It appears that the crash decollision occurred 10 days ago

[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:46.760]
We're not exactly sure how long it's been we're assuming it's been 10 days because the amount of time that they've been missing

[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:52.980]
Clark said police believe Ruby and her mother reported missing from nearby indio, California

[02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:57.900]
And a bunch of workers found her 150 feet down the steven bankman

[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:03.900]

[02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:06.660]

[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:18.440]
This is pretty weak. This is not what I had in mind when I was born

[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:20.120]
WQA and hello

[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:44.960]

[02:34:55.480 --> 02:35:00.360]
Whatever her name was Sally in the deer field or whatever it was and Evan Tura

[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:05.440]
Don't be a Yentah. It's a very derogatory term and a very accurate one too sweet heart, okay

[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:13.660]
That's the problem that has made South Florida into the pit that it is today with lack of humanity and humility and consideration and decency and

[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:14.440]
friendliness

[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:21.920]
All Jews and all humans have made it what it is today just like Montreal old frogs have made Montreal

[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:26.940]
What it is today? That's why the English speaking people bailing out of Montreal like crazy. Are they yeah?

[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:30.840]
See one thing about Toronto. Guess what they speak English. Oh no

[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:35.080]
Indians Pakistanis Chinese Koreans

[02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:39.840]
Canadians everybody even the frogs have to speak English in Toronto in you. It's

[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:42.360]
Right into it

[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:44.440]

You're not the only one what that finds what what were you gonna say now that that finds that there might be something

[02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:24.960]
Redeeming in Mohawar David that just I don't know I am maybe I'm you're an optimist of the problem is

[02:36:25.380 --> 02:36:30.640]
Obviously that it's like 100th of one percent of him if it was like maybe 10% you say hey

[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:36.520]
He's got a chance maybe if we like try to get along with the better if we go along with this new cold war or hot war

[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:43.540]
What are you know this they taught but it's just too small of a part too small of a you know peace peace

[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:45.760]
Give peace a chance

[02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:55.180]

[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:18.380]
But something that how you're talking and you're talking and now you come down and you're still talking

[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:23.240]
Well, what does that mean? Well, like you know you come down and you bash all these people

[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:27.820]
But you don't you know like I'll play the hide you come down from Toronto. He said he says I'm like

[02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:31.260]
It's really easy to talk from my couple hundred miles away

[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:36.720]
You mean like a twelve hundred miles away? Well, what differences make where you're sitting when you tell what kind of crap is that?

[02:37:37.060 --> 02:37:41.200]
I don't know this I don't know if this cat knows you or whatever but I never heard him in my life have a great day, pal

[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:44.260]
It's really easy to talk from a lot talk about what

[02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:50.420]
What you talking about talk about how their station blows. I guess he's just looking for a little publicity the attention over there because

[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:54.240]
Now that Stern is off big one. Oh six you saw that first week in the train

[02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:57.400]

Buckets of tears in the sales you talk about desperation man. There are numbers. You can't complain about the numbers

[02:38:06.300 --> 02:38:09.440]
They're gonna have because they're not gonna have any resumes everywhere right

[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:13.180]
In fact, they're changing the logo now to not so big

[02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:14.460]
106

[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:18.840]

[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:40.760]
So it's gonna be precipitous because it's gonna include an entire month minus Stern in the morning

[02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:46.980]
Yeah, and i mean i like the guess who and i like uh step and wolf you know what uh enough is enough already

[02:38:46.980 --> 02:38:51.180]

For them to be able to call and say whatever they wanted as long as they want

[02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:29.280]
Nobody calls back to show more than once unless it was like maybe over the years maybe five times if there was some special

I don't like it what people pull that's when I think about a ride

[02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:18.420]
And remember a sprig of mint in the trunk makes that last ride more pleasant and refreshing

[02:53:18.420 --> 02:53:25.040]
Be sure to catch the stew Prano's before they go into the witness redecoration program

[02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:27.960]
128 I can't believe this I hate this place

[02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:35.600]
Nothing works here the medications on work. I've been here for seven years nothing works here

[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:37.460]
I hate this place

[02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:44.840]
Nothing works here the medications on work I've been here for seven years. I hate this place

[02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:49.720]
Nothing works here. I'm sitting here, and I'm kept you know every now and then you glance over the clock

[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:53.540]
You see it's time for another break. I'm thinking when hell is that first break coming already

[02:53:53.540 --> 02:53:56.900]
I'm babbling and bop up up up up on it's been here all day time

[02:53:56.900 --> 02:54:00.420]
I thought you know this has got to be the longest hour I've ever done in my life

[02:54:00.980 --> 02:54:05.520]
I just thought no, we must make it the second hand on a clock, and it's like sitting there

[02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:09.740]
It's not moving any I look at my watch of course I could look at Eric's thing over here's time isn't even close

[02:54:09.740 --> 02:54:10.840]
Well, it's within a few minutes

[02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:16.900]
But I'm looking at my watch and it's 24 after one and the clocks is were all four

[02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:20.500]
Yesterday we ran over the day before it was yesterday, right?

[02:54:20.780 --> 02:54:26.060]
Because the clock was not set the right time. I realized it's a really difficult job and probably it takes all of our crack

[02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:30.020]
Engineering staff to do it but setting our clock to the correct time is really very diffugal

[02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:34.320]
Well, they'd have to come in here. Oh, I see and care where they have to care first and the other number two

[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:39.080]
Which neither cases true. Oh, we got our new TV. You hear it the press there just moment there you go

No one is what the critics say

[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:40.140]
No one is what the critics do

[02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:43.020]
Jesus has had a big day

[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:46.220]
Jesus doing all right

[02:57:46.220 --> 02:57:48.000]
But yeah

Once we're successful and Jesus gets in a spirit time

[02:57:51.660 --> 02:57:53.240]
We're going to put him in a QM lineup to replace

[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:54.120]
Howard from Bocah

[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:54.980]
Anyway, wait till you hear this

[02:57:54.980 --> 02:57:57.720]
Here's the story that you were searching for before

[02:57:58.240 --> 02:57:59.120]
Not a big deal

[02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:03.800]
US warplanes and helicopters firing heavy machine guns rockets and cannons

[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:06.860]
hammered insurgents today in the Beseed City of halluja

[02:58:06.860 --> 02:58:10.620]
And the commander of the US Marines here warned that a fragile truce was near collapse

[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:12.440]
Right

[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:13.520]
We're like

[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.260]
First is near collapse

[02:58:16.900 --> 02:58:18.280]
First we're going to kill some people

[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:19.400]
Then we'll go back to the truce

[02:58:20.020 --> 02:58:22.520]
A rocket hit the Sheraton hotel in central Baghdad

[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:25.640]
Breaking windows but causing no casualties in the heavily guarded compound

[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:27.960]
That houses many foreign contractors and journalists

[02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:31.640]
A second rocket failed to go off was found on the street outside the hotel compound

[02:58:32.300 --> 02:58:35.120]
With officials reporting four more Marines killed

[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:36.820]
The death toll of 87

[02:58:36.820 --> 02:58:39.080]
This is just since I sat down here this morning

[02:58:40.340 --> 02:58:42.680]
The death toll of 87 US troops in April

[02:58:42.680 --> 02:58:45.160]
Made it the deadliest month since the military set foot in Iraq

[02:58:45.160 --> 02:58:49.080]
The truce in fallujah was severely shaken by fighting yesterday and this morning

[02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:53.100]
I will Marines underline their halt to offensive operations was still in effect

[02:58:53.880 --> 02:58:55.740]
Even though of course we got a kill some people

[02:58:58.440 --> 02:58:59.760]
But it's a truce

[02:58:59.760 --> 02:59:01.360]
What kind of like that in the Middle East road map?

[02:59:01.560 --> 02:59:03.960]
The truce all shut you free

[02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:05.080]
I beg your pardon

[02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:06.320]
Uh oh

[02:59:08.200 --> 02:59:08.640]
Wow

[02:59:09.540 --> 02:59:12.600]
I still can't get over that puss that I called here three times

[02:59:13.160 --> 02:59:13.720]
Three times

[02:59:13.720 --> 02:59:14.680]
The former listener?

[02:59:15.140 --> 02:59:17.180]
The former listener the one that we lost like I give a crap

[02:59:17.180 --> 02:59:18.880]
Now you lost that listener

[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:21.780]
Yeah because of the fact that he just don't want to play by the rules

[02:59:21.780 --> 02:59:23.080]
You don't call twice in one day

[02:59:23.080 --> 02:59:25.480]
You said your thing and that was the end of the letter

[02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:26.860]
Let him say his thing you see

[02:59:26.860 --> 02:59:28.600]
I see well I don't want to let him say his thing

[02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:31.140]
I had a little verbal intercourse with him

[02:59:31.140 --> 02:59:33.240]
It's not like I said goodbye immediately which I should have

[02:59:33.860 --> 02:59:36.600]
And that was it when you hear the dial tone that means we move it on

[02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:37.760]
That's the way it works

[02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:41.780]
See freedom of speech is great but freedom of speech and calling a talk sure

[02:59:41.780 --> 02:59:43.960]
Not the same thing no we got to write the call it

[02:59:43.960 --> 02:59:45.460]
That's what the talk yeah right

[02:59:45.460 --> 02:59:49.220]
The constitution doesn't say that you got a certain number of seconds

[02:59:49.780 --> 02:59:52.680]
30 seconds to call it on a talk show and say whatever the hell you want

[02:59:52.680 --> 02:59:57.900]
We're here to entertain the public to amuse to inform to uh whatever we're going to aggravate

[02:59:57.900 --> 03:00:00.440]
That's what we're here for in the fact that aggravated you and very pleased

[03:00:00.440 --> 03:00:01.300]
So bye bye

[03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:02.020]
Are we still listening?

[03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:04.680]
5 6 7 0 5 7

[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:07.320]
It's so sad you just lost the listener

[03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:10.120]
Great great maybe you'll call tomorrow

[03:00:10.680 --> 03:00:12.000]
And tell us that he ain't listening

[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:16.060]
Right 862 votes which of these people or things do you care about least

[03:00:16.060 --> 03:00:19.380]
I don't I think we're ever going to catch up from that time thing from the clock

[03:00:19.380 --> 03:00:20.280]
No it's bizarre

[03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:26.200]
NASCAR 253 Donald Trump 175 horse racing 104

[03:00:57.740 --> 03:01:01.420]
But we should and could have a policy in this country

[03:01:02.140 --> 03:01:04.100]
That made our troops safer

[03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:07.540]
That reduced the cost of the American people

[03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:08.060]
Absolutely

[03:01:08.060 --> 03:01:14.000]
And that had a better chance of success than this president is pursuing today in Iraq

[03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:19.940]
Massachusetts senator as we said is in Harlem talking about the high cost of college obviously talking about Iraq also

[03:01:19.940 --> 03:01:21.980]

[03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:24.900]
He's a Wrangler

[03:01:24.900 --> 03:01:26.400]

22 to 560 see you you learn something today about what was it about the godfather?

[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:47.780]
I learned something about back in the day. Of course, I'm not supposed to know that because of an old fossil

[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:49.800]
And I'm I'm like it's seeps into everything

[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:54.140]
It's oh you can't tell you about seeping but we got back in the day I could tell you about it anymore

[03:01:54.140 --> 03:01:57.000]

That's why they're willing both of us on stage despite our age

[03:03:53.220 --> 03:03:58.440]
To make the sounds of seniors

[03:03:59.700 --> 03:04:07.400]
We broke up in the 70s and now we're nearly 70

[03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:17.240]
Our old voices no longer blend and we are both wearing depends

[03:04:17.240 --> 03:04:27.380]
And we won't have the slightest idea what we've played no hearing aids

[03:04:27.380 --> 03:04:36.660]
To catch the sounds of seniors still lots of rupees come backstage

[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:47.320]
But they all smell like been gay most of them got in the show for free

[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:51.880]

[03:05:13.760 --> 03:05:16.160]
Now this thing is kicking in gear in the hours flying by

[03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:17.600]
I'm serious

[03:05:18.580 --> 03:05:22.660]
That was the most incredible 4.5 minutes of my life that was like actually 24 minutes

[03:05:22.660 --> 03:05:24.780]
That's one of those time distortion experiments I do

[03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:28.220]
I'm sitting here and I kept looking up and I'm thinking wait a minute wait a minute

[03:05:28.620 --> 03:05:30.220]
What's going on over here you know

[03:05:31.380 --> 03:05:34.380]
And I look at my watch and it's almost 125 already

[03:05:34.380 --> 03:05:36.300]
Like swimming in the shore ain't getting closer

[03:05:36.300 --> 03:05:40.480]
Well I'll tell you Duffin clearance you're doing a helmet job keeping this place really in tip-top shape

[03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:42.480]
Keeping everything going it's just a beautiful thing

[03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:43.780]
It's just a lovely thing

[03:05:45.960 --> 03:05:46.360]
560560

[03:05:46.360 --> 03:05:47.560]
Oh I better do this

[03:05:48.460 --> 03:05:51.300]
New reports on US planting WMDs in Iraq

[03:05:51.300 --> 03:05:55.120]
So just keep this in mind it's on our website if you want probably a good idea to print it out

[03:05:55.820 --> 03:05:57.220]
Yeah and keep it handy

[03:05:57.220 --> 03:06:01.440]
So when we get our October surprise September surprise our July surprise

[03:06:01.440 --> 03:06:04.580]
Whenever it's gonna be then you'll say oh I got this story here we know about that

[03:06:05.440 --> 03:06:10.780]
50 days after they were saying that US forces were unloading weapons of assets directly in southern Iraq

[03:06:10.780 --> 03:06:14.280]
The first reports new reports about the movement of these weapons have been disclosed

[03:06:15.540 --> 03:06:19.900]
Sources in Iraq speculate that occupation forces are using the recent unrest in Iraq

[03:06:19.900 --> 03:06:24.960]
To divert attention from their surreptitious shipments of WMD into the country

[03:06:25.500 --> 03:06:30.200]
And Iraqi source posted the Basar governor's office told the MNA that new information shows

[03:06:30.200 --> 03:06:35.180]
That a large part of the WMD which was secretly brought to southern and western Iraq over the past month

[03:06:35.180 --> 03:06:39.660]
Are in containers falsely labeled as containers of the Maresque shipping company

[03:06:39.660 --> 03:06:43.920]
And some consignments bearing the labels of organizations such as the Red Cross or USA

[03:06:43.920 --> 03:06:46.140]
Nor did it disguise them as relief shipments

[03:06:46.140 --> 03:06:49.180]
The source was spoke of course on condition of anonymity

[03:06:50.820 --> 03:06:54.220]
And that Iraqi officials including forces loyal to the Iraqi government castle

[03:06:54.220 --> 03:06:59.540]
Station in southern Iraq have been forbidden from inspecting or supervising the transportation of these consignments

[03:06:59.540 --> 03:07:00.760]
I can't imagine why

[03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:07.380]
He went on to say that the occupation forces boarded Iraqi officials to forward any questions on the issue of the coalition forces

[03:07:07.380 --> 03:07:11.280]
Even the officials of the international relief organizations have informed the Iraqi officials

[03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:16.440]
They would only accept responsibility for relief shipments which have been registered and managed by their organizations

[03:07:17.220 --> 03:07:24.360]
The Iraqi source also confirmed a report about suspicious trucks with fake Saudi injured Indian license plates entering Iraq at night last week

[03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:31.540]
Extressing that the Saudi injured Indian border guards did not attempt to inspect the trucks but simply delivered them to the US and British forces stationed under Iraq's borders

[03:07:31.540 --> 03:07:38.400]
However, the source expressed expressed ignorance whether the governments of Saudi may be injured and were aware of such movement

[03:07:38.940 --> 03:07:40.860]
Right, we don't know no boxes

[03:07:40.860 --> 03:07:44.480]
No, we don't know no Saudis or Jordanians, we don't have no deal with them Arabs

[03:07:45.460 --> 03:07:46.380]
How do you like that?

[03:07:46.380 --> 03:07:51.420]
I hope that stories like that come out every even if they're not true just in case you know what I mean?

[03:07:51.480 --> 03:07:54.040]
Mm-hmm, just in case they decide to try to play fast and loose

[03:07:54.980 --> 03:07:59.160]
Because well over a year later if they ain't found nothing yet believe you me there was nothing there in the first place

[03:07:59.160 --> 03:08:04.980]
And all the other inspectors said there was nothing there from Hans Blix and Scott Witter and just about everybody else

[03:08:04.980 --> 03:08:06.420]
Oh there's a lot to win

[03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:08.100]
I'm sorry, I forgot about that

[03:08:09.140 --> 03:08:17.440]
Once you've been smitten observers, Ojohn Prabhakar to go in 5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 6 the on the AT and T line WQA and hello

[03:08:33.480 --> 03:08:42.140]
And as far as the weapons of mass destruction being found that's why we're talking about the turkey farm last night when they found some stuff in Libya

[03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:44.380]
So, um, it's all BS

[03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:46.060]
Okay thanks for the good news

[03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:50.240]

[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:50.540]
Right

[03:08:51.280 --> 03:08:54.100]
I wonder if they're feeding the same drugs to them they were to Gaddafi

[03:08:54.100 --> 03:08:57.780]
This is his head still spinning around like a dreidel wow

[03:08:57.780 --> 03:08:59.760]
He even makes a bone head boy look bad

WQA and hello

[03:09:02.680 --> 03:09:04.140]
Hey Neil, yes sir

[03:09:04.140 --> 03:09:08.840]
Last night just listening to it, it's some of the lot in sports that we're going to attack Iraq

[03:09:09.940 --> 03:09:10.300]
Yeah

[03:09:10.980 --> 03:09:14.660]
The question they should have asked is was some of the lot in Iraq?

[03:09:15.220 --> 03:09:18.180]
Hey well listen when most of the lady comes back we're going to go in to Mexico man

[03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:22.380]
We're going to go ahead and then beeners because they don't fight back too good they got a lot of gas

[03:09:23.580 --> 03:09:26.020]
It only took 600 and knocked them all over

[03:09:26.020 --> 03:09:30.140]
I was thinking about beans the other day what that was I thinking about like the about beans

[03:09:30.140 --> 03:09:30.520]
Mental?

[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:32.020]
No no about beans

[03:09:32.780 --> 03:09:36.820]
All of this beans with beans and about gas I don't know we fried

[03:09:36.820 --> 03:09:41.320]
Oh I must have been about that pigment or story how come we can't just use beans to make gas

[03:09:42.980 --> 03:09:44.000]
We could technically

[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:44.580]
Right

[03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:47.080]
It should be a hell of a lot of it

[03:09:47.080 --> 03:09:48.500]
And your car then and your pants

[03:09:49.100 --> 03:09:49.460]
Yeah

[03:09:49.460 --> 03:09:53.880]
Maybe that'll be our poll question mark where would you rather have the most gas in your pants or in your gas tank

[03:09:54.520 --> 03:09:55.000]
Cheap

[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.720]

[03:09:57.720 --> 03:10:02.240]
And of course your people down here all the Julio is down here of all varieties and shapes and sizes

[03:10:02.240 --> 03:10:03.380]
Too many beans

[03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:05.280]
Refried beans

[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:07.120]
Oh much less than that

[03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:08.980]
What the brief refried beans

[03:10:08.980 --> 03:10:11.440]
No but nevertheless beans and rice

Mm-hmm they make you fart your brains out and they make you a gay yeah

[03:10:27.980 --> 03:10:31.160]
That is not that explains that whole Hispanic problem we got down here

Oh baby I was smashed when we wed

[03:12:28.820 --> 03:12:33.420]
So I don't know if it was consummated

[03:12:33.420 --> 03:12:39.340]
And I might lose half my money

[03:12:39.340 --> 03:12:43.700]
Cause I didn't sign up right now

[03:12:43.700 --> 03:12:48.760]
I told my lawyers I got drunk again

[03:12:49.420 --> 03:12:51.380]
I was half in the bed

[03:12:51.380 --> 03:12:55.820]
Thought he was just in oh baby baby

[03:12:55.820 --> 03:12:58.620]
Oops I said that I do

[03:12:59.420 --> 03:13:01.060]
I had too much to

[03:13:01.060 --> 03:13:01.320]
Oh

[03:13:03.060 --> 03:13:05.500]
I can't hold my liquor

[03:13:05.500 --> 03:13:08.660]
Oops I got drunk again

[03:13:08.660 --> 03:13:11.240]
Last time I did that

[03:13:11.240 --> 03:13:13.200]
I kissed Madonna

[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:15.860]
Oh baby baby

[03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:19.140]
Oops I popped a few chords

[03:13:19.140 --> 03:13:20.720]

[03:13:25.780 --> 03:13:28.120]

[03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:29.720]
That could be quite duple on thunder

[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:31.120]
I think we better examine her

[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:32.460]
Let's have a meeting about her what do you say

[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:36.200]
Let's have a great discussion about that

[03:13:36.200 --> 03:13:38.120]
Hours and hours of a gnashing of teeth

[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:39.760]
And gnashing of long teeth of course

[03:13:40.460 --> 03:13:41.540]
So that's pretty interesting

[03:13:41.540 --> 03:13:43.940]
We also learned that about your gums get shorter

[03:13:43.940 --> 03:13:44.880]
They recede

[03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:48.340]
So what happens when you get to be like a hundred years old

[03:13:48.340 --> 03:13:49.780]
And you have your own real teeth

[03:13:50.820 --> 03:13:52.060]
You look really scary

[03:13:52.060 --> 03:13:53.100]
You look like James Coburn

[03:13:53.100 --> 03:13:54.380]
They must be fangs

[03:13:54.380 --> 03:13:56.240]

[03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:00.020]
Well that sounds bad

[03:14:00.020 --> 03:14:01.960]
I mean if he would look to be a much longer

[03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:04.160]
His teeth would have been down to his pupic

[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:05.720]
How deep could his voice get

[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:07.640]
James Coburn

[03:14:07.640 --> 03:14:08.340]
I don't know

[03:14:09.340 --> 03:14:11.140]

[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:25.500]

[03:14:39.480 --> 03:14:40.520]
Israel 96

[03:14:41.540 --> 03:14:42.640]
Don't care about Israel

[03:14:42.640 --> 03:14:44.360]
That's shameful probably go him

[03:14:44.900 --> 03:14:46.320]
Arnold Palmer 88

[03:14:46.320 --> 03:14:48.000]
Speaking of go him Arnold Palmer

[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:50.920]
Arnie he's not gonna be playing where the green jacket ever again

[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:53.500]
He probably wears one of the old ones

[03:14:53.500 --> 03:14:54.680]
One of the old moldy

[03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:56.660]
Like Ricky Tiki in his cap you know

[03:14:57.640 --> 03:14:59.380]
Although we like Ricky Tiki with his cap

[03:14:59.380 --> 03:15:01.180]
We don't like Arnold Palmer not on this show

[03:15:01.180 --> 03:15:02.840]
He's a crusty old golf hole

[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:03.400]
Is what he is
