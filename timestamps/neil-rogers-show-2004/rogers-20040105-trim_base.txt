[00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.840]
It's Monday.

[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.340]
Oh God Friday sits so far away.

[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.160]
Here I'm trapped in this office to stay.

[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.920]
I feel like crap, cause it's Monday.

[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.240]
I'm a huff huff huff huff huff huff huff huff huff huff huff huff huff huff huff.

[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.660]
You still need that you love my eyes,

[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.340]
But I know that you keep on taking up my mind.

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.680]
I'll play you cause I'm very good.

[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.600]
Check out my rest, they're poking on my butt, semi-eat.

[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.920]
You come onto me, I'm just putting things in my ears.

[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.040]
And it sounds so far,

[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.120]
But if you wanna take me, you're slow.

[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.800]
There's things about me, I don't think you know.

[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.940]
I'm underage.

[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.920]
All right.

[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.260]
Hey Grave,

[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.620]
You and your friend on me.

[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.820]
She's 25, but she's just a thief.

[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.600]
Perfectly, I've been my last three.

[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.160]
Daddy called the cops last night.

[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.780]
You're my best off perfect, you see.

[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.020]
Because I have surgery.

[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.740]
I'm a monster, which money?

[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.400]
My blood just ain't right now.

[00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.180]
Rack them.

[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.140]
She's so very rich.

[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.560]
She'll face you.

[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.980]
That's 25, you should be scared of her.

[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.860]
Yeah, the matter of all things,

[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.020]
Don't spread later, look, die, no, die.

[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.840]
What is that?

[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.760]
She's 25, she's 25, but she's just a thief.

[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.280]
Instead of a day of mourning,

[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.700]
It's a day of celebration for every head of her sexual male

[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.680]
on the face of the earth, because Brittany got married,

[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.060]
But the good news is, she got it in no way.

[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.120]
Like almost immediately, she just had a little bit too much to drink.

[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.960]
Little drinky poo here, another little drinky poo there.

[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.480]
Again?

[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.820]
Again, she has a problem.

[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.260]
Maybe she's hanging out with a book girl.

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.100]
Maybe she's hanging it out with them.

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.920]
They ain't no problem.

[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.400]
Anyway, here's the New York Post for the great picture.

[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.540]
Did you check it out on the web?

[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.980]
No.

[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.820]
You should right now, go workpost.com.

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.680]
Trust me, all of it is only black and white.

[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.220]
That's okay.

[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.480]
She looks pretty good right there.

[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.520]
Talk about quicky weddings.

[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.700]
It says only hours after exchanging vows

[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.820]
at a Vegas wedding chapel Saturday morning,

[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.320]
Brittany Spears had her new hubby, childhood pal Jason Allen Alexander,

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.100]
arranged to have their marriage annulled,

[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.680]
one of Spears Reps confirmed yesterday.

[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.120]
It was the old inn and out.

[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.400]
The 22 year olds met with the Vegas lawyer Saturday afternoon

[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.800]
to begin hammering out their split.

[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.220]
Then George Maloof, Jr., Spears Close.

[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.680]
Spears close friend,

[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.200]
and the well connected owner of the Palm Scacino Hotel,

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.880]
took over arranging for a buddy judge in town

[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.520]
to sign the papers that same evening,

[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.660]
a source told the post.

[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.460]
Did you see the picture yet?

[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.140]
I'm on it now.

[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.160]
She looks pretty good.

[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.080]
The whole ordeal was over by six o'clock Saturday night,

[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.020]
less than 13 hours after Spears decked in a baseball cap

[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.000]
and grungy jeans had walked down the aisle on the arm

[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.760]
of a Palm's limo driver to marry her handsome six foot

[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.280]
tube pal from Cantwood, Louisiana,

[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.100]
at the little white chapel, a wedding chapel at 5.30

[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.900]
in the morning with source set.

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.220]
I know exactly where that is.

[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.060]
Don't you?

[00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.540]
No.

[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.920]
Is that where you got married?

[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.980]
I got married at the Wee Kirk of the Heather Wedding Chapel in Vegas.

[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.580]
I see.

[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.360]
It wasn't clear if the couple had consummated their union.

[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.060]
Isn't that...

[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.880]
It wasn't clear if they had consummated the union.

[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.180]
Maybe they'd like to see the evidence.

[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.660]
Could we please see the evidence?

[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.240]
Yeah.

[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.740]
Still there were apparently no hard feelings

[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.440]
after the marriage's quick dissolution.

[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.140]
You notice all of that hard feelings solution?

[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.880]
All of the things.

[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.600]
Yeah.

[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.000]
Oh wait till the next program.

[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.060]
The peer reportedly dined with a few pounds of the Palm's steak

[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.680]
how shortly after signing the annulment.

[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.000]
The annulment means the marriage never legally happened

[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.180]
in bars, both parties.

[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.600]
I think you'll love this.

[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.560]
Bar is both parties from grabbing each other's assets.

[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.240]
Correct them.

[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.040]
I love it.

[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.340]
Leave it to the post baby.

[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.600]
They're hyperventilating their psychotic over Brittany's assets.

[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.480]
I got a color picture over here.

[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.320]
Do you?

[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.760]
Yeah.

[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.880]
Oh that's right.

[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.300]
I had a color picture too, but my own got a black and white printer.

[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.380]
Like I said, she looks pretty good.

[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.800]
I'll take you.

[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.420]
She looks glowing right there, especially with that crucifix on her around her.

[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.160]
In fact, I don't see any chain.

[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.480]
Do you?

[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.380]
Maybe it's just like glued on her thing.

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.440]
It's stuck on you.

[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.060]
But while it ended, what has to be one of the shortest celebrity unions on record?

[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.560]
Speculation over what led Spirits to suddenly what has only just begun?

[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.100]
It says.

[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.820]
They said Spirits have been drinking a lot over the holidays.

[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.020]
Disponded over relatively poor sales of her in the zone album.

[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.960]
In the zone.

[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.800]
You know, even Dr. Ankins is singing that tune.

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.840]
He's changed his tune.

[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.720]
Wait till we get into the spot, man.

[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.900]
I can't wait.

[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.180]
I might give them a free spot for balance for like just because of what it says about.

[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.800]
Even Dr. Ankins is changing his tune.

[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.400]
Yeah.

[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.340]
He's gone.

[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.200]
I love the note like that.

[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.300]
Wow.

[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.100]
Some posts the Spirits deny such claims insisting a related album is selling well

[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.280]
that the pop tart doesn't drink to excess.

[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.840]
But one I wouldn't have said Spirits was so smashed on champagne New Year's Eve allegations

[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.100]
a rep and Maloof deny that she had to be carried up from the rain nightclub to

[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.580]
were palm sweet by bodyguards.

[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.100]
Other sources said Spirits was also boozing it up at the Palm's club Ghost Bar in the

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.120]
wee hours before she and Alexander laughing and giggling hopped into a lime green limo

[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.080]
and drove to two wedding chapels that were closed before they landed that little white wedding

[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.940]
got emerged license and said I do.

[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.040]
She said something like oh wouldn't it be funny if we got married.

[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.280]
Oh let's just go and do it a friend told a London son but then it turned into oh my God.

[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.800]
Oh my God.

[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.660]
What have I done?

[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.900]
Suddenly was a joke that went a wee bit too far.

[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.960]
Those close to Spirits are adamant the single was not drunk that night and said the wedding was a lar.

[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.260]
A spoke a spoke woman for Jive records Spirits labeled say yesterday miss Spirits and Mr.

[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.000]
Alexander a file for an element which will become official today.

[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.300]
Lick a recite some sources also believe that Spirits study of cabala.

[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.140]
What is that it's Jewish mysticism don't you.

[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.080]
Cabala cabala right right a Jewish mystical practice introduced to her by pal Madonna may have

[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.460]
something to do with her choice to ring in the new year with a new ring.

[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.240]
Cabala which places emphasis on marriage and family could have only been seen by Spirits

[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.000]
a chance to settle down and start a new source to said but if that was your dream it was short

[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.380]
to say.

[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.200]

airport he wasn't very chatty he's been through a lot and he didn't have much to say.

[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.580]
Meanwhile sure lot Richards in the owner of the chapel where the two were married has been offered a million

[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.540]
dollars by two tabloids for the wedding video tape according to an article today's Las Vegas son.

[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.240]

Hey, nobody cares about that.

[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.620]
Why does what somebody faxes that crap?

[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.800]
Just another shot at poor Rosanna Dana.

[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.340]

Who is the most over and by the way, today starts the arrest of our life.

[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.220]

[00:13:59.220 --> 00:13:59.620]
Absolutely.

[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.600]
Who is the most overrated major celebrity of all time?

[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.000]
Now you notice major celebrity.

[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.520]
Don't be coming in with like a little marginal people at nobody ever heard of.

Major celebrity of all time.

[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.540]

[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.880]
sex, sex, sex, sex.

[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.120]
He's still like temporary, right?

[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:55.660]
Yeah.

[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:56.980]
Is that what he told you?

[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.680]
Why can't anybody, I asked these questions,

[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.120]
and nobody can give me a straight answer to anything.

[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.200]
Because I don't have a straight answer.

[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.400]
It's temporary for the time being.

[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.620]
Well, what did he tell you?

[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.640]
He said that you spoke to him, right?

[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.380]
He said, well, while supplies last,

[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.240]
void in the last gun, why?

[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.040]
He said they're trying it out for me.

[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.500]
Yeah?

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.760]
Like, neither party is convinced, but so far so good.

[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.960]
So in other words, again, two contradictory statements.

[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.280]
So far so good.

[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.100]
No, no, that doesn't make any sense.

[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.840]
If it's so far so good, then why wouldn't anybody be convinced?

[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.760]
So in other words, it's still in there's still the size.

[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.480]
So far so good.

[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.580]
But both parties know that they're both, you know,

[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.820]
gigantic egos.

[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.180]
Yeah.

[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.140]
And probably it can work.

[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.240]
Something like that.

[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.240]
In addition to which we're all already looking for another job.

[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.000]
Like I said, Friday, this is the only person I've ever known

[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.620]
in a business much less worked with, who the minute he starts

[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.900]
to job, he's looking for another one.

[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.820]
Probably because I guess he knows, huh?

[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.980]
But anyway, that's the update on Farrell.

[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.080]
We need some new names for this pool today.

[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.040]
Who is the most overrated major celebrity of all time?

[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.740]
Oprah is off to the races now.

[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.580]
She's got 16 that cross-eyed Jew bitch Barbara Streinshands got nine.

[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.100]
See, the reason Oprah, I wouldn't vote for her.

[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:12.960]
I voted for James Dean.

[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.620]
You want to know why?

[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.300]
I, uh, yeah.

[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.180]
Even though Oprah has absolutely no talent.

[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.700]
At least she's been on TV for what?

[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.440]
How many years now?

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.460]
About third, man.

[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.120]
A long time.

[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.560]
She sustained that phony activist, whatever it is.

[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.120]
She's kept those mesmerized housewives out there,

[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.480]
buying the book she's peddling, and all the other crap

[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.920]
that she's doing under those pastel backgrounds, you know.

[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.820]
But James Dean made three movies in a year, got killed.

[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.780]
See what I'm saying?

[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.260]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:35.620]
Good point.

[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.080]
See the difference?

[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T now.

[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.720]
And what I see, line nine, ringing, that's not a good sign.

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.260]
To start the official new year.

[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.040]
WDQA and line nine.

[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.580]
Hello.

[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.960]
I don't even hear like anything.

[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.320]
No, the pot on is the phone pot on.

[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.300]
Josh says yes.

[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.040]
I'll just program press.

[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.600]
There everything.

[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.740]
WQA.

[00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.000]
Hello.

[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:00.860]
Okay.

[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.260]
There he is.

[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.300]
Like I said, there's a good start.

[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.220]
There it is.

[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.600]
I said again, siphoning up from South Florida all the way up here

[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.140]
where we got a little snow on the ground by the way.

[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.180]
In case cash can over is listed.

[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5.

[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.140]
I'd like to take a two by four and just beat that,

[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.960]
that asshole silly, you know what, wouldn't you?

[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:16.800]
There's a list.

[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.680]
Just beat the pulp the addout of his list.

[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.460]
Come in to QA and hello.

[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.700]
Here's how we knew you.

[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.180]
And happy new year to you, sir.

[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.860]
The Michael Jackson interview you were talking about.

[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:31.440]
That's got more drops in it for your show that you won't even need to go anywhere else for another drop.

[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.320]
There's so many good.

[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.740]
Did you hear the interview with him, Mike Wallace?

[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.360]
So that's a week ago yesterday.

[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.780]
Did you hear the lady said, when the guy said, are you going to share it with the bag?

[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.240]
He goes, of course.

[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.340]
You can play that, of course, over and over.

[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:46.960]
Okay, thank you.

[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.320]
Thank you.

[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.820]
There's another amateur program director wants to tell us what to do.

[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.960]
It's old, old, stale news, okay?

[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:52.820]
It's old stuff.

[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.780]
For the 60 minutes piece of week ago.

[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.920]
And it wasn't, it was head Bradley.

[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.360]
And while they look alike, a little bit.

[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.580]
Only the shade has been changed to protect the wrinkles.

[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.860]
Come on.

[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.500]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.100]
Line one, I guess, is not working again.

[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.520]
The dots on?

[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.180]
No, but I got to press now.

[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.400]
It's not doing anything just like Friday.

[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.600]
Line one is not working again.

[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.320]
You know, I want to say it one more time.

[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.820]
I don't want to start getting all of that out of shape.

[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.600]
It's the 5th of January, okay?

[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.640]
Everybody, and I mean everybody, including me,

[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.540]
we had a nice long holiday, a chance to recharge our batteries,

[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.500]
a chance to like re-examine life.

[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.660]
It's all over.

[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080]
All of that is over.

[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.400]
I thought it was over Friday and silly me come to find out.

[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.600]
It wasn't over Friday at all.

[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.100]
No.

[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.440]
But now there's been another weekend.

[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.240]
Now here we are.

[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:41.940]
It's so official.

[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.760]
Today is the beginning.

[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.480]
We look at the lineup.

[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.880]
We got most of the people in place.

[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.300]
This is the way it is.

[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.440]
And yet, at that place, all we have is a bunch of people

[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.020]
wandering around looking for a reason to be there.

[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.080]
Like Muff, for example, comes in this morning for about four seconds.

[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.840]
How about Clarence or Muff?

[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.220]
Get somebody, one of our vast engineering staff, online one.

[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.820]
So we get at least the phones working for the new year would be nice.

[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.020]
That could be your New Year's resolution, Clarence, is do something.

[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.620]
That would be nice.

[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.660]
Now speaking of doing something,

[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:19.220]
there had to be a whole different bunch of reasons why those British Air Flight 223s were cancelled.

[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.180]
The one that I find most fascinating is from the Mirror UK.

[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.660]
It says a British Airways flight to Washington was cancelled at the last minute yesterday.

[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.800]
And let's see, this was January the 3rd, which is 7th.

[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.620]
That's the one on Friday.

[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.960]
On Friday, after an intelligence tip off that a woman's suicide bomb

[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.900]
or plane to blow up the plane over the US Capitol,

[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.780]
have you heard anything about this prior to this story?

[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.400]
No, nothing.

[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.520]
He told me this morning.

[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:43.960]
Okay.

[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.800]
It was the 3rd day running that a major security scare

[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.820]
had hit the afternoon flight to 233 service from Heathrow to Washington.

[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.680]
They were also saying that the somebody British Air pilots were refusing to fly

[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.460]
with the armed sky marshals on the plane.

[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.940]
So there's a hundred different, I like this one the best though.

[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.140]
US security services told Scotland Yard the woman almost certainly linked to Al-Qaeda

[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.180]
intended to hide 8 to 12 ounces of plastic explosive in her vagina.

[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.220]
Like the vagina.

[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.940]
Nothing could be finer than to stick some in your vagina.

[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.120]
She would then go to the turret during the Boeing 747 flight,

[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.600]
remove the material and detonate a blast that would down the aircraft.

[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.860]
A senior Scotland Yard source told the Daily Mirror,

[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.200]
smuggling a bomb onto a plane by this method is one of our worst nightmares.

[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.000]
If you don't have specific information about the suspect,

[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.080]
it would be impossible to carry out an intimate body search of every female passenger.

[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.500]
How about just the broken ones?

[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:33.740]

[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:34.140]
Yeah.

[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.100]
In addition to which, like I said to you this morning,

[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.860]
that is only a part of the small part, so to speak of the problem.

[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.740]
Because how about the male passengers could hide it in their...

[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:44.860]
Right.

[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.480]
...in their some other orifice.

[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.060]
But that just doesn't make any sense to me,

[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.940]
because if they're just going to blow up the planes in mid-air,

[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.480]
I mean, you know, they would have a certain impact,

[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.200]
but that's evidently not what they want to do.

[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.920]
They want to take over the planes and use them as flying bombs again, so...

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.700]
So there you go.

[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.880]
Believe whichever story assutes your fancy, okay?

[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.200]
Whichever one you find most exciting, like the one about the explosive vagina.

[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.040]
1027, in fact, if you put that one together with the Britney story and, you know,

[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:10.800]
huh?

[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.460]
Yeah, I think then you got something.

[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.060]
If you've got something wrong with your car,

[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.220]
here's the place to take it.

[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.640]
EF Taren Autor Repair, you'll find them at 5083 North Federal Highway,

[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.920]
just a mile and a half north of Sanford Road in prestigious Pompeo Beach.

[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.760]
And EF Taren Autor Repair experienced the difference that experience makes.

[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.080]
All EF mechanics are ASC certified technicians, in other words, they know their stuff.

[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.700]
They're current with all the latest technology, and most of these guys have been with the EF team for almost 20 years.

[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.980]
The EF team is over 200 combined years of experience,

[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.380]
so to make a long story short, should they know their stuff?

[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:41.720]
What?

[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.140]
No job is too big or too small.

[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:49.380]
EF from a blown fuse to a blow engine, from a 73 to an a to an 0-04 Bentley EF Taren Autor Repair, do it all.

[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.000]
All their jobs are meticulously double-checked for accuracy by the shop foreman.

[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.540]
EF Taren Autor Repair is cleaned upon completion of the work too.

[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.620]
EF honors most extended warranties, doctors, you evaluate service, and most repairs too.

[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.860]
EF Taren Autor Repair that address again is 5083 North Federal Highway in Papua,

[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.540]
which is called 954-4269926.

[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.880]
That's 954-4269926, when you call them, be sure to ask about their 90 days,

[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.540]
same as cash, no interest credit card.

[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:21.420]
EF Taren Autor Repair naturally recognizes one of the most successful automotive repair facilities

[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.900]
anywhere in the Italian USA.

[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.540]
In EF their motto is, nobody cares, more than nobody will work harder to earn your business.

[00:26:46.540 --> 00:27:03.640]
That's it!

[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.020]

[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.620]
Hey, real fuck you.

[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:39.900]

Hey, real fuck you.

[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.420]
Hey, real fuck you.

[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:42.580]

[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:42.580]

[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:42.580]

[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.260]
Hey, real fuck you.

[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:43.900]
Hey, real fuck you.

[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:43.900]

[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:43.900]

[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.060]
Hey, real fuck you.

[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:49.680]
Frank Sinatra 4, Johnny Carson 3, Neil Diamond 2, and Dick Clark just went up.

[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.820]
He just popped it up there.

[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.420]
How's keeper Denyze Limbaugh Blackmail charge?

[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.480]
I just still I'm just blown away by the fact that that was Chronic Joe.

[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.140]
Why?

[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.940]
Because I just can't believe that he would have the balls to become.

[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.840]
I guess he was just going to say something to you off the ear.

[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.300]
He certainly wasn't going to talk to me.

[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.500]
Maybe that's what he said.

[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:08.580]
He thought he was, huh?

[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.680]
That must be it.

[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.000]
WQAM Chronic Joe line.

[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.980]
He said something to you off the ear.

[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:13.840]
Hello.

[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.040]
Hello.

[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:17.420]
Yes, he's the name?

[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:18.580]
Speaking.

[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.380]
Neil.

[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.020]
Yes.

[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.380]
You need to give me some more of more.

[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.160]
Up to this more and more.

[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.980]
He said, um, nearly sandwiched between a big dog and a mad dog.

[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.000]
He called you dog piss.

[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.520]
Yeah.

[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.800]
Good one.

[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.660]
567.0560.

[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.580]
£560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.880]
I'm really pissed about that.

[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.080]
WQAM, hello.

[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.120]
Hello?

[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.320]
Hey, Neil.

[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.520]
I got two for you.

[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.480]
OK, go right ahead.

[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.480]
Jerry Louis.

[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.860]
I only do one, but because the audience is so slow going.

[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.100]
And Jerry Louis and Jim Carrey.

[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.520]
They both suck.

[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.000]
Jim Carrey sucks?

[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.840]
Yeah, he's got my three good movies.

[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:00.640]
OK.

[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.420]
I'll put them on there.

[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.800]
Thanks a lot, Palli, you two.

[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:04.460]
Have a good new year.

[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.500]
Jerry Louis and Jim Carrey, I know I'm not going to make any comment.

[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.680]
We're asking you the question and whatever your opinion is fine, right?

[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:12.480]
Right.

[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.820]
I mean, Jim Carrey is so, who are we'd argue?

[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:16.600]
Right.

[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.480]
Even though we may think that you're full of crap.

[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.700]
They had some old Jerry Louis and he Martin movies on a few days ago here.

[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.340]
Yeah.

[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.280]
They look at the link.

[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.920]
And he was annoying.

[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:26.540]
Yeah.

[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:30.400]
There was one where he had the little animals who was playing a veterinarian or something.

[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.380]
Do you know what that movie was?

[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:32.980]
I don't know.

[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.420]
Be sure and miss it.

[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.340]
But anyway, he was very annoying then.

[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.440]
And then he came a lot more into it and then his face blew all up.

[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.820]
And he was doing those telephones and lady, yeah, with the flagol and the smigol.

[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.440]
I thought it was funny like when I was seven.

[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:49.520]
Yeah, right.

[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.000]
Housekeeper Deny's limbaugh blackmail charge.

[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:53.980]
She don't think it's funny.

[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.360]
This is in the inquirer so we know this has to be the emis.

[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:05.800]
Rush Limbaugh's long time drug supplier Wilma Klein has angrily denied his lawyers claim that she and her husband tried to blackmail the conservative talk show host.

[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.180]
And let me just interject again.

[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.380]
It sure is very, very peculiar how long it took before all of a sudden they came up with that cock-a-mainly deal.

[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:19.320]
In fact, it was long after his rehab that all of a sudden they decided to concoct this story about all that were trying to blackmail him for $4 million.

[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.920]
Well, the strategy team had to concoct all of these.

[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:22.600]
I see.

[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.940]
Just like the Michael Jackson thing about him getting beaten up.

[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.780]
And is it germane to the case?

[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.740]
We got more Michael Jackson stuff from the inquirer too.

[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.520]
Have no fear.

[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:30.980]
All right.

[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.280]
The inquirer is here.

[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:45.240]
Anyway, it goes on to say Wilma Rush's former housekeeper spoke out as a judge in West Palm Beach dealt Limbaugh 53 a major blow by ruling that his medical records could be of zimmed by prosecutors as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.

[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:56.280]
It was the second setback for Limbaugh and 24 hours earlier as spokesman for his radio network revealed that behind the scenes his attorneys were trying to work out a plea bargain on charges of

[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.960]
factor shopping for pain pills, a former prescription fraud.

[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:10.600]
As the embelled radio pundit fought to keep his medical records secret as nationally known attorney Roy Black made the stunning claim that Wilma 42 and her husband David demanded $4 million to keep his

[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.480]
Pulidiction secret.

[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:19.100]
Blackmail has never crossed our minds who went to the authorities because we finally decided it was the right thing to do a shocked Wilma told the inquirer.

[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:39.740]
And a attorney Ed Shohad told the inquirer the clients absolutely absolutely deny any allegation of blackmail they turned over hundreds of emails and phone recordings to the prosecutors in which Rush Limbaugh never once referred to being blackmail or even implied that there was any pressure being brought on him whatsoever rather he was only interested in getting his hands on more pills.

[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:51.740]
The inquirer revealed in a world-exclusive story in October that in 2002 after Rush Limbaugh talked for the second time he sent his attorney to Wilma's home to pay her the 80 grand the odor for supplies of illegal painkillers.

[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:59.780]
Four months later, Wilma told prosecutors she was called to the attorney's office, had another check for 100 grand and asked never to supply him with pills again.

[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:12.160]
On both occasions, the attorney demanded that she sign a promissory note to make the money look like a loan said attorney Shohad, he claims he's been blackmailed, and he forces the supposed blackmailers to sign a promissory note doesn't make sense.

[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:20.340]
Limbaugh is desperately trying to deflect attention from what he did onto the clients but his own paperwork is going to refute his allegation said Shohad.

[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.960]
Ready for that? Shohad? Shohad? Shohad.

[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:30.500]
Free it on. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on EAT and C and Verizon wireless line.

[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:41.620]
Who is the most overrated major celebrity of all time, Oprah 37, Barbara Streisand 18, James Dean 14, and Celia Cruz 11, Shaman Hughes for Picket on Celia Cruz.

[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:48.740]
In fact, Celia is going to make tomorrow's poll too. Two in a row. Line nine is always my favorite. Line nine, QAM.

[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:54.820]
Here, rush is a little overrated. WQAM. Hola.

[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:15.620]
Hey. Yes, sir. What's going on? How you doing? I'm doing great. Good to talk to you, man. Hey, you know what? Don't change a damn thing. This is good like this. Right now. This is what we want. This is the old Neil Rogers show. More on calling the show. You deal with the morons and tell them to get the hell off. This is beautiful.

[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:33.460]
That's right. This is what we want, man. I make me laugh with it. This is what you're going to get a lot more in 2004 and any of these political professional talk show groupie listeners who think that we're going to do like political heavy duty light bulb radio here. They can blow it right out their ass. You know what? I don't want to hear it because you know what?

[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:44.240]
I don't agree with you in a lot of the political views. This is what I've got to listen for is the party. Why don't you hear what the agree or not? But basically it's preaching to the choir anyway. So that's the point. I totally agree with you 100%.

[00:35:44.760 --> 00:36:13.800]
Amen. Go on the right track. Keep it going. Okay. And Bush is an asshole. Well, I mean, I had to get that in there. Well, huh? Just for him. Right. He's a mental defective. The president, but this guy don't agree. And that's his that's his prerogative. He can still do that as of now. Of course, in a few months, you may not be able to have a different opinion. Anyway, what do we got on here so far? We got 97 votes and about what? And about 20. That's not bad. We're starting to get there. We want to see if we have any audience back there after the November trend was just suicidal for us.

[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:20.260]
You people with the diaries, man, you really stuck it right in our. You're not fooling me because I know how the game works. Okay. I know how it's played.

[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:43.600]
Must have had maybe more got some of his boyfriend, including maybe maybe chronic Joe that called before maybe he got a couple of diaries. And didn't he show us two colors or what? Right. What did he say? He said a few you. He said few you when he found out it was me. So he's still listening right now. Well, in this thing with Pete Rose, I am so sick. It's hard to hear about. Freakin Pete Rose who admits finally that he gambled on baseball.

[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:52.140]
The man is a scumbag. He's a scumbag. DeGenerate gambler asked anybody who works at any of the subfloat attracts and they'll tell you what a scumbag he is.

[00:36:52.700 --> 00:37:03.420]
Not just a chronic gambler, but a scumbag. So now that he finally admits after a lion for 14 years, he finally admits, oh, yeah, in his autobiography, he gambled on baseball. Now that's good reason to let him in a hall of fame.

[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:11.220]
Before I was ready to let him in a hall of fame. If we're going to come to me and ask me, should we do when I was going to say, oh, yes, sure. He was a great player.

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.260]
How to put him in a hall of shame. He's right in there with somebody else. We know if he keeps my drift.

[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.280]
We're sports radio 5cp.

[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.000]

[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.980]
You'll see, man. We're going to make a comeback this year in spite of it all. Spidey Greg Reed.

[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:44.060]
The radio killer. Now let's see. This one says he must be a mega major celebrity because every single break last weekend that had Darcy Hortachuk.

[00:38:44.060 --> 00:39:04.100]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Hornet Chuck. Trade out commercial with little Brady kid. This one goes on and on. I haven't even heard that. Have you heard it? No, I don't know what he's talking about. I have no idea. The Palm Beach troublemaker talking about poor Darcy Hortachuk. Nobody knows who Darcy Hortachuk is. By the way, simple for all and for else in Chicago. He's got man cow disease. He's gone.

[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:12.900]
Lionel Tade's going to be out. He's going to be free next month for poor little Lionel Tade. He sure lost a lot of weight Lionel Tade. Guess he did.

[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:26.720]
Ain't that something? Don't get so about it Lionel. After cooling his heels in there for three years. He's got to be out next month. He's side a plea deal, which they should assign to the first place. But what an idiot for a mother and an attorney. You know what?

[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:42.140]
Unbelievable. Had a chance to get the same deal three years ago. Oh no. Now anyway, he's going to be out. I don't want to even talk about him. You're talking about everybody's talking about him and his mother. Your mama. It's all the news, but nobody's talking about it.

[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:51.780]
Oh, well, something that is because there ain't nothing else going on. I'll bring the fact that everybody's peeing in their pants. And how come it is now? I'm going to say the same thing I said on Friday. Although I don't want to get that last guy. I'll bend out of shape.

[00:39:51.780 --> 00:40:04.220]
But if we're supposedly so safe now, because we captured Sodom. And if the Iraq attack was to make the world safer from terrorists, which they changed their tune on that, just like Dr. Rackens has changed in his tune.

[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:18.640]
Then how come everybody's crappin' in their pants now about flying? I flew back from Amsterdam last week. I wasn't crappin' in my pants or even in the crapper. I just held it very nicely for the whole eight hours. I don't get it.

[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:28.380]
And then the British are saying, oh, well, this is only the beginning. Air traffic is going to be like this for years now. Based on what? Based on the orange alert?

[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:34.940]
Based on nothing could be finer than a bomb in your vagina. I mean, I don't get it. Right? It's the bomb, baby.

[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:43.200]
Rackdom. Yeah. I've dropped a few bombs in my time. I'll pay that. But bombs. But I'm sure it's all I can tell them that at the airport. Never see my ass again.

[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:54.420]
No, just not a good thing to say. You know, like if this you go up to the store to say, oh, can you tell me where the restroom is on this plane? I need to drop a couple of bombs.

[00:40:54.420 --> 00:41:06.260]
You know, not a good idea. I mean, put it in those terms. Okay? I feel like I'm going to explode. No, not a good thing this day. So be very careful. Kind of linguistically with the flight attendants on your next flight.

[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:16.240]
Okay? Because otherwise they might have to drop your ass out of the plane. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon line.

[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:27.000]
Who is the most overrated major celebrity of all time should be an endless list. I would think. But again, it is the Monday after finally after the holidays. So you can be sure this usual Monday is bad.

[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:33.440]
So today they got a lot of a lot of catching up to do. Trust me. W2 way in. Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:41:40.040 --> 00:42:00.240]
Can you please put it on the top of that list? I hate him. That cracker. Okay. I like I like by Elvis crackers though. 5 6 7 0 5 60. Let's get Elvis on there. I almost put him on myself. But I figured somebody called in who hates him like poison. And there he was. And there he is. He said he's a cracker. WQ AM. Hello.

He just went on there. He's already got a couple of votes.

[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:59.940]
Thanks. I'm sorry. Okay. No problem. In fact, he's got three votes. 5 6 7 0 5 60. You know, the guy to call before his right. Lots Mo in O4. That's our model. No more to try to save the world. No, I mean, I got some stuff to read like for example, because you might actually learn something you might care about. For example, I'm putting lime on the taste of the bottom of my pile. Yeah, nobody cares. Well, I mean, even if they did care, it's old news already. You know, I mean, it could be wrestling with any of my kids. Maybe he's wrestling with his conscience. If he had one, he's just.

[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:27.520]
A few break short is the best way to put about him. Yeah, a whole brick house. Well, I'm just telling you. I blame the mama. The mama. Another one of these religious freaks. Oh, this religion thing. I don't want to get started on that either because it just it just makes me so angry. It makes me furious. We like the angry Neil. No, you don't. The other guy doesn't want the angry Neil. He wants the yuck, yuck, Neil. That's what he wants. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. Just like that. Anyway, Dean to make surprise visit to Iowa.

[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:57.500]
See now the headline. This is in the Boston Globe. This is unbelievable. That's the headline. Dean to make surprise visit to Iowa. Now listen to the first paragraph. Okay. How are because he's in Iowa? They had the debate yesterday, which I'm so tired of those. Oh, enough already. And enough of this Jew Lieberman attack an Howard Dean. Hey, Lieberman, you don't want to put pushing in the first place. You asshole. You Orthodox. Nebysh. Anyway, did you hear what I just said? Dean to make surprise visit. I want to. I want to know what you're doing.

[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:27.480]
I was the headline on the Boston Globe story. Howard Dean, whose presidential campaign is already won the back in a former vice president. Al Gore is planning a surprise visit to New Hampshire tomorrow. Well, maybe I was in New Hampshire. An expectation of receiving the endorsement of the other leading Democratic contender from the 2000 race. Former US Senator Bill Bradley. He could sure dribble it, man. He's still dribbling a little bit right down his chin. Democrats in New Hampshire. Other parts of the wind would have been invited to a previously unscheduled appearance by Dr. Dean and Manchester for what's being

[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:57.420]
grilled as a very special breakfast, which a surprise endorsement is in store. Dean Hadman skidds order to attend a pancake breakfast in Muscatine, Iowa, about the same time before participating in a candidate form in Des Moines in the early afternoon. How do you like that? So they have it a big surprise breakfast surprise. Bill Bradley's going to endorse Howard Dean for president tomorrow. Is it a surprise? Sure. What? Let's see. Sergio says picked up this cartoon from the

[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:27.380]
Spanish newspaper ABC. I'll be say it's very indicative of what's happening to Bush in Iraq and it shows a rat with a bush push on it caught in a trap. And it shows the bait says Iraq on it and it shows the any so old in the American flag. Why don't you have to see it? I guess kind of cute. But I'm like it started on that bush bashing at least not to the new hour because we don't want to get that other guy all upset. Because like I told you before, the white males in America, they love Bush man, especially when they see that picture of Brittany on the front pages of New York.

[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:57.360]
Post who got married and then knelt right away. I bet she ain't got none and they can't touch these others ass asses. Like I'm sure he's got major asses, right? He didn't look too bad.

[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:33.900]
Right? They don't have to come in and monitor anybody. Show no more. And they're certainly not going to monitor that early morning show because nothing's going to help that.

[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:40.780]
Absolutely. Right. So they got like nothing to do but sit around and complain at all this other crap. WQA. Hello.

Howard Dean is my overwhelming choice for presidents as this fact.

[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:05.960]
Somehow I don't feel warm and fuzzy when he or the media refers to him as Dr. Dean. I agree I said that Friday.

[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.980]
I think it's time to abandon the title as he plans on practicing while in the office.

[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.980]
I don't think he uses the title himself.

[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.000]
I think it's just the assholes in the media and these moderate moderate.

[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:19.080]
No actually the moderator in the debate is they called him governor Dean which is correct.

[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:19.480]

Okay they just if I see the picture they just go flying away.

[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.220]
He still is famous based on a mediocre show that's been in syndication for years.

[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.840]
Although not major celebrities the Hilton sisters have been famous for absolutely nothing.

[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:48.280]
They're ugly, bony, skanky and townless. Go away already says J.

[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.780]
Good point J. Excellent.

[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:50.120]
Yeah.

[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:55.100]
And I don't know what's so erotic about a skinny nasty, skanky bitch.

[00:53:55.740 --> 00:54:01.740]
What was the lot of what could possibly be so that makes it an erotic tape because he's got money for women it does.

[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:04.120]
I see if a guy's got a lot of money.

[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.100]
182 votes on the poll today.

[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.040]

Elvis Neildyme and Johnny Carson three of peace Jim Carries got seven.

[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.900]
I find that to be sacrilegious.

[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:20.600]
Yeah.

[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.800]
No don't you find that the little odd I mean he might be wearing a little thin.

[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:25.240]
Right.

[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:28.520]
He's a little bit some pretty crappy movies but he's most overrated.

[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.320]
Right.

[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.520]
He's got talent.

[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.000]
He least he's done some good stuff.

She's gone.

[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.520]
She has gone down the close the barn door the cow is out.

[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.360]
Maybe the votes will equal her weight by the time the paper is the mad cow.

[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:09.020]
567.0560 pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.180]

[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.400]
Back to him.

[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:12.800]

[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.420]
Don't you remember that the chin there's nothing on business are they?

[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:17.680]
Black angus.

[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.340]
The steak restaurant are they still around?

[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:19.960]
Nothing I know.

[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.300]
No the black amus.

[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:23.880]
WQA.

[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:23.940]
I'm not a black am.

[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.160]
Hello.

[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:28.380]
Yeah that wasn't me on the radio or I was.

[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:28.800]
I was.

[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.080]
I was Steve Nichol said that was his favorite was the old black amus.

[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.340]
Remember that?

[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.020]
Yes I do.

[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:35.180]
WQA.

[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:35.460]
Hello.

[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.600]
Hey what's up?

[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:37.660]
How you doing sir?

[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.400]
Good good I want to put one of the list.

[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.300]
Go right ahead.

[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.820]
How about Dr. Phil?

[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.760]
Dr. Phil's a good choice.

[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.000]
I don't think he's going to catch.

[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.520]
Listen I bet say that cruise wasn't turning in a gray right about now.

[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.660]
You mean like turning into a real woman?

[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.640]
She's singing a tune like Dr. Bob.

[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.080]
She's singing a new tune like Dr. Bob Ackon.

[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.940]
That's Bob's coming up in a couple of minutes by the way call all your friends.

[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.300]
I've really had a piece of copy that inspired me as much as the new copy for balance for life where it talks about Dr. Rack.

[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.500]
Even Dr. Ackon's is changing his tune.

[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:12.340]
I'll try and ever promoted a commercial before with a dead man.

[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:18.160]
In fact his tune for a few months there was like mmm and I was like mmm.

[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.140]
And he's changing his tune in the box.

[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.160]
It's all Dr. Bob in the box.

[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.660]
He was I don't want to say.

[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.440]
You know he has helped a lot of people.

[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.740]
He finally once he croaked and they said oh you know what his diet really works.

[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.380]
In fact that's all you hear everywhere in the world in Europe.

[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.720]
The same thing that's all they're talking about is the Ackon's that.

[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:36.720]
Now that he's in the box.

[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:37.060]

[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.500]
Now they had that little slip and fall.

[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:40.020]
Oops.

[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.960]
Well whatever you do is speaking of a slip and fall.

[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:46.660]
Don't be going on a plane after you eat those uh one of those Ackons what energy not energy.

[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.580]
What's the name of those bars?

[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:48.540]
Uh advantage.

[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.000]
Advantage bars.

[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:50.780]
No that's not it.

[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.940]
No that's the other ones.

[00:56:53.300 --> 00:57:00.680]
Wow wow wow wow because you'll keep running to the uh tourlet man after about the 40th or 50th time they're going to start suspecting something's going on.

[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.500]
Like you're pulling something out of your ass beside that.

[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.100]
I'm telling you.

[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.300]
Oh my god those things are got so much of that multitall and sorbitall and crap at all.

[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.400]
It's just unbelievable.

[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:17.200]
And like you said the people that survived Dr. Bob they've turned the whole enterprise strictly and like money making like Ron Popeel.

[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.720]
And speaking of Ron Popeel.

[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.400]
We got to get him on again someday for a couple of minutes on the phone.

[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.100]
Okay.

[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.340]
Maybe he'll extend each one of us one of those.

[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:28.900]
The new they they'll begin to improve the rotisserie whatever they call it.

[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:31.020]
I'm still waiting for my pocket fishery man.

[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.860]
Oh no no I'm serious those things are good.

[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.040]
This is the first good invention.

[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:34.900]
He is milking it.

[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.160]
They've been doing it for three years.

[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.780]
He said they've sold five million of those.

[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.940]
Now do the math.

[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:39.360]
Okay.

[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.640]
No I can't do math.

[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:41.240]
No.

[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.200]
If he if he made just individually.

[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.880]
If he made like five bucks a piece or even two bucks.

[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.280]
That's 10 million just off that one and they're right.

[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.520]
And you know it's got to be more than that.

[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.920]
Can you stop at that point and go spend some of it?

[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:59.200]
I'm sure he's have well you know they tape the infomercial and then you don't say he probably isn't working in for six months.

[00:57:59.360 --> 00:57:59.860]
That's good point.

[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:04.960]
And if it's not the best machine you ever bought for your kitchen.

[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.620]
The a secret weapon against Michael Jackson.

[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.520]
This is also in the inquire.

[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.880]
See I don't read like a lot of a crap like anything from the hero to the Sun Sentinel.

[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.700]
Because most of it is crap who who could ever believe it.

[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.100]
But if it's in the inquire I do believe it.

[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.640]
In fact that's about the only thing I gotta say.

[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.580]
I will hand it to Mr. Ego who's a total waste of space.

[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.460]
Piece of crap.

[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:33.060]
But years ago I used to make fun of him because he'd read from the inquire on the year and he'd say that was the only publication you could really trust.

[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.100]
And I'd say what a moron you are Steve.

[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:38.200]
And I have to tip my little fedora to him now you know it.

[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.540]
Even though he's a real scumbag.

[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.600]
How many kids has he got this way?

[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.200]
And he's got like mixing match.

[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:49.460]
He's got some white kids and black kids and Chinese kids and purple kids and Indian kids.

[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:50.100]
They have a subscription.

[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:50.920]
Yeah.

[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:51.940]
Like Columbia House.

[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.040]
He has a prescription.

[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.540]
In fact, Russia's getting them some new ones.

[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:56.620]
New kids.

[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:03.860]
The a secret weapon against Michael Jackson prosecutors have a secret weapon in their case charging Michael Jackson with molesting a boy.

[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.920]
Two other alleged victims who could help put the king of pop behind bars.

[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.260]
What's more, a secret police file containing photographs.

[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:12.900]
Video tapes.

[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:13.320]
Another item.

[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.540]
Seed from Jackson and connection with earlier molestation claims could now come back to hot him.

[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:23.060]
In this trial, the DA will want to show a pattern of abuse and a pattern similar behavior by Jackson.

[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.220]
The police are fully inquired.

[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.660]
That's where the earlier evidence will come into play.

[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:33.480]
In 93 the Santa Barbara County DA's office launched a 13 month pro bon convened a grand jury looking to sexual abuse.

[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.060]
Actuations brought against Jackson by a 13 year old boy.

[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:44.360]
Jackson wasn't charged in the criminal case because he paid the boy in his family $15 million to drop their civil lawsuit brought at the same time by the accuser.

[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:50.460]
And of course that was back in those days when his family wasn't quite so tight when it weren't so desperate to stay on a gravy tank.

[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.360]
But he were saying things like that damn bag and I can't stand it.

[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:53.920]
You go girl.

[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:59.160]
Authorities say that we're dropping criminal charges because the boy wouldn't agree to testify against Jackson in court.

[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:09.440]
But since then California laws have changed now Santa Barbara DA Thomas Stedden who tried to prosecute Jackson a decade ago can force the 93 accused to testify against Jackson in the new case.

[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.120]
You ready for that?

[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:10.700]
No.

[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:17.620]
In addition, a second boy who said he was sexually molested by Jackson then left the country as we churned and he could testify too.

[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.680]
He's singing that parliament song.

[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.480]
I want to testify.

[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.060]
Boy sure love that song, don't you?

[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:21.960]
That's okay.

[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.100]
You don't like it?

[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.040]
I like it part.

[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:24.920]
I love it.

[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:40.820]
Pron and California criminal defense attorney Steve Cron who was not involved in the Jackson case but is following it closely told the inquirer, assuming that Stedden knows where the first alleged victim is and he believes that kid now in adult, he can definitely call him as a witness and make him testify against Jackson where they want to or not.

[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:47.580]
The fact that Michael may have paid the kid off and they both say non disclosure agreements does not mean for a minute the boy can ever talk about it.

[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.140]
It's true we can't give interviews to the president about it.

[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:56.800]
He can't talk in a civil suit about it but it cannot shield him now from testifying in a criminal action when subpoenaed.

[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.420]
Stedden and any judge will tell the boy if he's ordered to testify that the gag order does not hold.

[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:12.720]
Months before the 93 scandal broke the inquirer first reported the story of Jackson's bizarre relationship with the young boy and it goes on and on about that in the Audi Audi and his world has turned upside down since the new charges against Michael arose.

[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:18.740]
He had been trying to live out a quiet life out of the spotlight moved to New York City from California and remained single.

[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.140]
Because of the multi-million dollar settlement he hasn't had to work and never Andy lives comfortably.

[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:34.700]
He thought he'd never have to testify but now that the lawsuits are different and the new accusers involved he's fearfully brought back into court but he's not a liar and if fast he'll tell the same story he told back then that he was molested.

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.420]
And then somewhere in here goes on about the second kid.

[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:44.400]
So there you go they're going to like nail his ass to the wall in spite of that slime ball mark.

[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:53.340]
Ergo's man I just he just makes me ill and yeah little later on I don't want to like over you know bury the audience with Michael Jackson stuff but please.

[01:01:54.380 --> 01:02:03.820]
Oh seriously this is from the examiner which I think is slightly less credible but nevertheless DNA and this this ties in with the story had a couple weeks ago DNA tests for Jacko's kids.

[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:12.520]
If it's discovered that Michael's been lying about being the kids real father prosecutors will dig even deeper to find out what else he's been hiding.

[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:18.840]
Yeah it's the old deal about if you lie about one thing just like how stupid it was to make up the story about being brutalized by the police.

[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:27.940]
Yeah because when it's obvious to anybody with a half a brain who isn't one of your sicker fans that you're lying to your teeth about that then it's probably your lying about everything else.

[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:33.000]
It's like if Greg retails you one day the week it is you probably figure he's making it enough because he lies so much so I'm saying.

And I haven't tried that yet it says but if the quality is anything like the dark chocolate I think you really enjoy them.

[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:35.040]
I bet I could go online and find Z carb chocolate bars. Yeah easy says here's the weird thing mentioned in the time magazine article.

[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.360]
You can find them at least a couple of flavors at seventy eleven of all places we got seven eleven here.

[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:45.300]
No no no no seven eleven. I got the dark chocolate with macadamia not loving I'm ordering a case today.

[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:26.800]
Jerry Lewis is stuck on seven. Dr. Phil five Johnny Carson four Elvis four Neil Diamond three and Jerry Seinfelds got only one.

[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.420]
I don't think Seinfelds going to give her any because these it's another one of those state of mind things.

[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:35.540]
You're supposed to like Seinfeld just like you were supposed to love mash.

[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:44.460]
Right happy days. Oh no. Yes. Who said that? I know what Tom Bosley said.

[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.880]
And we had Reverend Jones twice already just getting started WQM. Hello.

[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.780]

[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.080]

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on it. How many we got now?

[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:04.060]
We got to get 600 George. We got over 500 Friday when it didn't look like it was any chance.

[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:14.240]
We only got 240 now. So you know, just do the math. We got to get over 300 by noon because then it starts slacking off a little bit when they go to lunch and they start turning over to rush.

[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:23.480]
240. What? I'm just I don't want to play butch boss, but I'm just telling you the chances of 600 look pretty slim to me.

[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:28.420]
I'm putting a heavy load on the audience and shoulders today. They 600. They'll be like half the people we got left listening.

WQM. Hello.

[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.460]
Yes, sir speaking. Hey, Woody Allen. Woody Allen's a fine choice.

[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:48.380]
And Gloria is up on an even better choice. All right. Have a great new year, man.

[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:56.200]
Gloria, Stephon. Can she sing? No. Can she add? No. Does she make any sense? No.

[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:04.280]
Is she just a grandstanding bitch? Here. There you go. Should you go? No, I'm just I'm just saying what what? Where's the talent lies?

[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:12.520]
Is there any talent inside that body at all? No. She's she's a hell of a vote operator. I'll tell you that. Her and her husband the vote of them.

[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:20.200]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound. What's his name? Emilia. Who did they say before that? Cause we got distracted by Gloria. Woody Allen. Yes.

[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:27.140]
And Gloria as Stephon. See Woody Allen to me is just like he's just neurotic. You know.

[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:35.440]
I like some of his older movies like any hall didn't see it. But there is didn't see it. You want to know why?

[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:41.680]
Cause you don't like him. Cause if he's in it, I won't see it because I can't stand Woody Allen. He's neurotic. He's like a nebush.

[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.180]
She just I don't know. I just don't like looking at him. Sleepers was funny. Never seen it.

[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:55.320]

26 past 11 at 5 60. You know, Dr. Rackens is singing a different tune. Did you hear that? In fact, wasn't that other thing about that bit that we're playing about.

[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:26.400]
Rodney Spector singing a different tune. Everybody is singing a different tune. And you know what?

[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:32.220]
Greg's better be singing a different tune to come January 16 when he takes a look at the damage he's done to WQ.

[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:38.840]
Am nice. Go on Greg. Just keeps building it up and then ripping it apart. Building it up and then tearing it apart.

[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:41.920]
Lundentic. A crazy person on the loose.

[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:49.400]
26 past 11 at 5 60 W. Come speaking of meal replacements. Speaking of stuff that tastes good as opposed to that of the crap.

[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:56.140]
How about interest diabetic? A truly delicious meal replacement drink that just happens to me made for people living with diabetes.

[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.720]
But anybody wants to cut their sugarmetake down can drink it too and enjoy it.

[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.180]
Interest diabetic is sweetened with splendor, which is made from sugar.

[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:12.180]
So there's no aftertaste like a year with aspartame and saccharine recommended by doctors and dietitians for people who can't sacrifice proper nutrition just because they happen to be in a big hurry.

[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:20.120]
Interest diabetic is a completely balanced nutritional supplement that provides all the essential vitamins and minerals needed for a healthy life plus fiber and antioxidants.

[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:26.880]
Yet it's low and saturated fat and low in cholesterol too. In fact, interest diabetic is also gluten free and lactose free too.

[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:34.080]
And eight ounce can provides 237 calories of easily digested nutrition. Try it once you'll never go back to whatever else you would drink and before.

[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:42.840]

My, and local, this is Sports Radio 560. You way, you way.

[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.820]
Hey, who are you looking at?

[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.780]
Who?

[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:44.500]
Yeah, slide is the not case. You can't look directly at me. You cannot look in his eyes.

[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:59.740]
If you do your job close by by, he'd say, when I come in a room, you leave it you leave without turning around.

[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:07.680]
It's no wonder they'd be last that long.

[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:16.120]
Just slide the love, first best one of them, the job. Close these thought guys, they're job.

[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:26.820]
Another soon you, when you're white. Just slide the love and get your speak to him. He's mine.

[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:38.000]
Stack your back, close your guard. This kind of treatment just ain't right. He's sliced the love.

[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:44.780]
Can't complain about his tell, he don't have any. And you were the one tell me about how much you liked Rocky, which just struck the crap out of me.

[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.160]
I didn't go on, nothing I said it was okay. You went on a great length. You said it was one of the greatest movies of all time.

[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.280]
Okay, yeah, sure.

[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:56.440]
I'm sure, how can you say you enjoy that movie? I enjoyed that movie and I also enjoyed first blood.

[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:02.100]
Oh, no, like that. Holy crap, but not the other ones, but not Magnolia.

[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.840]
I like Magnolia a lot.

[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.160]
1132 and 560. I just can't hear you anymore. Dan Rather of CBS, somebody says they put Dan Rather on air.

[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:14.740]
The most overrated, okay. Would we say Dan Rather is a celebrity?

[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:20.160]
Rather not, but we'll do it anyway. Is he a celebrity? He's celebrated. He's a celebrity.

[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.040]
Okay, I'm just asking just double checking. Let's get him on here.

[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:30.180]
Now, let's see, we're going for 600 votes by two o'clock or Georgia's all the rest of the shows Tuesday through Friday this week.

[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.480]
We got 274. I think we got a shot.

[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.140]
Now on Friday, I thought we had no chance at all for 500 and we kind of like chicken away. We backed away from that.

[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:44.800]
And then all of a sudden they're toward the end. The phenomenal response.

[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.380]
Just because they were terrified you were going to be back on again.

[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:54.320]
The most overrated major celebrity of all time, Oprah Winfrey 81, nobody can touch Oprah and quite frankly who the hell would want to?

[01:17:55.500 --> 01:18:01.160]
Barbara Streisand 42, that'd be a good pull question. How much would it, how much would she have to pay you for you to bone her?

[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:07.120]
Ooh, I don't put the bone in her nose, by the way. Make it into a racial thing.

[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.400]
I don't know if it's possible, see? To put the bone in her nose.

[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.360]
I guess there's Viagra.

[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:18.400]
Oprah's got 83. Barbara Streisand 42, about a two to one margin there out of 278 votes.

[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.620]
James Dean 35 doing very well. Jimmy Dean.

[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:31.600]
Celia Cruz 31. Dick Clark 19. Frank Sinatra 14. Dr. Phyllis was the late editions. About 13. He's zoomed up the list.

[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.880]
Maybe he can be there with his gal pal. Jim Carrey 12. Carrie Lewis 9.

[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:43.340]
Johnny Carson 7. Elvis Presley 6. Jerry Seinfeld 4. Neil Diamond 3. Neil Diamond ought to be doing better than that.

[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:51.020]
He blows. All you like Neil Diamond? His old stuff. Like sweet, care, relying on Saturday.

[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:56.400]
Cracklin Rose. Cracklin Rosey is a whole, whatever that is. He's a terrible.

[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.960]
I think you're right. I said like, don't like what?

[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:05.560]
What bothers me the most about him is he really believes that every song he makes is like an epic classic. He's like Holly. Holy.

[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:11.580]
He just. No, seriously, you know what I'm saying? He thinks he's a hot stuff like jazz singer crap. That was really nauseating.

[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:17.640]
Yeah, he ain't no else. I'll tell you that. Yeah. Anyway, Sean and Hollywood says he nominates the most unfunny.

[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:24.820]
First of all time. Andy Kaufman. He said he's about as funny as the later stages of Ebola and his minions throw around the word genius.

[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.720]
Like he's the Stephen Hawking of comedy. He said there's never been a movie made about Leonardo da Vinci, but they spend millions to deify this.

[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.040]
Third. How do you like that? You turn Andy Kaufman. Get him on there.

[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:40.640]
Oh, there. Okay. I'll tell you. He was a real turd. Not not for our list because he's not famous. All the way is now.

[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.740]
He sure got a lot of publicity out of it. That Steve Irwin got the out of crocodile guy. Yeah. What an asshole.

[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:50.780]
I see there's another thing where you and I disagree. Oh, by the way, I found out something fascinating over the weekend.

[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:56.980]
I can't reveal my source. Okay. You know, I was talking on Friday about the fact that Miss Fudge is yanking it while he's listening to the show.

[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:04.020]
Uh-huh. Guess what he wears. I can. He's got. He's got pink silk panties that he puts out.

[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:09.600]
He's got about a quarter to ten every morning to get ready for this show. He puts it on right on his head.

[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:21.980]
Can't you just see it now? I'm trying not to picture it. Mm-hmm. My, my, my. Nice going, Matt. Miss Fudge. By the way, I hope his nursemaids take good care of him.

[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:26.320]
Changing his diapers and changing that the sweet empty out the bag every little couple of hours anyway.

[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:35.660]
Crocodile hunter, Steve Irwin snapped back at critics who have accused him of endadering his month old son's life by holding him while hand feeding a crocodile saying today he would even do it again.

[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:44.260]
What I would do differently is how to make sure there were no cameras around. He told network 9's TV nationally broadcast current affair program when I was a very small boy.

[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:51.820]
I did the same for me for me, not to me, but for me. In fact, when I was nine years old, he let me jump. Restrain and capture my first crocodile.

[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.660]
Oops. Oops. What a shame. He didn't have like a little incident. You know what?

[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:04.140]
Child welfare advocates have said the TV hero when danger to son Robert and the incident Friday drunk comparisons. And I, I thought of exactly the same thing.

[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:09.680]
Comparisons with pop star Michael Jackson, the dangled is an infinitable hotel into in Berlin in November of last year.

[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:16.100]
Michael Jackson has done a qualified child dangler. He's not. No. I hear he's held a lot of children real close to tight.

[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:23.780]
Good point. And he hangs out in real tight is what I'm hearing. In fact, that's how he likes him is real tight.

[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:31.500]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. I don't care what anybody says this guy's an asshole.

[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:37.280]
Oh, he was an asshole, but he would have stumbled and fallen just like you said before the show when you were singing different tune like Dr. Rackens.

[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:44.040]
No. People exploit little kids all the time. Right. It's show business. Right. Carnival.

[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:53.420]
Circus circus families. The the the willand is an old. He fell down. He's dead, but wasn't he brave? You know stuff like that? That's their family. Right.

[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.420]
I kind of like that your home was witness is same thing. Somebody Q. A. M. Hello. Yeah, I got a call for Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:09.780]
I got a name for Paul. Go ahead. When you can. Wayne Newton is a fabulous choice. Or Donkey Shane. Donkey Shane.

[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:17.640]
In fact, I think that's the winner. Don't you? I wish I could change my vote. I do too. I think he'd go past Oprah like he was laying out still.

[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:23.980]
Like she was in the prone position. Wayne Newton get him on there right away. Thank you Eric. By the way from putting up with us.

[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:33.740]
295 votes. We're going to have 300 well before noon. So we got a shot. We got a shot, which I don't know what I'm celebrating about. I should be saying, hey, don't vote.

[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:46.360]
But I don't want to fix it. Make no work. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T. And the rise and wireless line. My dog is back today is to after missing many, many days.

[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:55.420]
And an extended vacation after we just screwing off. And I guess the pressure with that dolphin season. How does that dolphin play off a picture? Look. Sorry. What?

[01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:09.080]
Oh, that's bad. See, there he goes. Rub it in. That's why they hate you here. Neil. That's why everybody itself. I hate you because you're a patriot fan and a papyrus one. Their last 12 and a row. They finished 14 and two. And because they are kicking serious ass.

[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:22.360]
I tell you one thing. They better really further. Cool. So all of a sudden. You see that to Denver game. Josh. I did. 46 to 10 or something like that. I mean, they just they just wipe the. They're asked with a man. Yeah, it was embarrassing.

[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:33.420]
It was unbelievable. All Denver's not all that good. Anyway, course, keep in mind who used to be their quarterback. Brian don't keep falling down, baby. 5 6 7 0 5 60. Now what game did Bob Greacy do over the weekend?

[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:43.320]
He didn't do the orange ball game. That he what came to do? Did you do the orange ball? I don't know. I was present. I think he done it. And man, he sure looked very.

[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:52.080]
He didn't go here to me. I don't want to you know, I want him anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying. He looked a little lost. Maybe after that tough season that is on Brian.

[01:23:52.080 --> 01:24:05.060]
Have with the dolphins, man. Maybe that's why Bob is like doing the old. Bob and we've WQ a hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I had a couple for your list. I don't know. Go right ahead. Take more than one. But how about John Wayne?

[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:20.880]
John Wayne is sensational. See again, the question is of all time. Yeah, see he's dead, but he's still pretty annoying. Right. And I got a couple that I don't like. Mick Jagger can't stand them. Ben Stiller suck Ray Romano.

[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:30.020]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I can't write that bad. Mick Jagger Ben Stiller. Ray Romano. Yeah. Will Smith.

[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:49.040]
And one that I can't stand is so many people love it. Jamie Lee Curtis. Oh, Jamie Lee. They don't come more butchered and Jamie Lee. No, they don't. And it's like the never had sex with a female male. Amen. See a meal. Okay. And the sky looks blue to me. Jamie Lee Curtis.

[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:57.440]
The daughter of Tony Curtis, aka Bernie Swartz. And remember, he, uh, he sure had some really interesting taste Bernie Schwartz. Right. And mother.

[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:13.360]
People knew that rich. He Simmons told me that. Right. Mm hmm. He said he was a Schmidt expert, something like that. My time is a stupid question. But since, uh, how does she stop Lee in Jamie Lee? Like Ellie, E or like her mom, like Pinky Lee, Brenda Lee. Okay.

[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:42.900]
Got it. Brandon Lee, Brandon Lee, Lee Jeans.

[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.460]

[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.680]
Dr. Phil.

[01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:58.620]
Dr. Phil.

[01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.400]
Dr. Phil.

[01:25:59.400 --> 01:25:59.480]
Dr. Phil.

[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.700]
Dr. Phil.

[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:01.700]

[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:01.780]
Dr. Phil.

[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:01.780]

[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:10.620]
Dr. Phil.

[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:18.180]
Dr. Phil Doano Comm로ter Dr. Phil.

[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:25.580]
Dr. Phil Doano Delicar's Best

[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:40.460]
Dr. Pangem Name of trump.

[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.900]
And every human should

[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:47.840]
Not to feel pleased just make it down

[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:51.040]
Your freaking self is clown

[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:56.680]
Try to handle things like your friend don't grow old

[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.760]
That's crazy!

[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.080]
Not to feel stop

[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.160]
The retired go away

[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.840]
Not to feel stop

[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:11.120]
Just leave and take your son Jay

[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.240]
I think I'd like the crocodile guys

[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.960]
Steve Irwin better he was holding on to say Gary Coleman

[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.240]
Okay, huh? Sure

[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.500]
Maybe McColley Culkin seven years ago

[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.340]
Although Michael would have got upset about that

[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:23.720]
Guess who's listening George?

[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:24.680]
I'm listening!

[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:29.060]
A wrong Howard. Howard from New Jersey who faithfully listens on the internet

[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.780]
I'm listening! Thanks Howard!

[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:31.460]
Absolutely!

[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.400]
It's just got back from four lot of day

[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.980]
Look for you in Windixian publics on knob Hilbert's no avail

[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:36.980]
Well guess what I wasn't there

[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:39.440]
Number one and number two I don't shop in either of those places anyway

[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.180]
I shop in publics at the sawgrass baby

[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:44.280]
That's where the good people are

[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.140]
I'm not knocking the other publics

[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:47.180]
Windixie I don't know

[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:48.920]
What?

[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:55.900]
Anyway, it's a good choice Howard in New Jersey

[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:58.540]
It's just one person I've never understood who should be on your list

[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.740]
Bill Cosby! Absolutely!

[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.580]
Others who would get votes

[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:04.440]
Harrison Ford?

[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.040]
What is he?

[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.860]
I think that's anti-Semitic if you ask me

[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:10.040]
Harrison Ford is great!

[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.760]
Yeah, right?

[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.460]
Absolutely! I can't I just Larry King

[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.420]
Now how about Larry King, huh?

[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.940]
Uh-huh! That's reset the poll so I can re-vote

[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:22.820]
How could we have forgotten Larry King who's known all over the world

[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:26.860]
Do you know what I'm an Amsterdam and I'm sitting there watching the cable in my room which is really pressing

[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:31.200]
Because when I had the apartment I used to have two satellite dishes and actually I could watch some really interesting stuff

[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:34.860]
But when you only got the cable you got CNN, BVC

[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:43.800]
You got a few Dutch channels that have old English shows with the Dutch subtitles but the English audio

[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.580]
And then you got National Geographic comes on there so if you want to watch animals eating other animals

[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:53.520]
You can watch that for a while but then you kind of like start losing your appetite

[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:55.260]
Which is good enough to them because the food sucks

[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.300]
Don't go there

[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.140]
Larry King and Sherr I think Sherr certainly observes a little shy man

[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.260]
Don't you? Yeah, why not? Let's share the uh...

[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:04.140]
Faint

[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:06.260]
Share the love with Sherr

[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:10.520]
Oh and I'm so glad that I just caught out of the corner of my eye and see it in moments of go-to or in a break

[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.680]
A story that I had buried in my pile, guess what it's about

[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:16.340]
I give up

[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:20.340]
Fan! You know what the Fattest City is? You probably already saw it

[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.160]
No Fattest City in the US

[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.120]
Okay, let me take a couple of calls then we'll let you guess

[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:25.980]
It's not you and even New York

[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.260]
Okay, come into QAM

[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.360]
Yeah, sir

[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.600]
How about that acting culture?

[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.480]
He's pretty talented

[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:36.180]
Ashden Coochered

[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:38.620]
Yeah, I'm pretty glad to come

[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:40.520]
What do you say?

[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:42.020]
Have a good one

[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:44.880]
Bob, okay, Baba, Ashden Coochered

[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.280]
Coochie Coochie Cooch

[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:48.460]
I'm not really sure about him

[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.020]
You know what I mean? You follow what I'm saying?

[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.680]
No, what do you mean? I'm not really sure about him

[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.680]
567-0560, let's get him on there though, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.560]
Let's build a big list because the more names we got on there, George, I mean the more votes we're gonna get

[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:06.220]
Right, see? And if we can get to 600 by uh... 2 o'clock

[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.800]
327 right now

[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.300]
We'll probably have about 350 by noon, I think you got a shot at 600

[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.000]
And then of course tomorrow it will be a 700

[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:19.100]
We'll just keep up, opening anti every day, you know?

[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:19.800]
You'll bust out

[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.600]
Anti-neil, anti this, anti-Christ

[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.900]
That's me, W-D-Q-I-N

[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:28.180]
Hey Neil, I got a couple for your poll

[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:31.980]
Okay, in fact maybe the number tomorrow the threshold will be 666, yes sir

[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:38.700]
Actually there's three of them, I don't know, I had 680, I don't think they mentioned yet

[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:40.260]
Yes?

[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.380]
Sandra Bullock

[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:47.160]
The girl, you know Sandra Bullock, Sandra Bullock

[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.140]
Who are the women? Who was the second one, oh canna Reeves right?

[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:54.340]
Patrick Sway, Sandra Bullock, those are the three that I have

[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:58.540]
2 out of 3 in bed, thanks a lot, Tyler, go ahead, don't go ahead, don't go ahead, don't go ahead

[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:01.320]
You can hang up on me so quick, one thing

[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.840]
I'm not hanging up on you, my finger is in a different place

[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:08.180]
The thing is, you know I've been listening for years and years and years and years

[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:13.620]
And the one thing I cannot stand is that what people call up, the first thing they ask you is how you're doing

[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:17.200]
People would just stop asking you how you're doing

[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:24.160]
Not only that, what will happen is they'll say how you're doing and I'll say okay and they'll say is this Neil?

[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:30.620]
I'll say oh how you doing, you know like, and I'll say the distance well as I was doing 2 seconds ago when you asked me the first time you asked so

[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:38.120]
Exactly and it's wasted about, it's wasted at least 2600 hours of my listening time for their stupidity

[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:45.060]
But one other thing I just want to say, my pet went in at MVP and came out of those days of pet

[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.200]
That's it

[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.420]
Okay, and how are you doing?

[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:50.740]
What did he say?

[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:56.080]
I had all this hope and you could say his pet went in at MVP and came out of those valuable pet

[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:00.260]
Okay, he was doing so good until then too, you know

[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:05.060]
Good list to all of Sandra Bullock I take exception of that, I like her

[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.100]
I like her too

[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:12.280]
She can be a little bit too cutesy at times, I do understand that but I think that guy would probably, he grabbed her in a second if he could

[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.640]
I could beat him to her

[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.120]
Right, now she's cute

[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:20.040]
But sometimes she's a little bit too cutesy depending on the role she's got

[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:26.560]
She was very good in that movie with Ben Affleck, she was good in that, what was that movie?

[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.000]
Forces of Nature

[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:29.760]
No, that wasn't it

[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:32.220]
Forces of Nature was at the end of it really?

[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.860]
I was going with Ben and I never saw it

[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:34.640]
With Ben Affleck?

[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:36.300]
Anyway, she's cute

[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:40.580]
Canna Reeves and Patrick Swaisy, I would have agreed, especially Patrick Swaisy

[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:43.220]
Was it dirty dancing or footloose?

[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:44.120]
Dirty dancing

[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.740]
Footloose was Kevin Bacon

[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:46.600]
Who was in that little field?

[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.840]
She always gets those cute confused, I like Kevin Bacon, he's good

[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:49.460]
Yes he is

[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:51.040]
And he used to be on batting light

[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:58.340]
By the way, speaking of batting light, I'm sorry I can't follow that anymore, it's getting a little bit too esoteric for me

[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.220]
And passions man, passions isn't going anywhere

[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:10.060]
It isn't going anywhere between Eve and Julian and Julian and Eve and nothing's happening

[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.620]
Aren't you getting a little bit burned out on it?

[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:13.200]
Oh yeah

[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.000]
Although Sheridan still looks pretty good, you still have to see Sheridan

[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.200]
I saw her

[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.960]
And she thought I'll take her

[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:23.340]
Okay, well you ought to be a little more excited about her than that, she's extra hot

[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:28.160]
She's, she makes grit, look, she makes grit, it looks like Oprah, okay, now I'm serious

[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:32.640]
Sheridan to me, whatever the, I don't know what her name is, the actress, the place around passions

[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.980]
But she's just, I mean, if you like, built a woman

[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.280]
Yeah

[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.060]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.140]
I keep trying

[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:43.520]
All of the parts, now I'm not talking about dressing up

[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:47.820]
You're a good friend PR Ralph says, oh yeah, when's the draft party?

[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.720]
It's in April Ralph

[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:55.340]
He says, I hope you have an excellent year in supplies with great entertainment like always

[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:56.940]
Well guess what Ralph, the price is right

[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.720]
He says, here's one for your list, Howard Davis Morning Host

[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.480]
Well first of all, he's not a major celebrity number one

[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.680]
And secondly, that's a cute name, Howard Davis

[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:12.400]
It says, don't mention that all offense definitely under any circumstances, big blue, Michigan

[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.560]
Or Rose Bowl in the same sense because Mad Dog will be upset

[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:19.580]
Yeah, Michigan got their clock clean too, pretty bad, who beat them up Josh?

[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.340]
USC

[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.400]
That's right, it was USC, it was the Rose Bowl, oh man, I watched a lot of that game

[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.840]
Because I sure liked that USC quarterback

[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.360]
But man, oh man, did they get their asses kicked or what?

[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.320]
I loved it

[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.700]
I'd be pretty embarrassed, mad dog, having my team get their asses kicked like that

[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.100]
Although Michigan State got beaten some of me in this game

[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.540]
But we don't get all bent out of shape about it like Michigan

[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.360]
But Michigan's like a religion

[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.420]
And as far as the offense is going, how's their playoff season?

[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.560]
What are their playoff pictures shaping up ass?

[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.000]
Anyway, fantasy in America, guess what?

[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:50.840]
Chicago

[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.720]
I'll keep going, what is it?

[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:53.280]
Chicago

[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.160]
No, they don't live long enough to get fans Chicago, they keep getting murdered

[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.100]
Oh, here?

[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.640]
Oh, by the way, I had the official total we discussed it on Friday

[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:05.460]
Chicago had the highest number of murders last year in the US, 599

[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:08.080]
Toronto had 65

[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.600]
I got the, it was in the yesterday's newspapers here, 65

[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:15.700]
And again, the one guy's trying to say Chicago was twice the population, the metro area

[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:19.320]
Not quite like 9 million to 5 million, but almost twice

[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:23.480]
Okay, so you double 65, you got 130 compared to 599

[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:24.920]
Got it?

[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:25.620]
Got it

[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:28.000]
So Chicago's got the most murders but not the most fat people

[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.020]
Okay, guess again

[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:32.280]
West Pole Beach

[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.440]
Come on, get serious

[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.100]
Good city, Miami

[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:36.720]
No

[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.200]
Okay, we'll continue

[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.360]
No, we'll just keep going on it until you guess it

[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.500]
And don't be looking it up

[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:44.600]
Don't be checking it out, don't be cheating on it

[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:50.880]
The most overrated major celebrity of all time is Oprah so far, she's got 99 that big tub of crap

[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:56.300]
Got a billion dollars and never, and she's got the, oh man, I'm jealous

[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.620]
Not just the money part, sure I'd like to have the money

[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.500]
But the influence, the power that she has over those simple and women

[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.660]
She makes, she puts rush to shame, you know what?

[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:06.120]
Oh yeah

[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.120]
I mean, he's got the ditto heads and now listen, oh whatever you say rush, love that don't, you know

[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.800]
But she, if she says fart, they bend over, man

[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.680]
You can smell it all over the country

[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:17.880]
Oh there's that asshole with the kid

[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.240]
Well here from the pocket, I'll go

[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.160]
Yeah, drop the little oops, there it goes

[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.540]
Maybe he's just trying to get rid of it

[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:26.620]
Maybe it wasn't unwanted baby George, everything of that?

[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.300]
Mmm, yeah, we have a good one

[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:33.360]
A little, little, little, little, little, little, little brackets though, no crocs and that, no alligators

[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:40.840]
Oprah Winfrey 99, Barbara Streisand, Cross-eyed Bitch, with a big mouth, 52

[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.000]
James Dean, 36, I like that a lot

[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.580]
I'm ecstatic, I never thought you'd do that well

[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:51.200]
Seeing that cruise 34, she's right on James Dean's ass, and he's probably like an ad

[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.020]
Dr. Filmer, because she's got a big strap on

[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:56.580]
Dr. Filmer, 25, Dick Clark, 19

[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:58.420]
How do you like that? They've turned on Dick

[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:03.860]
Frank Sinatra, 16, Jim Curie, 12, Jerry Lewis, his type with Elvis Presley, 10

[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.280]
Johnny Carson, 8, Jerry Seinfeld, 7

[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:11.680]
Neil Diamond, 3, Wayne Newton, 3? Oh, oh, see there are probably a lot of people like us

[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.660]
Wish we could change our vote

[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.560]
John Wayne, 3, Andy Kaufman, 2, Woody Allen, 2

[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.920]
Larry King has got a pair

[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:23.520]
Dan Radher, 1, Bill Cosby, 1, Gloria Stephons, got 1, Ashton Kuchers, got 1

[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:28.780]
and no votes yet for Mick Jagger, Ben Stiller, Ray Romano, Will Smith,

[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:32.840]
Jamie Lee Curtis, Cher, Slice the Loan, Patrick Slesey,

[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.960]
Cano Reeves or Sandra Bullock, got a 349

[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.200]
It's just about noon and we got 349 votes, what's your retake?

[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:41.060]
We'll do it, we'll do the 600? Yes

[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.380]
Hey, here's a great idea for

[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.360]
Instead of standing in the kitchen, getting all worked up over a hot stove

[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:50.420]
One out of their friends at the Emerald Coast, the world's number one Asian buffet restaurant

[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:57.660]
Do all the cooking for you, start out your mouth watering eating experience with any one or two or three or all six different kind of great soups

[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:04.240]
And then sample dozens of succulent on phrase like New York strip made of order in the sizzling Asian grill along with a brand new seafood saying Jacques

[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.720]
Enjoy oysters on a half shell every night

[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.780]
And if that's not enough, try the Alaskan Stone crab, middle-led clams, jumbo shrimp scampi

[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:15.620]
And now for the first time, steamed main lobster on the weekends at the Emerald Coast

[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:19.160]
If you still have room for the hand-carred prime rib in the new Thai specialties

[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.240]
The Emerald Coast, don't forget, will never give you a headache because they don't use any crap in their cooking

[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:29.040]
They cook only with cholesterol free oils, no MSG, no cornstarch, only the best ingredients go in anywhere

[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:35.320]
The buffet features a full salad bar, the new sushi bar, fresh room cocktail, and because they figure if you've got a big, big

[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.700]
Puprik like a lot of people that come in there, you might have room for dessert left over too

[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:46.260]
So they feature a full dessert station featuring Belgian waffles, pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite toppings and fresh fruit

[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.600]
By the way, speaking of ice cream, I'm hooked on it at the Ben and Jerry's coffee topic crunch

[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:50.320]
You're gonna die

[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.280]
Remember that the Schwarzer guy that called me in that one day a couple months ago?

[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:57.580]
He was right, you were right pal, it's a disease man, coffee, coffee, crunch, Ben and Jerry's

[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:02.200]
Anyway, three Emerald Coast locations for you, they're in sunrise, pine island or 44th street

[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.540]
They're on Collins Avenue, just north of prestigious 163rd street in North Miami Beach

[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:10.000]
And you'll find them at the intersection of Flamingo and Pemberg Roads in Pemberg Pines

[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.920]
So take the whole family or book your next business luncheon right now and let our friends at the Emerald Coast do all the cooking for you

[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:19.980]
Take out an delivery available to call 954-572-3822

[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.440]
954-572-3822 for the original, the best in the university, Emerald Coast, Chinese buffet

[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:33.760]
Five at the local, this is five cities, three years old yours, two in

[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:40.460]
This is Mark Morgan, it's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M

[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:47.720]
Undershuttered the fish of my, come on in, I'm the afraid of it, I'm the afraid of it

[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:54.620]
If you don't like the way you look and change it, change it

[01:39:54.620 --> 01:40:00.040]
If you don't like where your stuff is, where you range it

[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.240]
We range it

[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:09.840]
We'll fix your scars, we'll tie your tubes, we'll give you Pam and this in boops

[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:15.240]
And find a change we can't do to make a friend you, you not your boop your boop

[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:20.480]
Hey, I've been holiday's early there, I'm Dr. Longing, look a boop

[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:25.980]

[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:05.500]
like me you don't remember like uh... who's somebody like ancient

[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.740]
root off Valentino

[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:09.000]
i know something that's exactly what was thinking of

[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.600]
oh my god we've been working together to long

[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:15.920]
that's exactly what was thinking of that queen uh... who married all those

[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.680]
bulldogs pull a neck of it all was a

[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.900]
what a coincidence every day a woman he married was a guy that was just a

[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.740]
coincidence yeah

[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:26.140]
but anyway Valentino although did you ever see any of his movies sure the other

[01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:28.520]
one the machine one yeah that's not right

[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:32.220]
i saw that the uh... what the hell's the place of the eastern house and

[01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:35.080]
rickerson really happy a movie thing huh the beach you max

[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.700]
no no no well whatever the hell it is

[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:41.300]
uh... so that is it is going of course it's hard to tell if somebody's a great

[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:45.360]
actor would like some movies that's no right that's not speaking right

[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.980]
but nobody would know from him now anyway so we're not going to put them on

[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:53.820]
but it's got to be somebody ancient like who is very highly overrated like um...

[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:57.180]
but the problem is that most of the actors and actresses from those days

[01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:59.840]
uh... were great right most

[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.600]
like bell on a go see

[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:02.660]
that's right

[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:05.320]

[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.420]

[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:13.900]
uh... shy lock homes

[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:16.160]

razzle bathboon i used to calm

[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:25.820]
that's a wrathful was a great actor is not a good movie but they were all great

[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:28.300]
actors and actresses now you got so much crap

[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.700]
yeah personally the TV people like opera

[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:35.880]
the most overrated major celebrity of all time opus kick an ass man that big fat

[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.980]

[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.940]
i'll give you a clue of dark people there

[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:04.580]
detroit

[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:05.460]
alright

[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:11.940]
now that must just be a coincidence huh

[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.500]
what do they call it low-town

[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.400]
because more was once there absolutely a ball game

[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:18.780]
the back to ball game

[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.820]
a lot of dark folks played in that game too

[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.380]
uh... this city

[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:25.840]
judge the nation's fatties for the past three years is starting to look

[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:26.920]
thinner he was in texas

[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.620]
but only when it's measured against the truth in second

[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.740]
uh... men's fitness magazine in February issue uh... do out this month

[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:41.500]
this is me off and i tried to find out i couldn't find the whole i guess i

[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:42.500]
could buy the stupid magazine

[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:45.820]
and of course if you buy men's fitness magazine you know what that means don't

[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:45.940]
should

[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:46.980]
your gay

[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:47.860]
uh...

[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:53.960]
the skills to be twice way because of a jump in tv viewing a worsening commute

[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:57.160]
time and a scarcity of gyms the magazine said i guess they're leaving out the

[01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:58.300]
fried chicken factor

[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:02.880]
Houston officials were pleased although the six annual survey made it clear

[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.660]
they could still lose to stand more than just a few pounds

[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:10.400]
we were ecstatic not to be the fastest to sit a fantasy against the leela brada

[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:13.720]
a former mister universe was named Houston's fitness czar

[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:15.840]

the culture here is you walk out of your house

[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.820]
you get in your car you think of us and you go where you're going now how

[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:35.320]
different is that from south florida not again right you walk out of your house

[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:39.320]
you get in your car and you take a bus or go where you're going the difference

[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:41.520]
being a course in south florida is that you've got the beaches

[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:45.180]
and you've got people who actually play golf a little bit maybe a little bit

[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:47.800]
tennis you got the people swim things like that

[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:52.380]
even though we do have enormous numbers of tubby fat pieces of crap like me

New York let me give you a clue a lot huh oh really Honolulu who won Honolulu

[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:58.380]
number one in fitness oh yeah I guess they weren't counting those big what

do they call the um the Japanese like the samurai guys the the sumo

[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.600]
wrestlers yeah because there's a lot of people like that in Hawaii too

[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.440]
but they're I mean they're the small exception but there are many of those kind of

[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:13.040]
like really what are they the Polynesian people right

[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:17.700]
all up exactly but the other people they're boy the beaches in Hawaii are just

[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:20.760]
oh that beaches there the beaches that are most beautiful

[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:24.600]
I guess they didn't count seeded crews when they were taking the effect Miami

[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.100]
five six seven oh five sixty because she not only couldn't sing she not only had

[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:33.320]
a guerrilla face but boy was she a cow huh she wasn't always from those

[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.960]
pictures I used to get beat with yeah she wasn't always a fat cow right

[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:42.000]
she was slim in term in fact maybe she wasn't fat at all maybe it was just that

[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:42.720]
dress she was wearing

[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.240]
okay we'll take your word for it sweetheart

[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:03.920]
pat Robertson says God tells me it's bush and a blowout oh yeah

[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:08.560]
pat Robertson said Friday that God told him President Bush will be

[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:10.800]
reelected in a landslide Jesus Christ

[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:17.480]
in fact there's no what somebody we love said praise Bush like Jesus right I

[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:20.640]
think George Bush is gonna win in a walk the religious broadcaster said on

[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.920]
the 700 Club Program on the Virginia Beach Base Christian Broadcasting Network

[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.160]
which he founded I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's gonna be like a

[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.600]
blowout election in 2004 it's shaping up that way he would

[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.620]
the Lord has just blessed him Robertson said of Bush I mean he could make

[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:40.000]
terrible mistakes and come out of it it doesn't make any difference what he

[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.360]
does good or bad God picks him up because he's a man of prayer and God's

[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:47.380]
blessing him that's right as a matter of fact since God's going to elect him

[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:51.080]
none of the Republicans need to show up to vote this time that's right and all

[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.360]
you white males out there do our Bush people out there guess what we're

[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:57.780]
gonna keep you home on in fact why don't we get everybody laid on election day

[01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:02.840]
huh that's all right huh okay sounds like a good idea we'll find a bunch of

[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:06.960]
sluts we get a bunch of cheerleaders and we'll send them around all over the

[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:10.020]
place because Florida's supposedly gonna be a pivotal state again we got

[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.840]
that on our website today by the way speaking of our website for those of you

[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:15.300]
who are like looking your wounds because I'm not sitting here

[01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:19.540]
weeding just pontificating hour after hour and I'm not gonna do that anymore

[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.180]
I mean you know some stuff I'll read but just not like it was before too much

[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:27.320]
but all the good stories continue to be on our website as we work

[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.620]
feverishly along with Eric to keep you you know those people are

[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:33.400]
caring off the center very best to take a look at what's going on right

[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.260]
which is the unfortunately the tiny minority of the people

[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:43.880]
let me give an example on an average day if we have let's say let's pick a

[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:48.200]
number 20 bedtime stories on our website okay and we have 10,000

[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:52.560]
requests for pages assuming I understand how that works and I'm still

[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:57.200]
on so sure I do that means that they're assuming that all those people

[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:59.600]
would go there would read all 20 stories which I'm sure they might

[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:05.460]
that means that 500 people are looking at it see what I'm saying I say in

[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:09.420]
other words on the same day we might have 160 200,000 hits but those people aren't

[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:11.320]
interested in that and and then those things

[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:16.400]
follow I follow so does it make sense for me to do the show

[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.220]
gearing it to those 500 people are interested in like no at light bulb radio

[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:23.220]
of course not and I'm not not going to those people because I appreciate the

[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:26.340]
fact that they look at what I mean it takes a lot of time to put that stuff

[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:28.800]
together right right how many seconds

[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:32.260]
about good man it takes a while that does scour all of those different

[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:35.280]

were peddling advanced nuclear technology must have been averting their eyes from a most

[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:51.860]
conspicuous piece of evidence the laboratories own sales brochure quietly circulated to aspiring

[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:55.280]

[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:12.100]
all

[02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:05.820]
These are a couple of funny facts that you sent me now.

[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:07.600]
1233 at 560, W.C.

[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:08.880]
We got the mad dog back at two.

[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:12.060]
Bow, Kim Bo-Kamper for Hank at Chula's at 4 to 7

[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:13.480]
because the Humper is up source.

[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:16.140]
He's got a scratchy throat, he's at the doctor again.

[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:17.340]
Pratt loses an answer to.

[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:19.180]
Come on, Hank, you can do it.

[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:21.120]
Here's the first fact.

[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:23.620]
This is, and of course you notice it's university pharmacy.

[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:26.180]
Who always are sending us these same malcontent,

[02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:29.280]
always bitching and moaning and just turn it off already, okay?

[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:30.180]
And this go away.

[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:31.420]
Fake facts, of course.

[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:34.600]
Of course, because it's just sincerely a listener

[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:35.720]
that has stopped listening.

[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:36.840]
Right.

[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.940]
Now, if you look at the word, if you look at the word listener,

[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:43.720]
misspelled by the way, but if you look at the word listener,

[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:46.480]
you see the writing is that this is just a chronic

[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.780]
facts from university pharmacy, by the way,

[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:50.180]
wherever that light is, listener.

[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:53.200]
I'm pleased to see you are not bush-passing.

[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:55.060]
If you've nothing good to say about bush-better,

[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:56.220]
you not say anything at all.

[02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:58.300]
I would think of Corvette lover as yourself

[02:08:58.300 --> 02:08:59.880]
would know the new Corvette is sixth generation,

[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:00.440]
not five.

[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:02.320]
Did not say fifth or sixth, who the hell know

[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:03.160]
is what they're doing to make.

[02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:05.640]
And James Dean was great and he drove porches.

[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:07.040]
Well, that's one of the reasons he wasn't great.

[02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:09.420]
And he died while racing his Porsche.

[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:12.900]
Get your facts straight and quit ruining our country.

[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:15.040]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:17.440]
A list there that has stopped listening.

[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:19.880]
But he's surged, glad to see,

[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.160]
well, don't get your hopes up.

[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:23.060]
Remember they tried that a couple of years ago?

[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.620]
Oh, well, Neil, there's so many people

[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:25.520]
disagree with you politically.

[02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:27.960]
If you just have a good time and just screw around,

[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:30.820]
we'd like you so much better than what they're trying to do

[02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:33.300]
is they can't do it the other way by intimidation.

[02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:35.400]
So they can't get me fired even though they tried

[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.700]
their damnedest with the condolizant, all that crap.

[02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:41.000]
But no, so the next deal is, oh, we'd like you so much better

[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.920]
and everybody will listen to you and mark it down

[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:45.520]
in their diaries as long as you stop bashing our present

[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:47.300]
and is banned of Mary Nazis in Washington.

[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.820]
Then it never gonna happen on a show.

[02:09:49.460 --> 02:09:49.760]
Ever.

[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.460]
Bill, not gonna happen on this show.

[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:53.640]
Not for next three years anyway.

[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:56.800]
I mean, when you get your show.

[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:02.640]
Yeah, then you can come up and get fired and bash bush.

[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:04.420]
Bad and talking about bush.

[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:07.960]
Here's another one that says, hello, unhappy new year.

[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:10.460]
I'm writing a response to what you said

[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:12.800]
about the men's health magazines saying that Texas has five

[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:14.600]
cities that are rated the fattest in the nation.

[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:17.760]
Being a native Texan, I can vouch for this.

[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:20.100]
However, you said that Texans are a bunch of Yahoo's

[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:21.040]
and that's why we're so fat.

[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:22.800]
You go on to say just look at our president.

[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:24.900]
I don't think that's what I said, is it?

[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:28.040]
In terms of being fat, he's not fat.

[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:29.940]
He's just a fat head.

[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:33.280]
As for Texans being a bunch of Yahoo's,

[02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:34.680]
that's not so for all Texans.

[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.400]
Some Texans are actually aware of the world.

[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:40.280]
I imagine probably some to say all Texans are Yahoo's.

[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:42.480]
Might as well say that all people in South Florida

[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:43.980]
are South Florida Yahoo's as well.

[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:48.900]
And I would say, except for maybe a few.

[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:49.900]
So handful.

[02:10:50.820 --> 02:10:52.500]
As for our president being from Texas,

[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:54.200]
that's not so. He's from Maine.

[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.080]
Well, because he was born from Maine

[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.420]
and he was a bunking it up in there for a while,

[02:10:58.680 --> 02:10:59.440]
that's not the point.

[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:01.500]
He's been in Texas for a long, long time,

[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:03.620]
about 30 men, including governor twice.

[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.340]
And former owner of the Texas Rangers

[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:07.700]
who traded away, what's his name?

[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:08.920]
Who did trade away?

[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:10.340]
Draskin, me?

[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:11.580]
Lewa, Sandy Sosa.

[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:15.180]
Unfortunately, claims Texas as his home in Cincinnati does,

[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:16.800]
please don't blame all Texans for that.

[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:18.060]
Love your show, we'll continue to listen

[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:19.160]
with a little happy face.

[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:20.300]
Well, thank you so much.

[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:23.200]
I guess five, six, seven, oh five,

[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:25.660]
six, the pound five, six, the only AT&T

[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:27.440]
in Verizon wireless line.

[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:28.960]
How are we doing on that total, man?

[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:30.580]
How's those peaches totals?

[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:35.060]
We got 476.

[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:38.120]
We need 600 votes by two o'clock

[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.760]
or George does all the rest of the week shows.

[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:42.900]
In fact, if we don't get 600 votes by two o'clock,

[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:46.180]
George is doing January and just played bits.

[02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:47.240]
Yeah.

[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:51.080]
Five, six, seven, oh five, six, the pound five,

[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:53.800]
six, the only AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:55.800]
WDQA, hello.

[02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:58.920]
Yes, I have a couple for you, Liz, although it's probably too late.

[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:00.580]
Because I'm too late, I'm Joe.

[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:01.680]
Never too late.

[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:02.540]
Arnold.

[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:04.200]
Okay.

[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:05.840]
Ellen DeGeneres.

[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:06.940]
Right.

[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:07.800]
And Ellen Fun.

[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.740]
Ellen Fun from Candid Camel?

[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:13.140]
That's my, that's my opinion, I feel like that.

[02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:14.060]
Okay.

[02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:17.680]
I didn't think he was rated much less over rated.

[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:22.660]
Now, Ellen Fun, he's been dead for a hundred years,

[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:24.580]
but not on pretty much.

[02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:25.400]
The other two are good.

[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:26.720]
Arnold and Ellen DeGeneres.

[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:28.860]
But that's his opinion, Goddamn it.

[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.460]
Who'd Ellen Mine to be dicking around with his opinion, right?

[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:33.260]
Right.

[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:36.400]
Just like somebody we know and can't stand since.

[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:37.180]
That's my opinion.

[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:37.960]
I'm Mike Disney.

[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:39.080]
Yeah, well good for you, Disney.

[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:39.760]
Have another drink.

[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:41.080]
Piece of crap.

[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.340]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.660]
And Verizon, Marla's line.

[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:49.220]
Keep cranking out those hits, Mike.

[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:50.620]
Keep cranking them off, baby.

[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:51.820]
Keep jamming it.

[02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:55.500]
Man, just to have one of those FM stations,

[02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:58.380]
that Cox and Cheap Channel are butchering in that town,

[02:12:58.580 --> 02:13:00.000]
just to have one of them for a year.

[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:02.840]
Can you imagine, forget about even being syndicated,

[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:04.480]
just be it on an FM station

[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:06.400]
where there are living and breathing people listening?

[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:08.040]
Oh, you missed it while you were on vacation.

[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:09.120]
What was that?

[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:11.140]
We're broadcasting an HD digital now.

[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:12.680]
Yeah.

[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:15.940]
And how many HD digital radios are there in you?

[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:16.620]
In the world.

[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:18.240]
3rd man.

[02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:20.180]
We have one.

[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:21.760]
Who has one?

[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:22.280]
The station.

[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:24.700]
And who's got it?

[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.260]
I think in the engineering day, they share it.

[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:29.600]
Well, good, maybe back there listening to me

[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:32.700]
in digital HD, whatever it is, they pass it around.

[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:35.180]
As opposed to working on a fixing line,

[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.960]
one on the phone and getting the place working again.

[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:40.080]
What a bunch of WQAM, hello.

[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:40.960]
Hi.

[02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:42.280]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:43.640]
Yes, yes it is speaking.

[02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:44.620]
Neil?

[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:45.280]
Yes.

[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:46.080]
Hi.

[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:50.740]
I am a lady from North Miami Beach.

[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:51.800]
Excellent.

[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:55.300]
I wanted to know, first can I add to your list,

[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:56.320]
Billy Bob Dorton.

[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.580]
Billy Bob Dorton.

[02:13:58.760 --> 02:13:58.960]
Please.

[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:00.000]
OK.

[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:03.140]
And the other thing, I don't know if you saw the article

[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:07.720]
about the woman here who is in court

[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:11.200]
because she bit her child and then shook the baby to death.

[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:12.480]
Yeah, I did see that.

[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:13.280]
Yeah, I did see her.

[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:13.960]
And it was a bitch.

[02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:18.400]
I mean, these people shouldn't be having children.

[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:20.820]
They should have been fixed a long time ago.

[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.300]
I mean, I have two children and they get on my nerves,

[02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:27.120]
but I would pull my hair out first before I would harm them.

[02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:29.400]
Well, that goes back to what I've been preaching for years,

[02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:30.680]
fourth sterilization.

[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:31.340]
Yeah.

[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:34.000]
And you and I can pick who the victims are going to be.

[02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:35.520]
I have a great year.

[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:36.300]
Thanks, you too.

[02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:36.760]
Bye.

[02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:37.300]
Thanks, bye-bye.

[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:40.200]
You know those, in the hardware store,

[02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:42.640]
they got those machines that shake the paint for you.

[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:43.740]
And I got one of those.

[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:44.640]
That's what I use on my kid.

[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:47.940]
You mean the kid that you didn't want?

[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:48.340]
That's right.

[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:50.040]
You didn't work those machines.

[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:51.660]
No, she's still a good friend of mine.

[02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:53.780]
Well, maybe you should have put something else in that machine, OK?

[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:56.540]
I might not have had the kid.

[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.020]

[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:04.680]
still have company in your house?

[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:06.280]
See, this is another bonus piece of copy.

[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:09.200]

[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:09.800]
I know.

[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.200]
Or if you're just in South Florida for the winter,

[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:13.000]
you need a new mattress.

[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:13.800]

Ride in local,

[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:37.540]
here sports radio 560-UAM.

[02:16:39.660 --> 02:16:40.220]
For the talking.

[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:42.560]
American girls.

[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:46.940]
And American guys who only listen

[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:50.680]
to the message from the Uber ride

[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:52.880]
will have their table talks lined

[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:55.580]
as the troops from home did.

[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:58.640]
They find the comfort of the night

[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:01.420]
riding under the bed.

[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:05.240]
I never served in armate.

[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:07.040]
I'm too afraid to fight.

[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:09.440]
So I sit right here near the TV

[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:11.740]
far from liberal thighs.

[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:13.700]
Under the covers you'll discover

[02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:15.440]
I'm a big fishy.

[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.280]
Who would prefer to have some mother

[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:20.300]
do the fighting for me?

[02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:23.880]
Now this country I love is occupying

[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:26.660]
Iraq and all the suckers like me

[02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:29.120]
whose necks are red in the back

[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.220]
have our tongues all pleased firmly.

[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:33.360]
In bush's pink brown eye

[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.820]
the pigmouth towers of the world

[02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:37.900]
who gladly follow fly.

[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:41.900]
Hey, Uncle Sam, I feel afraid

[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:43.660]
to fight or enlist,

[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:46.580]
but you can count on me to watch TV

[02:17:46.580 --> 02:17:50.240]
and shake my fist and my flag will fly

[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:52.480]
from the back of my truck.

[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:56.020]
I can idiotic pseudo patriotic

[02:17:56.020 --> 02:18:00.000]
dumb **** in my view of the bull ride world

[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.700]
is what I see on Fox News.

[02:18:04.540 --> 02:18:07.920]
Yeah, I'm an armchair warrior

[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:11.580]
who knows better than you.

[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:33.000]
I'm an in-bred jerk who parrots

[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.520]
anything they say.

[02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:36.720]
Don't have to read or research.

[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.660]
It's so much easier this way.

[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:42.420]
If you watch TV or look at pictures

[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:45.660]
you wish it today

[02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:49.660]
with my finger up my ass.

[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:51.660]
As I tickle my brain

[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.460]
and Uncle Sam, I'm too afraid

[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:56.300]
to fight or enlist,

[02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:59.160]
but you can count on me to watch TV

[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:02.580]
and shake my fist as I lower my flag

[02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:05.220]
so I can pull on my hood

[02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:07.840]
to proudly show the swathe good

[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:09.460]
and cute on my nuts

[02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:12.700]
the soddies are our best friends in the world

[02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:15.300]
like those Iraqis or Jews.

[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:20.540]
Yeah, I'm an armchair warrior

[02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:25.240]
who knows better than you.

[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:30.520]
I'm an armchair warrior

[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:32.440]
who knows better than you.

[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:35.960]
1246 at 560 WQM

[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:38.220]
I can just imagine the rattling of the spirit

[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:40.280]
all in any of Rogers he's going to lay off a bush

[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:42.660]
this year we're going to like just steal Florida

[02:19:42.660 --> 02:19:43.720]
is if I'm going to have an impact.

[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:44.480]
Then it's going to happen.

[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:46.240]
Yeah, they're yanking it.

[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:48.880]
Same old crap, you know,

[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:51.440]
it's just one more way to try to silence anybody

[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:52.160]
who doesn't agree.

[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:53.520]
You know, this doesn't want to go step along.

[02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:54.140]
It's bullcrab.

[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:55.440]
They wouldn't pay anybody off with that.

[02:19:56.940 --> 02:19:58.680]
How about the people at Arbitron

[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:00.220]
starting to be suspicious of them?

[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.780]
What kind of a sample do they find in November, huh?

[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:03.760]
Are they a company?

[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:06.220]
What do you mean by that?

[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:08.760]
Like a big company, a company that stands to gain something

[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:09.280]
from something?

[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:09.760]
Yes.

[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:12.680]
Or speaking of assholes,

[02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:14.780]
Pete Rose admits he bit on baseball

[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:15.560]
and the team he managed.

[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:16.920]
Now listen, this is the beginning of the show.

[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:18.480]
I'm so sick and tired of Pete Rose

[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:20.100]
if I never hear his name again,

[02:20:20.220 --> 02:20:21.840]
it'll be because of Rose by any other name

[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:22.980]
that would stink the same.

[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:24.700]
Great player.

[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:25.100]
Great.

[02:20:25.220 --> 02:20:25.820]
Stick them in there.

[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:27.160]
Get it over with already, you know?

[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:29.200]
Talk about fun for the people, mind it.

[02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:30.060]
Something that people have.

[02:20:30.180 --> 02:20:30.540]
Nothing else.

[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:32.640]
People who have nothing else going on in their lives.

[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:34.100]
This is the kind of crap they talk about.

[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:35.480]
So I'm, I'm carrying the story up.

[02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:36.440]
It's on our website.

[02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:38.340]
We had it on all weekend long.

[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:40.000]
Road is autobiography.

[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:43.360]
And after 14 years of lying about betting on baseball,

[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:45.000]
oh, I guess what I did.

[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:46.340]
But I always bet on my own team.

[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.560]
I never bet against the reds.

[02:20:48.180 --> 02:20:48.500]
Well, great.

[02:20:48.660 --> 02:20:50.180]
Congratulations and get lost.

[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:53.980]
As long as I live, I'll never forget that night.

[02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:54.980]
He came to Pompato Park.

[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.480]
And of course, the stories I've heard from my friends about him coming to the

[02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:03.420]
Thurabred tracks and putting on a similar display and making these wild $10,000 exact

[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:05.460]
amounts and never cashing one of them.

[02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:06.360]
Never.

[02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:10.940]
And his routine is he comes to the track always with some fallups.

[02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:12.280]
He was a young babe.

[02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:17.720]
And he he stacks up a bunch of hundred dollar bills on the table in front of him.

[02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:18.560]
Nice.

[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:19.860]
Isn't that lovely?

[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:20.580]
Clathy.

[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:22.460]
Yeah, really, really classy.

[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:24.160]
Really, I'm so impressed, you know.

[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.840]
It's like saying, hey, look at me here.

[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:27.740]
I'm looking all this money.

[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:29.200]
Of course, it'll be gone by the end of the night.

[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:30.680]
But look at all this cash.

[02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:36.140]
Man, just enough to make you puke.

[02:21:36.820 --> 02:21:39.440]
And I never spoken of this man before in my life.

[02:21:39.460 --> 02:21:40.880]
He's sitting right across from our table.

[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.380]
Fat Rich goes to make a bet for us.

[02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:44.600]
And Pete Rose looks me in the eye.

[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:46.780]
And he says, you like anything in this race?

[02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:50.820]
He's got the TV on looking at the cymbal casting from Mohawk or Woodbine here in Toronto.

[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:54.680]
And I said to him, I said, well, I said the four horse.

[02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:57.100]
I said, whatever the hell was with Randy Wapel.

[02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:58.940]
I said, he's my favorite driver in Toronto, man.

[02:21:59.060 --> 02:21:59.340]
He's great.

[02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:02.340]
And a horse wins and pays 22 bucks to be betted.

[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:02.600]
No.

[02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:03.040]

[02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:04.240]
Because then he would have cash.

[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:05.880]
See, I think there's something in his mind.

[02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:07.000]
He doesn't really want to cash.

[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:07.800]
He wants to lose.

[02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:08.900]
There are those.

[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:09.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:10.700]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:11.920]
He wants to be a martyr.

[02:22:12.060 --> 02:22:12.960]
It's the martyr complex.

[02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:16.760]
And I'm not saying he's the only guy in the world that's got a gambling problem.

[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:21.720]
But he, the way he does it, just so ostentatious and grotesque and just, oh,

[02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:23.500]
enough to make your skin crawl.

[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:28.780]
And so now, after all these years that he's been banned from baseball and banned from

[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:32.820]
being inducted into Hall of Fame, now let's reward him for lying about gambling on

[02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:34.020]
baseball, now that we know the truth.

[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:35.240]
And now let's put him in there.

[02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:35.620]
What do you say?

[02:22:35.660 --> 02:22:37.840]
In fact, the Sun Sentinel took a poll on it.

[02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:42.680]
And like, this morning, I think, I think like 63% said, yeah, he belongs in the Hall of Fame now.

[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:46.260]
Now that we know he's a liar, kind of like the president, the same thing.

[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:50.280]
Oh, speaking of the president, US starts fingerprint program.

[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:51.360]
They started that this morning.

[02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:52.300]
You see the thing on CNN?

[02:22:52.340 --> 02:22:53.540]
Yeah, pictures and prints.

[02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:56.700]
Many, and I don't know why they don't do it for everybody.

[02:22:57.200 --> 02:22:57.980]
That's what the guy was saying.

[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:02.320]
Why can't they do it for everybody so that those of us who are frequent travelers,

[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:05.720]
whether we have our US passport or Canadian passport, whatever you got,

[02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:08.560]
so that you don't have to go through all the hassle all the time.

[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:13.520]
And then the regular, the frequent flyers, whatever the hell you, they want to call you,

[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:17.580]
you have a little, in fact, they're doing that in some places where they have the I ID.

[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:19.760]
Yeah, the evil eye.

[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:24.200]
No, no, seriously, where they, they, instead of fingerprinting, they, I print you.

[02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:24.600]
I print you.

[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:24.660]
I print you.

[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:24.660]

[02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:27.680]
Yeah, they stick it in your eye.

[02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:31.720]
I'm serious, I'm a scant.

[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:32.540]
Yeah.

[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:35.400]
And they say that it's a foolproof.

[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:36.720]
Yeah, can't be beaten.

[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:40.740]
Because I mean, you can always, you know, file down your prints, I guess, or do something.

[02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:44.840]
Even with identical twins, because your capillary pattern is unique.

[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:45.760]
Really?

[02:23:46.060 --> 02:23:46.140]
Yeah.

[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:47.400]
Well, excuse me.

[02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:49.280]
5 6 7 0 5 6 6.

[02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:52.600]
So anyway, they started that this morning, the new government program demanding fingerprints

[02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:59.800]
and photographs from people from 28 countries, mostly in Europe, who aren't required to carry a V,

[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:02.240]
but no, from the other countries beside those 28.

[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:03.020]
Mm-hmm.

[02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:04.140]
See?

[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:05.560]
Oh, I, I get it.

[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:13.740]
Now, it says here, outside of Europe, the exempt countries include Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Brunei,

[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:16.620]
citizens of Canada generally don't need a visa to enter the US.

[02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:22.260]
And of course, if you're a US citizen coming in from out of the country, and you have your passport, though, then you don't need to go through that either.

[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:24.000]
I, I just just don't go through it once.

[02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:26.020]
And then just whip on through there.

[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:27.140]
And they can tattoo your forehead.

[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:31.140]
Kind of just like an Amsterdam at Skippel Airport, just whip on through there, not paying any attention.

[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:34.940]
You can't complain about the security there, because there isn't any.

[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:36.060]
It's a pollen.

[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:41.060]
It's amazing, which it goes right in line with what I said about the Netherlands last week.

[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:44.640]
It's a good idea gone way too far.

[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:46.540]
It's one thing to give people freedoms.

[02:24:46.540 --> 02:24:48.900]
It's another thing to carry it to, to an extreme.

[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:54.880]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Lone.

[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:55.540]
QA&N, hello.

[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:56.620]
Hey, Neil.

[02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:57.460]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:02.420]
Just surfing the tube this weekend, I've seen a couple things that were caught my eye.

[02:25:02.420 --> 02:25:06.780]
They're talking about replacing, chaining with condolesea for the ticket for 2000.

[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:08.840]
Oh, you got to be kidding condolesea?

[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:10.000]
Yeah, that's what they're saying.

[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:13.460]
They're saying that she's going to be, they're pulling them off the ticket, because of how it's burnt,

[02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:14.760]
and they're putting condolese on there.

[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:16.300]
Oh, please, I would love that.

[02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:21.640]
And the, the two bush daughters, the two bush daughters were on this celebrity baggrove.

[02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:26.160]
They said that they, they drink you under the table, and then they leave you with the secret service, guys.

[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:28.260]
Good job, man.

[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:30.480]
Now, I got two for the poll.

[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:32.420]
I got a carrot top and Carson daily.

[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:33.760]
Carrot top.

[02:25:33.900 --> 02:25:37.780]
How can we forget old carrot top, and the anxious, obnoxious Carson daily?

[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:38.940]
Good choices, pal.

[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:40.740]
All right, you have a good one.

[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:41.700]
You two, thank you.

[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:43.520]
Carrot top and Carson daily.

[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:45.100]
Got it.

[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:46.600]
In fact, I bet you'd Carson daily.

[02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:47.920]
Boy, if that's true, what he just said.

[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:49.000]
Yeah.

[02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:50.660]
About condolesea.

[02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:51.680]
Wouldn't that be great?

[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:53.020]
Oh, man.

[02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:54.400]
I think we got a shot.

[02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:56.120]
I think we got a legitimate honest of goodness.

[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:00.260]
In fact, you remember you were saying you tired of them or somebody said to call on Howard Dean, Dr. Dean?

[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:01.080]
Somebody.

[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:02.500]
How about President Dean?

[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:04.600]
There's a much better ring to it, huh?

[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:05.840]
Sounds good to me.

[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:06.780]
Look, President Dean.

[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:11.680]
There's a little preview of, in fact, we're playing the original one at one o'clock.

[02:26:12.300 --> 02:26:12.620]
Hey.

[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:14.500]
After the long-dishy-m chain?

[02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:15.460]
Well, dust out the lunch.

[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:17.260]
We could play it over and over again.

[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:18.820]
I think so. That's a good idea.

[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:24.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T and for rise in line, we need 600 votes by two o'clock.

[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:29.140]
Or George is going to have a really heavy duty week that he's not prepared for.

[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:32.360]
520 votes, you think we'll make 600?

[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:33.140]
Yes.

[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:35.360]
I think we ought to stick with my original 700.

[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:36.760]
No.

[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:38.560]
Come on!

[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:40.140]
Be a good sport.

[02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:41.520]
Get on with you.

[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:42.440]
No.

[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:43.420]
600.

[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:45.060]
Okay. Don't want to change it in the mystery.

[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:46.160]
Not a Marlowe go for 700.

[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:47.120]
You bet.

[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:48.640]
Or no, a Marlowe go for 666.

[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:49.980]
Oh, there you go.

[02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:50.340]
Right?

[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:56.420]
And whoever is the 666 vote on a Marlowe's pool, get the million dollars in cash from Greg Reed.

[02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:56.840]
Not.

[02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:58.000]
Huh?

[02:26:58.480 --> 02:26:58.840]
Not.

[02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:00.580]
It sounds good.

[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:03.080]
I can't see the beesling.

[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:06.020]
Now, isn't that interesting how on hot 105, not hot 105?

[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:07.860]
Whatever our same thing, power 96.

[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:08.340]
Yeah.

[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:11.060]
That they buy the audience with cash.

[02:27:11.420 --> 02:27:13.620]
Sure. We're doing that now with the ticket Thursday.

[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:15.220]
We are?

[02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:15.720]
Yeah.

[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:16.860]
Take it up your ass on Thursday.

[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:20.280]
Or something like that.

[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:24.180]
It's an initial promotion that's got its own promos and everything.

[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:24.800]
Oh, no.

[02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:26.980]
Can we find one of those promos?

[02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:27.900]
We've been playing them all day.

[02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:28.360]
No, no, no.

[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:29.640]
I heard something like that.

[02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:30.540]
I'm going to try to ignore it.

[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:32.740]
So in other words, on the sports shows every Thursday.

[02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:36.800]
And the reason they do a Thursday is because Thursday is the first day of each rating week.

[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:39.840]
Oh, you're going to tell me that came from someone.

[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:40.580]
Oh, sure.

[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:41.200]
What?

[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:42.920]
And what have to?

[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:45.500]
From one of the consultants, maybe him or her or it or whatever.

[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:47.620]
Yeah, but that's where we come from.

[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:50.260]
Hey, don't forget you better watch yourself, Mr.

[02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:51.300]
You're in the Tanner building.

[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:52.400]
Oh, yeah.

[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:53.800]
That's what muffal we says.

[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.080]
You're in the Tanner building.

[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:56.260]
So you better watch it.

[02:27:56.340 --> 02:27:57.000]
Keep an eye on it.

[02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:57.640]
Yeah, better watch it.

[02:27:57.820 --> 02:27:58.060]
Right.

[02:27:58.240 --> 02:27:59.920]
So is that only on the sports shows?

[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:01.120]
How can we get left out?

[02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:03.820]
See, we're taking it up the old shoot, man.

[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:04.920]
Is what we're taking here lately.

[02:28:05.180 --> 02:28:06.480]
There's something really strange going on.

[02:28:06.660 --> 02:28:08.740]
It's like, and maybe it's my fault.

[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:11.220]
Maybe it's because I say the sports nerds make me a nauseous.

[02:28:11.260 --> 02:28:12.260]
And I'm still going to say that.

[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:13.420]
I'm not changing my mind.

[02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:17.500]
If I hate its sports like you do, it would be like a lot more

[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:18.740]
negative for me to say that.

[02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:20.620]
But I love my football and hockey.

[02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:21.100]
And that's fine.

[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:21.880]
I watch plenty of it.

[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:24.100]
Probably more than most of the assholes we got on the air.

[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:27.660]
Probably the fact of the matter is people who live within this whole

[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:32.740]
web of my new show who want to talk about the same crap day after day after day.

[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.780]
I'm never going to change my opinion about that.

[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:35.460]
It's pathetic.

[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:39.940]
I feel sorry that those people are waltzing around taking up the goddamn space

[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:42.620]
and breathing the fresh air that somebody useful could be doing.

[02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:44.020]
Makes me sick.

[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:46.240]
WQA and Hello.

[02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:46.980]
Nobody there.

[02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:47.760]
QA and Hello.

[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:49.420]
Hello, Neil.

[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:50.060]
Yes.

[02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:52.580]
Happy Deleted.

[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:54.020]
Happy Circus.

[02:28:54.660 --> 02:28:57.620]
Yeah, you know, those same people that talk about my new show,

[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:00.700]
the second Adolfins one next law that last game,

[02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:02.400]
how they're going to come back next year.

[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:03.180]
No.

[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:04.900]
You know what?

[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:05.940]
It's pathetic.

[02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:10.340]
Narada, Narada Crepetician, and it's the same crap every single year too.

[02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:10.480]
No.

[02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:13.020]
As opposed to just saying hey, they suck or wants that stuff,

[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:16.520]
and just telling it like it is, they've always got some kind of a looted excuse.

[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:20.640]
These guys haven't even hit the shower yet, and they're already talking about this and that.

[02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:27.040]
Listen, I understand that you think that that fingerprinting in the eye scan is a good idea.

[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:27.720]
Yeah.

[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:28.900]
Yeah, I do too.

[02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:31.340]
I mean, why didn't they do this like 10 years ago?

[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:35.060]
Do they realize how, you know, the people that are against this,

[02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:40.320]
how many people that are criminals and wanted felons that they would touch

[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:42.520]
after borders as a result of doing this?

[02:29:42.660 --> 02:29:44.060]
Let me give you an example of that.

[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:46.860]
When our flight got to Toronto from Amsterdam,

[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.840]
they opened up the door on KLN, they opened the door up,

[02:29:51.060 --> 02:29:53.320]
and we're getting ready to de-play in.

[02:29:53.460 --> 02:29:56.720]
And all of a sudden, we see three or four cops out there.

[02:29:56.920 --> 02:29:58.700]
They got the armed bands, police and all of a sudden,

[02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:02.240]
and they buzz about talking with the flight attendants,

[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:05.300]
and they tell everybody, go back, please sit down, have your passport ready,

[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:07.500]
and there was some guy that they dragged off of there.

[02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:09.540]
I will say this, he did come forward voluntarily,

[02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:11.680]
some dark, complex guy, but they said,

[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:13.420]
it's so and so on a plane, they came forward,

[02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:15.340]
they slept him off, and they let us off the plane.

[02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:16.020]
And it worked.

[02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:16.880]
Great.

[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:17.860]
And it worked, exactly.

[02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:23.640]
Listen, I'm sure you didn't watch the Democrats...

[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:26.200]
I did, I taped it and I watched it last night.

[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:29.460]
You know what the real shame is, and I know you've spoken about this,

[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:31.600]
it's at Great Length, and I'm with you.

[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.480]
You know, the whole Democratic Party is self-destructing.

[02:30:35.480 --> 02:30:37.740]
And for these candidates to come out,

[02:30:37.740 --> 02:30:39.460]
instead of talking about the issues,

[02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:42.860]
to turn around and to shoot down the frontliner,

[02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:44.840]
I mean, what is that doing?

[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:46.880]
Especially, especially Lieberman,

[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:49.180]
I thought his performance yesterday was so grotesque.

[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:52.380]
Of course, he's grotesque anyway, but his performance was so over the top.

[02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:53.240]
He's an asshole, man.

[02:30:53.540 --> 02:30:56.340]
And listen, one last thing is that I had to help me eat trache,

[02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:57.740]
if he cheeseburgers for lunch.

[02:30:58.100 --> 02:31:00.120]
Two last things, one, I rented Requiem,

[02:31:00.200 --> 02:31:01.140]
but I haven't seen it yet.

[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:01.700]
Please.

[02:31:02.380 --> 02:31:07.060]
And another thing is, there was a poll in the Washington Post

[02:31:07.060 --> 02:31:12.720]
that said that I believe it's 62 or 65 percent of all Americans.

[02:31:13.380 --> 02:31:18.260]
Now it does not matter if weapons of mass destruction are ever found in Iraq.

[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:21.400]
In other words, that means that those people don't care if we were lied to.

[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:25.320]
And you know what, I read that, and I was like, you know,

[02:31:25.940 --> 02:31:28.440]
this is why we went to war in the first place.

[02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:32.500]
And now all of a sudden, all those soldiers, all of those injuries, everything now,

[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:33.900]
it doesn't, it's all for naught.

[02:31:34.060 --> 02:31:34.680]
It doesn't matter.

[02:31:35.180 --> 02:31:37.900]
It feels easy to be fast and loose with somebody else's life.

[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:40.740]
And if you look at what this president is doing, okay,

[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:42.940]
the legislation that he's proposing now,

[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:45.460]
because in all of this money that he's spending on the war

[02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:47.600]
and everything else, this is all borrowed money people.

[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:51.060]
People that are bushwickers, this is all borrowed money.

[02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:52.180]
Take a look at the deficit.

[02:31:52.640 --> 02:31:55.500]
If you look at all the legislation that he's thinking about,

[02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:59.480]
it's only good for one year, which means that once he gets reelected,

[02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:02.380]
he will not renew what he plans on doing.

[02:32:03.100 --> 02:32:05.100]
And people need to really understand that.

[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:07.560]
They don't, they don't, and they won't, man.

[02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:09.060]
No, I like you.

[02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:10.240]
See it to border, thanks.

If you look onto the evening,

you can bid on my tune.

[02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:52.520]
What you shouldn't be buying,

[02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:55.680]
I'll blame it don't belong to you,

[02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:59.400]
and so I'll say, return my mother,

[02:34:00.860 --> 02:34:03.080]
I want it back,

[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:06.820]

and that's my dog,

[02:34:23.620 --> 02:34:24.940]
so buy a flaws,

[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:29.520]

[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:06.100]
to sell my teeth,

[02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:08.660]

[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:12.720]
return my mother,

[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:14.280]
what a five at five sixty,

[02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:17.180]
if you did buy Elvis's mower

[02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:19.420]
on the eBay on the internet,

[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:21.100]
what are you going to do with it?

[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:23.620]
Yeah, seriously, what are you going to do with a tooth?

[02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:25.880]
Oh, make a necklace out of it.

[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:28.540]
That's a great idea,

[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:29.580]
you can have a tooth,

[02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:31.500]
you can make a necklace made out of teeth

[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:32.780]
from all different celebrities,

[02:35:33.740 --> 02:35:34.500]
right, right,

[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:35.180]
and if you were gay,

[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:37.300]
you could be the tooth fairy.

[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:40.000]
Anyway, speaking of fairy,

[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:41.680]
some asshole sends me this facts,

[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:43.320]
in small letters it says,

[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:44.840]
oh, you know who this is?

[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:45.520]
Yeah, I do.

[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:46.720]
Dave Friedman.

[02:35:49.460 --> 02:35:50.200]
Am I wrong?

[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:51.000]
No, you're not.

[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:52.900]
And the reason I know that is,

[02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:54.260]
because of the teeny tiny print,

[02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:56.200]
he's the only one that ever does that.

[02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:57.740]
And then,

[02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:00.300]
there's a different header,

[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:01.560]
which is actually on the bottom,

[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:03.120]
which shows that it's not him,

[02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:03.940]
it's from another one.

[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:05.360]
And who's this?

[02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:06.160]
From the Guardian?

[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:06.980]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:08.580]
Well, anyway,

[02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:09.660]
and you already forgot to mention,

[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:11.180]
free spaghetti night at Pompato Park,

[02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:12.320]
then did I forget to mention that?

[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:12.420]
No.

[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:13.480]
Did I mention it in the spot?

[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:14.560]
Did I mention it twice?

[02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:16.100]
Did I talk about cemetery village

[02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:17.100]
and win more in those people?

[02:36:17.300 --> 02:36:18.780]
Don't steal the silverware at all.

[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:20.880]
Get lost, okay?

[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:21.820]
Few you, man.

[02:36:22.700 --> 02:36:24.400]
You know, there is something I do want to read,

[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:25.340]
and I read it on Friday,

[02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:26.260]
but nobody was in town,

[02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:27.460]
and so nobody was listening Friday,

[02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:28.340]
and I'm going to read it again.

[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:28.940]
Very short.

[02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:29.600]
Okay.

[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:31.620]
It's from the great Mike Walker

[02:36:31.620 --> 02:36:32.940]
at the National Inquirer.

[02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:35.320]
Jackson Brothers claim

[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:37.460]
a police brutality bogus writes, Mike.

[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:38.200]
It says,

[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:39.360]
do you mean Jackson?

[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:40.220]
Shut up.

[02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:42.440]
Despite your bizarre claim

[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:43.480]
that Santa Barbara cops

[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:44.840]
you label racist rednecks,

[02:36:44.980 --> 02:36:45.740]
roughed up brother Michael,

[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:47.900]
nobody laid a glove on the glove one,

[02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:49.180]
my inside sources insist.

[02:36:49.860 --> 02:36:51.200]
Remember on the only journalist

[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:52.160]
who's reported details

[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:53.140]
of the booking procedure,

[02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:55.100]
Michael describing his eye-colorist

[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:56.060]
chocolate, for example,

[02:36:56.460 --> 02:36:58.000]
and my sources sneer at your charge

[02:36:58.000 --> 02:36:59.840]
that he was very much mistreated physically.

[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:00.980]
In fact, they say,

[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:02.260]
Michael was so grateful

[02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:03.360]
for respectful treatment

[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:04.180]
that he had an assistant

[02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:06.020]
to deliver autograph photos of himself,

[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:07.560]
complete with holiday greetings

[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:08.720]
to the booking officers,

[02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:09.980]
which annoyed his lawyers,

[02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:10.780]
no endow here.

[02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:13.240]
My sources also say,

[02:37:13.300 --> 02:37:14.820]
Michael can't stand you, German,

[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.260]
and really speaks to you,

[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:17.380]
you distant years ago

[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:18.660]
with your notorious song,

[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:19.760]
word to the bed,

[02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:20.880]
snapping at Rose,

[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.300]
plastic surgery and weirdness,

[02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:22.820]
you warbled,

[02:37:23.140 --> 02:37:23.960]
once you were made,

[02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:25.060]
you changed your shade,

[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:26.080]
was your color wrong,

[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:27.220]
could not turn back,

[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:28.060]
it's an own fact

[02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:29.100]
you were too far gone.

[02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:30.860]
At the time, German,

[02:37:31.020 --> 02:37:31.700]
you called it an attempt

[02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:32.740]
to heal our relationship,

[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:34.540]
our today's outrageous lies,

[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:35.940]
your latest pathetic stab,

[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:36.960]
at healing,

[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:38.720]
Mike Walker with the Inquirer,

[02:37:38.820 --> 02:37:39.460]
wants to know.

[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:41.020]
Hi, Skawn Mike,

[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:41.600]
you go, boy.

[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:44.060]
I love the Inquirer.

[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:46.020]
See, there's a classical example,

[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:47.360]
you don't like it at the end of the debate,

[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:47.640]
but it's the case that

[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:48.360]
yesterday one of the last things

[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:49.760]
is they asked each of the candidates

[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:51.800]
to admit a mistake that he made,

[02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:52.340]
or she,

[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:53.820]
his account was the wrong,

[02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:55.820]
and they did,

[02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:56.720]
although, the Lieberman,

[02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:58.620]
of course, very, very wishy washy,

[02:37:58.740 --> 02:37:59.880]
and some silly as, you know,

[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:00.600]
pathetic.

[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:03.580]
But here's a mistake I made.

[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:04.820]
I used to diss the Inquirer.

[02:38:04.900 --> 02:38:05.640]
I used to think it was like

[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:07.040]
the star and the Tatler

[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:08.600]
and the weekly world news,

[02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:09.780]
all these other Tatloids.

[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:11.080]
And the fact that it matter is

[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:12.660]
that 99% of the time,

[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:13.700]
if it's any Inquirer,

[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:14.840]
like the Robert Blake story,

[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:15.380]
they broke it,

[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:15.900]
right?

[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:17.200]
They evolved.

[02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:18.260]
See, they got sued

[02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:19.120]
one too many times

[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:20.960]
and decided to, you know,

[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:22.040]
vet all their stories,

[02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:22.460]
henceforth.

[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:22.820]
Right.

[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:25.420]
And they do a great job of it, too.

[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:26.760]
The Worshland Ball story,

[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:27.620]
that's where I found it.

[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:29.000]
I remember somebody

[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:29.920]
dissed me for a,

[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:31.080]
oh, it's only in the National Enquirer,

[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:31.500]
remember that?

[02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:31.980]
Right.

[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:33.460]
And look what happened to him, huh?

[02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:35.140]
It'll teach you for a while.

[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:36.280]
By the way,

[02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:37.040]
wouldn't he come in back?

[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:38.680]
Any minute now.

[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:40.060]
Don't say that.

[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:42.300]
Five hundred and fifty votes

[02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:42.940]
on a poll,

[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:44.240]
the most overrated

[02:38:45.060 --> 02:38:46.620]
major celebrity of all time.

[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:48.420]
And there's no oldies on here,

[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:49.820]
you know, like Humphrey Bogart,

[02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:50.760]
not that he was overrated.

[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:51.760]
This is an example.

[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:52.940]
The only oldie on here,

[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:54.040]
I think is John Wayne, right?

[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:56.000]
Yeah, as far as, like,

[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:56.740]
real oldie yet.

[02:38:57.340 --> 02:38:58.180]
Although Bill Cosby.

[02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:00.440]
Oh, he's not in the same category

[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:02.120]
with John, with Mary and Wayne,

[02:39:02.420 --> 02:39:03.280]
whatever the hell his name was.

[02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:05.140]
Oprah Winfrey,

[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:06.080]
136.

[02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:07.540]
Nobody can touch her fat ass.

[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:08.540]
I'll tell you that right now.

[02:39:10.380 --> 02:39:11.740]
Barbara Streisand, 64.

[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:14.200]
Senior Cruz is in a death,

[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:15.960]
and she's in a good battle for third there.

[02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:16.460]
You know what?

[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:18.780]
In a, in a death clench.

[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:21.500]
She's got 47, Dr. Phil 44,

[02:39:21.740 --> 02:39:22.660]
and James Dean 43.

[02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:24.840]
The three of men separated by a hair.

[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:27.960]
And Dr. Phil wishes he had it.

[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:30.460]
Dick Clark, 22, Frank Sinatra, 21.

[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:31.920]
Jerry Lewis, 14.

[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:34.560]
A lady, the flag of the Schmigel.

[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:36.200]
Woody Allen, 13.

[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:37.240]
Jim Carrey, 13.

[02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:38.480]
Elvis Presley, 13.

[02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:40.140]
Larry King, 11.

[02:39:40.140 --> 02:39:41.280]
Jerry Seinfeld, 11.

[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:42.100]
Andy Copp and 10.

[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:43.300]
Everybody else single digits.

[02:39:43.660 --> 02:39:45.140]
So you have to ask yourself the question,

[02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:45.780]
would Jerry Lewis?

[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:48.660]
And what point did we start to really hate him?

[02:39:49.300 --> 02:39:50.540]
Because I like Martin and Lewis.

[02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:51.620]
I mean, of course, I'm an old fart.

[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:52.360]
They were on television.

[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:54.980]
And you generally speak like almost everything that was on TV,

[02:39:54.980 --> 02:39:55.960]
because it was on, you know?

[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:57.400]
It's not like he had a lot of choices.

[02:39:57.960 --> 02:39:58.660]
I'd say color.

[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:01.400]
Color changes color.

[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:02.120]
No one.

[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:03.820]
When he made a color movie.

[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:06.100]
When those, those black and white movies were kind of funny.

[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:06.760]
Yeah.

[02:40:08.660 --> 02:40:09.560]
Color ruined him.

[02:40:11.180 --> 02:40:12.080]
I don't understand.

[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:13.000]
No, this is going to be missing.

[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:13.700]
I'm going to be missing the crap up.

[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:14.520]
You said at what point?

[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:15.980]
I just had to choose a point.

[02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:18.040]
You're missing, uh, very well.

[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:24.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:27.220]
I think when his head, I'm not talking about when he got sick

[02:40:27.220 --> 02:40:28.520]
and his head started getting fat.

[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:30.580]
Just when his head started getting fat or in general.

[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:33.400]
At that point, we started turning on him.

[02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:35.940]
WQA-N, not there.

[02:40:36.260 --> 02:40:36.920]
WQA-N, hello.

[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:38.200]
Uh, Neil?

[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:39.080]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:40.260]
How are you today?

[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:41.480]
I'm OK, sir.

[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:42.600]
Happy New Year.

[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:43.900]
And the same to you.

[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:45.420]
Uh, I have two for you.

[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:47.820]
How about Rosie O'Kall and Rosie Anno Bigger?

[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:49.260]
OK.

[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:51.040]
You know, Rosie and Vah?

[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:52.140]
Yeah, I got a vote.

[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:53.300]
OK, thank you for your boring.

[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:54.420]
I mean, your great call.

[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:56.860]
Well, was that a put on or was that for real?

[02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:57.560]
That's not a put on.

[02:40:57.620 --> 02:40:58.160]
It was like real, yeah.

[02:40:58.660 --> 02:40:58.860]
Ted.

[02:40:59.640 --> 02:40:59.980]
No.

[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:01.600]
It's not like Ted on Doggie Downers.

[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:03.560]
Are we, do we want to put them on there?

[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:05.080]
Rosie O'Kall, I guess so.

[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:06.980]
They're on all these kind of polls, you know.

[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:08.540]
Rosie, have already on there.

[02:41:09.340 --> 02:41:10.140]
She is?

[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:12.000]
That's not your ethics.

[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:14.820]
Roseanne Barr is already on there?

[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:15.820]
Yeah, that was my pick.

[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:19.380]
Oh, I see Dennis Miller's got one.

[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:20.720]
Well, where the hell is Roseanne Barr?

[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:21.240]
I don't see her.

[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:21.740]
How many she got?

[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:24.420]
Oh, she's already got five.

[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:25.080]
Excellent choice.

[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:30.960]
She's tied with Ashton Eshton the Coocher and Britney Spears and Bill Cosby and John Wayne.

[02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:32.160]
What a group.

[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:37.740]
Why would you like to have a party with John Wayne, Bill Cosby, Ashton Coocher, Roseanne Barr and Britney Spears?

[02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:38.400]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:39.580]
I'll bring the dip.

[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:42.240]
Wait, the phone's already there.

[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:44.560]
By the way, the good news is Britney got a quick enalman.

[02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:49.860]
O'Kall, she was just a little bit in a party in a festive kind of a mood and said, let's tie it up.

[02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:52.740]
You know, Miguel brought up a good point during a break.

[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:53.020]
He popped.

[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:53.260]
Really?

[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:56.580]
Said if he was the guy, he'd be going to divorce court.

[02:41:57.740 --> 02:42:00.500]
Maybe she'll be on with Judge Judy next week with the two men.

[02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:01.100]
Settlement.

[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:04.180]
And Miguel cut the crap, okay?

[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:07.320]
I'm surprised he wasn't in her screaming about Celia Cruz.

[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:10.720]
Seriously, he was what just got into it.

[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:16.360]
He said his family was psychotic with me because what we both said about Celia Cruz.

[02:42:16.540 --> 02:42:17.300]
He was like that.

[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:17.540]
He was like that.

[02:42:17.540 --> 02:42:18.420]
But they wouldn't tell me.

[02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:20.620]
I'm Celia Cruz and I am dead now.

[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:22.880]
I got a re-number when I was alive.

[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:24.700]
I will need to do the live-loin with it.

[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:25.160]
I will do it.

[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:28.140]
I will do it.

[02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:28.140]

[02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:31.660]
Twelve minutes after one at five, sixty W. Cooom.

[02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:33.780]
Here's another great spot for you for balance for life.

[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:35.560]
In fact, they're going to be getting more attention now.

[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:37.680]
I can't do that.

[02:42:37.780 --> 02:42:39.780]
Dr. Atkins maybe changing his tune.

[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:43.160]
Oh my God.

[02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:44.920]
What kind of a spot is this, Troy?

[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:46.580]
Are you out of your mind or what?

[02:42:46.660 --> 02:42:47.380]
Oh Jesus.

[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:51.120]
I think too much comedy when I'm young girls at that Christmas party.

[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:52.980]
That's what put Troy a stratford over the edge.

[02:42:53.260 --> 02:42:53.860]
That's what I'm hearing.

[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:56.780]
But the good news is that this stratford is back with us.

[02:42:57.040 --> 02:42:57.780]
How is Doreen doing?

[02:42:57.780 --> 02:42:58.280]
Is Doreen seeing her?

[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:03.260]
Anyway, if a lot of people out there have made losing weight

[02:43:03.260 --> 02:43:05.380]
as their New Year's resolution, which we do every year,

[02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:07.420]
it's the same old stuff and then you still stay fat,

[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:09.420]
maybe you can pack out a few more pounds, you're packing it.

[02:43:09.820 --> 02:43:11.760]
Balance for life could be the answer that you're looking for.

[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:12.420]
Quit tittering.

[02:43:12.820 --> 02:43:14.400]
It's the convenient affordable weight loss

[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:15.960]
and you need healthy gourmet meal service delivery.

[02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:16.980]
You've heard so much about it.

[02:43:17.220 --> 02:43:18.980]
Too busy to eat right, too tired to cook tonight.

[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:19.860]
No time for shopping.

[02:43:20.260 --> 02:43:20.920]
Hate doing the dishes.

[02:43:21.180 --> 02:43:22.480]
Tired of that afternoon drowsiness.

[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:24.640]
You feel they're about to crawl up like a ball on the corner

[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:25.480]
and sleep for hours.

[02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:26.600]
No time for the gym.

[02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:29.020]
Is he still making noise, Josh?

[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:29.680]
Yes.

[02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:30.980]
Why?

[02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:34.360]
I don't know.

[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:38.240]
Balance for life is the answer you're looking for.

[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:41.680]
And don't forget, and now the famous dr. Rackens is changing his tune.

[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.520]
In his new book, The Age Defined Diet Revolutiony Talks

[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:47.060]
exclusively about zone-based principles.

[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:49.460]
And of course, Balance for Life is based on the zone diet.

[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:53.980]
Dr. Barry Sears, no kind of gene series or Brian Sears or even J Sears.

[02:43:54.880 --> 02:43:55.440]
Here's the deal.

[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:58.160]
They bring you a little black sack by six o'clock in the morning

[02:43:58.160 --> 02:43:59.320]
right here at Door at Homer work.

[02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:01.160]
And in there's all the food you need for the whole day.

[02:44:01.260 --> 02:44:04.540]
Three gourmet meals, hormonally balanced, two delicious snacks,

[02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:06.060]
and even a 60 ounce bottle of water.

[02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:07.320]
It's there by six o'clock.

[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:09.740]
All the food you need for the week, the only choice you have to make

[02:44:09.740 --> 02:44:12.700]
is between two alternatives for each meal every day that's run a program.

[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:13.460]
You fill out the menu.

[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:15.780]
They bring you to food and the weight just pours off your body.

[02:44:16.260 --> 02:44:17.820]
I think maybe you need a hormonal balance.

[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:21.580]
And then their on-stab dietitian will consult with you weekly to guarantee you lose the weight

[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:22.740]
and continue to succeed.

[02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:26.520]
So get started for real on the New Year's resolution right now.

[02:44:26.660 --> 02:44:29.220]
Did I mention Katrina Lusk 15 pounds? She's doing great.

[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:29.980]
She's a sweetheart.

This is Sports Radio 560.

[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:48.120]
You ain't who I am.

[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:56.940]
N-N-N-G-A-Y-S-U-C-K-S.

[02:44:59.540 --> 02:45:01.340]
The 80s are back.

[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:02.040]
They are?

[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:02.420]
Uh-huh.

[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:05.180]
And 50s Funny Man Jerry Lewis is too.

[02:45:05.340 --> 02:45:05.960]
Are you sure?

[02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:06.940]
Well, kind of.

[02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:11.660]
And now the 50s meet the 80s to form a supergroup for the new millennium.

[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:14.600]
Introducing Jerry Lewis and the news.

[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:17.700]
Hey lady, the heart of rock and roll.

[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:20.160]
Heart of rock and roll is still beating.

[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:23.680]
With the Benz or Coles and the AR then Cleveland.

[02:45:24.020 --> 02:45:28.260]
Already with Shipwagon and the flagl and all those places.

[02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:30.940]
The King of Comedy is about to become the Prince of Pop.

[02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:33.340]
It's Jerry Lewis and the news.

[02:45:33.460 --> 02:45:36.340]
Hey lady, please I like a new drug.

[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:37.900]
No need those plays.

[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:40.920]
It is a nice man who promises typewriter.

[02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:42.460]
And the white goat plays.

[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:46.220]
Hey, it's hip to be square.

[02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:48.280]
And it's even hipper to buy something round.

[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:51.760]
Like the new CD from Jerry Lewis and the news.

[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:52.560]
Available.

[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:54.800]
You can find it wherever find records.

[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:57.200]
It's all with the nice man behind the cow.

[02:45:57.360 --> 02:45:59.920]
They have you find it with the nice lady.

[02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.160]
Parsam okay.

[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:02.320]
Okay.

[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:02.640]
Okay.

[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:03.600]
118.

[02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:06.660]
You know, Chris must be psychic because the bit that it says here that well,

[02:46:06.660 --> 02:46:08.140]
he wants to hear which I'll play in the next break.

[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:09.400]
I had that cute up.

[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:10.060]
How do you like that?

[02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:13.240]
And then I thought well, I did our Jerry Lewis have it or play some Jerry Lewis thing

[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:14.420]
because we're just bitching about him.

[02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:16.640]
So that was actually cute up.

[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:18.480]
There you go.

[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:19.660]
Shocking man.

[02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:21.660]
Those psychic who says I'm not in touch.

[02:46:21.660 --> 02:46:22.400]
I touched this.

[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:24.500]
Anyway, speaking of Ms. Fudge.

[02:46:26.940 --> 02:46:28.320]
What the hell day was this?

[02:46:28.420 --> 02:46:28.820]
Oh, Friday.

[02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:29.920]
Well, Friday ain't that long.

[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:30.780]
Go it's only three days.

[02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:35.040]
Ask the vote for a Democratic presidential nominee if the election were held today.

[02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:40.040]
Twice as many registered Democrats would choose Vermont Governor Howard Dean over John Kirich.

[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:41.260]
Twenty two to ten percent.

[02:46:41.980 --> 02:46:42.720]
Lieberman nine.

[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:43.880]
Wesley Clark eight.

[02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:45.140]
Got it.

[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:46.460]
Got it.

[02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:48.100]
Let's see.

[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:50.300]
Dick Gibhard, ten percent for Dick.

[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:53.320]
I see if Dean didn't run.

[02:46:54.020 --> 02:46:59.340]
Fourteen percent for Kirich, thirteen for Clark, twelve percent for Lieberman and ten percent for Dick.

[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:03.060]
Now in direct matchups against W. Wait till you're this.

[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:04.920]
Voters would vote this way.

[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:08.920]
This is a poll taken by time CNN December 30th in January 1st.

[02:47:09.980 --> 02:47:12.580]
Bush 51 percent, Dean 46 percent.

[02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:15.160]
Pretty close.

[02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:19.160]
Bush over Lieberman, I don't believe this one, 52 to 46.

[02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:20.720]
That's the live factor.

[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:21.160]
Right.

[02:47:21.460 --> 02:47:22.920]
There's a lot of that going around.

[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:26.000]
Bush over Carrie 54 to 43 percent.

[02:47:26.140 --> 02:47:27.880]
Bush over Gibhard 53 to 44.

[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:30.300]
Bush over Clark 53 to 43.

[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:33.080]
And Bush over John Edwards 53 to 43.

[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:35.500]
I think John Edwards out across over or across dress.

[02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:36.320]
Just go away.

[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:36.620]
Right.

[02:47:37.140 --> 02:47:41.700]
He's just a not a real Juleing Yahoo, but like a somewhat Juleing Yahoo.

[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:42.400]
You know what I mean?

[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:43.400]
It's a little bit of a drill.

[02:47:43.960 --> 02:47:44.600]
One strand.

[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:46.640]
Don't like it.

[02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:47.960]
And there's also a story.

[02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:57.820]
I don't want to read no bedtime stories, but there's a story on our website you must read today from the Scotland Sunday, Harold Sodom's capture was a deal, broken behind the scenes.

[02:47:58.060 --> 02:48:00.180]
Can I read just a couple of it'll make you puke?

[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:00.520]
Okay.

[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:04.940]
Well, the reason I say puke is that the patriotic union of Kurdistan, P.U.K.

[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:06.900]
Yeah, I call it puke.

[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:16.940]
Rumors that the crucial Kurdish role in the capture of Saddam have persisted, even though it now seems they're previously euphoric spokesmen have now been afflicted by an inexplicable bout of reticence.

[02:48:17.020 --> 02:48:19.460]
In some of the words they're not talking like the Americans as well.

[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:26.600]
It was the two weeks ago that the Sunday hero revealed how a Kurdish special forces unit belonging to the patriotic union of Kurdistan, P.U.K.

[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:33.300]
had spearheaded and tracked down Saddam, seething off the Aldoar farmhouse long before the arrival of the U.S. forces.

[02:48:34.340 --> 02:48:42.200]
P.U.K. leader, Jalal Talabani, it's chosen to leak the news in details of the operations commander, Kusrut Rasul Ali, the Iranian media.

[02:48:42.380 --> 02:48:47.080]
Long before Saddam's capture was reported by the mainstream western press or confirmed by the U.S. military.

[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:56.580]
By the time western press agencies are running the same story, the entire emphasis had changed that were in the Ausged Iraqi president, then had been captured in a raid by U.S. forces back by Kurdish.

[02:48:56.580 --> 02:49:00.520]
Does something you might want to read on our website? Believe it or not, I believe it.

[02:49:01.260 --> 02:49:05.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, how we come up with those 600 votes, huh?

[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:12.800]
5, 100 and 84. See how that's your off the oak too easy.

[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:16.340]
Like sliding off a log. Yeah.

[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:21.420]
Mandog is back at 2 today and it's about time. Jesus Christ, he's been on vacation for months.

[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:26.280]
3 months and months and months, a lot of stress, a lot of pressure. At least you don't have any pressure, no mo.

[02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:30.880]
Michigan got their ass kicked. Dolphins didn't make the playoffs, so we ought to be really mellow today.

[02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:37.160]
The Boehmister, Kim Boe camper for the Humper at 4 from Shulis Day 2, because the Humper is like a little scratchy.

[02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:42.380]
Maybe Hank, if he's got the scratchy throat, maybe he can start doing a feral thing.

[02:49:43.660 --> 02:49:49.320]
Good point. Hey stupid. Hey stupid. Hey stupid. I can hear it.

[02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:57.460]
Give it a shot, Humper. WQM. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I got someone for your list. How about Wayne Newton?

[02:49:58.180 --> 02:50:02.000]
He's on there. He's not doing too well though. I can't believe it. Oh really unbelievable.

[02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:04.920]
He ought to be giving over. He ought to be giving that bitch your run for her money.

[02:50:04.920 --> 02:50:10.720]
Okay buddy. Thanks a lot pal. Have a great year. How is he doing Wayne Newton?

[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:19.040]
Nine. Oh and speaking of nine. That the Robert Grieper resume that you've faxed me before.

[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:21.620]
Yeah. Where did that come from? The fax machine.

[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:26.700]
Oh somebody faxed it to us? Yes. So Robert Grieper is shopping his resume around.

[02:50:26.860 --> 02:50:31.780]
He's looking at the monster com. I guess I shouldn't have said that.

[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:36.460]
Why not? Okay. Why would you not want to say that?

[02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:41.320]
The lawyers might want to check out Robert Grieper's resume. Right. And?

[02:50:41.700 --> 02:50:44.640]
Well you just try. If you put it on there, then you're just giving him some help.

[02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:47.720]
You're giving him some help like right out the door.

[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:51.260]
Oh right. It's time for him to go. We don't like his attitude.

[02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:55.780]
He's a little overqualified for this kind of a slumber job.

[02:50:55.780 --> 02:50:59.640]
Just like the person you told me emailed and said wanted to come in.

[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:02.760]
Do what? Like the assistant producer or what was that? Yeah.

[02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:07.320]
Responding to some postings that we had about a producer and a part time.

[02:51:07.400 --> 02:51:10.200]
I mean I was thinking about that. That somebody I knew in Kalamazoo Michigan.

[02:51:10.420 --> 02:51:15.320]
Let's see 35 years ago. That person would be like in their 50s now.

[02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:17.700]
Perfect for entry level.

[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:23.700]
Wow. I was glad Paris the thought.

[02:51:23.700 --> 02:51:28.520]
Go and you can go. Hello. Hey George. Yes, sir. Happy New Year.

[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:31.620]
And the same to you. So you want to talk to Neil? Yes, please.

[02:51:31.900 --> 02:51:35.400]
Where you're calling from? Call spring. Here's a call from Carl spring. Hello.

[02:51:36.100 --> 02:51:41.120]
You know, I fall for that. I know. I love it. Yeah. I got two two for your fall.

[02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:44.560]
Go ahead. Bob Hope. Elizabeth Taylor.

[02:51:45.140 --> 02:51:48.700]
Bob hopes somebody on there. Not good. He's moving up. He's starting to move up.

[02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:53.540]
I love that. Yeah. She is such a drunken slob man.

[02:51:53.620 --> 02:51:56.940]
You all time. Exactly. She makes me sick. Thanks a lot, pal.

[02:51:56.940 --> 02:51:59.560]
I have a good day. Then you two. Good day.

[02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:04.160]
Liz Taylor, man. Now I don't know. I mean, she was attractive once upon a time.

[02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:08.140]
Was she really a great actress? And no. Like who's afraid of Virginia?

[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:11.900]
Well, that wasn't really acting. That was her.

[02:52:12.140 --> 02:52:15.400]
Or they just being drunk and fighting. Right. Like I said, that was just her.

[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:20.000]
Her dick. Right. That was like a whole movie. She's one of those people.

[02:52:20.180 --> 02:52:22.340]
There's so many of those people. They just were all look at that.

[02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:27.060]
596 votes, dammit. Like I said, if we don't get to a thousand by 130.

[02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:34.200]
But they really, when it gets to the light, see,

[02:52:34.280 --> 02:52:39.320]
used to be the other way around on our polls. Always the, you know, the response would peter off as we go along.

[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:43.800]
We're adding a few more names on here. But now it's kind of like they want to like ensure.

[02:52:43.800 --> 02:52:46.700]
They want to make so damn sure that you're not on the rest of the week.

[02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:49.720]
I think there's a message there, not in the chain emails I'm sending out.

[02:52:50.460 --> 02:52:52.840]
Right. Oh, is that what it is? Good. Good choice.

[02:52:53.580 --> 02:52:56.420]
Look at that. The Dow is up 94 in the NASDAQ. Up 29.

[02:52:56.700 --> 02:53:01.060]
The economy is making a great comeback. There aren't too many people dying every day in Iraq.

[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:03.980]
And things are just beautiful. What's not to like? You know,

[02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:07.660]
the deficit is only like trillions and billions.

[02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:12.300]
And once we get up our, our military up there on Mars, how can we never got those pictures?

[02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:14.920]
I've been watching for that. Did you ever see him?

[02:53:15.020 --> 02:53:19.600]
I know. They sit around noon today. We were going to get the first color pictures from Mars.

[02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:21.280]
Didn't see him.

[02:53:23.580 --> 02:53:24.760]
We'll keep our eyes peeled.

[02:53:25.940 --> 02:53:28.680]
We're going to have a car and truck of the year. I bet you that new six generation of vet.

[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:31.540]
I bet you that's going to be the car of the year. That's not it though. What is that?

[02:53:32.940 --> 02:53:38.480]
Engine. Now it could probably fit inside the bed of a massive F-154 pickup truck and for it said.

[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:40.360]
That's that's what it is. What is that? I don't know.

[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:43.320]
I don't know. The D is the key to its economic future.

[02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:48.220]
The previous F-150 model is the best selling vehicle in America.

[02:53:48.800 --> 02:53:54.100]
With dynamic Chrysler sales down 4% last year, the company hopes to spark sales with a number of new vehicles,

The

[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:17.780]
I thought I could get a decent farmer

[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:22.640]
But dinner on my boner is a bummer

[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:25.880]
And now my lap is full of crap

[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:29.360]
Cause my monster take off your tonsils, fill your guts

[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:31.760]
Puking on my nuts

[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:36.920]
I was hoping for a decent BJ

[02:56:38.020 --> 02:56:41.580]
But now I am wearing Chinese buffet

[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.200]
All my moans were getting louder

[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:48.500]
Now my lap looks like cranchotter nasty slut

[02:56:49.700 --> 02:56:50.920]
Puking on my nuts

[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:04.420]
I should have held back my thrust

[02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:05.460]
You lost your lunch

[02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:08.100]
Now my luck has turned to disgust

[02:57:08.940 --> 02:57:10.200]
Puking on my nuts

[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:15.320]
Puking on my nuts

[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:16.780]
Puking on my nuts

132.560 WQM

[02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:22.500]
I whistle a tune for like 10 seconds while I pipe in a routine a little bit

[02:57:36.540 --> 02:57:36.960]
Okay

[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:42.320]
The reason I did that is because this story from the nation will affront you dig chaining

[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:44.660]
Yes, you just fangs me

[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:46.620]
I read this story a couple of days ago

[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:49.820]
I don't know whether you had this on our website or if I put it on there over a week ago

[02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:51.300]
I don't know if I did a lot of drugs

[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:52.960]
So I just emailed it to Eric

[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:55.780]
It'll be on the website either today or tomorrow whenever he decides to put it on

[02:57:55.780 --> 02:57:57.640]
It's pretty fascinating stuff

[02:57:58.680 --> 02:57:59.480]
About your vice

[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:01.640]
Maybe that's why they call them the vice president

[02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:03.900]
He's a crook

[02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:09.040]
I don't start that again Neil, you're having such a good day. Don't start the bush-bashing and chaining-bashing and the Nazi-bashing

[02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:13.220]
Okay, please add lies and vanilla to this somebody says and that's an excellent choice

[02:58:13.220 --> 02:58:15.360]
Especially right on the ass-hand of Liz Taylor

[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:17.560]
What a what a good Cornell of that is, huh?

[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:19.200]
Narotic drunk

[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:20.700]
Wash down

[02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:24.280]
Man, just wish they would both go to hell away

[02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:27.340]
Who is the most overrated major celebrity of all time?

[02:58:27.500 --> 02:58:28.740]
They can't touch you Oprah

[02:58:28.740 --> 02:58:32.400]
You're in the leak of your own baby. 141 say Oprah

[02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:35.100]

Bob Hossone got 6

[02:59:08.660 --> 02:59:11.900]
That's amazing. That's the sympathy factor

[02:59:11.900 --> 02:59:14.520]
He just croaked, although Sid he don't get the same sympathy factor

[02:59:15.300 --> 02:59:16.880]
Because they really hate her

[02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:21.180]
Britney's got 6, John Wayne's 6, Sherry and Axton Kutcher each have 6

[02:59:21.180 --> 02:59:24.820]

She's got 2, Jamie D Curtis 2, Ellen DeGenerer 2

Which I can never figure that out

[02:59:48.460 --> 02:59:51.180]
No votes for Will Smith or Liz Taylor

[02:59:52.780 --> 02:59:54.440]

And the other one for Almond, if you have it, you have Joan Rivers

[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:36.060]
Joan Rivers is good

[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:37.940]
I can't stand it

[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:39.940]
Okay, thanks a lot, Pally, have a great day

[03:00:39.940 --> 03:00:40.820]
Thank you, you're welcome

[03:00:41.260 --> 03:00:44.760]
Joan Rivers is good especially if you happen to a channel serving Kermakross

[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:46.600]
That the shopping channel

[03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:50.540]
She's always on their pedaling something, man, she just, I don't know

[03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:54.260]
And again, she's somebody I used to like a little bit but then she did just too much

[03:00:54.260 --> 03:00:54.560]
She took

[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:58.180]
Go away Joan, take your money, take your jewelry, take your dad husband

[03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:02.840]
And go away, go away Joan

[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:05.440]
Used to be really, you know, she was funny in her time

[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:06.940]
But her father killed himself

[03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:09.500]
Really? Oh, there's Wesley Clark, what's he saying?

[03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:13.740]
What's up? The $50,000 or less and two children or more

[03:01:13.740 --> 03:01:15.780]
Then you should put away your checkbook

[03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:18.860]
You won't owe the government a diamond income tax

[03:01:18.860 --> 03:01:19.880]
Okay, it sounds good to me

[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:22.220]
Now, how come he wasn't there yesterday in Iowa?

[03:01:22.540 --> 03:01:24.740]
Even Jewelieberman who's not participating in the Iowa caucuses

[03:01:25.380 --> 03:01:27.360]
Even he was there because he just won't show up

[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:29.940]
He's the, he's the hatchet man

[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:33.120]
He's the guy that they've sent out there to like go after and get Dean

[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:34.380]
The attack man

[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:36.180]
The attack dog

[03:01:36.180 --> 03:01:36.780]
The kill man

[03:01:36.780 --> 03:01:39.340]
Right, that's a Jewelieberman, makes me sick

[03:01:39.900 --> 03:01:40.620]
WQAM, hello

[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:41.860]
Hello Neil

[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:42.660]
Yes sir

[03:01:42.660 --> 03:01:43.580]
How you doing buddy?

[03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:44.580]
Great, Pellie

[03:01:44.580 --> 03:01:46.640]
Hey, how about uh, river feeding?

[03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:49.020]
How about him, he's still dead

[03:01:49.020 --> 03:01:51.340]
I know, that's what you're talking about already

[03:01:51.340 --> 03:01:52.220]
Hey, and go bush

[03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:56.140]
Oh excellent, what a good quenella

[03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:01.140]
567-0560, by the way, CEDA will be over a couple of hours for some of Gwakomoli

[03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:04.100]
CEDA Cruz is really Cuban

[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:05.960]
Right, yeah

[03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:07.440]
Now, what about Carmen Miranda?

[03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:09.320]
I don't know

[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:11.000]
Is that embarrassing?

[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:13.560]
With all the LLLFruit on her head?

[03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:14.460]
You'd think, right?

[03:02:14.740 --> 03:02:16.480]
But she might have been some kind of a South American

[03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:19.720]
I think she was like Brazilian, Carmen Miranda

[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:21.920]
Somebody will know, I have some stick out there, though

[03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:25.460]
So I don't think Brazilian, but uh, why Brazilian speak Portuguese?

[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:27.040]
See, really?

[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:27.520]
Yes

[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:28.660]
I'll be damned

[03:02:29.260 --> 03:02:30.540]
She sure knew her fruit

[03:02:32.580 --> 03:02:34.680]
Kind of like Lynn Samuel, sure knew her fruit

[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:36.200]
WQAM

[03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:39.000]
Yes sir, right here

[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:40.300]
Thank you

[03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:41.220]
Yes sir

[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:42.800]
How about Tom Arnold?

[03:02:43.940 --> 03:02:47.280]
Tom Arnold's a good choice, I think he got a lot of hoards, but he's got no talent

[03:02:48.200 --> 03:02:49.060]
Exactly, thank you

[03:02:49.060 --> 03:02:50.680]
Thank you so much, and have a good day

[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:54.080]
567-0560, pound 56, how about Wayne Arnold?

[03:02:54.240 --> 03:02:55.440]
No, we like Wayne, Wayne's a good guy

[03:02:56.340 --> 03:02:58.160]
He's had a problem or two here along the way

[03:02:58.160 --> 03:02:59.880]
He's had a bumpy rocky road, but he's a good man

[03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:01.120]
In fact, maybe he'll bring in some food

[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:03.100]
Don't forget what I'm there, no food, man

[03:03:04.040 --> 03:03:04.640]
Don't worry

[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:06.300]
No food

[03:03:06.900 --> 03:03:07.620]
No problem

[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:08.640]
Really?

[03:03:09.060 --> 03:03:09.420]
Really?

[03:03:09.900 --> 03:03:10.440]
Well, that's good

[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:13.640]
Then keep Joe Castello out of there, too, because even if he just makes a cameo appearance

[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:15.620]
He always demands free food

[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:17.380]
I like you, I used to like Joe a lot better

[03:03:18.980 --> 03:03:21.620]
567, especially after that, fast you sent him about him

[03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:23.360]
That was sad, I didn't know that

[03:03:23.840 --> 03:03:27.040]
I don't even remember what that was about, it was something that turned into a warm-ongering

[03:03:27.700 --> 03:03:32.060]
Oh yeah, warm-ongering, Joe Castello, that we thought was a pretty head-on screwed-on straight

[03:03:32.060 --> 03:03:34.780]
Well, maybe it's all of them drugs that you keep peddling to him

[03:03:34.780 --> 03:03:35.600]
Hey, now

[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:37.100]
Oh, that's right, you're giving them

[03:03:38.060 --> 03:03:38.680]
WQAM, hello

[03:03:39.540 --> 03:03:42.700]
Not really, and after the buddy's a drug addict, flush wind bump

[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.120]
Yeah, I'll come be doing a liberty

[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:47.480]
How come we don't have him on the list?

[03:03:49.460 --> 03:03:49.620]
Hi

[03:03:49.620 --> 03:03:52.780]
Thank you, sir, I guess we're all the time we're just kicking, how could we forget?

[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:53.240]
Thank you

[03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:54.680]
Well, how could we forget, Rush?

[03:03:55.640 --> 03:03:56.800]
What is wrong with us?

[03:03:57.240 --> 03:03:58.500]
Because he's on all these lists

[03:03:59.540 --> 03:04:01.740]
Yeah, but this is all encompassing

[03:04:01.740 --> 03:04:03.880]
That's why I like this list today, because we've never done...

[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:07.340]
You know, we could have like the broadcast or TV person

[03:04:07.340 --> 03:04:11.600]
We've never done one the most over-rated media celebrity of all time, which covers everybody

[03:04:12.340 --> 03:04:15.600]
Everybody who's like somebody, like a big somebody, like a contender

[03:04:16.540 --> 03:04:21.120]
Rush Limbaugh, I think it's beautiful that we waited to like almost be in any call to remind us

[03:04:21.120 --> 03:04:24.880]
Because you'll see him Rush right up that list, believe me

[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:28.800]
Trust me when I tell you, if anybody can give that bitch a battle for her money

[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:30.460]
What does Pete Rose again, the interest in...

[03:04:30.460 --> 03:04:33.060]
...cogography that he did that on the...

[03:04:33.060 --> 03:04:34.620]
Hey Pete, you're a scumbag, baby

[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:41.240]
We're sports radio 560, ju-a-m

[03:04:46.300 --> 03:04:47.340]
Yeah, yeah

[03:04:47.340 --> 03:04:49.920]
Did I get something? It's a charge of fault

[03:04:50.460 --> 03:04:51.380]
Okay, well, there's a...

[03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:53.580]
There you are, I'm back

[03:04:54.560 --> 03:04:57.200]
Like I said, let's just dispense with it

[03:04:57.200 --> 03:04:59.460]
You bitch, you slut, you whore

[03:05:00.300 --> 03:05:04.760]
An Amos Rosio Goddo, I know what I stand for, I own the name

[03:05:04.760 --> 03:05:07.960]
I created it, I will always own the name

[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:13.740]
Better than I do think that as a good name, a bad name, or what it kind of takes to you is your own conclusion

[03:05:14.300 --> 03:05:18.040]
His rules again, it feels good

[03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:24.660]
It is not a crime to have a latitude

[03:05:25.660 --> 03:05:31.020]
But all sweet Jesus, what a mouth she's got in

[03:05:31.020 --> 03:05:36.200]
Trash in her place, and not giving a squat

[03:05:36.200 --> 03:05:42.720]
The Rose is dreaming else, she cannot deny the fact

[03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:45.940]
She's silent, the contract

[03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:52.680]
There's no bail, it is now right up the end

[03:05:52.680 --> 03:05:57.420]
But why the hell did Rose be need, a goofy fantasy

[03:05:59.500 --> 03:06:05.460]
Well, a TV show was hot and it was, can't get out

[03:06:05.460 --> 03:06:10.860]
She even had movie stunts, I'm cruise-cut in her grasp

[03:06:11.680 --> 03:06:18.020]
Oh, but it all went away, and now it's the horror of mine

[03:06:19.200 --> 03:06:26.000]
Rose is a bitch, ill-moded, and an even bigger one at night

[03:06:27.820 --> 03:06:32.360]
144.560, this is a great fact, since it's a great Nobel laureate in economic Joseph Stiglitz

[03:06:32.360 --> 03:06:38.060]
The Bush administration is borrowing a billion dollars a day plus interest just to keep this country afloat

[03:06:38.060 --> 03:06:41.860]
All I can say is that it's a damn shame we can't borrow the money from rooms to go

[03:06:41.860 --> 03:06:44.540]
At least then the interest wouldn't start till June of 2006

[03:06:46.320 --> 03:06:48.960]
And Paul suggested Madonna, they say

[03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:51.260]
How come we don't have a Donna on there?

[03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:53.400]
We do, do we now?

[03:06:53.880 --> 03:06:56.740]
We'll see a lot of these that are like you said on all the polls eventually

[03:06:56.740 --> 03:07:00.240]
And as soon as we got around them, I'm surprised Rush hasn't got any votes yet

[03:07:00.860 --> 03:07:03.740]
Out of 658, wait till I get home

[03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:10.100]
Here's one that says I can't believe that Ugly Jennifer Lopez's name hasn't made the list yet

[03:07:10.100 --> 03:07:13.360]
She's so disgusting and her dumb boyfriend Ben off-locked, the real-a-duck

[03:07:14.260 --> 03:07:15.440]
Did we put him on there?

[03:07:15.900 --> 03:07:17.400]
I did, I spelled it right too

[03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:18.220]
And her?

[03:07:18.680 --> 03:07:19.080]
Her?

[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:20.440]
Alright, excellent

[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:23.880]
Now this other page, this bothers me

[03:07:24.300 --> 03:07:27.940]
Jay Leno, I'll go along with that, no problem, no talent, just a big chin

[03:07:28.540 --> 03:07:29.620]
But Steve Allen?

[03:07:31.500 --> 03:07:33.460]
Yeah, I hope we didn't put Steve Allen on there

[03:07:34.100 --> 03:07:34.900]
Sure, I said all of them

[03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:35.420]
Why?

[03:07:36.860 --> 03:07:40.300]
Steve Allen was the most overrated major celebrity of all time

[03:07:40.300 --> 03:07:42.540]
Some of us young actors don't remember anything

[03:07:42.540 --> 03:07:47.140]
And Addy, he was one of the great innovators of television with a tonight show and with his Sunday night show

[03:07:47.140 --> 03:07:48.240]
I'll take a look for it

[03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:52.360]
Just because he became seen Allen obnoxious and the goody Tushus there before his death

[03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:54.240]
Please see that's all I remember

[03:07:54.240 --> 03:07:56.040]
Well, guess what, you're wrong

[03:07:56.040 --> 03:07:57.140]
Bad move

[03:07:57.720 --> 03:08:01.880]
Get him off of there Eric, no Steve Allen, okay if he got one vote it would be like Sacra Ligis

[03:08:04.200 --> 03:08:08.360]
5670560, pound 56 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[03:08:09.580 --> 03:08:10.360]
WDQA and hello

[03:08:10.880 --> 03:08:11.480]
Hey, hey, what's up?

[03:08:11.900 --> 03:08:12.280]
Yes sir

[03:08:12.280 --> 03:08:17.540]
Hey listen, I'm looking for maybe you know a number of some of your deals with 55 and older retirement

[03:08:19.120 --> 03:08:20.080]
Continental Association

[03:08:20.840 --> 03:08:21.620]
Maybe a lawyer?

[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:22.040]

[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:25.000]
No

[03:08:25.740 --> 03:08:27.020]
Call up my mother

[03:08:28.100 --> 03:08:31.120]
5670560, pound 56 on the AT&T, what was that?

[03:08:31.980 --> 03:08:32.700]
I don't know

[03:08:32.700 --> 03:08:34.460]
What was it?

[03:08:34.980 --> 03:08:36.120]
He's looking for a lawyer

[03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:37.880]
I think he thought he was reaching Bruce Williams

[03:08:37.880 --> 03:08:38.840]
I see

[03:08:38.840 --> 03:08:40.140]
Oh, what's doing?

[03:08:40.660 --> 03:08:41.060]
What's doing?

[03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:41.800]
Call a lawyer

[03:08:43.860 --> 03:08:45.480]
Is he still on the air somewhere?

[03:08:45.580 --> 03:08:45.960]
No idea

[03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:47.660]
Oh, I sure hope not

[03:08:47.660 --> 03:08:51.000]
WQA and the famous line 9, not there, that's good news

[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:52.280]
That's a good move

[03:08:52.280 --> 03:08:53.240]
Excellent

[03:08:53.780 --> 03:08:54.600]
WQA and hello

[03:08:55.120 --> 03:08:55.740]
Neil God

[03:08:55.740 --> 03:08:56.740]
Yes sir

[03:08:56.740 --> 03:08:58.860]
Hey Neil, I haven't had a chance to check the website

[03:08:58.860 --> 03:09:04.780]
Did you have a story about the FBI demanding the the room list from Las Vegas last weekend?

[03:09:05.280 --> 03:09:05.520]
I didn't

[03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:08.860]
I don't even think I put it on there, I saw it, I read the story

[03:09:08.860 --> 03:09:12.140]
All right, so you know you know the basic facts about that, I said that you could see that

[03:09:12.140 --> 03:09:18.800]
Okay, and also the other thing that you talked about in the airport in Europe to do the retina scandal and whatnot

[03:09:18.800 --> 03:09:20.840]
The program is called Privium

[03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:21.720]
Right

[03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:26.240]
And you have to be a citizen of one of the EU countries of course

[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:29.640]
I think there's about like the 12 or 13 countries on the list

[03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:32.260]
And obviously the US citizens don't qualify

[03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:34.680]
But it does do what you said

[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:39.840]
It involves both a written scan and they take those biometric measurements of your hand

[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:40.780]
You know those kinds of things

[03:09:40.780 --> 03:09:44.480]
And the combination of those two is like is literally foolproof

[03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:44.980]
There's no way

[03:09:44.980 --> 03:09:47.420]
Like Dr. Collar said before we should have been doing this for years

[03:09:47.420 --> 03:09:50.060]
I mean anybody can get a fake passport, it's easy as hell

[03:09:50.060 --> 03:09:51.440]
In fact you can't wait to get a certificate

[03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:52.620]
I'm starting you know

[03:09:52.620 --> 03:09:55.600]
A US citizen already can do that you know with the INS pass

[03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:58.680]
You can do that with just the biometric measurement of your hand

[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:01.980]
You saw it down your passport with you but you're able to bypass the line

[03:10:01.980 --> 03:10:04.580]
But this actually does the retina as well which is much more secure

[03:10:04.580 --> 03:10:05.600]
That's the way to go

[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:06.660]
All right, thank you

[03:10:06.660 --> 03:10:08.000]
Thank you, have a great day

[03:10:09.060 --> 03:10:10.340]
5670560, pound 560

[03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:12.640]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:13.740]
Mad Dog coming up at 2

[03:10:14.740 --> 03:10:16.680]
The volmeister for a handkit for it

[03:10:16.680 --> 03:10:18.480]
That's not a good way to start the new year you know what?

[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:19.540]
No

[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:20.600]
Whatever

[03:10:20.600 --> 03:10:24.340]
But now what does that mean whatever that's not good

[03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:26.260]
Don't be a sander like that whatever

[03:10:26.820 --> 03:10:29.320]
Well the man's got to do what he's got to do

[03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:31.840]
He's got to do what he's got to do he's got to stop eating man

[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:34.240]
He's got to become like a half a load

[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:36.700]
Does that what they always say a half a load is better than none?

[03:10:38.100 --> 03:10:41.700]
The toad and the half a load sounds like it sounds like a winning combination to me

[03:10:41.700 --> 03:10:42.440]
The nematode

[03:10:43.100 --> 03:10:44.380]
If you're oh he's on before

[03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:45.160]
Absolutely

[03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:45.920]
Either one of us

[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:49.260]
If you're planning on replacing your carpets because they don't look new anymore

[03:10:49.260 --> 03:10:52.680]

Now the networks let their actors curse

[03:12:24.640 --> 03:12:28.120]
There's no wedding sites with this in set of key

[03:12:28.120 --> 03:12:31.500]
All the dialogue can take for granted

[03:12:32.600 --> 03:12:36.340]
Swearin like a sailor on a pre-day pass

[03:12:36.340 --> 03:12:39.540]
Words a whole lot worse than ass

[03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:44.180]
F bomb F bomb how will it be

[03:12:44.180 --> 03:12:47.620]
Before they drop the F bomb on that word TV

[03:12:47.620 --> 03:12:54.740]
F bomb F bomb there's no telling when they're dropped one on the U.T.M.

[03:12:54.800 --> 03:12:57.620]
All right I can't wait myself 152 at 560 WQM

[03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:02.220]
We never got to this DNA test thing no way to not that's because you didn't remind me

[03:13:02.220 --> 03:13:05.740]
Hey don't forget that Michael Jackson DNA testing in the examiner

[03:13:05.740 --> 03:13:09.900]
It says DNA test to prove once and for all if Michael Jackson is the real father of his three children

[03:13:09.900 --> 03:13:14.920]
Maybe demanded as a result of child molestation charges against him say sources

[03:13:14.920 --> 03:13:17.700]
You know those sources they say it

[03:13:18.360 --> 03:13:20.920]
The explosive development in the child molestation case

[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:24.060]
With n speculation that is swirled around the pop king for years

[03:13:24.060 --> 03:13:27.560]
That his two sons and one daughter were conceived by sperm donors

[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:30.840]
Squirt squirt if Michael is found killed in sentence to jail

[03:13:30.840 --> 03:13:34.900]
He may have to give up custody of the kids the source post to the investigation tells the examiner

[03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:41.420]
If that happens whether or not he's the biological father will be an important factor in deciding where they will go

[03:13:42.020 --> 03:13:44.980]
And investigators have another compelling reason to test the kids DNA

[03:13:44.980 --> 03:13:48.000]
If it's discovered that Michael's been lying about being their father

[03:13:48.600 --> 03:13:51.580]
Prosecutors will dig even deeper to find out what else the singer has been hiding

[03:13:53.240 --> 03:13:57.900]
Michael's pals are concerned that the DNA test will prove there is no blood link between Jackson and his three kids

[03:13:57.900 --> 03:13:59.980]
Says a Jackson family insider

[03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:04.140]
I think he's claimed the kids are his because it makes him look in the eyes of his fans

[03:14:04.140 --> 03:14:07.900]
But when you see Michael's kids it seems obvious that he's not the father

[03:14:07.900 --> 03:14:09.740]
That's why he makes them wear veils

[03:14:09.740 --> 03:14:13.500]
It's clear to me that these kids are white not biracial

[03:14:14.380 --> 03:14:18.380]
Maybe they got like a early die job a bleached job

[03:14:18.380 --> 03:14:20.760]
Or they got that illness that he's supposed to have had

[03:14:20.760 --> 03:14:21.640]
Oh yeah right

[03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:27.080]
Michael insists his two older children son Prince Michael one six and daughter Paris five

[03:14:27.080 --> 03:14:32.500]
Were conceived naturally with second wife Debbie Roe formerly in the system the medical office of Michael's plastic surgeon

[03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:37.980]
But mysteriously Debbie handed them over to Michael right after their births and doesn't have anything to do with the children

[03:14:37.980 --> 03:14:43.680]
She brought another world I had them because I wanted Michael to be a father that he said I didn't do it to be a mother

[03:14:44.640 --> 03:14:50.240]
The circumstances surrounding the child's third they star third child 21 a month old Prince Michael the tooth

[03:14:50.240 --> 03:14:53.380]
The son Michael calls blanket or even more mind-boggling

[03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:59.860]
And Michael's behavior with the babies already sparked an outcry among professionals who fear he's an unfit father no kidding

[03:14:59.860 --> 03:15:06.940]
First he said the boy was conceived during a relationship with his anonymous mother then he changed the story saying he'd never met the child's mother

[03:15:06.940 --> 03:15:09.480]
And then he donated sperm to make her a surrogate mom

[03:15:10.440 --> 03:15:16.000]
They conflicting accounts cast suspicion on Michael experts said it could be used against him if he stands trial from

[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:17.040]
All of a station meanwhile

[03:15:17.940 --> 03:15:24.280]
Social workers are desperately trying to talk to the two older kids to evaluate their well-being and the aftermath of the charge against Michael 45

[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:33.060]
Ready for that and it goes on and on and on and assholes continue buying his records and watching them on

[03:15:33.060 --> 03:15:38.140]
He watched the special on Friday Friday and on CBS you talking to me yeah

[03:15:38.140 --> 03:15:40.920]
I thought it was a joke it's just a joke

[03:15:43.380 --> 03:15:50.040]
Anybody watch the Michael Jackson special on CBS because if you did we got something for you. It's got your name on it

[03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:58.360]
I mean there's no shame anymore in other words if they can draw up some ratings for just like the interview 160 minutes

[03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:06.360]
Here is a show that is always weekend and week out for the last hundred years always in the top five or ten in viewing 60 minutes legendary

[03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:08.940]
Right right and they don't care

[03:16:09.780 --> 03:16:13.920]
What do they pay them the million dollars and that is almost insignificant the fact that they would put them on their dispute

[03:16:13.920 --> 03:16:21.760]
A bunch of crap and make up that story about being abused by the cops and just just again to spew propaganda and put a spin on it is the pathetic

[03:16:23.640 --> 03:16:27.360]
Here's the pool as it is now we got amateur we got close to 700 votes on there

[03:16:28.580 --> 03:16:33.220]
682 you see I think they're doing it just in case if we get 700 did I get credit for tomorrow

[03:16:34.700 --> 03:16:37.700]
What do you mean by that because you said tomorrow we renew 700?

[03:16:39.060 --> 03:16:42.900]
So tomorrow is already done now I see tomorrow 666. Oh that's right

[03:16:43.720 --> 03:16:48.160]
So well listen we have to ease but you don't think the whole audience is back here do they do it?

[03:16:48.240 --> 03:16:53.620]
Just let people come back from vacation the first day is line 150 yet?

[03:16:55.180 --> 03:17:00.340]
