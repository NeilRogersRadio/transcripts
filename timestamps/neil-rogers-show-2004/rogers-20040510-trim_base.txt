Fc CSI only on cds when we're not exposing Janet Jackson's breasts on the Super Bowl

[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.600]
We're exposing some really serious cry

[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.740]
It's a 10-o-one at five sixty W-a-m. It's some Monday. It's May 10th. Georgia defa

[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.560]

[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.760]
Why would you say that? I don't know. I just I just have that feeling. I can tell I have that six cents

[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.160]
Six six cents. Yeah, like Gary Sarner might be in the building Gary Sarner

[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.040]
I sure hope you're playing old crash and away back to Miami from New York. Okay. It would be a really bad thing

[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.400]
wouldn't it

[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.940]
To bring Gary Sarner back in little teeny tiny scratch-stuff pieces in a box in a bag and a sack anyway

[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.980]
What good vacation, huh?

[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.760]
I had a great vacation. It's just that I hate Gary Sarner. He's a he's a slime hole

[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.320]
See I haven't forgotten what to still say there's no we can there's a few words we can still say

[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.840]
Not too many

[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.020]
Anyway, I've got a couple of celebrity deaths. Everybody knows already. Alan King died

[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.340]
Unless you're under the age of a hundred you probably don't know who Alan King is right. Who?

[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.220]
Right. Oh come on. I know who Alan King is he was on the Ed Solomon show 93 times beginning way back in the 50s at who he

[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.460]
He was a 76 died yesterday. Alan King

[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.180]
lung cancer

[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.940]
Smoke up a storm. He smoked man. He was not just a chain smoker. He was smoking chains

[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.460]
He was like a wild man and he's dead 76 lung cancer

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.640]
and

[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.300]
Well, look at that. I got Greg reads the memo stuff in between the two slumber deaths. You think there's an ominer

[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.820]
Wow

[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.060]
I'm gonna say it again. Okay, since I'm gonna let it all hang out today. I really am good thing. It's radio

[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.240]
I have never ever seen a man makes so many mistakes and continually come out smelling like a rose like Gregory this man

[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.260]
He is just a oh we're fine. Did it? Yeah

[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.880]
He's just an accident awaiting to happen and in spite of him

[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.980]
WQM continues with the big numbers and Joe Rose was a big part of that too. I should point out

[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.580]
Do you go over the hour by hour with the shower power? I think it's a part with a golden hour shower

[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.120]
No, seriously. Did you mention those what Joe did? I went and showed it to Joe in the numbers to I'm talking about on the year

[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.900]
I don't want to know what you showed me Joe. We were number two with an eight oh and there you are right

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.780]
But no rush kicked our ass from noon to two. I'm proud to tell you that we were we were third

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.580]
Yeah, noon to two 10 to one or 10 to noon. We've kicked serious ass

[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.300]
With a 9.3 share and men 10 to noon, but noon to two between WCM QFM FAMA and

[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.200]
rush

[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.020]
Because we have to get over to rush to hear about how the babes are just they're letting off a little steam over there in Iraq

[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.880]
The babes are doing all of this stuff and it's just a little bit of fun or having to let off some steam, you know

[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.560]
That's a kind of crap that a lot of you people want to hear. Okay, so that's where you can always find it

[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.520]
On that god awful wiod that Glenn Dreck Show man had thing to do to good did it

[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:28.340]
I didn't know like a three share a three two I think but anyway Joe rose had a 5.3 in the eight o'clock hour and in the nine o'clock hour

[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.960]
respectable

[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.020]
No, I wouldn't say respectable. I would say outstanding nice college. Oh, it would be nice if they paid you now and actually signed that contract

[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.640]
No, seriously Greg reing just continues doing everything in his power to demolish WQM and continues no matter how much

[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.880]
Exchrement he drags us all into continues coming out smelling like lilacs. I don't know what it is

[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.600]
I think he was born with a gigantic four leaf cove or and 16 horseshoes inside his ass is what I think what it's the ass me

[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.020]
Huh, how you doing? Yeah, that's why he walks that way

[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.620]
I don't know about freaky Carlos. I think he walks that way for a different reason

[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.120]
But anyway

[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.080]
Mother of the osman family dies on mother's day. That's that's terrible

[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.680]
Huh yeah, okay sure yet. She died tragic Salt Lake City, Utah

[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.560]
olive osman

[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.960]
Mother of Donnie and Maria osman and all of those other members of the performing family died yesterday

[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.740]
Family spokesman said she was 79

[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.180]
She died a complications from a massive stroke. Oh, by the way. How about you? Bush and what's your name there?

[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.600]
That he can't this court said can't keep those tubes going Terry Shive

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.900]
poor Terry Shive Oh Terry's law

[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:43.120]
And the Jebs is if necessary he'll take it all away to the Supreme Court that is after he make sure that Disney won't make that Michael Moore movie

[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.160]
You know somebody else is gonna make it

[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.860]
What's made?

[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.960]
No, I mean, they're gonna release it. Yeah, I know that in fact it's gonna win the thing at the can film festival again

[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.920]
It's in the can is what you try to say

[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.640]
If from what I'm hearing about Jim well back in the day, I might say something about that

[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.880]
But I better not say it right now

[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.440]
Anyway, she died of complications from a massive stroke. She suffered more than two years ago family members were at her side

[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.200]
On Mother's Day. That's just not not the time to die died

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.800]
She was born in Idaho 1925 Mary George Osman in 1944 wait to hear these numbers man. They were busy

[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.800]
The couple had nine children 55 grandchildren and 22 great grandchildren. How do you like that? Oh my god

[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.320]
Wow

[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.740]
Oh

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.700]
And now olive osman is dead never I never heard of her before she must have stayed way in the background heard of olive oil

[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.880]
Right and papa but never heard of no olive osman before but she's dead and so is Alan King rest in peace

[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.180]
He was he was

[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.820]
You know he's all right. Yeah, I can't say I actually ever saw he was schmaltzy. You know

[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.800]
He was one of those Jewish comedians and probably should have spent a lot more time in the cat skills, you know

[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.960]
Jewish comedian on the bush belt. Yeah

[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.200]
Well, that would fit into your pool one of the pools you took

[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.520]
Uh, oh, and let me ask you which one do you like better the roadmap or the accorded?

[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.560]
All this crap is going on all of this insanity this madness is going on people are dying children are dying and we got

[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.340]
The world accorded we were the world by cliche is the way things are going right around

[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.160]
We got the roadmap to peace and we got the quartet the quartet had another meaning today

[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.940]
Is that the Sammy Davis quartet or quintet? I forget the barbershop quartet

[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.540]
I see

[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.880]
You have to be seeing him different too. And if you ask me, but that's beside the point

[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.540]
Yeah, the winter ratings are in and the accorded this memo by Greg read announcing the ratings party too bad

[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.080]
I can't be there because it's gonna be this Thursday may 13 am I coming for that? No, no

[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.220]
If a fade dinner in beverages will be served the party will be held at in the pember pines

[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.020]
I can't say we're because then some pain in the ass listeners will show up right did like they were invited

[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.520]
Staff only

[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.180]
Which I assume when he puts that on there that means that no wives no kids no

[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.000]
mothers-in-law right very sorry to bring his mother-in-law

[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.680]
Gary cernor. I hope I don't hope you're playing crashes because there's probably a lot of nice people. I just hope you fall out

[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.300]
What yeah, I hope he just falls right out all the other people on the plan are safe

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.520]
But I just hope his ass falls right out and the rest of them too. You're an idiot

[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:19.840]
He's the only person that our building could make Todd Dreckler fuck a human being. That's a kind of schmuck Gary cernor is

[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.400]
Anyway, looking forward to seeing you all there says Greg with that squiggle in his head right we kicked ass. Why were you right?

[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.080]
We're great. We're doing it. We're doing it

[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.740]
It just it just astonishing to me the man who does everything this power

[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.740]
To destroy everything that we attempt to do who's just the biggest impediment to our success continues coming out smelling like like

[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.040]
deathadils in springtime

[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.920]
like roses

[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.200]
Like the lilacs in Rochester

[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.660]
You ever smelled the lilacs sure purple in white. Have you really we're just smell over Montana had several trees Montana had lilacs

[00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.680]
Oh, yeah, well, I'll be damned with them huh, Huckleberries too. Here's your pool from Friday

[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.740]
And another nice list. I check your polls online all weekend

[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.760]
You know all week how I was away. Yeah, and I notice a lot of good judgment there a lot of building polls

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.460]
for whole buildings is exciting

[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.260]
They call that that's the only thing gets them to call you don't see anybody call right now do you know that I'm back from a weekend

[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:23.200]
Copen Agen and rollman Amstadam and places where they give you the real news or they don't sugarcoder like on CNN

[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.460]
The certainly not news network. I'm gonna tell you seriously the difference is like night and day

[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.240]
reading the British papers

[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.120]
watching the news on BBC

[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:39.520]
CNN International not sky news because that's a rooper Murdoch piece of right wing crap. So it's like watching Fox News light watching sky news

[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.120]
That's garbage

[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:47.400]
And what is it with the Brits and all that silly sportsman with a cricket uh, it was a test a record for a test cricket

[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:54.300]
What are they talking about? I think they ought to test their sanity them Brits and there was plenty of them in Amsterdam again too many

[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.300]
One is too many

[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.340]
All in silly twists they all look like the beast. They got those bowling ball heads the Brits

[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.140]
You know I'm talking about

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.100]
bowling ball heads big porki guys with bowling ball heads

[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.540]
Drunk is a scunk

[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.400]
Acting like a bunch of silly twits and we know that the queens uh, well, what is it?

[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:19.140]
Who the British soldiers that did a lot of the abuse in Basra? It was the Queens battalion or something like that?

[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.100]
Couldn't we possibly have been that?

[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.180]
And based on their behavior over there, I think a bunch of queens is absolutely what we're talking about

[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:31.180]
Just like you've always said nice, certainly how largely agree all of these things always involve all of this

[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:31.780]
Faggery

[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.200]
Faggery is what we're talking about rush lots and lots of faggery

[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:38.900]
What?

[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:47.440]
That's a fraternities military man sports you get you get hold of somebody's sports make sure they take a lot of naked showers together

[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.740]
Initiations baby, right that's right

[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.660]
Get a strip of naked and then uh have your way with them right haven't do stuff rape

[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.760]
murder

[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.500]
Golden showers you name it whatever you can come up with

[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.440]
Stuff that we can't see on here anymore like that is funny right

[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:10.980]
Oh, by the way, yeah, his he is the missing link the weakest link the moment you can't complain about his numbers in this last book

[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.520]
Because basically he didn't have any remember how he was out sick today after the numbers came out

[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.260]
Lawicky or Friday right yeah

[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.740]
He was in morning. That's what that said

[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:24.080]
He was in morning for his own bad numbers man. I was pretty lame. Oh, I know you stink. You're really bad

[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.660]
But the numbers you came up with when they rested the station had a gigantic book from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m

[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:37.860]
Everybody kicked ass the mad dog the Humper yours truly the Joe Rose the blockhead everybody the moment in the old

[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.780]
Dump her

[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.680]
Nothing worse than a sorry old man and just in his hair piece spending all our time in the dumper anyway

[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.980]
Well, I will have to do the break and then get your pull. We got Cynthia Rothrock today

[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.360]
Yes, he depleted uranium

[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.880]
Just those are two words to keep in mind. Okay, nobody cares

[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.200]
I'm gonna tell you one of the books. I know I'm not gonna read any of it because they don't care

[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.420]

And that line about that after half a million Iraqi kids died because of our sanctions

[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:41.880]
And because of the depleted uranium that we've dropped all over the country not to mention the birth effects of the children of our own military since the Gulf War

Well, I want to get the exact quote. I read it to you, but I want to get the exact quote

[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.100]
Then this time you get out of here see that CNN's even trying to muscle in on my show

[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:07.220]
If they asked whether the US policy toward Iraq meaning the sanctions the UN sanctions could possibly justify the death of 500,000 children

[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.480]
Then Secretary of Madeleine Albright didn't hesitate. She said yes, the price is worth it

[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.220]
Well there. That was nine years ago

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.340]

[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.640]
Are you trying to say that the audience is dumb that Americans are dumb?

[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.420]
Is that what you trying to say stupid stupid is that what you're trying to say? Well guess what

[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.620]

What's your name Cynthia Rothrock on her they have no idea who she is she does martial arts movies

[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.400]
She's a martial artist. I got her bio here. I'm on top of this just because I've been on vacation a week

[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.660]
You think I forgot how this thing works? How we killed another couple of good minutes here?

[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:13.460]
This is almost 10 30 already haven't taken one call yet. Of course we don't have any because we have no tickets to give away because I'm stupid ballgame

[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.500]
I'm thinking very seriously about this I I'm all that over I spent a few seconds

[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.360]
On my vacation thinking about you know

[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.760]
Whether I I don't want to keep taking these polls where we make a list

[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.620]
You know and I commend you for doing it because it's the easy way out

[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.860]
And it's a smart way to do it and I did that the last the whole last week

[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.640]
Before vacation. I was just killing time. I'm not gonna lie to you. Just get the hell out of here. That's what's all about

[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:44.620]
But just because of the fact that the software audience can't respond to the show unless we're have a pool building a stupid ass list

[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:50.560]
I don't think I'm gonna do that anymore. I'd rather go back to just reading mostly bedtime stories with all the crap that's going on right now

[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:56.380]
When you tell me that most people don't even know what the quartet is and how stupid that is that I tell you there ain't no hope

[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:02.960]
Okay, there ain't no freaking hope they don't have an idea. They have no clue what the quartet is zero none

[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.860]
The US the UN Russia and

[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.800]
Yeah, you can do it Israel the EU. Oh, oh, I didn't know I thought it was Israel. No

[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.160]
See there he goes bitching everybody else out

[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.020]
There's your smarty pants and you ain't got a clue

[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.860]
Anyway, Cynthia Rothrock. She's behind the beaten curtain today

[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.520]
If you're very old and you're very feeble and couldn't get it up on a bet here's the deal

[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.980]
Then you're allowed to look at it very briefly keep your hands right in front of John

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.640]
Ascrot's eyes at all time so we can keep a watch on you

[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.620]
Make sure you're not getting no bad ideas

[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:43.680]
Boy he that he would have gone nuts in Rome man. I never realized why I did but I've forgotten have been there in a few years

[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.120]
All those naked statues over there. There are breasts and the penis isn't just

[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.620]
I mean, there's just all kinds of stuff just right out there in pubic man

[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.840]
Piazza della this and Piazza della that and Piazza della vagina. I mean, it's unbelievable

[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.940]
naked body parts

[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.640]
At least we could keep his ass busy over there anyway covering it all up

[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.800]
Because the one thing this administration does best is a cover-up

[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.180]
Cynthia Rothrock and let me just tell you right up front. Okay all of this stuff in the rack with the abuse

[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.140]
This with the brits and the US

[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:22.100]
This isn't just a series of isolated incidents. This is the policy. This is policy made by the the movers and shakers

[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.760]
The people in charge over there and all these underlings they're the ones you're gonna stick it to and I'm not saying

[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.780]
Should know better like your girlfriend Lindy England there

[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.260]
What up? What up they on I forget which network it was on I think it was on a BBC

[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.660]
They referred to her in the report is trailer trash

[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.720]
Which I thought was was so perfect man some of us are keen on that trailer trash

[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:43.920]
Wow

[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.260]
Anyway, Cynthia Rothrock she was born March 8th, 57. It makes her a very old 47

[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.980]

[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.480]
Um, and then it says I don't know what I see that's a trivia thing

[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:05.420]

[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.660]
Bala Perdida

[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.120]
2002 never say die untouchable two man hadn't chased tire clause three

[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:17.240]
There is a list here of 80 billion martial arts movies that she was in the hostage night

[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:24.000]
But not they're not all martial arts movies either duksa hazard reunion on TV. She always kicks somebody in every movie she's in

[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.820]
This is a real litter contract. Did she kick ass and other parts?

[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.780]
Well, you better tell a W bottom. Maybe she can go in her and kick some ass

[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.920]
Deep covers warranted justice

[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.640]

[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.100]

[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:41.560]
And here's the latest picture to add on and of course this is only one of many many many many more that are coming and the video as well

1032 at 560 wq. I'm happy Monday to it 70 votes already on the pool haven't even announced yet

[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.380]
What's your take on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners?

[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.280]
Don't let me forget to talk about the geniuses we have in the US House of Representatives

[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.580]
No, no seriously. I mean you know we got our own alien arose and a dana idiots like that but I just

[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.560]
Anyway

[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.420]
70 votes. So what's your take on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners? Bush has to go 26. Ramesfeld has to go 16

[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:42.080]
I don't give a Schmidt 9 it's part of war 9 only the abuse of office should be punish seven and they must have deserved it

[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:48.080]
Three there you go. They must have had it coming right last for it now just from oh the thing about the

[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.000]
I watched I'm probably one of the few people in the face of the earth. I'm here on vacation. I wasted

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.540]
At least two and a half hours of my time

[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.600]
Watching and of course everybody had its kind news and BBC and CBC and whatever was CNN International

[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:09.440]
I don't watch the Senate hearings. I did see the clip Ted Kennedy and the John McCain ripped the Ramesfeld an ass. I love that

[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.920]
But when a house of representatives when a house was holding their hearings

[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.440]
First of all mainly what you've got is a bunch of politicians sitting around making speeches

[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.800]
Either kissing Ramesfeld ass or like Kendrick meek did which I was really embarrassed for him about well

[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:29.800]
Why you know, it's not political but why you really have to resign? Yeah, he went on and on and on just making a speech

[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.880]
You know not really illuminating or getting any information out for the most part

[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.760]
They got to the one of the congressman from Illinois and the guy's name was oh Jim something or other. I wish I remember his last name

[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:47.240]
Now I don't want to make fun of somebody that's got a hair lip. Okay, but if you got somebody it's got a hair lip or whatever

[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.740]
His handy cap is I don't know he's got the strange thing out of the

[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:58.300]
That's how you Ramesfeld couldn't understand him the genitals couldn't understand him nobody in the room could understand a word

[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:58.840]
He was saying

[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.400]
Like that they prefer if you refer to it as a cleft palate. I see he was

[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.020]
verbally challenged okay as the best way to describe it

[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.040]
And I thought and I kept watching him go from one of these bows those to the next one and I thought to myself

[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.820]
These are the kind of people that we have on a committee like this handling sensitive issues of life and death

[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.600]
Holy moly and you wonder

[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.480]
Now I see on the news today more Democrats call for Ramesfeld to resign

[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.420]
So I guess they must have taken some wheatina or something over the weekend and they're butching up just a little bit

[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.840]
I'm gonna say the same thing that I've always said to you because no there people accused me of being partisan

[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.660]
Which I you know I do have my my

[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:44.140]
Predictions your leanons yeah, but the fact that it matters you got too really crap political parties in the USA

[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.460]
One is bad and the other one is just

[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.380]
Dangerous and bad

[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:54.260]
You don't have uh how many good politicians can you name with balls who really like you know

[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:59.380]
So you say Ted Kennedy and John McCain really did a good job there on the Friday name name me some other ones

[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.240]
I'm done you're done yeah

[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.940]
That's the end of that list maybe Charlie Wrangle, but he was not at committee unfortunately

[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.340]
I'd love to see him rip Ramesfeld at ass

[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.900]
Because you know Ramesfeld's lying through his teeth the whole the whole deal behind this thing is they

[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:19.280]
They knew about this for months both the brits and the US it was military policy and the only thing that they've got

[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:25.740]
Egg under face about just like the bushmeister is that all these pictures are available now see these things are supposed to go on

[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.600]
But pictures oh no oh my god

[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.680]
Pictures are the kind of atrocities that they go on at a routine basis

[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.860]
I'm just gonna read a couple of few a few short paragraphs

[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.200]
Can't a command by Seymour Amhert well, we'll take one quick call first and it'll be good WQA. I'm hello

[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:51.260]
Henry Wachman from California has a pair he can't do anything cuz he's good he's good you're right

[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.300]
Thank you there

[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:59.560]
He's chronic, but he's a good guy. Well, he came up with a good name now Henry Wachman's good. He's got that bold head and that funny little mustache

[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.380]
Bees a good guy

[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:08.820]
Uh, in his devastating report on conditions at Abu Ghraib prison in the rack major general Antonio M to Guba singled out only three military men for praise

[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.140]
One of them master at arms William J Kimber a Navy dog handler should be commended to Guba wrote

[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.200]
Because he knew his duties and refused to participate in improper interrogations

[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.540]
Despite significant pressure from the MI military intelligence personnel at Abu Ghraib

[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.900]
Elsewhere in a report of he came clear what Kimbrough would not do

[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:35.340]
American soldiers to Guba said used military working dogs to frighten and intimidate detainees with threat of attack and in one instance actually biting a detainee

[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:41.740]
To Guba's report was triggered by a soldier's decision to give army investigators photographs of these sexual humiliation and abusive prisoners

[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:48.460]
These images were first broadcast on 60 minutes to April 28th seven elisted members of the 370 second military police company

[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.040]
The 320th military police battalion and army reserve unit are now facing prosecution

[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:59.080]
And six officers have been reprimanded last week says see more her share was given another set of digital photographs

[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.000]
Which had been in the possession of a member of the 320th

[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:10.040]
According to a time sequence embedded in the digital files the photographs were taken by two different cameras over 12-minute period on the evening of December

[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.760]
2012 2003 two months after the military police unit was assigned to Abu Ghraib

[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:21.060]
One of the new photographs shows a young soldier wearing a dark jacket over his uniform and smiling into the camera in the corridor of the jail

[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:27.640]
In the background are two army dog handlers and full camouflage combat gear restraining two German shepherds

[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.940]
The dogs are barking at a man who's partly obscured from the camera's view by the smiling soldier

[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.000]
Another image shows that the man in Iraqi prisoner is naked

[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.280]
His hands are clashed behind his neck and he's leaning against the order was self-converted with terror as the dog dogs bark a few feet away

[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.280]
Other photographs showed the dogs straining at their leashes and snarling at the prisoner

[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.840]
In another taken a few minutes later the Iraqis lying on the ground riding in pain with a soldier sitting on top of me

[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:57.480]
Press to his back blood is streaming from the inmates leg another photograph is a close-up of the naked prisoner from his waist

[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.260]
Who is ankles lying on the floor on his right thighs what appears to be a bite or deep scratch

[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:07.460]
There's another larger wound on his left leg covered in blood and it goes on at the great length

[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:13.000]
Now we'll say this there was one Republican member of the house committee that did the interrogation on Friday

[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.720]
I wish I knew what his name was kind of a blonde-haired guy. Do you see any of it?

[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.640]
Right no, I know who he is there so eclipse

[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.940]
He was great and he said to me he was talking to rumswell. He said to me. He said to rumswell

[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.360]
He said you know you you people talked me into voting to send all these young people over there

[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.580]
We've had over 700 of these people die

[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.260]
Including I guess one in his district. They mentioned the name

[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:37.380]
Sent these people over to die. I'd like to know what we're still doing there. What are they dying for?

[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:43.720]
And he gave he made a great little speech there, but of course rumsfeld was busy looking off into space

[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:53.320]
So he had about you know four or five people with some real balls there and the rest of it was just windowed dressing and a lot of speech making like the Republican chairman of that committee

[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:59.440]
My god he did everything but go up there and and kiss the rumsfeld on both cheeks and I'm not talking about the ones on his face either

[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.940]
And then at the end of that whole proceeding here is the Duke

[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.720]
Not the duke you're thinking of here's Duke cutting ham. What sounds like a basketball player or something

[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.260]
Duke cutting him

[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:16.000]
Who the hell is Duke cutting him and he's been sitting there all day long some old grizzled up guy

[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.700]
I look like John Wayne and drag you know with big old glasses on

[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.220]
And he's telling us about his exploits in the military and about how proud he is a secretary rumsfeld

[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:30.600]
And now he knows all that men would follow him right over the hill to hell if necessary because he's such a great guy

[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.180]
And he just made little stupid speech

[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.640]
Was he a member of the committee? Did he have any business really being there?

[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.240]
Did he ask any questions? Did it anything to our understanding of what all us atrocities was all about?

[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.260]
No, but it was nice windowed dressing, you know, it was good photo op that the Duke

[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:53.340]
I'm sorry you missed Duke cutting him oh well old Duke he's a good grizzled up old boy

[00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:00.520]
Funny before 11 of course that thing about was on last night on 60 minutes again about me lie and about the

[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.480]
Saudis those barbarian lying bastards in Saudi Arabia

[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.580]
I'm gonna tell you again right now and you can laugh all you want 1973

[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:10.020]
That's when we had the chance we were too busy bogged down with watergate

[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.400]
That's when we had the big chance the original Arab oil embargo by the way gas prices just soaring

[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.620]

Happy about that thank you mr. President for those little gas prices

185 votes what's your take on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners?

[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:24.100]
We got that whole see more harsh article on our website chain of command. How much is read the whole thing? You know

[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.220]
die

[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.880]
What I like that I don't want to yeah, but you see you don't get any diaries. That's the problem. They're concerned about ratings

[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.940]
They're all concerned about ratings and we got to keep pandering to a bunch of little little silly people like that

[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.220]
I don't really care quite frankly about little little silly people anymore. You know what?

[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.040]
I've just taken this turn in the road. I've come to that fork in the road in my life

[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.880]
fork in the road and I've decided to myself fork it is what I've decided, you know

[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.060]
Yeah

[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:52.400]
What

[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:59.020]
Don't be dumping that now if you tell me he dumped that I'm gonna get up and walk on

[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:04.660]
Watching TV you didn't dump that did you know that's a comedy? Well there you go. It's comedy

[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.640]
Jesus boy. I wish I had 85,000 like you guys

[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.360]
1,000 or 85,000 a piece with that. I have a 50 share

[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.280]
easy

[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.680]
Anyway, thanks you back to this thing for clearance. Thanks a lot clearance

[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.040]
You had a best when it comes to them checks anything else worthless. That was a raspberry

[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.500]
I just want to keep you on your toes, okay

[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.960]
Keep your word on the edge of that I had a dream

[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:31.420]
You know you know I have dreams at different times of the night sure and late in the

[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.960]
sleep process which I slept like crazy because I'm doing the like switching over the time you know from my European time

[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.580]
So I went to bed about nine o'clock last night, which was the equivalent of three in the morning

[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.200]
Europe time and I slept till 715 this morning my regular time, which is amazing

[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.100]
But I slept right on through like a rock

[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:53.760]
And right toward the end of my sleep cycle I had this dream that I'm on the air doing this show and sitting in that where you are now

[00:38:54.380 --> 00:39:02.460]
In a room configured obviously much different much wider is this long long table and there are about a hundred different guys

[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.100]
Punk sitting at the day and each one has a yellow button in front of

[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:12.160]
Yeah, a yellow dump button in front now the audience won't get as big of a charge out of that as we do because

[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.640]
But under the under the recent circumstances

[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:22.440]
With all the leap and stuff going on. I thought it was kind of amusing myself. Josh don't be last week

[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.040]
Did he really yeah, he dumped you off

[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:26.940]
study note

[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.280]
Why what did you say give me a clue master bait

[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.760]
Well, and he dumped that no, there was a context thing that there was a judgment call about and that's like whatever

[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.940]
Who might argue with him? Well, I see the Iraqis. That's one of the thing now

[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.920]
I'm glad you mentioned that because getting back to this Iraq business going on all the abuse this in sanity

[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.540]
As we've discussed so many times on the year it always comes back to

[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:54.360]
Faggery always yeah, the fraternity I mentioned this before the fraternities the

[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:02.440]
Sports guys the initiations the hockey hazing story that we had all of this stuff and certainly the military

[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:07.020]
And when you get a hold of other people and you had complete power over them now what was it on

[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.540]
Was it the 69th singer was on date line last night?

[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.520]
Which what were they had a little bit where they had the segment about the

[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.660]
Experiment that they did with the people and they gave them complete power over huh that was date line. Yeah, I saw that

[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:26.660]
And it's a pretty scary thing because it almost always seems to involve a great deal of

[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:32.120]
Faggery stripping the other people naked making them a humiliating degree themselves abusing them

[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:37.240]
raping them raping and in fact part of this so the thing with a bridge now is raping young boys in Basra

[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:42.480]
Lovely of course it's a brit thing you say wow yeah, they've been out that a while you know them silly brits yeah

[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.920]
Once you take on the abuse of Iraq prisoners is our question today 214 votes bush has to go 90

[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.900]
Rumsfeld has to go 47

[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:58.100]
It's part of war 24 sure. It's just boys will be boys and girls will be girls are having a good time. That's what rush says

[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:04.560]
Rush says the babes are doing it. They're just having a good time over there. Okay, the babes are doing

[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.100]
They're stripping them

[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.640]
They're beating them

[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.200]
They're raping them

[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.860]
They're abusing them

[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.040]
But the one thing they're not doing is popping in the axes. Oh, that's called an Appalachian party what they were doing over there

[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:26.540]
Only the abuse of officers should be punished 20. I just don't give a shmit 18 real rocket scientists out there

[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:30.620]
That's those those are the people we can say goodbye to okay, I'm tired of them people you know

[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:36.100]
Maybe they'll care about those other pictures and they must have deserved it 15

[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.800]
I haven't like those people better than once. I just don't care. I don't know give a shmit, you know

[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.400]
That's under new with my life

[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.160]
America is full of idiots man

[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:51.640]
You watch the news any place else in the world and they come on with the important stuff that has the impact on our lives on a future

[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.420]
The whole thinking planet and you watch the news here in the second stories about stupid ass Kobe Bryant

[00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.480]
Well, who gives a flying thing about Kobe Bryant? Okay, I sure is held on

[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.540]
The you

[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.280]
I guarantee a judge probably does because he's got a little bit of that sport nerd rubbed off on his

[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:13.640]
But I don't care about Kobe you know the Nutella taste just as good without his picture on the lake and I think it was clearance that was responsible by the way

[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:19.440]
See, I slid that all by and you even pay any attention. I got you off guard on that way. Let's see

[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.000]
Right

[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:27.000]
See, I'm pretty sharp the first couple days after vacation then I slide back into being you know a dodging old fool

[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.300]
But that's okay because the checks keep showing up

[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:35.680]
Yeah, I hope others I hope there's a plenty of checks in that box there and at PO box clearance. Okay

[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.940]
We're talking a whole bunch of cash ought to be in there maybe enough for me to say although I tell you I got a new god

[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.460]
It's handling my money and he's losing it so fast he makes me sure it's look like I rock inside really serious

[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:46.600]
Yes

[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.240]
Not no equities though. I have no I have no uh, I'm I got to call this guy

[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.180]
I'm gonna show over today and tell him that my iron Luca Brotsy. What's gonna be a two and a one? You're hitting Gary Sarner

[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.660]
And anyway why why why do I even bring that up? It's really pressing

[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.200]
There are all a bunch of snake oil salesman, baby. That's all they are

[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.820]
But I mean but I'm up over here over there. Yeah, right kind of like those weapons of mass destruction

[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:16.220]
You keep looking for your money with all these investment experts. Oh must be over here under the table. So I tend to the sofa

[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.720]
somewhere is some of your cash

[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:20.580]
WDQAM hello

[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:22.920]
WDQAM hello

[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.100]
Okay, I don't know why they have to be torture people of God is on our side

[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:34.820]
Yeah, and you know if he was sent by God to be president he should have more powers than the torture people

[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.860]
Wait, can I get a get a hold of some of our justice to I mean which is also sent by God as well

[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:42.900]
so

[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.520]
It's amazing. Zahd did you see the Zahd be thing John Zahd be

[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.140]
What thing well he has now said if he carries

[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:52.520]
Uh

[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.140]
Election to lose. Yeah, and he's doing a hell of a job of it. Yeah, well

[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:06.280]
And if it keeps up like this, I mean under these circumstances with all this stuff that's going on right now carry ought to be 15 to 20 points ahead and pulling away

[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.800]
Well, you but you also have that 40% evangelical base, you know of other Republicans that just no matter what happens

[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:20.040]
It doesn't matter what happen. They're going to vote for Bush. So you know

[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.580]
Wait for me that 40% of the country are evangelical Christians

[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:31.580]
Well, no for about 20 million 20 million evangelicals in the last election cycle out of the 50 million who voted Republican

[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:39.600]
Yeah, right. So he's got an order but that's but that's only 20% of the total electricity because only half of the voters vote for Bush

[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:47.580]
Well, they're absolutely right, but they sort of got another 80% and then he's got another 10 million in the water all already vested

[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:52.760]
Because he's got you know all his cronies and the people he's doing business for

[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:58.200]
Uh, there's a 10 million 10 million population there. So he's got 30 million secure votes

[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.840]
And you know, obviously made with nature in there. It causes a problem

[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:08.760]
Let me say it again carry ought to be had 15 to 20 points right now. Well, I agree with you and have a great day

[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.460]
If he was doing any kind of a campaign any kind of a job

[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.120]
What's his plan for goodness out of Iraq does anybody know no

[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:24.660]
What's his plan what's his plan to counter this uh chilling a free speech in America and the freedom of the press any plan no any commentary no

[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.260]
Where is this man what is he waiting for

[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:37.200]
It's his for the grabbing grab out of the brass ring okay, John if you can find it

[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.840]
He's a fuzzy pathetic sad loser

[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:55.120]
You know he keeps all these guys they morph from one thing into another and I yeah like my magic

[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:01.900]
Maybe he'll morph into this dynamic brand ball of fire candidate between now and uh, November the second whatever the hell it is

[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.680]
I don't see it happen. Do you know

[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:11.380]
I think it's it's not too late to make a change. I told you this before vacation people thought I was nuts

[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:16.520]
Well, they always think I'm nuts. That's because they're too busy word about about the important things like the heat

[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:18.340]
Yes, I

[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.880]
I don't care about the freaking numbers. How do you like that? Okay, play some play some fart sounds

[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:12.920]
I've been doing this too too long to worry about stupid ass numbers and watching those rush numbers on there

[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.780]

queer pal for the street gal right after flantops and bergenstocks where else but bravo

[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.080]
It's 11.02 done that sound a little bit low. All right. No, to me could be

[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.020]
low, low. That sounds mighty low

[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.680]
Anyway, you're supposed to have stepped in by this point. I'm writing so come back to your senses

[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.220]
Neal and quit the talking crap

[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.100]
I'm like two senses and place some fart sounds right. Well, we can't do that anymore. How about a few things

[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.660]
All right like that some silly stuff

[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.360]
Quit start with his serious heavy-duty crap again

[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.820]
Here's while I give you I'll give you a living proof that that statement is correct

[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:27.180]
After just five weeks on a year air America radio showing signs of stagnation

[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.940]
What an understatement that is

[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:35.840]
As co-founder and chairman Evan Cohen and vice chairman and investor rec source enjoying the ranks of those who have already left the building

[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:42.080]
One week earlier co-founder CEO mark wash resigned while Dave Logan had a programming was fired at it

[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.420]
Uh-uh the company also here comes the real jackpot you ready for this ready

[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:53.200]
The company also reportedly failed to make its scheduled payroll wins day leaving approximately

[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.660]
100 on air personalities red as producers without a paycheck until Thursday

[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.440]
We're on a wild ride said john stinton the net worth president

[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.980]
Conceiting that the network has suffered the typical bumps and bruises faith by any startup

[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.940]
But the bottom line he said is that we're on the air to stay

[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.340]
Said right

[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.340]
Cohen is a former Republican political operative was among the network's initial investors

[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.340]
Sored citizen investor who owns radio stations in Guam

[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.720]
Well, maybe they can go on here in Guam

[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.000]
okay

[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.220]
Just to start out small you know and then you work up from there

[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.580]
Kind of like when we were at iod and they had a cymo casting on that station in key west

[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:35.600]
That had the tower knocked down by a tornado and the tower was laying flat on the ground

[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.720]
But we were cymo casting we were on the air just that nobody could hear it remember that's a true story

[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:48.780]
Hey, Neil two things is this facts the fast-talking very rich senator date and blasted them about suppress the news about this today and rather and

[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:49.480]
Jan them up

[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:56.820]
Well, I don't know this facts is in coerid and asked if this is proper for a general to call a news organization

[00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:03.560]
That was a general Myers to suppress the story as usual bullsman answers and double talk another thing

[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.020]
I'll do a well, I don't understand this

[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.860]
So do all generals have lists like general Kimiton general Myers and they all have lift okay

[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.440]
Maybe that's why they're all abusing all those the prisoners over there

[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:18.100]
I don't know they're raping in the mouth thing and the playing with them and doing things and piling on

[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.320]
I don't know so air america is that big trouble. Did I take you that?

[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.340]
And I take you got no chance

[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:31.480]
Because this this whole myth of this the see when you look at the at the radio ratings there

[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:35.860]
And we had a really great book and no complaints except for that no speaking English that nobody ever heard of

[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.540]
But the rush people see they're all they got to have their fix it at right wing

[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:45.880]
They're just like they're like the fox news people. It's the same thing. There is no there is no counter part

[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.860]
On the other side of the political spectrum it doesn't exist

[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:56.420]
Because the rest of us are multi-dimensional in other words we're not running around going I have no like that

[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:59.900]
Praise the Lord and uh, you know and uh, where's fox news, you know

[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.260]
And if you were watching sky news like I was last week very little I should point out

[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:07.000]
Because I wanted to get the real story what was going on too many big stories

[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.600]
But you see that rupper murdoch spreads his poison everywhere he goes

[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:15.800]
On the one hand he gives you all the real the real racy entertainment to make the money so we can produce all of his

[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.360]
Right-wing propaganda news stations like fox news and sky news

[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.660]
And his tabloids

[00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.540]
Thank you mr. President for those low gas prices by the way right

[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:28.920]
free

[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:30.840]
I

[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.960]
I'd like to put that kid in gary cerners lap

[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.620]
Just before that plane hits the hits the ground

[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:42.820]
The kid that called several months ago smart ass. Oh, thank you mr. President for those low gas

[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.940]
This is right after they started probably about a year ago now I would think

[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:54.520]
Started the big rancatech the shock awe and I think shock and awe is what we got now when all these pictures and videos coming out

[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.580]
Shocking awe

[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.080]
As in awe she the pictures got out dang

[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:06.180]
Gary in western says what that last call was referring to is that 40% of Americans finned to read the bible every day that's W's base

[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:13.120]
That being said could you please get the word out that everybody should consider voting absentee

[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.740]
So the very minimum will have some sort of paper trail

[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:21.440]
And be sure and sign your thing unlike Catherine Harris who didn't sign her thing. We'll get to that also

[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:27.580]
She didn't sign her thing. Oh, maybe Catherine Harris could be flying that plane that gary cerners gonna be I'm with that kid with the

[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.900]
low gas prices she could be the pilot

[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.640]
Or at the very least maybe god could be the co-pilot don't you think

[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:41.140]
U.S. gas prices rose by slightly more than 10 cents a gallon in the past two weeks

[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:48.740]
How do you like that the biggest jumps since last august and industry analysts say yesterday more than a dime in two weeks

[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:55.980]
The weighted national average for all three grades of gasoline was just over a dollar 96 a gallon of Friday according to

[00:54:55.980 --> 00:55:02.440]
Trilby Lundberg publisher of the biweekly Lundberg survey which regularly pulls 8,000 gas stations across the U.S.

[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.500]
What do you folks do for business? Oh, we call up gas stations and pull them

[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.240]
Yeah, we pull the gas we pull the attendance to the gas stations

[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.220]
I can tell you some stories back in the day about that, but I better not pull the soldiers were

[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.260]
Tight gasoline supplies and rising demanded to time when seasonal environmental regulations cause a price adjustment

[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:25.860]
Are we responsible for the increased Lundberg said those regulations are both a cost and supply impact on refiner said Lundberg

[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:29.780]
We'd get less gasoline out of the higher cost just when we need more of it

[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:34.260]
Meanwhile tighter regulations make it tougher for importers to bring in additional supplies

[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:41.980]
The nation's economic growth is also on increased demand contributing to the rising prices Lundberg said the average price of gas is broken

[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:51.720]
All-time record highs for two months straight although the average price remains about 90 cents a gallon lower compared to the peak gas price in March 81 when adjusted for inflation Lundberg said

[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:56.580]
Kuroa prices reached 13 year high of 40 dollars of barrel on Friday

[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.160]
He did this is why this is also insane now madness

[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:07.020]
And also in his book that I'm recommending so enthusiastic being hardly spinning on the axis of evil by Scott Taylor

[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.860]
America's work against Iraq

[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:18.280]
For the umpteenth time here once again documented and very planning list to understand how we give the green light to Saddam Hussein to invade Kua Kuwait

[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.340]
And we said oh, we don't know fear an error error versus Arab matters

[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:27.960]
So wink wink nudge nudge anyone ahead and did it and then the Saudis also are peeing in their pantaloons and their Ashmothas

[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:31.960]
Oh, he's gonna come after us. He's gonna take over Saudi Arabia and that's when the

[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.340]
George Bush number one the Saddam would better go in there and the com things down

[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:38.740]
And

[00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:44.560]
And the reason they didn't finish off with Sodom after the first Gulf War is because they didn't know who the else was gonna come in there

[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.200]
They didn't want some ayatola coming in there some religious fanatic

[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.700]
That's the only reason they left him in power

[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.360]
And so for Rumsfeld to be talking any kind of crap the same guy who went over there and it's well documented in this book also

[00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:01.220]
About how he went over in shook hands with Sodom we had the picture on our website. They didn't care about chemical weapons

[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.480]
We provided them to them

[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:07.680]
We gave them the chemical weapons. We sold them the Sodom was saying and so we used them against Iran

[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.920]
But he also happened to use him against his own people the Kurds in north we said wow who gives a crap their animals

[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.680]
Anyway, let them lose their souls we don't care

[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.520]
And now all of a sudden you guys to zone people he was

[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:21.240]
See the the guy and I wish I knew his name that one congressman man

[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.940]
He should get a congressional medal of honor

[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.760]
For his performance on Friday because he's the one guy had to both to say what are we still doing there?

[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:36.460]
How can we justify we've killed over set off our kids over 700 of them have died already and the number is increasing every day

[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.860]
What are we doing there? What was this all about?

[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:45.200]
And this business about just like CNN now the headline the fight for Iraq that that was never the fight for Iraq

[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.320]
It was about protecting us against terrorism

[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:53.040]
Did have anything to do with terrorism? No, were they like 45 minutes away from an attack against us at a bridge?

[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.620]
It was all a pack of lies

[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.200]
Were they involved with with Osama Yamama? No

[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:06.140]
But now all of a sudden they managed to pull a bait and switch. This is the biggest bait and switch in the history of the US

[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:11.480]
What was supposed to be about connected with a war and terrorism and making things safer for America?

[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:16.620]
Obviously, I was now made more people more if you had any idea how Americans are hated all over the world right now

[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.420]
You would do crawl under your desk right now. Oh, they don't care. They must be wrong. Yeah

[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.360]
I'm talking about hated despised

[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:31.740]
Probably Americans are hated in the world right now more than at any time in a history of the human race history of this country or the new Nazis

[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:38.500]
And we can thank W for that at the same time. We're thanking him for those record-hogged gas prices

[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:45.360]
Ice-gun W you moron you simple than you idiot you how's that pull looking

[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:50.920]
What's your take on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners? Bush has to go 147

[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:55.320]
See I shouldn't have put that under because that's you know, that's a given 341 with this crowd

[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.740]
Lama's fall last to go 68

[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:05.140]
Only the abuse of officers should be punished 46. It's part of war 37. I just don't give a shmit 26 7.6 percent

[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.080]
Of those people who want to hear

[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:13.420]
For hours of that and they must have deserved it 17. Yeah, they had it coming right

[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.020]
Yeah, bunch of infidels right right head

Thanks Mr. President for those love gas prices here to best it's 1117 at 560 WQ I am

[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.520]
Here's the fact that says George W's having the soldiers look everywhere for WMVs

[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.820]
That's why the prisoners are naked and been over never thought about that. They might be hide in the mirror. You know what?

[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:34.260]
Blackcomb

[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.360]
Yeah

[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.580]
Something to think about for just a second there. I thought you just maybe were only at

[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:45.040]
The counteroff route you were doing one reaching for a cop drop

[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.040]
All I see don't tell me that they got those energies and all I crap and events and everything and they're again

[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.320]
No, no, I just have a problem. It says I think we should bend GW and run me over and look

[01:01:53.780 --> 01:02:01.660]
Deeper some brains. I'm sure that they're somewhere. I heard from good sources in Nigeria that they brought back some brown cake brains on the black market

[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:05.700]
How do you like that says Tom? He has George has to go. It says he sucks on radio

[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.460]
And he underlines radio now. Maybe it'd be good on TV, but on radio you suck. He said well, we'll see

[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.260]
Well, at least it lead no other good thing is you can't see

[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.480]
If you do that on TV you can see and then you'd be in big trouble all over again

[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:24.560]
But about kinds of tourists then strong who's usually a very good factor here. This ends there

[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.520]
I don't know what I know what that is crap

[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:31.180]
Can't always be good Sean. Okay nice drive, but that your weakest facts ever. I don't know what that is

[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:38.620]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. What about those marlin? That's our topic today

[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:45.240]
What about those marlins huh aren't they kicking some right they're not doing too well right now

[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.480]
They're hellsperch planes. I beg your pardon still in first place

[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.120]
Yeah, because they're in a craft division. Okay, because everybody else is about like under 500 everybody else blows

[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.780]
They're in a crappy division

[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.580]
The way the teams are playing that is correct sir. They're in a craft division

[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.680]
In fact, let me get my an I'd send the other room

[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.780]
I don't want to take the time to run into again

[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.360]
You probably got the standings right there the braves 500 or 100 either one under 100

[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.400]
One one under 500 well, what kind of a division is that they're in second place and they're a game under 500

[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:19.020]
And you tell me that's a good division well the last time I checked baseball season was six months long and uh by the he's talking to his teeth again

[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.980]
That's right. It's a it's a shun

[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.860]
What's your take on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners? That's our pull question today 374 votes

[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.340]
There ought to be 55,000 votes on there

[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:37.080]
People ought to be foaming at them out. They don't give a fly and crap. You're right. Let's go back to that again

[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.940]
See it took me an hour and 20 minutes and I finally came back to my senses

[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.360]
God

[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:50.160]
Faith death claim on sex case priest will get to that. This is in the British Guardian yesterday

[01:03:52.180 --> 01:04:01.300]
Well, it's so refreshing to find like real newspapers and real TV news stations to watch and they're just ripping bush and rums fell to an ass

[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.380]
On all the TV I was watching even on CNN international of course because that's not seen domestically

[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:12.540]
That's not part of the brainwashing program from the a new American Nazi party. That's not part of the game plan

[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.980]
I guess one of those ends in CNN certainly must stand for Nazi don't you think by now no question

[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:25.980]
cable Nazi network WQ wam hello. Yeah, sir. How you doing? Okay?

[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:31.160]
You know I used to listen to you for laughs and and I still do you know you're awesome

[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:39.760]
So the world has taken a turn for the worst it's taking a turn man and we have got a horrible horrible

[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.820]
administration in there and I just thank you for your service sir

[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:52.500]
You know you put in your time and and you do your research and it's important and it really is important that people hear what you're saying because there's no

[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.240]
out there saying it

[01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:03.260]
And let's listen to Randy later on and you know as long as long as he's gonna be on air good thing for her she can still come back

[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:09.140]
You know that's true and I'm back to Palm Beach Randy. I was forgiven at MR. Ermer. America thing. That's history. That's dead meat

[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:13.220]
All right, yeah, well, I hope it goes you're right. Yo, in my mind. It might not let's go all right

[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:19.140]
I was wondering if you I don't know if you mentioned this yet today and the newspaper today there's a there's an article

[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:24.640]
We're some Pentagon officials and some generals in the field are saying how we're losing the war

[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.500]
We're losing battles, but we're winning the war yeah, it's on our website. Oh, okay. You got it. Okay

[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:35.280]
Um, yeah, I again, I thank you very much keep it up. You know you you keep me saying during the day

[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.140]
Because you know there's so many people out there you just can't get through to I mean

[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:45.680]
It's just amazing how these people like you just said a little bit ago. Why do people aren't off this stuff and fire it up

[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:50.060]
I don't get it either. I mean when you look at the news on air in the second stories about Kobe Bryant

[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.300]
That tells me everything I didn't know about the American public

[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.440]
You're right. That's exactly right. Good luck, Pally. I'll see you at the border. Hey, thank you, bye. All right

[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.460]
In fact, what stories it on there want to make sure I know the story is talking about

[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:04.660]
I just want to make sure I see the headline on here on our outstanding

[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.700]
bedtime stories on the orages.com

[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.200]
I like this story too on a break of the Cronkite moment

[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:17.240]
It's beginning to feel like 1968 when if you had no more was first challenged by a till then compliant US media

[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.820]
Start to get the same thing

[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.320]
Let's see where's that story we got the crispy cream story coming

[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:30.000]
Uh, the the series the tension grows in senior ranks on war strategy

[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.180]
US may be winning battles in Iraq, but losing the war some officers say there it is by Thomas

[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:35.520]
E

[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:36.860]
Rix

[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.080]
Ranger his kin to Ranger rix. Yeah

[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.280]
He said he's flipping it

[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:48.980]
Deep divisions are emerging at the top of the US military over the course of the occupation of Iraq with some senior officers

[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:55.740]
Beginning to say that the US faces the prospect of casualties for years without achieving the goal of establishing a free democratic

[01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:01.920]
Iraq and you'll notice I should point out in recent days they're saying oh, we don't want an American democracy anyway

[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.380]
They never wanted that in the first place

[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.380]
We want an Iraqi democracy, which is really what they're saying is a theocracy is what they really want

[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:16.180]
They don't want any part of this. It's not it's not their culture and it's you know, I can't emphasize enough please pretty please

[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.100]
I'm begging you

[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.040]
If you read just one book and mostly it won't read a book, but there are 22 bucks Canadian oh good luck. They won't spend that

[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:32.000]
Spinning on the axis of evil America's war against Iraq by Scott Taylor

[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.280]
He doesn't pull any punches here. He doesn't know one side or the other side. It's not politically partisan

[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:42.040]
He rips Clinton and asked he rips Madeleine all bright and asked he rips cool and powell and asked bush rums fell all of them

[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.620]
As tells you exactly what's been going on over there for a long long time the Reagan people

[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.100]
The real evil doers

[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:56.620]
And we're stuck in the middle of all of this how the hell can we still be there and how can John Kerry not have any kind of a plan to get us to

[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.300]
Hell out that's what I'd like to know

[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.920]
Of course somebody would say well he didn't get us in there to first by sure he did he was one of the participants

[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.260]
Right, he was one of the enablers

[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.120]
And I always say well, we're still gonna have to be there for out here

[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.900]
I say Dennis Kassinich for president man just because he's got a crappy hair piece. We'll send him to Chuck Alphair

[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:20.660]
I'll pay for it. I was that in fact Charlie said you good guy. I'll probably trade it out. It's too late to get Dean back

[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.020]
Get who back?

[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.480]
Did I say that like 10 days ago? Yeah

[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:31.580]
Can we say it again? Well, I'm saying again. Let's get back Howard Dean

[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.580]
I'm gonna I'm gonna say it again and I'm not a conspiratorial

[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:37.840]
I'm not always screaming about the builder burgers knee luminaughty in the trial out of commission

[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:43.500]
But there's a group of people who decide who's gonna make it and who doesn't and if you think it's the people that vote

[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:48.340]
Your dream and man. I got some real cheap land decided in my backyard some old dog droppings

[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:55.680]
Because somewhere along the line it was decided that Howard Dean was just a little bit too independent

[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.100]
He wasn't one of those people that they could manipulate

[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.820]
And so they just overnight they turned him into a jackass. They just oh look at as he's screaming

[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:10.320]
They they manipulated that video the audio from it

[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.320]
They brought back that old crap again about the Iowa caucus

[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.200]
You know when you talk about caucuses our garbage and the

[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:23.360]
Stuff from years back just like now this desperation with carry in the middle

[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:29.420]
What the hell is that have to do with anything and then I want to scream when I read these letters like in time magazine about

[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.420]
From these grizzled military lunatics from these brainwashed idiots

[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:38.920]
Well, you know a Hanoi Jane and and people like Carrie during Vietnam they took away

[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.820]
You know the morale from the troops. Yeah, yeah, we couldn't have kept them morale up so we could have kept them there in other 10 years

[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:47.040]
And brought home another 58,000 kids in body bags that would have been smart

[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.120]
So we could have fought off that red menace

[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:51.120]

[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:56.220]
Dennis the red menace right Venus the red

[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:03.100]
Venus careful Venus. Yeah rhymes with penis. We can still say penis

[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:08.480]
I got news for if your friend Lindy England there can be pointing at penises and Iraqi prisoners there

[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.900]
We can still say penis on here. How do you like that? Huh? All right

[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.520]
We can still say rectum and penis and that's about it and after that dummy up

[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.720]
It's big in a dummy house that had rectum

[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:28.440]
I haven't seen him in a long time mom. I'm stalling because I got the low piece of copy

[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.180]
You know how that goes sure

[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:37.760]
What we had that little problem with Gary Sartre this morning who's in New York and we certainly hope that his plane makes it safely back in his return to south Florida

[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.460]
Or not is the case maybe

[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.620]
Isn't that a little bit harsh on my part do you think?

[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:49.100]
Oh, I'm sorry I was spaced off but I do mean it

[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:56.180]
With every ounce of energy in my body. I do mean it. I'll be praying remember in the in the movie the ace

[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.700]
The great Santini yeah the rubber Duval

[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:07.800]
And his plane crashed and then his son was all all just choked up because he used to play a prey for his plane to crash because he hated him so much

[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:09.420]
Remember that yeah

[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.920]
Well if Gary Sartre's plane should crash I would not feel bad about

[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.560]
Terrible for all I got some special luggage. I'm gonna pack for him next time next trip

Whose first name begins with oh

[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.920]
There's one thing we all understand

[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.780]
Alcatel won't be finished

[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.380]
Until we blow up Pakistan

[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.240]
We could chase him round forever

[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.800]
With our tanks and all our troops

[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.140]
But special forces are some tire

[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.840]
Of jumping through them moves

[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.680]
You pull and you need another plane

[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.820]
So let's cut out all the nonsense

[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.060]
And we'll blow up Pakistan

[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:55.700]
And

[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:55.700]

[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:56.400]
Clear

[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.240]
Why don't you step on the way to Bumbo, Jeffrey?

[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.340]
I guess by the way something yes, so it's on the way Saudi Arabia

[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.160]
Right on the way to Pakistan

[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.360]
Oh, I see

Fake death claim on sex case priest

[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.840]
British police have flown to Australia to investigate claims that a priest

[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.600]
Faked his death in order to avoid child sex abuse charges

[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:40.300]
Father Christopher Cohnen was attached to a church in Coventry for 20 years

[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:44.860]
Until 1992 when he fled the city after former altar boys accused him of molesting them

[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.880]
Another one of these isolated incidents you do understand of course

[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.980]
He went to Australia where he's believed to oppose his

[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:54.060]
Christie Oliver a property developer

[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:57.640]
I don't know if that's Christie is in a guy or I don't know

[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.880]
In the town of Bendigo 90 miles north of Melbourne where his brother Andrew lives

[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:07.360]
Andrew Cohnen said the priest died suddenly a brain hemorrhoid six years ago

[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:14.380]
But there have been sightings of men burming him and coming here with the past year and claims that he's back in England using a false name and posing as a teacher

[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:20.260]
A sergeant and a superintendent from West Midlands police are in Australia liaising with Melbourne police

[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:26.180]
Born in Kloen the county in the Irish Republic father Klonemov to the Christ the King Catholic Church

[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:29.100]
Encowned in Coventry as an assistant priest in the 70s

[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:34.720]
A part-time builder and property developer before he entered the priest city with nicknamed Father Fixit

[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.120]
For his abilities in church construction projects look out for Fixit Man he's dangerous

[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:48.540]
But he vanished in July 1992 after eight former altar boys between the ages of eight and seventeen at the time of the offenses accused him of molesting them

[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:55.040]
In January this year Simon Gray 38 received an out of court settlement of 330,000 pounds

[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.200]

[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.000]
Gray claim that six years of abuse at the hands of the priest turned him into a violent alcoholic

[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.680]
Would spend time in jail and tried to set fire to himself for other cases were pending our pending

[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:14.000]
last year Andrew Klonem produced a death certificate stating that Christopher O'oliver Klonem died of a brain hemorrhage

[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.700]
October 22, 1998 is 56 and was cremated in Bendigo crematorium

[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.700]
Andrew Klonem said at the time his wife identified the body in the presence of police that his brother was cremated

[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:27.600]
Unusual for Catholic priest because the family was short of money but

[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.000]
but

[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:36.440]
Sort quoted in Birmingham Sunday Mercury newspaper claimed several priest and spotted father Klonem in the city on a number of occasions over the past year

[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:40.580]
Maybe made a comeback. Maybe he pulled a Jesus. Maybe it's a resurrection

[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.400]
Maybe Mel Gibson can make another movie about him and make another total and 50 million bucks

[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.280]
The source claimed he's lost a lot of weight

[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:52.660]
But otherwise it did not change much and he was using an Irish passport which stated his profession is a teacher

[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:54.980]
How do you like that?

[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.320]

[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:27.980]
This is the UK independent newspaper today this morning should be British troops pull out of Iraq by the 30th of June by about

[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.720]
That's the question the response

[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:38.060]
Yes, 55% no 28% don't know 17% they're too worried about the Queen

[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.220]
How do you like that two to one margin 55 to 28

[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:51.640]
Pull all our raki troops out by June 30th and I should point out that the Brits acted as you saw incredibly defensive and paranoid

[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:56.080]
Oh the mirror the daily mirrors is making all of these things up the full of our doctor

[01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:57.560]
Guess what

[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:05.340]
The same crap was going on in Basra and in the south of Iraq as was going on up in all these other places

[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.920]
As oboe grab it

[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:14.300]
Man always in denial of those Brits those bloody Brits. Oh, we wouldn't be doing anything like that

[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.940]
That's those bloody Americans doing it those barbarians

[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:20.720]
And of course we all remember how well the Brits treated those people in their massive empire

[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.300]
All their subjects. Oh, yes with the greatest of dignity

[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:28.340]
Right Gandhi was just a troublemaker and the South Africans too always with the greatest of dignity

[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.800]
And that's to forget Los Melvinus

[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:36.920]
Wow

[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.380]
The mushroom supply just came in I can tell

[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.460]
I wish even by long distance I can smell it

[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:48.720]
I was speaking to smelling Rush Limbaugh in the babes of Abu Ghareeb

[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:49.300]
Ghraeb

[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.620]
Gras is written by Kurt Nemo and counter punch. It's on our website today I do believe

[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:58.840]
Either yesterday or today. I put this stuff under yesterday not knowing whether you wouldn't

[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:02.660]
I'm glad I did because I don't think you did I did not I think you did on Saturday either

[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:05.740]
No, I slapped I thought you'd be back like on Saturday

[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.820]
I'll just pretend I didn't hear that

[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:19.000]
Torture at the Abu Ghraeb prisoner in Iraq question markets no different than fraternity hazing or so to clear is the king of reactionary radio Rush Limbaugh

[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:23.660]
Beating and killing Iraqi detainees according to Limbaugh is good fun

[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.440]
I'm talking about people having a good time these people see high agents and MPs at Abu Ghraeb

[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.160]
You ever heard of emotional release you heard of need to blow off some steam Limbaugh asked to call her

[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:40.060]
This is no different than what happens at the Scullin Boads initiation and we're gonna ruin people's lives over and we're gonna

[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:44.280]
Hamper our military effort and then we're really gonna hammer them because they had a good time

[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:50.680]
Limbaugh is attracted to people who torture on his May 3rd show the Laugh Mouth drug addict said have you noticed

[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:55.300]
Have you people noticed who the torturers are women the babes the babes are meeting out the torture

[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.200]
Limbaugh's talking about special

[01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:58.500]
um

[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.560]
Subbri what is it? What does that mean SPEC?

[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.340]
Isn't there a word that's supposed to follow that? I don't know

[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.960]
Anyway subbrinded the harman and military police officers have been charged with abusing detainees at Abu Ghraeb

[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.620]
Harman is now probably the world's most infamous dominatrix of Saddam Asakism

[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:22.380]
She took her orders from army military intelligence officers CIA operatives and civilian contractors have conducted brutal Israeli-style interrogations

[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.760]
She's accused of photographing dead Iraqis posing with corpses

[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:31.140]
Stracking several prisoners by jumping on them as they lay in a pile writing rapist on a prisoner's leg and

[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:35.020]
Attaching wires to prisoners hands and penis while he stood on a box with his head covered

[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.900]
Most of us would likely find harman seriously deranged in need of years of psychological treatment

[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:43.900]
But Limbaugh finds her and pfc limbed the England attractive

[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:49.700]
England is featured in many of the torture photos and once he smiles happily with the cigarette clents between her teeth

[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:53.200]
As she points at her hooded to raki man's private parts. That's my girl

[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:58.340]
England's boyfriends surgeon Charles Grainer is a former prison guard with a history of domestic violence

[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:00.840]
None of this bothers rush on the contrary

[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:08.700]
Harman and England are patriotic Americans initially engaged in good old American pornography as limbaugh said in May 6th more like good old American snuff films

[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.760]
In fact for limbaugh torture is a good thing it builds character

[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:18.780]
Americans are too squeamish too wimpy unable to face up to the neocom plant of total war against Muslims and Arabs

[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.740]
The war bushes promise will last for generations

[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:24.360]
I think a lot of the American cultures being feminized

[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:28.860]
I think the reaction to this stupid tortures and example of the feminization of this country told his audience

[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:32.480]
In other words, if torturing people makes you sick you're a feminine or maybe French

[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:36.120]
It used to what rush seems to be saying there's more where that came from

[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.140]
For Russian the neocons it's all about humiliating and torturing as many Arabs as possible

[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:45.240]
It could all be that the whole purpose here which has been said was to humiliate these prisoners

[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.400]
And there's no better way of doing it than what was done

[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:51.680]
These are Arab males love better way to humiliate them than have a woman or have authority over them

[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:56.920]
What's the purpose here? What's the objective of this? The objective is to soften them up for interrogation later on

[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:00.900]
As I said there was no horror there was no terror there was no death no injuries nothing

[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.440]
Said rush

[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:07.300]
Never mind that people were killed and photographed by limbaugh's centerfold subbrindity harman

[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.920]
The point rush is making is that Arabs are

[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:14.380]
Untermencine subhumans and they don't experience horror and injury the same way Americans do

[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:22.380]
It's okay to settle up the 70 year old Iraqi woman with a harness and ride around like a donkey because Arabs are immune to terror and abuse and it goes on

[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.380]
Rosh limbaugh and the babes of abu grave

[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.440]
Yeah, nobody died

[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:29.380]
Right

[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:35.160]
Well a few just a few that were beaten to death, but yeah just a few and the brits by the way

[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.260]
Beat of fume to death also plus raping the young male the prisoners

[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.340]
well

[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.100]
all of these things

[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.300]
In the war against terror

[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:50.160]
You're doing a superb job. Oh, yeah, you know, I have a job especially with whatever the camps man

[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:53.520]
Wait till he start taking him in to take those showers

[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:57.600]
Hmm once you take on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners is our question

[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:00.180]
Bush has to go 243

[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:06.740]
Romsfeld has to go 104 this is out of 534 votes only the abuse of officers should be punished 62

[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:11.640]
It's part of war 55. I just don't give it shmit 43 8 percent. They don't care

[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.120]
No matter what they just don't care they want to hear

[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.980]
Not 30 man

[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:25.060]
Lot more of that and they will and they must have deserved it 27 5 percent say they had a coming

[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:27.720]
Them schmata heads

[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:31.340]
rag headbar burians they had a cullin

[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:34.660]
They shouldn't have bombed us on you know not a lot of

[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.660]
That'll teach you not to do it again

[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:43.800]
Oh, by the way the number of Iraqi dead so far see the British newspapers actually list the numbers each week go for the week

[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.740]
And so far the total why would they do that?

[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:50.180]
Because they're not like the american press they're not totally intimidated yet

[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.980]
Not totally controlled and brainwashed

[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.980]
16,000 dead Iraqis

[01:33:58.340 --> 01:33:59.600]
Hmm any year

[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:06.920]
1195 us and brits almost 1200 16,000 Iraqis well, they shouldn't have attacked us

[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:13.940]
Should have been having a morphine's of astrospection all over the place right and those plans should have been having dinner with Osama

[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.960]
Your mama the same story with all these other evil doers harboring terrorists

[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:21.840]
Should have been putting that chemical weapons that we gave them on their own people

[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:25.280]
4 meds till noon at 560 WQA M

[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.520]
Nobody wants to talk about cancer heart disease all of these horrible things and yet

[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.120]
We owe it to ourselves and our families to be sure that we're in good health

[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:35.640]
It's a proven fact that disease responds extremely well treatment if

[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:40.740]
Detected early that's the key. There's an amazing place. It's called Hollywood Diagnostic Center

[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:43.960]
Was there about three four weeks ago? They're proud to announce their virtual colonoscopy

[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:50.280]
coronary heartscoring and full-body screening exams that can detect cancer other life threatening diseases and their early stages

[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.680]
The doctors referral isn't even needed for all your imaging exams called Hollywood Diagnostic Center

[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:56.000]
954

[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:03.160]
9663600 for the test that can give you and your family peace of mind if you have a really good exam like I did you walk out of there

[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:07.840]
Get the results and you think hey, I'm gonna live like in these at least another week or two at Hollywood Diagnostic Center

[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.040]
They are first aid the art imaging equipment with open MRI high-speed cat scan nuclear medicine and much much more

[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.060]
These folks have been serving the south Florida community for over 20 years

[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:20.840]
And if the solvary also provides a complete mobile diagnostic service that can come right to you like for example when

[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:27.280]
Throger's mother breaks her arm and leg and neck so called Hollywood Diagnostic says for your imaging exam today at 954

[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.880]
966 3600 that's 954

966 3600 that could be a life-saving call

[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:44.000]
I am from Iliana

[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:52.920]
Ross Lateman and I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from Jews and listening to the near rocket

[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.180]
I'm gonna eat the hour

I hate you so I always will I look at you and wish I could blow you away

[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:21.920]
I'm sure wish you hadn't wrecked my wedding day wedding day

[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:30.180]
I was on my back and then you shot me

[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:36.180]
But now I will attack bill because you never got

And the revenge rules my heart I will shoot straight

[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:04.680]
Yes, till you'd better be prepared to meet your fate

[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.200]
Oh drop dead bill

[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.100]
Oh please

[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:16.720]
I love to kill you

[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.220]
I love

[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:22.460]
I got the care of the blues

[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:25.900]
Please long to be

[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.000]
Follow to have a little weeny for lunch here

[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:31.580]
Okay, having a slim gym and cheese

[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.560]
I'm already going to very much work a life

[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.880]
And I'll present it called the Iraqis Iraq's

[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:39.240]
The provide security will continue on July 1st and beyond

[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.000]
I'm July 1st okay, ready for that? I'm July 1st

[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:42.780]
Oh, it's gonna be fun

[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:44.680]
Yeah, we're gonna turn it over to somebody

[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.420]
Here's the case to the kingdom anybody want them?

[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:50.300]
Oh, well don't know I'll jump a ride once now come on

[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.500]
Yeah, I mean this is already May the 10th

[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:58.320]
June 30th we're handed over to the kingdom

[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.380]
To somebody over there, we're not really sure who

[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.960]
Paul Bremer by the way is forming at the mouth

[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.360]
You see what he said the other day about how they waited and waited on this thing with the abuse of the prisoners

[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:11.600]
And they knew about it for months and the international red cross had been screaming and yelling

[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.580]
The Brits finally admitted that in early February

[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:20.100]
They were warned by the international red cross about the abuse advisor by the British troops

[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:23.540]
At the same time the Brits were saying their news media

[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:25.660]
Oh, it's all a bunch of funny pictures

[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:28.440]
It's uh, oh well, I guess we were wrong

[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.020]
But it's probably T-time anyway in Britain, wouldn't you think?

[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:34.840]
It's in it always

[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:38.660]
It's always T-time, that's why they spend so much time in the T-room

[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.700]
Here's the facts from Jeff who says, welcome back, we went to Rome a few years ago after hearing you for so long

[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:48.080]
We went all over the place in Italy then we went to London, Paris after 9-11

[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.740]
Everyone was sympathetic treatise by kings, the French kissed our asses

[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.580]
That's all been shot to hell thanks W

[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:58.160]
In fact, I was talking about this with some friends over the weekend when we were still in Europe

[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:02.320]
The fact that right after 9-11 we had the whole world on our side

[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.820]
The whole world loved America, they felt for us, they empathized, they sympathized

[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:09.920]
They wanted to do everything, they wanted to massage our parts, they loved us

[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.100]
Two months is all it took for W to turn that right around

[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:16.300]
Turn the entire world against us

[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:21.560]
Anyway, Jeff says this year we'll be going to Vegas and San Francisco, not Budapest and Prague like I want

[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.720]
Can't wait to pay $3 a gallon of P.S. where are my guilty noises?

[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:26.480]
Jeff wants to know

[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:29.900]
Well

[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:29.900]

[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:31.960]
Oh

[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.220]
Oh

[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:32.600]
Oh

[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:37.740]
There you go

[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:40.140]
That should keep you at least one o'clock

[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.600]
Keep you going through the lunch hour Jeff

[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.040]
Calm down

[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:50.300]
5-6-7-05-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:55.080]
Don't forget we got the pretons coming up Saturday right?

[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.740]
Dave Johnson will be calling again on Friday

[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:57.160]
I know

[01:39:58.020 --> 01:39:59.860]
I gave it to you a triple man

[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.480]
What's in the end of the horse in the Derby that I picked?

[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:07.260]
Smokey is Smurras, Smarmy, Adams, Grizzly Adams, whatever it is I forget

[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:08.540]
Smokey Beck Canadian horse

[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.880]
Longer Derby, easy in the mud

[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.480]
An imperialism with the Kent Dissoramel board finished there

[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.120]
I told you he'd be on the money

[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.880]
Dave Johnson is always not fast enough, Neil, I'm so sorry

[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.500]
947 dollar triple I do believe

[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.680]
Probably some people cash but they don't want to call and say hey thanks a lot of you you made us some money

[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.140]
That would that would be you know that would be bad

[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:37.180]
Let's see Kentucky Derby oh yeah I already got this it's on our website and I'm going to get to it but I don't know why you just back to us

[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:39.980]
To me I guess you're not checking very closely okay about Jose Santos

[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:46.240]
We love you Jose always like Jose Santos number one and number two now I like him even better than ever because he's suing a hero

[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:46.620]
Oh

[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:49.240]
Nice going Jose baby

[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:54.280]
I think it's the same yes the same AP story

[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.920]
The jockey who wrote funny side to victory last year's Kentucky Derby in pre评 the stakes is suing the hero for libel

[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:01.660]
All right

[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:06.080]
No you know even you remember that but where they showed the uh that yes maybe

[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.440]
I believe that the imaginary uh battery that he supposedly had in his hand

[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:09.860]
Right

[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.940]
I think somebody at the hero should have a battery up there

[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:19.120]
Let's get all those uh Iraqi abusers uh let's bring it over to one hero plaza okay

[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:25.120]
And start abusing those hero publishers those right wing lunatics those many of those pandewars

[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.120]
Jose is seeking forty eight million dollars in damages and federal law suit filed last Tuesday in US District court in Louisville

[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.880]
The suit contains that the hero printed articles and photographs about the Chilean jockey that were libelist even after Santos

[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:44.520]
Directly and in arguably disagree with and contradicted denied all the allegations presented by reported during a telephone interview

[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.360]
Robert Bady attorney in spokesman for the anxious hero publishing company

[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.840]
So yesterday he hadn't seen the lawsuit once we do we'll analyze it and determine the appropriate responses

[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.840]
But I can assure you we will be defending against the allegations vigorously you should only rot at the hero

[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:04.200]
Okay and by the way Howard Cohen nice story there about those ratings huh you idiot man

[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:08.780]
Did they ever print a correction about that all see that's the thing about the newspapers

[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:12.640]
They just put any kind of craft they want in there and that if it turns out that they're wrong if they ever do

[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:16.640]
Print a retraction or correction it's in little teeny tiny print somewhere like on a page

[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:22.260]
Where they got all the subscription information or that nobody reads you know I'm talking about oh yeah yeah

[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:28.620]
That's their idea of a correction big 106 not heard by shop-jock laws right you should live so long

[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:34.120]
They went from a nine something share in February to a 1.8 and men in March

[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:42.580]
What's eight nine so nine since like eleven it's a almost 90% of their audience vanished in one month

[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:52.100]
And this jackass this clown is idiot in the business section of the hero rights a week ago Friday big 106 not heard by law so

[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:56.740]
Shocked yock and then Tom Jerk by the way our good close personal friend

[01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:01.520]
Musk gives him all the numbers okay a given the graphs and the charts and the numbers for this and for that

[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:04.680]
Of course, up he's seen a few numbers this time

[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:11.980]
There's his time I checked the Sun Central every single day and I even confabulated with muff about it this morning

[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:20.480]
In our pre pre show a meeting I said I didn't see a time jicker right away about it did he said no how you like that with egg on his

[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:24.960]
Push he said no didn't write a word give all the numbers all the information

[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:34.660]
That's the kind of information you get in the South Florida fish wrappers boys and girls you don't have it

[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:43.100]
For mankind is the internet and that's pretty sad because it's a little on the scary side like the 18-year-old kid in in Germany with his sassy

[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:48.680]
Of virus there that a stick him on top of a box and stick those wires up to his his hands and his penis

[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.700]
Don't you think oh yeah

[01:43:55.220 --> 01:44:01.980]
In fact let's take a look at the pictures you really looks like all the side you know which ones I'm going to take care of if you want to interrogate it personally

[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:11.900]
No I just thought I would clip the wires on the complaint was brought by santo's in his family as well as sacked at Togo's stable in New York which owned funny side

[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:17.980]
The newspaper is parent company night rhetoric and several employees are named as defendants

[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:25.380]
The proof liable sent us would have to show the newspaper had knowledge that the facts were reported false or enacted with reckless disregard of the truth

[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:33.340]
Stewards investigated the finish of last year's Kentucky Derby after a photograph and story in the newspaper last May raised questions about whether santo's might have carried an illegal device

[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:38.920]
A battery in his right hand when he crossed the finish line stewards later concluded santo's was holding only his whip

[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:46.020]
The newspaper reported santo's city carried an object in his hand during the race and they've described it as a curing to learn how to write it to his presence

[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:52.660]
The jockey who speaks English with a heavy accent later said there was a misunderstanding he was talking about his curay bracelet for arthritis

[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:59.660]
No speaker to no pick it upon me now what what kind of Spanish do they speak in Chile Spanish

[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.160]
Spanish

[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:01.740]
Spanish

[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:09.080]
Kind of an answer is that it's a it's Spanish but you know there are subtleties between the countries I see

[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:17.280]
5 670560.560 on the 18t and Verizon wireless line let's get some additions for this pool of air

[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.880]
Red Cross report describes abuse in Iraq

[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:15.880]
The Red Cross saw American offices mistreating elbow-grab prisoners by keeping them naked and total darkness in empty cells

[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:21.240]
And up to 90% of Iraqi detainees were arrested by mistake according to report disclosed today

[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:27.080]
Let me just read that last line again there up to 90% of Iraqi detainees were arrested by mistake

[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.960]
Like cab drivers for example

[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:37.060]
Right for example the report by the international committee the Red Cross supports its allegations that abusive Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers

[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:43.980]
Was broad and not individual acts contrary to President Bush's contention that the mistreatment was the wrong doing of a few

[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:54.980]
ICRC delegates directly witnessed and documented a variety of methods used to secure the cooperation of the persons deprived of their liberty with their interrogators according to the confidential report

[01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:03.380]
The delegates saw in October how detainees in Abu Ghraib were kept completely naked in total empty concrete cells and in total darkness the reports said

[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:09.740]
It said found evidence supporting prisoners allegations of other forms of abuse during arrest initial detention and interrogation

[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:16.100]
Among the evidence were burns, bruises, other injuries consistent with the abuse that prisoners alleged it said

[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:27.080]
The 24-page document confirmed by the ICRC as authentic after was published today by the Wall Street Journal said the abuses were primarily during the interrogation stage by military intelligence

[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:31.900]
Once the detainees removed irregular prison facilities the abuses typically stopped it said

[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:38.560]
The report said the abuses on 10-month torture including brutality, hooding, humiliation and threats of imminent execution

[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:55.160]
These methods and of psychological and physical coercion were used by military intelligence in a systematic way to gain confessions and extract information of the forms of cooperation from persons who had been arrested in connection with suspected security offenses or deemed to have an intelligence value

[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:58.640]
The agency said arrest allegedly tended to follow a pattern

[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:12.760]
Arresting authorities entered houses usually after dark, breaking down doors, waking up residents roughly, yelling orders, forcing family members into one room under military guard while searching the rest of the house and further breaking doors, cabinets and other property of the report said

[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:18.160]
We're here to liberate you! Why aren't you thanking us and giving us candy and flowers?

[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:24.460]
Sometimes they arrested all of the old males present in the house including elderly handicapped or sick people that said

[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:30.460]
Treatment often included pushing people around insulting, taking in with rifles, punching and kicking and striking with rifles

[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:39.200]
It said some coalition military intelligence officers estimated between 70 and 90% of the persons deprived of their liberty and a rack have been arrested by mistake

[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:44.000]
They also attributed the brutality of some arrest to the lack of proper supervision of battle group units

[01:52:46.380 --> 01:53:01.680]
Pierre Cronbule, ICRC director of Operation said Friday the report of a given US officials in February but only summarized what the agency had been telling US officials in detail between March and November of last year, either in direct face-to-face conversations or written interventions

[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:07.620]
Cronbule said the abuse of prisoners represented more than isolated acts and that the problems were not limited to Abu Ghraib

[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:13.680]
We were dealing here with a broad pattern not individual acts he said there was a pattern and a system declining to give further details

[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:17.020]
The report described how male prisoners were forced to parade around and women's underwear

[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:23.400]
Well, we didn't hate that song, you know? That Christmas song?

[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:24.740]
We don't, no that's right

[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:32.300]
It said that information obtained suggested the use of ill-trimid against persons deprived of their liberty went beyond exceptional cases

[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:42.660]
And might be considered a practice tolerated by coalition forces Cronbule said the ICRC regretted the publication and said it would have preferred sticking to its policy of confidential discussions with coalition authorities

[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:47.900]
Because the US have been making progress toward meeting its demands they declined to discuss the full report

[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:48.440]
Yadi Yadi

[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:54.900]
But then of course these dang pictures got out, you know what? That's the Chigurana Wood pile, the pictures got out

[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:56.000]
Damn it

[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.720]
That's the proper training they were talking about it they were trained not to take pictures right into your problem

[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:06.440]
And they keep asking what kind of lunatics, what kind of maniacs would take pictures of themselves doing all of these things?

[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.200]
All of these things!

[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.760]
Part of the procedure they decided

[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.660]
Catherine Harris, you're about her plane?

[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.380]
For her to about her peanuts?

[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:18.740]
I heard Gary Sarner was on her plane

[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:24.920]
That's her alarm starting today, put that in your uppipe and smoke it Miss Foddo, can't there's room in your mouth?

[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:26.240]
Yeah

[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.520]
Tough on it, Matt

[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:35.580]
Representative Catherine Harris, the former Florida Secretary of State who oversaw the disputed 2000 presidential election

[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:39.060]
Admitted she's responsible for a vote coming uncounted, her own

[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:43.340]
She's a vozo, she's a dumber, she's a miserable idiotic bitch

[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.860]
Harris forgot to sign her absentee battle when she voted in Longbow Kees Local Election March 9

[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:53.220]
I feel terrible the Republican said Friday, it's a mistake I regretted

[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.500]
Harris said she was in a rush to catch a flight

[01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.620]
Uh-oh, you hear that?

[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:01.120]
Catch a flight

[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:08.580]
To Washington DC when she handed the unsigned ballot to her husband to say then she said she usually both in person has never had trouble before

[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:11.920]
I know how important voting is, Harris said, oh what a line that is, huh?

[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:15.400]
She knows how to fix an election with the best of them

[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.920]
The election decided the fate of a proposed community center, yada yada yada, after the making of events

[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:24.460]
Harris later received a letter from the supervisor informing her that her vote didn't count

[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:34.040]
This story to me, this is one of the most amazing things for Dr. Bob, wouldn't he be just shocked right now?

[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.320]
The crispy cream story?

[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:36.000]
Yeah

[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:37.960]
You talk about it?

[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:38.160]
Nope

[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.180]
Well why not?

[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:40.500]
You're saving it for me

[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:41.360]
Yeah, that's all

[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.620]
Hey you like your crispy cream, and look at me

[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:46.420]
Had one this morning?

[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:46.940]
Yeah

[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:50.100]
Lire, how about you Jyce like crispy cream?

[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:51.680]
We had crispy cream all over the place in here

[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:52.320]
I like it

[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.460]
You make it donuts better actually

[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.700]
Oh my god

[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.120]
I have just

[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:03.900]
Lost it

[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.800]
We'll find it

[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:12.460]
That has got to be the most unbelievable comment in the history of the subhuman race

[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:16.800]
You like Dunkin' Donuts better than crispy cream, you know what that's like saying?

[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:18.180]
Oh boy

[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:25.560]
That's like saying you'd rather sniff, you'd rather sniff scruans ass for six hours

[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:28.260]
Then have a banana split

[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:34.660]
You'd rather put your nostrils under Duff's armpit for six years

[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.340]
Than enjoy a delicious plate of spaghetti bolanesi in Rome like I had

[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:41.760]
Spaghetti pomegranate d'oral

[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:46.380]
Man, outside of the food in Rome continues to be, there's just nothing like it

[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:46.720]
Man

[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:50.660]
I wish I weighed about 20 pounds when I went there, you know?

[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:54.340]
And just had to eat like several meals a day just to stay alive

[01:56:55.660 --> 01:57:00.660]
You really said you like crispy, you like a Dunkin' Donuts, I'm gonna give you a chance to change your mind on that now

[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:02.160]
You want to use stand by that answer?

[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:03.140]
Yeah

[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:07.480]
What does he know? He's just a punk

[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.340]
Now you don't eat the crispy creams that we have in the building for free?

[01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:12.740]
No, they're looking sugary, you know?

[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.640]
A little tooth-weed

[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:20.340]
Maybe if you'd start eating crispy cream instead of Dunkin' Donuts, you'd stop talking through your teeth like that

[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:25.640]
Maybe it makes you, it makes you greet your teeth when you eat the Dunkin' Donuts, they suck

[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:27.880]
They're the worst

[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:34.700]
I wouldn't feed Dunkin' Donuts till like a starving Saudi Arabian, to a peasant in the desert

[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:39.760]
I wouldn't feed Dunkin' Donuts to some schlepper on the street here

[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.140]
San

[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:42.900]
Spare some change, Mr. I wouldn't feed them Dunkin' Donuts, eh?

[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:47.980]
Crispy cream hit by the Atkins craze

[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:48.940]
Oh my god

[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:51.280]
Yeah, we're getting to that heavy duty

[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:52.880]
Even though Josh would rather hear about

[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:58.340]
I noticed that Dunkin' Donuts stuck in effected because nobody gives a flying crap about Dunkin' Donuts

[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:00.220]
So there's no story about them

[01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:04.020]
But you continue eating those which leaves a lot of crispy cream for George and everybody else, right?

[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:04.780]
Right, until we die

[01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:05.560]
Good idea, good thing

[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:09.180]

Back in the day when someone done a strong

We didn't take their cry

Imperial Harbor, they're one that jobs, drop their bonds

[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:38.020]
We bombed them bad, and now the Saudis, they hit us hard

[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:41.180]
And on our cards are little flags waving

[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:48.460]
As that Saudi love and recharge points the farmers the wrong way

[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:54.920]
And on embarrassed to be in Americans

[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:58.500]
Where they follow goals like cheese

[01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:01.740]
The United States of arrogance

[02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:06.140]
Led by Bush and his family, reading of this country

[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:11.560]
And the late North, the largest state in our history

[02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:15.720]
I don't want to be a tax American

[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:20.040]

Stop living in the West

[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:35.900]
If you want that SUV to drive

[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:38.460]
You're gonna need more gas

[02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:42.920]
It's the greatest country in the world

[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:45.060]
They train us to believe

[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:49.200]

Where we pay three authentic leaves

[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:06.420]
We have flagged with hand with our head in the sand

[02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:10.460]
And blindly follow the powers that we have ascetic

[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:12.020]
And I'm not a frantic dog

[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:16.240]

The Yorker magazine published a photo of dog threatening an A.K.D. and made it Albu Grey Prison

And the same man with blood streaming from his leg after he was apparently bitten

[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:05.160]
The US was expecting the publication of more photos

[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:10.020]
And a video from the notorious jail in Baghdad that they're thought to show US soldiers raping a woman prisoner

[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:14.080]

Pentagon sources warned that the abuse of dead bodies possibly murder victims

[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:39.320]
Is a recurring feature in the sickening material. I'm going to read that paragraph again

[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.860]
While I get sick

[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:45.800]

Senator John Warner said lawmakers would be allowed to view them in private

[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:09.640]
But Senator Lindsey Graham said the Bush administration needed to make the photos public as soon as possible

[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:11.320]
You know that Dhrulan Lindsey Graham?

[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:17.460]

[02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:20.040]

Last week Mr. Graham more and the public needs to understand we're talking about rape and murder over here

[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:31.520]
The administration is prepared for a damaging fallout a worried defense official said it's a time bomb

[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:37.620]

[02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:02.460]

[02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:29.780]
Kelly told the mirror was a film of about 24 pictures all taken in Iraq most of them showed general scenes of soldiers holding weapons posing for the camera

[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:33.580]
But there were four of them that really shocked and disgusted me they were horrible she said

[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:37.500]
The first showed a prisoner being forced to perform oral sex on a soldier

[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:40.940]
The prisoner was screwing up his face and disgust he looked deeply ashamed

[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:45.480]
The second showed two naked iracky men with one apparently being forced to rape the other one

[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:54.300]
The third appears to be taken in some kind of warehouse and showed a naked iracky looking terrified being dangled in the net from the lifting gear of a forklift truck

[02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:02.620]
He was being held about 15 feet off the ground and looked absolutely petrified at the wheel of the forklift was a soldier in uniform and you can clearly see his face

[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:05.500]
Two British soldiers were watching what was going on and smoking

[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:09.420]
The fourth one showed a group of a racke men all naked sitting on the ground

[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:12.820]
There were about ten of them sitting were squashed up together but none of them were on top of another

[02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:14.640]
Some of them were scared some of them looked ashamed

[02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:19.940]
Labor MP Alice Mayan said the sickening twisted this already horrific tale diminishes us all

[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:24.340]
The news that Iraqi women and children were raped is a truly horrifying turn for the worse

[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:28.900]
Are we really to believe that these soldiers are the only ones responsible for not a chain of command?

[02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:34.940]
We need answers from Washington and London about what those orders were and who gave them etc

[02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:36.900]
There you go

[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:38.980]
We better get that on the watch right here

[02:05:38.980 --> 02:05:40.140]
There is a war on off steam

[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:44.360]
That what it is good fun. Yeah, that's what rush says

[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:47.400]
This boys will be boys girls will be girls

[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:50.140]
It was the babes that were doing a lot of the stuff those hot babes

[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:57.460]
Just pathetic people who are there and all of them virtually all of them

[02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:01.580]
And we've done extensive research on interviews with their loved ones their relatives

[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:07.340]
Their friends back in their hometowns whether in West Virginia or Maryland or anyplace else around the country

[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:14.080]
Say they have no way they can't understand how it's possible that these people did allegedly

[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:20.560]
What they're at least seen as having done in these pictures as you look at those young faces what goes through your mind?

[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:23.140]
They are the face of America wolf and not only that

[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:28.300]
They're smiling just as they are in the pictures and that's why when my colleague says you know

[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:31.660]
Well, let's just keep this investigation quiet. Let's recover

[02:06:31.660 --> 02:06:35.540]
We can't recover by the way if we're looking like we're covering up

[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:41.200]
And these young men and women were smiling in those pictures because they believed that they were doing the right thing

[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:47.480]
They were going to get into trouble for doing what they were doing in these pictures

[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:50.420]
There's a sense of hilarity in these pictures

[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:53.580]
They were having a good old time as well as a good gay old time

[02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:54.580]
That's what it looks like to me right?

[02:06:54.580 --> 02:06:55.100]
I believe in hotel

[02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:57.380]
Exactly. Yahoo, y'all come

[02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:01.740]
22 to 1 at 5 60 Don't forget about that crispy cream strainer

[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:04.760]
I know that Josh don't want to hear about it because he's too busy with his dunky donut

[02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:10.900]
Man, I can't believe that. My opinion of you was in fact George told me before he came in this morning

[02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:13.340]
You did a fabulous job last week it was great, etc.

[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:19.720]
And you have just dropped several notches on a Richter scale. You got some serious work to do with Mr.

[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:25.020]
You eat like two crispy cream donuts. You got diabetes. How can you handle that?

[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:29.540]
I already have diabetes. Okay, but you can't eat only two. You have to have at least three.

[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:32.700]
I think you got it. You have to have at least three. Okay?

[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:34.440]
I only had one this morning.

[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.840]
Yeah, well what's the excuse for that?

[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:41.000]
I took one and then I ran away from the other ones and ate it in here.

[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:45.280]
But ate it right next to the box and would have five.

[02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:47.320]
That's for sure. You can't eat only three.

[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:54.140]
21 to 1 at 5 60. We got the mad dog at 1 at 2 at 1. All right. I like to sound of that at 2.

[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:58.520]
You got the Humber, the Hebrew hammer at 4 and then after that it's, well, it's Monday with you went.

[02:07:58.520 --> 02:08:01.560]
No ball games. That attendance has been dropped in badly.

[02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:05.900]
Although most of they had 30,000 people there because it was, it was, uh,

[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:13.400]
Darryl, what was it? Don Trell, Cap flip off your coach something night.

[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:15.780]
What was it? It was like Don Trell hat night.

[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.620]
Well, he made it a little more complicated. Now you kept flipping something.

[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:22.380]
But that's tough. You know, she's got a real sense of humor.

[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:25.520]
He said 30,000 for the giveaway night. But the other games have been on a week side.

[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:28.320]
13,000 for the Dodgers, 14, 16, 12,000.

[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:31.240]
A little on a week's side, I would say maybe everybody's billed out of town. You think?

[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:31.840]
Yeah.

[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:33.380]

You should shut your mouth and don't be anymore. Back to the U.S.S.A.

[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:10.580]
Great thing I come up with in my SUV is far from easy way to play.

[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:18.980]

Great thing I come up with in my SUV is far from easy way to play.

[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:26.320]
I think I was scary John Kerry. By the way, if you notice how little we've seen him these last couple of weeks, I mean,

[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:31.020]
we're the ads finally, which are kind of weak, but at least they're there now.

[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:36.700]
But where the hell is he though? In the middle of all this. He ought to be screaming and yelling and carrying on shouting from the rooftop.

[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:43.420]
We see a lot of Joe Biden. We see plenty of Ted Kennedy. We see lots of John McCain. Where the hell is John Kerry?

[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:47.520]
Maybe he's Biden his time. Either better, maybe he's trying to get the medals back.

[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:56.420]
Now get back to Krispy Kreme, the important stuff. In fact, let's do that pool. What do you say? Not on the website, but just for the hell of it.

[02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:01.360]
He'll give him something to call about. Do you think? Okay.

[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:07.360]
Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts? Or maybe they got some other ones they like. Is there another, I don't know any other ones.

[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:10.800]
As far as a big chain? Yeah. A big chain.

[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:17.720]
I hear what you're saying. Krispy Kreme hit by Atkins craze. This is a shocking. Don't make her Krispy Kreme a scene that shares plunge.

[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:21.680]
After it warned that the man is being hit by the craze for low carb diets.

[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:32.620]
Everybody and their brother now is low carbing it. I mean, beer is low carbonate. Subway, every fast food joint is low carbonate.

[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.200]
Oh, you'll be pleased to know that the pet rat was still there. McDonald's on the dam rack.

[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.660]
Well, that's good. I never understand that. It's always under, you know, the deep fryer they hit with a frizer.

[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:49.880]
It's always under there. And every time I've stood there waiting for my diet, so to my whatever the hell I'm getting, it comes running out.

[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:54.120]
Maybe it's just a greeting or something. I'm thinking maybe it's a mechanical rat. I don't know. You shouldn't name it.

[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:00.600]
The firm said donut sales were I did. I said, hey, Greg. Nice to see an Amsterdam.

[02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:09.820]
The firm said donut sales were following across the industry and that it would close the gourmet bakery until a bought what a unit that a bottle only last year.

[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:15.100]
The news profits were likely to fall, push cheers down 25% to $23.90.

[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:21.400]
More and more Americans have tried to cut out carbs as part of the popularity of the Atkins diet rest in peace. Nice going, Dr. Bob.

[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:28.900]
How can anybody stick to that diet though? Really? I mean, I did it once. How can you stick to it?

[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:33.600]
I don't know. Well, we have the lights away spoken the next breaks and maybe that's the answer.

[02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:38.240]
See how I bailed out of that? Nice.

[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:45.180]
For the diet said here in crispy creams glazed gooey confections as well as baked goods in general are off the menu. See that Josh?

[02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:51.740]
You don't want to balloon up like the beast and all those other fat tubs like Zach, all those tubs of crap you got right in around there. Those bald headed geeks.

[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:53.920]
I don't think there's any chance of that.

[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.360]
The warning marks the first real setback for the company since it went public four years ago.

[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:04.060]
The intervening time is a spandor overseas, including in what some would see is that a departure from its downhomers in the US South.

[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:08.760]
An outpost in the upscale Heritage Department store in London, no less. This is the BBC website.

[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:16.080]
The brand's endorsement by celebrities has helped drive it to a strong position in the $10 billion dollar donated to your US market.

[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:23.560]
And since floating in no wonder this is written so awkwardly it's on the BBC website. It's written like it by a bunch of brits.

[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:33.420]
In a statement, crispy cream had no hesitation in blaming the Atkins diet and its local likes like the South Beach style, which is absolutely nothing but a real cheap imitation of Atkins.

[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:35.140]
I don't care what anybody says.

[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:43.740]
For several months there's been increasing consumer interest in low carbohydrate diets. It's got live and good. The firm's president chief executive and chairman.

[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:53.460]
He's the C. When did that start? We started hearing about the CEO and the COO and the ACC. See you next time. What did that all start?

[02:14:54.040 --> 02:15:03.280]
Just subtly slow in. It's kind of like the quartet. Are you, you, you're not trying to make me that nobody knows what that is that they're using that term.

[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:08.920]
I'm surprised about the EU thing because since when did they start acting as a unit just because of the money thing?

[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:18.120]
It's the US, the UN, the EU and the Russian. I mentioned it, but I thought Israel was in there somewhere in what in the quartet. Oh, they're in there.

[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:29.600]
I'll write. They're stealing all the halava. The trend has a little discernible fact that our business last year, but recent market data suggests consumer interest in low carb diets has heightened significantly following the beginning of this year.

[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:39.540]
It has accelerated the last two to three months from now on. He said the firm will focus on the core donut business, which means that the writing is on the wall from Montana mills, the gourmet bakery business brought last year for $40 million.

[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:47.420]
In addition, Krispy Kreme is hoping to bring out here you go, Josh, what you've been waiting for a low calorie sugar-free donut by the end of this year.

[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:54.820]
That doesn't taste like crap. Oh, and probably going to taste real good, but the crap part you got to keep in mind because that's probably what it's going to make you do.

[02:15:55.260 --> 02:16:01.100]
It's probably going to be loaded with like sorbetol and manateau and maltatol and the old stay close to home and crap it all.

[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.500]
Can't say that no more.

[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:10.160]
I want to watch it. That team of button pushers that are lined up at that table I dreamed about. They're going to be on your ass.

[02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:13.880]
I'm serious. I really had that dream. They were all I think I had that dream too.

[02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:22.040]
Yeah, they all just sitting like long, long wooden table and each one had nothing but a little yellow squared dump button in front of them.

[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:27.000]
And it had to go right right down at a whole committee before it could finally go out on the year whatever the hell we were talking about.

[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:33.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

Yes. Yes.

[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:42.540]
I got to put it for the new car died.

[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:46.440]
No chain, no S-car, no road spill.

[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:48.600]
Okay, we're on it.

[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:55.520]
Wow. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:16:55.580 --> 02:17:00.100]
I think he really wanted to say something about Dom Trail Willis and about them caps.

[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:04.400]
But he got he was in. He was on a sports show. He was humiliated and embarrassed.

[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:05.340]
He was getting there.

[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:10.320]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on our AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:11.900]
WDQM. Hello.

[02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:13.960]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:17.980]
Did you see one of the prisoners in one of the photos?

[02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:22.180]
He looked like he had a swollen package.

[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:24.940]
WDQM. Hello.

[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.200]
That's a guy to call in his whole thing is swollen package.

[02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:29.960]
That's his whole lie.

[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.580]
Whether it's a rock group or whatever it is swollen package.

[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:33.840]
That's his life.

[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:35.320]
I have no life.

[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:36.100]
Oh, excuse me.

[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:38.640]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:40.200]
Crispy cream or ducky donuts.

[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:41.040]
You can do it.

[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:42.400]
Come on. Paper or plastic.

[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:46.920]
I'm going to say I may just go back to that like the seven months ago.

[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:48.780]
I'm going to think about it very seriously.

[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:51.300]
The seven months what?

[02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:51.980]
Did no calls?

[02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:52.580]
Right.

[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:53.060]
Oh.

[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:54.960]
Oh.

[02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:56.840]
I'm pondering it in my mind.

[02:17:56.940 --> 02:17:59.100]
Well, you know, maybe you call there like one over.

[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:01.320]
You know, just for a variety of sake.

[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:03.480]
Because it's too much pressure.

[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:05.240]
It's unfair for us to put this on a public.

[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:06.980]
Actually, like have something to say about anything.

[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:08.660]
It's a hell of a lot.

[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:08.880]
Yeah.

[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.640]
As opposed to just saying swollen package.

[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.580]
You're supposed to do for them not the other way around.

[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:13.580]
WDQM. Hello.

[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:14.340]
Hello.

[02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:15.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:15.800]
Hey.

[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:16.640]
Welcome back, buddy.

[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:18.160]
Hello.

[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:19.600]
Easy for you to say yes.

[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:20.340]
Hi, guys.

[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:22.260]
WDQM. Hello.

[02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:24.060]
Is there?

[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:25.040]
Speaking.

[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:28.980]
Yeah, between crispy cream and ducky donuts.

[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:31.140]
I would say crispy cream.

[02:18:31.140 --> 02:18:35.680]
But you know, you had asked on the poll if there were any others.

[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:36.660]
I guess time and all.

[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:37.480]
It's the best.

[02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:38.400]
Small potatoes.

[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:39.460]
Oh, okay.

[02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:40.200]
They're all small potatoes.

[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:40.940]
Thank you so much.

[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.040]
I watched Godfather 3 on the plane against them.

[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:43.640]
The seven 77.

[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:46.140]
I watched Godfather 3.

[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:47.000]
Yeah.

[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:47.560]
I'm sorry.

[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:49.900]
Don't be sorry.

[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:51.280]
The acting was just as bad.

[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:53.140]
But the and the awful lines.

[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:55.200]
You know, now they will now they will fear you.

[02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:56.060]
Maybe they should fear you.

[02:18:56.140 --> 02:18:58.340]
It was just so sad to take a movie.

[02:18:58.520 --> 02:18:59.960]
A movie with such an important message.

[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:01.980]
So much important historical stuff in it.

[02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:04.180]
And make them acting just stick to join out.

[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:08.320]
Like I said before the show today, if they were to shot Sophia.

[02:19:08.580 --> 02:19:10.320]
If they were to shot Mary in the beginning of the movie.

[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:11.960]
And if they would have fed Eli Wallach,

[02:19:12.580 --> 02:19:13.880]
the canola is right in the very beginning.

[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:15.260]
And we could have had these movie gone.

[02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:15.700]
Daddy.

[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.000]
And if they were left to George Hamilton somewhere on TV with that stupid.

[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:23.680]
Isn't that amazing that he actually he and his wife actually had a talk show for like five minutes?

[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:24.400]
George Hamilton.

[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:26.040]
Well, what does he do?

[02:19:26.260 --> 02:19:27.240]
Where did he come from?

[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:28.940]
He does exactly that.

[02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:30.620]
He has a tan and nice teeth.

[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:31.940]
And that's that's it.

[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:35.040]
Boy, can't complain about his acting because he don't do any.

[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:36.240]
WQAM.

[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:36.500]
Hello.

[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:36.980]
Neil.

[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:37.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:40.040]
How can someone not like crispy cream?

[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:40.700]
I know.

[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:42.380]
It sounds like a communist thing to me.

[02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:45.440]
I used to live about two blocks from a crispy cream shop.

[02:19:46.580 --> 02:19:51.320]
And by the time I moved out of there, Don Deloitte could turn and looked at me and went damn you need a diet.

[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:51.980]
Yeah.

[02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:55.600]
And the last time I ate Dunkin' Donuts, it was horrible.

[02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:58.540]
You know, they say that's what they like to donut fresh.

[02:19:59.540 --> 02:20:03.780]
My god, when I was living over on the other side of the state, I could have gave a donut to Japlone's skin.

[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:05.000]
He couldn't have stopped that in the net.

[02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:05.660]
Yeah.

[02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:06.980]
It was that bad.

[02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:08.540]
And...

[02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:09.900]
Okay, you're on a material pal, thanks.

[02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:13.600]
I mean, yeah, I'm not asking you to do a whole lecture on it just to...

[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:17.680]
In fact, quite frankly, I would hope you wouldn't respond to it, but they will.

[02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:19.460]
Because they got nothing else going.

[02:20:19.620 --> 02:20:20.320]
Five, six, seven.

[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:20.960]
I have no life.

[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.240]
Oh, five, sixty, pound, five, sixty.

[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:23.900]
I have no life.

[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:25.660]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:26.920]
On our poll, we're going to go to response.

[02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:31.120]
What's your take on the abuse of the Iraqi prisoners, which we're sure are just isolated incidents?

[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:31.620]
Not.

[02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:33.660]
723 votes.

[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:35.200]
Bush has to go with 328.

[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:37.340]
Ramesfeld has to go 134.

[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:40.960]
Only the abusive officers should be punished 93.

[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:44.360]
It's part of war 75, very naive folks.

[02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:45.960]
I just don't give a shmit, 61.

[02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:47.200]
8.4%.

[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:48.300]
Now, it's moving up there.

[02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:50.160]
And they must have deserved it 32.

[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:50.880]
They did something.

[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:54.700]
We don't know exactly what it was, but they must have given like a dirty look or mouth off or something.

[02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:55.940]
They're there.

[02:20:56.260 --> 02:20:57.300]
They must have said you're mama.

[02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:59.560]
They shouldn't have a bond night or whatever there.

[02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:00.460]
WQM, hello.

[02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:01.300]
Hello.

[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:02.200]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:03.960]
Uh, Neil.

[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:04.800]
Yes.

[02:21:05.500 --> 02:21:06.580]
Talking about polls.

[02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:11.880]
I just don't believe any of these polls about the president being ahead.

[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:16.360]
You know, I don't know what to take on that is, but I don't buy it at all.

[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:17.220]
Why not?

[02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:20.020]
I don't know what you think.

[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.480]
Do you think that all the polls are fake?

[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:22.220]
They're all fixed?

[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:24.300]
Not all of them.

[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:26.760]
I mean, what do we have to look at these days?

[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:30.260]
I mean, all the corporate mogul vote, all the media stations.

[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:31.840]
I mean, you look at it.

[02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:33.360]
I don't know if I can say this, ABC.

[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:34.680]
I mean, it's Disney.

[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:38.660]
So they're not going to cover any of the issues that's having a...

[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:41.040]
But, uh, move it out.

[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:42.200]
Okay.

[02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:43.080]
And have a great day.

[02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:43.640]
Whatever you said.

[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.960]
ABC Ted Coppel did do the thing the other night.

[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.200]
A week ago, Friday, and Ridley, and names of all the dead soldiers.

[02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:50.140]
Which I commend them heartily for.

[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:52.200]
And then, of course, what was the company being with an ass again?

[02:21:52.500 --> 02:21:53.220]
I mean, Sinclair.

[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:53.960]
Sinclair Group.

[02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:56.480]
They're 70 ABC affiliates.

[02:21:56.600 --> 02:21:56.700]
The public.

[02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:57.480]
The public.

[02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:03.700]
The public.

[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:03.940]
The public.

[02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:04.160]
The public.

[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:04.400]
The public.

[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:04.440]
The public.

[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:04.440]

[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:05.580]
The... you know, the narrow things we're doing.

[02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:07.640]
All these wonderful things were emancipating.

[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:08.460]
We're bringing democracy.

[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:12.800]
Since it's when, and again, nobody's asking this question because the American media sucks.

[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:17.940]
But since when was it our goal to export freedom around the world?

[02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:18.740]
Export democracy.

[02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:23.560]
Nationbuilding, which is exactly what Bush said he wasn't going to be doing when he was running for office.

[02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:25.600]
Nationbuilding.

[02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:26.660]
When did that come about?

[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:27.980]
Sure.

[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:29.260]
I see.

[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:33.300]
Emmancipating people from all these evil dictators that we installed in their first place.

[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:35.900]
I don't know.

[02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:37.660]
I must have missed that part of the year campaign.

[02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:38.580]
He's starting up again.

[02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:39.140]
Yes.

[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:41.980]
1257 at 560 W.C.

[02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:44.260]
Like I said, there's nothing like the Atkins diet, man.

[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:46.920]
Or any other low carb than I just say that minutes ago?

[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:47.540]
Just.

[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:54.000]
Well, I did point out that it's hard to stay in any of the low carb diets because just the meat and the cheese and the seafood, I mean,

[02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:55.720]
it sounds all wonderful and good in the butter.

[02:22:56.060 --> 02:22:57.660]
That's great by itself, but it's pretty boring.

[02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:58.380]
It's one dimensional.

[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:00.900]
And that's why people are looking for variety.

[02:23:01.400 --> 02:23:04.600]
And that's why you ought to be heading for Delights of West Booker the number one low-carves through an American.

[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:09.940]
Now, a lot of the new reduced carb products on store shelves are geared toward cutting back on carbs, but not on weight loss.

[02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:11.160]
Well, who the hell wants to do that?

[02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:15.500]
Delights of West Booker's expertise has always been on the weight loss phase of low carb dieting.

[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:21.800]

[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:28.800]
If Delights host stop by, their staff knows dieting inside and out, and they're open every day, seven days a week from 10 to 10.

[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:46.360]
Here's some taste, here's some variety, here's something to keep you on that straight-nero path that otherwise is so boring and one-dimensional.

[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:49.720]
Don't forget Delights of West Booker's your official Atkins retail center.

[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:54.720]
5-6-Low-Coff, this is 5-C-T, the radio's on your side.

[02:23:55.920 --> 02:24:05.380]
2-1, this is Delaries, and you know, won't be listening to her in junior ads as I want to.

[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:12.580]
Another thing, you know, some of me would have been a big star by now.

[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:16.860]
You know, it's that little bit sweet voice that you can take anywhere, little cutie-poo.

[02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:18.880]
We saved you?

[02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:20.460]
I think that's a different brand.

[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:23.780]
I don't want that 30-500 Ways to hire a huffer.

[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:26.760]
You're a hot, the more I see you.

[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.340]
Yeah, what a huffer.

[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:30.640]
The more I hate you.

[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:32.140]
What do I see?

[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:34.400]
And when I see you.

[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:35.600]
Okay.

[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:38.380]
I want a time.

[02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:41.520]
Hi, you're a tech agree.

[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:44.780]
Oh, don't, don't, don't cheat.

[02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:45.700]
A roll.

[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:49.700]
It's the end of the whole matter.

[02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:53.400]
And points like that.

[02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:57.200]
Why you, why you're a smart you?

[02:24:58.040 --> 02:24:58.720]
That's a thing.

[02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:01.340]
I know my smell attracts you.

[02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:04.840]
But unlike that you.

[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:09.320]
You still got your job.

[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:16.340]
I feel just like that you are my divrutter.

[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:19.820]
And what did you do another?

[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:24.820]
That's why you are still not buying it.

[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:34.160]
The noise, the noise, the noise.

[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:38.840]
The noise, the noise, the noise.

[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:41.240]
The noise, the noise, the noise.

[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:46.900]
I'm on a show and I must you.

[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:50.500]
In a cow, by...

[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:53.600]
That's what you think we'd say that's all about you.

[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:03.700]
It's 103 at 560 WQM. Happy Monday to you. You didn't talk it all last week. I guess about

[02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:08.200]
that story about the three proms in Lyons, Georgia. No, I did not. That we've seen this

[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:14.760]
morning around CNN and the... I beg your pardon? I missed the story. Three cultures, three

[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:23.580]
proms for high school. Now the only story I could find was one from last month. Monday,

[02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:27.760]
Monterey, Harold, somewhere. Where is this from? Monterey, Harold? I don't know. Where's

[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:33.940]
Monterey? Oh, it's in Georgia. Okay. Well, that's where it happened before. They keep

[02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:38.600]
having that there. Yeah, I understand. The black kids at Tumes County

[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:42.320]
High School, and keep in mind, this was written before. I mean, these proms just happened

[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:46.540]
this past weekend. The black kids at Tumes County High School will hold their prom at the

[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:49.420]
National Guard Armory next weekend, and the white kids will dance live, reminisce, and

[02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:53.460]
cry on the same building on May 7th. What about the Hispanic kids? Which party will

[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:57.600]
the children of the Mexican migrant workers attend? This is in Lyons, Georgia. Neither

[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:10.140]
they'll hold their own prom. It won't be my first for... Oh, hello. Wow. I don't know if

[02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:23.440]
you can hear us. Neil. We just lost a line or something. Or audio or something. This

[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:30.060]
is a technical emergency. Maybe he'll pop back on it. I know it's lunchtime. That means

[02:27:30.060 --> 02:27:35.000]
nobody's going to be going right. The engineer is anyone. Go rustle up an engineer or

[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:46.800]
something. And you know panic. Like, you know, yell, scream like a woman. Hello. We just

[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:52.220]
lost the air thing. We lost you. And now you're back. Well, what else is that all about?

[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:56.860]
I didn't go anywhere. I didn't shut anything off. Obviously you didn't on your end. So

[02:27:56.860 --> 02:28:00.780]
something's going on on your end is what you're saying. I'm sitting here talking and I'm

[02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:04.000]
not going to be responsible. I'm thinking you're probably just stuff on another door

[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.700]
on your face or something. What kind of crap was that? We're up and running, but we weren't

[02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:11.440]
there for a while. We're often running, man. It sounds like sabotage to me. Probably

[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:15.240]
Jeb Bush got his fine figure stuck in the middle of this crap. First impression is me.

[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:18.780]
An evil elf in the control room leaned on a button or something, but there was nobody

[02:28:18.780 --> 02:28:22.180]
there. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is,

[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:26.820]
Tumes County, Georgia now has three separate proms for the high school. They have one for

[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:31.740]
the blacks, one for the whites, and one for the Hispanics. Well, how do you like that?

[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:36.600]
It wasn't supposed to be this way when Yuri Flores bought a $50 ticket to the white

[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:40.040]
prom in February. She retired later that day with a white girlfriend, Jennifer Hart, who

[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:43.460]
also wanted to buy a ticket. Hart says the white prom committee girl wanted to know if her

[02:28:43.460 --> 02:28:48.240]
date was white, black or Hispanic. Mexican was the answer. Well, she told me that it was

[02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:52.820]
a white prom, not a Mexican prom, not a black prom. It made me feel mad. That's not right.

[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:58.720]
I wanted to put my fist in her face. She said, you go, girl. It's the babes that are

[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:02.260]
meat now that punishment. Anyway, that's what Russia says. They Flores too was stunned,

[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:06.740]
hurt, mad, and with the minutes determined. The Hispanic slash Latino prom committee was

[02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:10.520]
formed that February afternoon. The Silverado Night Club on US one North Alliance, Georgia

[02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:18.000]
resounded May 8th. That was set out night with Kumbaya, rap, pop, and reggae. As Latino

[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:23.280]
high school kids in Tums County and from across East Central Georgia go to the prom, CUMBIA.

[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:30.440]
Kumbaya? My lord, Kumbaya? This is the land of freedom. It's supposed to be a land of

[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:34.740]
dreams that Anna Rosa Perez, a Tums high school junior with braces and aspirations for

[02:29:34.740 --> 02:29:38.040]
a career in Hollywood, but it's not equal. We just don't want to be left out. I'll probably

[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:41.220]
show other people if you want to try to achieve something you can do. Why can't all the kids

[02:29:41.220 --> 02:29:50.780]
go together? Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. Now who's being naive? K. Oh, boy. I printed out

[02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:54.600]
a good part of this. See more her story from the New Yorker. I don't know. It's just

[02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:59.060]
too long in Pondras. We do. We do have it on there. Chain of Command, how the Department

[02:29:59.060 --> 02:30:05.220]
of Defense Misshandle did disaster in Abu Ghraib. Grab, grab, grab, grab. With that new picture,

[02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:09.080]
the moment of the dog, everybody's going to want to take a peek at that. And then also

[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:14.340]
they were speaking of dogs, Cynthia Rothrock. Now she's all right. That picture is okay.

[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:19.000]
It's kind of erotic. She's got a good body. How about that? From many, many years ago.

[02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:22.780]
She's how old I say she's now 75, something like that? 49 or something. I don't know.

[02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:29.160]
5670560, pound 5660 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Look at that phone, man. Are they

[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:35.160]
doing it or what? WQM? Hello? New. Yes, sir. Three things. Love the moment, Goldie

[02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:39.700]
Bits. Man, that's the best thing on radio. Second thing, I got a right. All time favorites.

[02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:44.600]
Oh, God, I love it. I got a brother to the military. And he said that the civilian contractors

[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:49.000]
is a politically correct way to say mercenary in case anybody hadn't caught on to that

[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:56.100]
quite yet. And I was delivering to a feed supply store near Lake Okeechobee last week

[02:30:56.100 --> 02:31:00.700]
when George went off on one of his Middle East ramps. Right. And actually had a guy come

[02:31:00.700 --> 02:31:05.420]
up to me, some big cowboy bowhunk. And he came up to me and said, what station he listened

[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:09.540]
to? And I told him QAM out of Miami. And he said, who's that faggot liberal that's

[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:13.960]
talking? I told him that George needs a spilling host. And he goes, that faggot needs

[02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:18.100]
to have somebody put a bullet in his brain. And then he's just off. He's got Jesus saved

[02:31:18.100 --> 02:31:23.840]
license plate. I'm scared. Oh, man. All right. And there you have it.

[02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:28.980]
I just love you. I'm going to forget it. And have a great day. There you go. He's gunner

[02:31:28.980 --> 02:31:32.380]
for your ass, George. Yeah. We were talking about the Christians. When you're good red

[02:31:32.380 --> 02:31:35.740]
neck, he folks there went in good Christians. He got Jesus on his bumper stick. And he got

[02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:40.820]
his shotgun in the back in a cab. Speaking of what he was just talking about before that,

[02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:45.060]
many of the prisoners abused at the Abu Ghra'at prison were innocent. Iraq. He's picked

[02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:49.820]
up and random by US troops and incarcerated by underqualified intelligence officers or

[02:31:49.820 --> 02:31:53.580]
former US interrogator from the notorious jail told the Guardian newspaper, the Brits.

[02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:58.420]
Torrin Nelson who served as military intelligence officer at Guantanamo, baby for moving to

[02:31:58.420 --> 02:32:02.560]
Abu Ghra'at was a private contractor last year. Blendy abuses on a figure of command in

[02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:07.080]
US military intelligence and overreliance on private firms. He alleged that those companies

[02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:11.340]
were so anxious to meet the demand for their services that they sent cooks and truck drivers

[02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:17.540]
to workers interrogators. In fact, maybe this truck driver that this last caller was talking

[02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:21.960]
about, maybe he ought to be going over there. I'm sure he'd do a fine job. Now, yeah,

[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:26.140]
he'd feel right in with this crowd. Military intelligence operations need to drastically

[02:32:26.140 --> 02:32:29.640]
change an order for something like this. Never to happen again, Mr. Nelson said he spoke

[02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:33.180]
to the Guardian in a series of interviews by phone and email. He claimed that many of

[02:32:33.180 --> 02:32:36.260]
the detainees of the prisoner are actually innocent of any acts against the coalition

[02:32:36.260 --> 02:32:39.820]
and are being held until a bureaucracy there can go through their cases and verify there

[02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:48.680]
need to be released. And it goes on about the variety of different, incompetent, unqualified

[02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:55.340]
clowns who are in charge of the interrogations. Mr. Nelson denies any involvement in the

[02:32:55.340 --> 02:32:58.700]
physical and sexual abuse of Iraqis at Abu Ghra'at was listed in the official military

[02:32:58.700 --> 02:33:02.820]
report into the scandals of witness rather than a suspect. He says he be sung from his

[02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:07.380]
job in February and fear for his life because Abu Ghra'at was coming under increasing

[02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:10.960]
attack by Iraqi insurgents and because of his disillusion in the military leadership

[02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:15.600]
there, he's now working as a private contractor but not as an interrogator. Any audio,

[02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:22.440]
anonymous. Also on our website, torture on the cheap. It's a beautiful thing. 5, 6, 7,

[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:26.800]
0, 5, 60 pound. So I'm just examining in my mind since I made that comment at the

[02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:30.140]
beginning of the show. I'm not doing any more of those. Build the pool things, the

[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:35.100]
older builders. Have you noticed? Yeah. It's like a culture shock. You know, oh,

[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:39.940]
what do we do now? Because you had a really rolling there on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday

[02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:44.300]
with the euphemisms and the oxy morons and just the plain old everyday morons. They

[02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:49.840]
were on a roll man. They thought, hey, this is heaven. WQA, I'm hello.

[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:55.900]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Good. Hey, Andy really had a great idea for what George Bush

[02:33:55.900 --> 02:34:01.220]
should be doing. Yeah. Did you hear it? No, I did not. And see. He didn't need to get

[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:04.440]
off the campaign. You know, stop back from like a candidate and start acting like a

[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:08.440]
president and get us out of that quagmire. Put all his energy into getting us out of that

[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:15.680]
quagmire as opposed to campaigning. You know, 25. I have a suggestion for you, Andy. Hold

[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:18.720]
your breath. Okay. And here right now, we'll let you know what an exhale. We'll keep

[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:24.820]
it on your eyebrows. The chances of that happening on a scale of minus infinity are

[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:30.900]
an ink on a happen. In addition to which, how do you act like a president? Oh, you know,

[02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:34.820]
put on some makeup. In other words, what he's been doing for like three years plus,

[02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:39.700]
come on. It's after one at five, 60 WM, you know, buying a mattress can be so dang confusing.

[02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:42.800]
So many brands and different model names that are restored. It's almost impossible to

[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.800]
compare plus all the phony sales. False promises and strings attached. You have to really

[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:51.460]
read the fine print, which is why dollar mattress is so amazing. It's the easiest possible

[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:54.940]

We're sports radio five six. You a M.

[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:03.600]
Vidmilti's version of the old west when cabboys were smelly and used five hundred

[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:09.020]
curse words for sentence. There's a new gunslayer in town to avenge the death of his

[02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:16.420]
friend. Why I'm building. What you do? These parks stranger. Yeah, who did? For you.

[02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:18.520]
I'm Buffalo Bear. Mommy.

[02:36:18.740 --> 02:36:20.020]
He said.

[02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:25.180]
Kid living in a low bill. You sure are fast on a

[02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:29.120]
I wouldn't be fast if I didn't put the lotion in a

[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:29.960]
holster.

[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:34.340]
Stranger. I've been told a terror for my

[02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:38.540]
nose. That's about as close as we can get to promoting the viral

[02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:40.880]
article. Only on eight.

[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:42.200]
No.

[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.620]
One seventeen at five sixty W. D. Q. M. the man dog coming to two we're going to change

[02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:47.380]
the polls now.

[02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:53.600]
Oh, I already emailed the terror. I mean a fact that I did something with it. I stuck

[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:54.760]
it in that stuck it.

[02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:58.720]
The already faxed to him. Here's the final result of the first poll today. What's

[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.000]
you take on the abusive Iraqi prisoners and obviously the audience isn't nearly

[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:07.420]
is a whipped up into a frenzy as I thought they would be. Are they? No. No. They just

[02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:08.120]
read don't care.

[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:11.720]
Bush has to go three hundred and fifty nine. Chris we could have asked any we could

[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:15.380]
have asked which is the best donut and if we put Bush has to go is the first

[02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:18.180]
category on here it would have won. Right. See what I'm saying.

[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:21.040]
Bush has to go three hundred fifty nine.

[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:25.560]
Romsfeld has to go one forty five. Only the abusive officer should be punished

[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:29.380]
one hundred and one. It's part of war seventy nine. I just don't give a

[02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:32.760]
Schmidt sixty five eight point few percent which is depressing but probably the

[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:36.240]
honest answer and they must have deserved it thirty two four percent of almost

[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:41.440]
eight hundred vote. Here's the a new poll for the rest of the day. Much more

[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:46.900]
important obviously which is the best donut. Okay. This is something they can

[02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:48.080]
sink their teeth into.

[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:53.800]
Christy cream. Don't get donuts or I hate donuts. I don't know why the other

[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.860]
choices. There are many many independent donut shops. Yeah but none that we

[02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:01.680]
ever heard of that. I mean their individuals this is like mom's donuts pops

[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:06.680]
donuts. Yeah mom's. Don't I. Rose. Donut Joe.

[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:09.680]
You're brosie donuts by the way and everybody thought about that. Yeah.

[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:17.600]
I suppose the brosie. You suppose the brosie. No. No. Yeah. Who knows about the

[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:23.520]
brosie. Hose. Which is the best donut.

[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:27.580]
Christy cream. Dunkin donuts. All right. I hate donuts. We have no other choices.

[02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:32.540]
Now naturally you can always add on to that list. But see what's going to really

[02:38:32.540 --> 02:38:35.640]
piss them off as I picked another poll right away. I mean is there anything else

[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:39.200]
to really put on there. No. Not really but we'll see. Because I mean let's do

[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.880]
it the scientific way on our website instead of having a bunch of stupid people

[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:45.120]
calling and saying oh Christy cream. But oh don't get that. Yeah. It's just a

[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:49.440]
pathetic is what I mean we'll kill a good hour forty or one minutes. But we

[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:52.500]
ain't gonna do that. Alan King is dead. We mentioned at the beginning here was

[02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:56.600]
the lung cancer. Heavy heavy smoke. He was all right. I mean he was not like really

[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:01.520]
fall down funny kind of guy but he was schmaltzly you know. 76. He's dead and

[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:05.920]
all of us. Osman is dead. She was the mama mama Sita of the whole Osman

[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:14.760]
clan. She's dead 78 after a nasty stroke. Look at that power balls 205

[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:18.800]
million. I'm gonna go win that. I'm gonna get in the car and run a car and drive

[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:23.760]
on that Ohio and win a power bowl this week and then have a good time. And then

[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:27.920]
maybe that guy would just pick up for I can drive up and give you what for. Give

[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:30.980]
you like Licky Licky all over your body. That's probably what he'd like to do. Oh

[02:39:30.980 --> 02:39:34.700]
yeah. But he calls all the names in there. Just like you're seeing over there in

[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:38.020]
Iraq right now. That's what it's all about. It's closet baggering head is finest.

[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:45.640]
Somebody QAAM hello. Yes sir. I'm sorry I've never added to your polls before

[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:50.280]
but I just feel compelled. The spirit of Christ compels you go ahead. Public

[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:55.200]
bakery makes very good donut but I would never eat any there because donuts are

[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:58.820]
best for you. No I'm not asking you whether you'd eat them or not. I mean this is

[02:39:58.820 --> 02:40:02.380]
not we're not gonna come and check in your cupboards and all the way might. So

[02:40:02.380 --> 02:40:05.600]
look at the second covered from the right if you do. Oh that's the one okay thanks a

[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:09.700]
lot Pally. See it publics. Publics let's put publics on here we can get Josh do a

[02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:12.240]
little bit of work here. Add a couple of names on right. Maybe we'll have a

[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:15.120]
list of a whole bunch of them. About 30 minutes. Like two o'clock what do you think?

[02:40:15.260 --> 02:40:18.940]
I doubt it. Then we'll of course have to go and sample them all. You will have to

[02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:22.300]
go. I'm not I'm not eating no donuts. I'll tell you all about it. No I don't

[02:40:22.300 --> 02:40:25.740]
even care because I know crispy cream is the best number one and number two if I'm

[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:28.480]
gonna eat something outrageous like that. I'll go find me some more nestly

[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:34.860]
turtle ice cream something like that. Or maybe some rollo ice cream things.

[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:39.640]
Cones. You ever have rollo candy? Rollo cones yeah they have them. We call them

[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:42.840]
rollo but then what do we know? Is it rollo? I don't know I could be wrong.

[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:49.500]
I don't know. It's probably rollo but you know I went to school in Florida. I see

[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:53.200]
they're damn good no matter what you cone and they're gonna kill you. There's

[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:56.240]
nothing but pure sugar. Although the thing about those now if we're talking about

[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:00.720]
the same cone is that it doesn't really have a cone. The part underneath the ice

[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:04.960]
cream is all chocolate. It's solid chocolate is that what we're talking? Yeah. See

[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:08.080]
now the cone is where you find all the trans fatty acids in there so that's

[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.720]
probably a lot worse for you as if you're one of those ice cream cone things with

[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:15.420]
the cone is much much worse than the rollo which is pure chocolate which has

[02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:18.120]
probably got more calories and more sugar but won't kill you so fast because

[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:23.860]
you don't have the trans fatty acids. Got it? Got it. Remember Dr. Kilmer McColley

[02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:27.180]
Culkin, man he warned us about that stuff and that homo problem too and I look

[02:41:27.180 --> 02:41:34.820]
what's happening over there in Iraq in Abel Gravenant. Somebody QAM hello? Yes sir?

[02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:40.380]
With Neil please? Speaking. Oh Neil how you doing man? How about

[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:45.500]
Entomans? Entomans don't know. Oh my god how could we forget that? And Velvet Cream also

[02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:49.460]
makes them. Okay the good point thank you. See I told you this is gonna now the

[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:54.740]
audience is happier. Velvet Cream which I can't read that's with a K. Yeah right

[02:41:55.620 --> 02:41:58.940]
and Entomans now Entomans quite frankly I don't think I we're had an

[02:41:58.940 --> 02:42:04.120]
Entomans just a donut maybe I guess I must have with all the crap I've eaten. You

[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:07.420]
know like the chocolate covered donuts are the ones that most people buy from

[02:42:07.420 --> 02:42:11.620]
Entomans which are I can't wait to see the way Josh is gonna spell Entomans but

[02:42:11.620 --> 02:42:16.620]
never less. Now Velvet Cream I'm trying to think that I certainly predates

[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:20.700]
Krispy Kreme by a long time but don't but Kreme where where did we find us? I don't

[02:42:20.700 --> 02:42:25.960]
know. Thank. So see this I told you this was gonna open up a whole new avenue

[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:29.020]
now the audience is next to feel so bad like we've we've shut out their

[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:33.180]
creativity their their laundry list all of these things you know. All of these

[02:42:33.180 --> 02:42:36.260]
right now they feel a little bit better about life and they're not so pissed off

[02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:39.040]
that I'm back from vacation. Of course it could always be a range I can go right

[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:43.940]
back tomorrow sounds good. No. Why not? Don't do that. Then of course don't forget

[02:42:43.940 --> 02:42:47.000]
a week from tomorrow George will be on again to just test it out make sure it

[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.780]
could just keep it in practice. Test out that panel of our finger are our

[02:42:50.780 --> 02:42:56.580]
button pushers. WDQ way I'm hello. Mr. Donets good. Mr. Donets. Yes sir. I may

[02:42:56.580 --> 02:43:01.180]
go ahead WBTA this summer. WBTA good. Well I hope we run into each other.

[02:43:01.180 --> 02:43:06.760]
At least I'll run into you anyway. If I see you wouldn't surprise me if he was

[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:13.240]
here. Yeah. My my my. Blind Mike is back WBTA and but they're right Mike. Oh you'd be

[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:17.360]
perfect there man. Talk about the blind leading the blind. 5 6 7 0 5 6 8. Oh

[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:20.000]
actually you have to be working for Greg Rita would think would be a perfect fit

[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.020]
blind leading the blind man. Greg congratulations on the phenomenal job you

[02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:27.720]
guys have been doing over there. Power 96 WQA. We couldn't have done it without

[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:31.080]
you Greg without your fantastic leadership with your hands on approach with

[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:36.260]
your real interactive thing. That's what I hear on the building he's got an

[02:43:36.260 --> 02:43:39.820]
interactive thing that's what I'm hearing. I can't tell you who told me that but

[02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:45.060]
you can probably imagine WDQ way I'm hello. Hello Neil. Yes sir. Hey how you know.

[02:43:45.460 --> 02:43:49.220]
Pretty good. Good listen. I just say you know man the Gover Cree was on H Street

[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:53.420]
30 second Avenue across from Georgia Super Stumps another wonderful place.

[02:43:54.500 --> 02:44:00.820]
8th Street and 30th. Yeah. Yeah. In Miami and Kyotl. Oh that ain't my hood.

[02:44:01.140 --> 02:44:03.920]
Across from Georgia. I guess they were all over the place though.

[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.560]
Well it was a shame. Anyway great to have you back guys. Have a good day. Thanks

[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:10.420]
pal. I have a great day. Velvet Cream. See now we got it at Donuts. Something

[02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:14.300]
people care about. Not these beatings and all this abuse and all this barbarism and crap.

[02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:18.960]
All the lies. All the innocent lives being sacrificed. We don't care about that. We want to hear

[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:22.480]
about Donuts. Now we got something like I said we can seek our teeth and new, right?

[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:28.260]
That. They got crispy cream here as matter. All of I don't think I don't know. I don't think

[02:44:28.260 --> 02:44:32.720]
that close by me. Thank goodness. And unlike where you are in tomorrow you don't go any

[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:36.040]
like your convenience store and find crispy cream donuts or any like local gas.

[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:38.840]
I haven't even seen any gas stations here. I don't think they can afford any.

[02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:46.180]
I think they'd rather unfumes. But in in South Florida for example you go into like your

[02:44:46.180 --> 02:44:50.820]
mobile station. Right. And behind the counter. Because from what I hear is crispy cream. We'll

[02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:55.500]
set it up just about anywhere. If you want to have a thankful of their donuts. Yeah. A booth.

[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:59.680]
Oh, whatever it is. But what do they call it? Donut. Yeah. They'll come in and they'll set

[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.240]
up for you and bring your fresh every day. At least they used to until they started losing their ass.

[02:45:04.380 --> 02:45:08.000]
See it goes to show you man. This whole thing with a stock market. I don't want to get started on that

[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:13.120]
again. But it's you know, hide it under your mattress. That's my best advice. Okay. Hide it under

[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:16.980]
the mattress. Don't let anybody see it or touch it in the money either. Because all of this

[02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:21.240]
below me. But this is the hottest damn thing to come along. A fool in his money are soon parted.

[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:25.320]
Nobody knows that better than I do. Believe you may. In fact, when his show ends at two o'clock

[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:28.640]
today, I'm going to be making a phone call. You'll be able to hear it even off the ear from all

[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:35.640]
the way down there. Be hearing screaming and gnashing and wailing. But listening. Exactly. In fact,

[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:40.040]
I might call him. Absolutely. This bitch him out just in general principle. I spoke by the way. The

[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:45.700]
weakest link. The mole man. A grotesque book. Joe Rose showed you his ass man. He showed it right

[02:45:45.700 --> 02:45:54.140]
to you. His big right. Lily. Why I ask right to your push. Let you in the dust. Mo. I'm feeling good.

[02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:59.900]
So anyway, it's good thing that you told you because our fine programming staff and management

[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:04.520]
didn't bother. Joe Rose would have found a copy after this was like third day. Man, you clear

[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:08.020]
clearance and duff. You ought to be ashamed yourself. All these stuff. Anyway, clearance to get

[02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:13.080]
me my checks. Hey, good news. Lobster Fest is back at the Emerald Coast. If you've never been there,

headaches. Just a big smile and a big fat puppet. There were faithfeatures of full salad bar,

[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:51.200]
full Chinese food lineup. Their brand new sushi bar and of course fresh. Seam cocktail. And if you

[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:55.280]
have any room left after all of these things, which is unlikely, but if you do, take the crow bar

[02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:58.580]
and shove it into your pants and make room for some dessert because they got a full dessert station

12 132 at 5 60 WQAM 58 votes on a second poll now this is the important one.

[02:48:36.900 --> 02:48:42.520]
Now you notice how I did that purposely donut can be spelled DOUGH and also DONUT right?

[02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:45.660]
Oh we got it. Mixed and matched all over the place which is the best donut.

[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:51.300]
Krispy Kreme 26 which is clearly the best answer the right answer. 26 I hate donuts 13.

[02:48:52.620 --> 02:48:57.960]
Dunkin' donuts 12. Publix 3. Endermans 2. In Velvet Creams got a pair. They have two.

[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:02.440]
How can it be that close? Well there's a lot of people with bad taste I guess and don't forget

[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:10.440]
Dunkin' donuts is for Graham. 567-0560, pound 566 on the AT&C and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:14.440]
Come to QAM hello. Hello. Yes sir.

[02:49:15.080 --> 02:49:21.640]
I'm Clonail. Yes I am. God loves you sir. I just wanted you to listen to your bid you played the

[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:29.480]
day that has Cartman on it. You forgot to believe just before it speeds up. Yeah. Have a good day.

[02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:36.460]
Okay. What is he talking about? Whatever I don't know. Yeah there was a belief that he thought

[02:49:36.460 --> 02:49:40.320]
should have been somewhere. Well we don't really care okay sir so just leave this.

[02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:44.340]
Remember the other year. Yeah well when we have auditions for people to sit on that long table

[02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:48.700]
at the panel with the yellow square buttons. We'll let you know okay. A few months away.

[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:54.100]
567-0560, pound 566 on the AT&C and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:49:55.100 --> 02:50:03.060]
WBQAM hello. QAM hello. All right. Sam just punching all over the place just just to check it out.

[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:15.440]
QAM. Yes sir. There is no doubt anybody's literate or illiterate mind. It's got to be Dunkin' Donuts.

[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:23.280]
Well how about if we try holding the candle to your door?

[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:26.460]
Right. And then you can sympathize with those poor raki prisoners over there too.

[02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:30.760]
What kind of an idiotic comment was that he sounded kind of militant about it too. He sounded like one

[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:34.260]
of them guys. I guess in the trailer parks they probably liked Dunkin' Donuts a lot when you think.

[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:38.840]
Or now the trailer parks they probably bring home the public's brand by the dozen you know.

[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:43.240]
WBQAM hello. Jesus whoa buddy.

[02:50:46.020 --> 02:50:50.620]
WBQAM hello. Yeah Neil. Yes sir. Yeah won't you marry me to Kennedy G. Go?

[02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:56.680]
WBQAM hello. Yes I agree with that last call. If George is deaf again he needs to be put.

[02:50:56.900 --> 02:51:01.360]
WBQAM hello. Yeah Neil. Yes sir. How about Hostess and Drake's cakes?

[02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:06.140]
What was the second one? Drake's cakes. What the hell is that?

[02:51:07.660 --> 02:51:12.800]
New York thing maybe. Don't know. Never heard of it. But Hostess is around here. The Hostess

[02:51:12.820 --> 02:51:16.940]
with the most is put Hostess on it and make them feel better. I thought Hostess made cupcakes.

[02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:20.840]
So I guess they made cupcakes. They probably make brownies. Things like that. And Donuts.

[02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:26.060]
He sounded like a brownie hound to me. 25 till 2. Now here is the book spinning on the

[02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:29.380]
axis of evil America's war against Iraq which I know that all the intellectual people in the

[02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:32.640]
audience are going to be rushing to the bookstore to buy it by Scott Taylor. It's a paperback.

[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:36.780]
You might actually be able to afford it but I doubt it. Spinning on the axis of evil America's

[02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:40.400]
war against Iraq by best selling off the award winning journalist Scott Taylor. If you read one

[02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:46.480]
of all these books that are out today this is the one you need to read. Okay. Got it. I'll even bring

[02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:52.680]
it back and loan it to you. Loan it and then I want it back. It's just it's just all in there.

[02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:55.980]
It just tells you everything you need to know. If you really want to know and of course most people

[02:51:55.980 --> 02:52:03.560]
would rather not know they'd rather be in the dark. I don't know. How about Tim Horton? What is it?

[02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:09.280]
Tim Horton. So Tim Horton's Donuts. Now we're talking a. I'll ride. How could I forget

[02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:14.780]
it and Tim Horton? Yeah put it on there just for fun. Maybe a couple of connox will be voting for

[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:20.860]
Tim Horton's. How the least do them by the way? So yeah fairly significant moderator on the buzz.

[02:52:21.140 --> 02:52:25.840]
Other yeah buzz this okay. I wonder they're all drinking after that last Philly game. And anyway

[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:31.020]
it's all over and it's probably just as well you know. I know you're pretty excited about the

[02:52:31.020 --> 02:52:37.140]
finals right? Conference finals. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and T in Verizon world

[02:52:37.140 --> 02:52:40.740]
of China. Certainly they're the world's man Canada went in the world tournament over there in Europe.

[02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:46.200]
Why are they going to give it up already? It's getting a little bit stale and old just too much of a good thing.

[02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:54.780]
Somebody QA him hello. Does David still exist? That's a good question I don't know. I don't think so.

[02:52:55.260 --> 02:53:00.540]
You don't think so? There was one on eighth street they tore it flat down to the ground and the one in

[02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:04.420]
the floor and the one in Coral Gables has been gone for a while. Krispy Kreme rules.

[02:53:04.420 --> 02:53:08.020]
All right now there's somebody with good taste thanks a lot sweetheart Krispy Kreme rules.

[02:53:09.180 --> 02:53:13.460]
Well put the I mean velvet cream at least once upon a time it did exist. What's the question again?

[02:53:13.660 --> 02:53:17.220]
Which is the best donut? Maybe they got some petrified that they've been hanging on to for a long time.

[02:53:17.260 --> 02:53:22.660]
Maybe they put them in the freezer. Very nothing like a good uh well I was going to say chocolate

[02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:26.760]
clear but you know what's even better than that is cream puffs. Oh yeah those are good. I haven't

[02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:31.460]
had one of those in a coons age man a cream puff. I don't believe you. I haven't I don't know

[02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:35.660]
how do you find those even a cream puff. I'm going to start placing this station. There are?

[02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:41.080]
Oh well that's another story. No no seriously. Where would you go to find a good like chocolate

[02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:44.620]
a clearer cream puff? What kind of a bakery? There aren't really a lot of good bakeries. What?

[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:48.180]
In Hollywood we have some like French bakeries and stuff like that that are very good.

[02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:53.220]
On the Dam Rack in Amsterdam they have a French bakery man where they they're lined up at 738

[02:53:53.220 --> 02:53:56.640]
o'clock in the morning for the all across Johnson all I have stuff they make in the morning.

[02:53:56.640 --> 02:54:02.020]
They make like those little tiny pizzas on whatever the hell kind of French bread unbelievable.

[02:54:02.380 --> 02:54:05.600]
I thought I'm eating them you do understand and just watching everybody else eating them.

[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:14.240]

[02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:28.920]
I don't know if they still make donuts but does a raw castle make donuts? They do?

[02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:35.540]
I think so. They never heard of that. Yes they do have bakery there because they used to have the

[02:54:35.540 --> 02:54:40.620]
little. Get out of here right? A bakery at raw castle? Not a bakery but they actually have the

[02:54:40.620 --> 02:54:44.800]
donuts and they're the Boston cream donuts. I know with the white frosting on the top.

[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:49.220]
I'll be there. That sounds good. The one in North Miami I think it's around 12

[02:54:49.220 --> 02:54:53.580]
to after. It's not like that. Wayne Arnold's. Wayne Arnold that's it. That's it.

[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:57.820]
And that's all I have to contribute today. Okay thank you and have a great day now.

[02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:03.000]
What were you saying about the guy from where? A Southbrower brokerage or mortgage brokerage or

[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:10.900]
a 20 freaking page fax of what? Crap. George Tenant's agenda for the next century or something like that.

[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:15.960]
Oh god stop already. Stop trying to save the world. It's just a freaking radio show. Okay we're

[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:19.920]
trying to do the best to put out little information there for you to read some ponderous articles to

[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:23.960]
kill four hours of your meaniest life every day. I have no one. The South Florida which pretty soon

[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:28.600]
is going to be like a it's going to be like a steam fact read on there pretty soon. What's the

[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:35.620]
temperature? Not about 89 in the shade. Not really. It was quite nice last night and not bad today.

[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:40.080]
10th of May. Well you just wait Mr. Wayne. You see nothing yet. Like I said pretty soon.

[02:55:40.080 --> 02:55:43.340]
Like in about a half an hour. It's going to be smoldering.

[02:55:44.620 --> 02:55:49.220]
21 till 2 at 5 speaking to half an hour gym manager be longer to a clock this afternoon. The highly rated

[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:53.980]
afternoon boys. You manage Hank Goldberg had a big book. We had a big book. Joe Rose had a big book.

[02:55:54.140 --> 02:55:58.640]
In fact the weakest link was five day in the morning man, especially those six to eight hours of

[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:03.880]
discretion embarrassment to QAM. We're still waiting for Tom Jiggett to write his piece about the ratings.

[02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:07.840]
You know you're pretty disappointing Tom. I'm not talking to him anymore either because that last

[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:11.880]
time you know when I try to get the thing out about stop FCC and all that jazz and he still miscoated

[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:16.580]
me again. Put the thing in the paper about well the station is every a few minutes they keep taking

[02:56:16.580 --> 02:56:20.820]
something. That's not what I said at all about the station taken stuff away. It's because of the FCC

[02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:24.960]
rulings. It's because of what's happening to freedom of speech that we used to have once upon a

[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:31.540]
time a little bit of Tom. But you can't get it right. Can you Tommy? So perfect for South Florida

[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:37.420]
man just like Howard Cohen at the Harold. Perfect match. Big one or six. And in fact when you think that

[02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:41.260]
this rating book if the only thing he wrote about was during going off the year in the market

[02:56:41.260 --> 02:56:45.800]
and big one or six taking his gigantic tumble wouldn't that alone be worth it? We could mention

[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:51.940]
some of the other numbers in passing but doesn't that make for like an important article? No. Excuse

No late father's a special

People fall into them on the flag

[02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:49.260]
147 at 560 WQM. I think tomorrow what we're gonna do is do just do a complete turnaround

[02:59:50.140 --> 02:59:52.420]
Okay, because it's taking us all of these years

[02:59:52.420 --> 02:59:55.900]
We finally figured out what the South Florida audience responds to what they just lap up

[02:59:55.900 --> 03:00:01.540]
I mean they they will phone in by the millions if he gives something to sink their teeth into how about something really easy like

[03:00:01.540 --> 03:00:05.960]
What's the favorite product at the public's oh boy like

[03:00:06.440 --> 03:00:07.660]
Velvita cheese or

[03:00:07.660 --> 03:00:15.260]
How many thousand products can you think about 30,000 we can get in fact that can curious right into August

[03:00:15.260 --> 03:00:16.620]
I would think name some food

[03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:21.740]
That's not a bad idea

[03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:27.620]
In fact, I'll make it even more specific name some food you like and then the next day we can do names some foods

[03:00:27.620 --> 03:00:30.480]
You don't like would be good of course brand names naturally

[03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:36.500]
How are we doing on the donut trail and of course this is all inspired by Josh and blame him because he had the interpret

[03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:41.100]
Comment earlier about like in Dunkin Donuts better than crispy cream

[03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:45.280]
Which I thought that was like a revolutionary to say that. Oh, we'll say this on American yes

[03:00:45.280 --> 03:00:52.140]
Dunkin Donuts has other things like coffee coffee very good and then I can't drink coffee make my stomach explode like an H bomb

[03:00:52.140 --> 03:00:59.880]
I can't say that once and whatnot. Yeah, so other they have croissants. Oh, yeah, they're very good to and they you know they make croissant sandwiches

[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:04.380]
croissant which is the I thought it's burglar king makes well likewise

[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:12.500]
Croissant which is without the egg or with how come we never got that back in the days when D for was working

[03:01:12.500 --> 03:01:17.720]

[03:03:18.340 --> 03:03:22.220]
Chuck Hagel said today that who's of course is a Republican he said that he thinks

[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:33.860]
Has it got a roll but in the meantime there's only one head that needs to roll that's in November and don't look too promising because John

[03:03:33.860 --> 03:03:38.720]
Kerry continues being really scary. We just can't find him. We can't seem I don't I'm not even sure he's still around

[03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:39.960]
You know, he may have just still left

[03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:45.240]
He may have gone on hiatus road. You know that new one that they're building that they can't seem to get over and finished

[03:03:46.260 --> 03:03:52.520]
That maybe where John Kerry is hanging it out because he just uh absent here's the opportunity to go in for the see he doesn't have the

[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:56.160]
I don't know how he beat Dean. I'll say it again. I think that that whole thing was fixed

[03:03:59.180 --> 03:04:03.860]
How did he come from absolutely nowhere to win all those primary? I saw it too

[03:04:03.860 --> 03:04:07.160]
I mean what was that all about what what what precipitated that

[03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:11.200]
Besides the course the great scream and then of course the biggest mistake of them all

[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:14.900]
When we got to see judy dean that was the real

[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:16.320]
killer

[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:22.700]
I think that means kite I haven't played that in a long time. I think we can still play that we don't I think she says

[03:04:22.700 --> 03:04:26.480]
Two or three times and by the way on that uh south park thing you like

Also, uh, but those places that that set one o'clock in the morning

[03:05:12.820 --> 03:05:16.540]

Florida now award from Howard Dean's wife hi

[03:05:53.440 --> 03:05:59.840]
Hello there, hand actor Julia Steinberg. Quite a presidential candidate. How it didn't you can call me juli

[03:05:59.840 --> 03:06:06.900]
Not judge juli. That's a different risqué people want to know why I'm hardly ever on campaign trail with how it hey

[03:06:06.900 --> 03:06:13.300]
Did you get a good look at me in Iowa? I scared a crap out of myself. I made crap a bison and look like a shane a poon him

[03:06:13.820 --> 03:06:16.120]
Stop me if I'm bombarding you with too much yiddish, huh?

[03:06:16.620 --> 03:06:22.020]
Anyway, how he says after I showed up his numbers drop it. No, I say that's a bunch of mischegas

[03:06:22.020 --> 03:06:24.880]
For those of you who don't take a piece the yiddish that means crap

[03:06:24.880 --> 03:06:30.480]
How is a good guy though? He's what you might call a loose cannon. He's got a pretty bad temper on him

[03:06:30.480 --> 03:06:34.300]
I remember one time one of our kids left the cap off of the toothpaste

[03:06:34.720 --> 03:06:36.460]
I thought he was gonna blow a gasket

[03:06:37.020 --> 03:06:41.620]
Zaveins popped out in his head and that white spit strings were gone in the corners of his mouth

[03:06:41.620 --> 03:06:48.480]
Event my sugar. I spent 23 years with the shagitz most of the time he's a man. But on occasion I hate him

[03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:52.040]
I think my husband how he would make for a very good president

[03:06:52.040 --> 03:06:56.340]
One of the things I'm a little p.o. about is that how he doesn't let us have a TV

[03:06:56.340 --> 03:06:59.800]
I want to watch section the city. I got a schlep down to campaign headquarters

[03:06:59.800 --> 03:07:02.600]
To the croggers to watch on some tiny black and white set

[03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:06.260]
I have never seen any program in color. So I'm no Jackie Kennedy

[03:07:06.260 --> 03:07:11.900]
Hell if you look at me. I'm no Ted Kennedy. I don't want to make up. I'm like a whisker away from being amish

[03:07:11.900 --> 03:07:14.280]
Don't expect to see much more of me during the campaign

[03:07:14.280 --> 03:07:18.720]
The only reason I'm addressing you today is because I was able to chew through my restraints

[03:07:18.720 --> 03:07:23.100]
Anyway, Gazagazont that's yiddish for that to judistine work over and out

[03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:25.420]

[03:07:45.320 --> 03:07:49.160]
Is the new or even the test pattern so you don't have to feel bad. It don't take it personal unless you want to

[03:07:49.160 --> 03:07:52.040]
They just all hate you moan. That's so what it that's what the deal is

[03:07:52.040 --> 03:07:56.620]
