Now they told me over to a rocky control

[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040]

WQ a.m. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing pretty good sir?

[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.080]
Did you happen to notice where the booby trap came from the website? It's on the bottom there. I didn't see that

[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.500]
It's moh our david's favorite milky paradise dot com all right

[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.460]
For five take another day and paradise. Thank you so much

[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.260]
For pointing that out to us and don't forget

[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.640]
Squirt your mouse along our booby trap

[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:40.960]
Yeah, yeah, the reason I keep repeating that I'm sure you do too is because a lot of guys probably are like clicking on here

[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.480]
And I say oh, that's pretty interesting, but they don't realize how the fun they can have with it by

[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.500]
Clicking their mouse. It's interactive drag your mouse right along that row. Uh, but all the rows and then put it back in the house

[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.440]
Exactly put the mouse in the house

[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.300]
Which of these people here's today's pooled you think?

[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:02.140]
Is or was the most despised south Florida personality of all time? You know what inspired me for the pool?

[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.760]
I give up well, don't you remember on tooth?

[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.420]
They I mentioned the the ricky ticky sands is departing his show and over like sliced hollivop in North pole right

[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.960]
And he's gone again for the umpteenth time. Bye bye ricky ricky ticky sands is only cast an over and time jicker

[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.660]
The only ones in town to keep kissing his ass. They must have something going

[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:26.840]
Anyway, uh most despised south Florida personality of all time radio tv newspapers in other words personality can include a lot of territory

[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.760]
So I got on a pool for a start rich sands

[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.120]
And then for the old timers out there Alan Courtney who was uh did talk radio in this town for about a hundred years

[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.560]
But uh became the most just

[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.780]
I'm not just for munching

[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.940]
You know, you never heard him did you?

[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.560]
I heard you talk about him that's all more actually heard him

[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.420]
hmm

[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.860]
nasty me old man. I mean just and of course I can understand a little bit of that when you knew talking south Florida for many many years

[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.960]
It was longer than that. Uh he was the pioneer no question about that

[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.280]
But he was a miserable old sunbitch

[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.400]
But uh I can't understand it gets to you south Florida has a tendency to like to make you

[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.800]
Like that. Yeah

[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.400]

I accept you as a precious gift

[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:35.240]
1018 at 560 wqm. I want to say they hate you Rick but don't let the door hitch in the pace the ants on the way out of town because

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.320]
We got 37 votes on a poll right away and

[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.560]
He's got 31

[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.080]
That's only because we don't have a lot of competition on there yet

[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.300]
We'll get a whole bunch of names on here. There are many people they despise. They hate like poison, but

[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:54.260]
So far the first 37 votes Rick Sanchez 31. Spilky's the rate. That was your choice. Three good choice

[00:15:55.220 --> 00:16:02.620]
Alan Courtney's got a pair and I voted on the only vote on her so far for somebody that I intended to put on there and somebody didn't waste any time in fact

[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.420]
You and Gregory Benjamin Buidel

[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.920]
Greg Buidel now most of our audience probably don't even know who that is anymore because he's been

[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.560]
He's been in between the country pantry there in Hollywood

[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.860]
Huh? Sorry. That's in between

[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.600]
Yeah, eating tables and cleaning toilets at the country kitchen in Hollywood where where my used to live

[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.380]
Uh, he's been unlike some

[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.840]
Low-watch stations, you know, uh, how many watch?

[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.440]
He's been around although I said he is what solid no question about that

[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.820]
So I voted for him because I don't want to make him feel left out because then he'll get paranoid about that

[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:41.080]
Although who am I to talk about people screw up in the head? I didn't realize I was screwed up in head until the last week

[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.700]
How do you like that? In a week and a half? I've lost seven and a half pounds. All right

[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:51.000]
How do you like that and the audience is out there? Oh, why you've done this a million times you fat tub. You'll see

[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.660]
You know, I know it because I the key for me is I just don't know if you have the sugar cravings the all that stuff all these things

[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.640]
No, no, don't have no need any big meals

[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:10.360]
Just to graze a little bit maybe some cheese over here and maybe uh some bacon this morning for breakfast and uh, you know some stuff a little bit here a little bit there

[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:10.820]
That's it

[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.820]
It's that is sitting down to those big heart throbbing meals that just tear your kishkis up

[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.700]
And making have gigantic oozing painful bowel movements like uh mupwitsa, you know

[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.200]
It's just seven and a half pounds in a week and a half pretty good for me

[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:32.940]
Yeah, you'll take and then duck I told up this morse is well. What are you on the other? Yeah, I should have said sounds to me like you're on something

[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.360]
No, seriously

[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.860]
Uh, I'm not on anything. I'm on the uh common sense save your life by it

[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:48.240]
There old Miller in Minneapolis didn't make it to airport security because he couldn't keep his pants on

[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.340]
Ha ha ha

[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:56.060]
Airport police said a security screener was waving a metal detecting wand over Miller's pants area on friday

[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.540]
When Miller pulled his short stout it was ankles the only problem is he wasn't wearing any underwear

[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.720]
Miller then said there. How do you like your job?

[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.600]
That's ending ending the screening quite any police report

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.920]
He was charged with a decent exposure released on 300 dollars bail

[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.180]
We've never had anybody do that before said air force police uh air-pro police lieutenant mad christensen

[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.820]
But it's not abnormal for people to become frustrated with the screening process

[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.440]
In other words, you probably is wondering why you waving your wand over my genital area

[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.440]
Miller also became belligerent during the screen in fact

[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.600]
They found out one thing about him. He was rock solid

[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.140]
He became belligerent during the screening TSA officers told police

[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:39.060]
One TSA employee also told police that Miller had a note inside a magazine in his bag with an expletive and told a TSA employee

[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.400]
Oh, yeah, it's for you when asked who the note was directed at in other words

[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.280]
You he probably give him the old dick chaining

[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.580]
Let's get some more names on that pool before we start to hopping in and all this crap. I got piled up here

[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:58.000]
Lots of crap all the crap all the time George tells me there's nothing going on well check check check check check

[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.740]
She

[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.280]
WQM hello

[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:01.760]

[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.640]
Thank you, Kelly. All right, buddy. All right, buddy. Castor no, we get his ass on there right away

[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.520]
Uh, shack is coming to town anybody know that

[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.120]
Really? I it's it's a miracle. I don't understand who these people are out there and quite frankly

[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.140]
I don't want to know them the sports news. I don't want to know them from them. I don't want to know nothing to bottom

[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.420]
Mad dog at two of the humpwirt four we got a fairly pristine schedule then we got the very rock solid big

[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.840]
That's seven o'clock for three upon two hours eighty-k at ten and I said pristine schedule

[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:45.260]
And then of course we got marlin's let's see to plan the pirates tomorrow. Am I right about that out of town stop new Josh

[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.560]
What's that I said chat oh?

[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:56.980]
Oh, I judge before we take any more calls the judge rule this week that it proposed politically motivated billboard

[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:02.040]
This is a little follow-up on a story we had on Tuesday by the group project billboard that was blocked by clear channels

[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.960]
Spectacle or division in myriad hotels was a contract dispute and not directly involving the first amendment

[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.720]
Spectacle or channel 70 plus displays in Times Square and for myriad hotels rejected the design last week

[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:19.020]
Project billboard an anti-war group has been charging the media giant cheap channel but your grave robbering bastards

[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.780]
With blocking the erection of it. Oh, we can't say that anymore the

[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.260]
Of a billboard that depicts an illustration of a cartoonish bomb

[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.360]
Drake would stars and stretch the company by the words democracy is best taught by example not by war

[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.180]
The ad was to appear on the facade of the marriott marquee hotel on Broadway August 2 November 2

[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.600]
Meaning the display would be up during the Republican National Convention starting August

[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.060]
And Manhattan through November presidential election and a yadda yadda

[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.080]
So there you go bad news there

[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.320]
It's just a contractual dispute and I can nothing to do with freedom of speech is what the judge said

[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.360]
Line 9 W. Q. A. M. Hello Neil. Yes, sir Glenn Hill

[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.120]
Oh, how can we forget my friend absolutely how to side out of mind

[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:11.020]
Okay, pal, he took the choices. Thank you so much. We're nearly we just say one, but I'm in such a good mood

[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.940]
Seven and a half pounds. I think I was telling George before the show

[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.100]
I think it about another couple of months

[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.620]
I'm going to be able to throw away a lot of that medication. I've been taking it's probably going to shorten my life tremendously if I keep taking it

[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.580]
No matter what kind of drugs you're taking boys and girls and I'm not suggesting

[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.280]
Please understand they you throw your drugs down the turlant unless of course they're illegal substances

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.040]
But and here and knock on the door, but other than that

[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.060]
Man get off of the drugs if you can

[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.160]
Because they be bad for you

[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:44.500]
And now there's new stuff with a cholesterol. Oh, yeah, you really now we want to get your cholesterol numbers way down there

[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.200]

Do me if ever play anything because I can't stand listening to you

[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.700]
You start like a douchebag

[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:41.720]
Do what do you mean if ever play anything? Well, can I ask you a question before you go? Oh God

[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.820]
You sound so stupid I hate to talk to you. Yeah, go ahead. Why did you call me? I didn't call you

[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.960]
I just tell you not to say anything just play something

[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.960]
Oh god can't stand it. Well then why are you listening?

[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.040]

[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.860]
I had to dump that. I'm sure you probably did too. Yeah, and you know it reminded me

[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:15.960]
I heard that those two words together on air and early this morning at 804. Yeah, on that show I was telling you about they actually said

[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:23.180]
They didn't just say it they said it loud and strongly like that's why hardly I mean there are several things that this

[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.980]
Company's just gone way overboard and of course because we have emotionally crippled the

[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.120]
Middle-level management people at WQA and as a result they've like gone way overboard

[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.640]
What you can't say there's and you can't do that you can't know like my little raspberry. You can't do anything

[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.260]
And I think that the

[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.580]
bag in fact

[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.460]
There are two of them one begins with an S right

[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:49.940]
Right correct, which includes the word scum which we can say scum on the air but we can't say scum and conjecture with another word

[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.960]
I have a handful of it

[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:59.460]
Right pons gum which we got lots of that in Florida and then of course the old douche you can you can do show your problems away

[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.840]
But you can't do a

[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.300]
Right. Oh god

[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.180]
So sad so pathetic so childish so spineless and in the fact I had to dump that

[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.540]
I don't know the gd don't forget that which Archie's been saying that for you know. Oh yeah, right

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.540]
In fact not only can we say

[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.460]
anymore we can't even say

[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.060]
The the letter

[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.400]
Right you know, I mean a

[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.680]
Hold them a ground

[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.340]
Could be dangerous if you're tripping phone right

[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.440]
So that's just a little bit of what we have to continue

[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.060]
But you know something we shall overcome we don't care because we want the checks baby

[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.520]
That's all we care about just give us show us the money

[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.420]
Show us the money and all the rest you can stick it right where the moon don't shine okay right in the old

[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.820]
Hole yeah, we just can't tell you where right now we can

[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.240]
We can draw you a picture, but we say it or we can stick our foot there to give you an indication

[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.980]
Although death might enjoy it

[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:59.080]
Which of these people do you think is the most despised south Florida personality radio tv to live your dead of all time

[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.160]
Rick Sanchez. I'm gonna tell you 105 votes

[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.280]
If you aren't near your computer and can't see this result you may be shocked

[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.680]
By these things pretty staggering

[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:16.460]
81 that's 77.1 percent of our first 105 votes say they despise rich Sanchez more than

[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.580]
Anybody who's ever come down the old pike that's with a pee

[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:27.840]
Spooky's Narees god nine and interesting in both of them have worked or did work or do work in her case on channel seven right

[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.220]
It's amazing how many people watch channel seven but they lie about if they pretend they don't

[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.660]
Horrible excuse for a newscast to horrendous

[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.860]
Whatever happened to the little news fairy there our good friend Brian is he did he go into limbo

[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.640]
Remember he called us that day he was going off to New York to seek his fortune and that's lost we heard of it

[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.540]
Huh, that's lost we heard of it now

[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.720]
I wonder what they're all talking about over channels so we're that talking about women

[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.820]
That's not not him or the paper boy. Yeah, they're talking about Shaq like everybody else Shaq

[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.140]

You've got three Greg who know who you are because to know you is to despise you

[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.200]
Alan Courtney to Glendiborne Hill has got a pair

[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.200]
Maryland myths all I always wondered if he really did have a pair. I was never really too sure about

[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.760]

[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.540]
Wouldn't you think you've yet any conscience at all? In fact, that's what Greg Read and Larry King have in common

[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.840]
No conscience whatsoever none not a little bit of a conscience NUN

[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:45.340]
Get me to a nunnery. Let's see. Here's an excellent one from chronic Rick. This is beautiful

[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.820]
In fact, we can't play that

We can't play that anymore

[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.320]
What a show

[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.260]
Can't play that

[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.880]
But had never were nervous there

[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.320]

[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.600]
Deal. Yes, sir

[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.760]
I got

[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.900]
Tony Cigarette was good and

[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.540]
And Ryan or cross the mother fairy. Okay. Thank you, sir

[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.320]
Clear up that choke condition five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty. I bet you yeah

[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.740]
I was gonna say I bet you most starts climbing the list

[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.960]
We gave everybody else kind of a handicraft

[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:43.080]
Sanchez 102 spielkeys in the rate ten Mohawar David and six. I don't think you can beat Rick

[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.260]
no

[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:51.020]
No because well don't be too sure because Rick got off to a huge start. He's like a hundred yards ahead

[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.420]
But once Mo gets up a full head of steam or full head of hair

[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.080]
He's not a ten-day vacation. I asked I asked this morning our operations mangler

[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.320]
I asked mufflin miss Lindsay. I said is uh

[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.080]
What's gonna happen when he comes back from vacation? Are he are they gonna be together again?

[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.200]
Mo and guilty and he said oh, yeah, he said the two of them aren't rock solid

[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.020]
That's what he told me

[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.740]
So when Mo gets back from his ten-day vacation the two of them will be reunited like peaches and squirms

[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.460]
For president day, baby he tried desperately to do that, uh, you know kind of change the topic

[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:29.260]
Wagged the old cat's ass, but it didn't work too well from the beginning gay marriage has been an issue that president Bush has got to finesse

[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.640]
He's got the finesse of a bull in a china shop

[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.700]
under election year pressure from a social conservative base mr. Bush endorsed the art of the effort to adopt a

[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.580]
Constitutional amendment that would van gay marriage and last few days

[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:45.580]
He's turned up the volume on the issue talking about it in his weekly radio address in Saturday and calling wavering senators over

[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.280]
Last year to an effort to show up the support for a measure as it headed toward a crucial procedure of hope yesterday

[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.180]
But after endorsing the measure in February it would often go weeks without mentioning it in public

[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.220]
Suggesting either a personal or political reluctance or both about pushing it too hard your pushing to hard

[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.260]
That's what the seed said

[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.620]
And when he did raise the topic he was careful to modulate his message to avoid alienating moderate voters

[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:11.060]
Warning in particular against the lawing issue to become an excuse for gay bashing right. We sure wouldn't want to do that

[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.280]
Would we oh no

[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.760]
What they do in the privacy of their house consenting it else should be able to do in that that's exactly the way he said it

[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.840]
Mr. Bush said during the campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Friday

[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.200]
What they do in the privacy of their houses consenting it else should be able to do

[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.460]
Seeking to distinguish between private behavior and giving legal sanction the same sex marriages

[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.320]
This is America. It's a free society, but does me we have to redefine traditional marriage in fact, you know

[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.920]
Well, let me just go on

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:44.160]
By hitching his position to folio bit Mr. Bush may have insulated himself somewhat from the sting of the defeat on the proposed amendment suffered in the Senate yesterday

[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.380]
It took a whopping

[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:52.540]
But the way in which the proposal went down with a whimper short of a simple majority much less the two thirds of the Senate needed for approval raised questions

[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.020]
About whether the White House had fundamentally misjudged the nation's attitude on the issue

[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.280]
You see all of the polls if they were just look at the polls

[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.780]
Yes, 65% of America is not in favor of gay marriages including carrying Edwards, but

[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:11.020]
More than that in fact the Lutob's polar couple lights to go on CNN they had 80 billion votes 71% are against the constitutional amendment because they see through it

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.520]
And if they're so concerned that opening the door to all these other kinds of marriages that means it's going to be like

[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.540]
Too well then and six of pigmies. Well if you're so that concerned about how about just read refining it as too

[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:28.360]
Consenting adults without talking about gender isn't that difficult wasn't that tough? That was way hard

[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.980]
Okay, what about the neuters? Okay, there are adults

[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.860]
Yeah, well what differences are make are you are you picking on griep or again is that your problem? Yeah, I got

[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:46.040]
What a tourb I think I had a nightmare about that child something about him. I did he just he is creepy and creepy

[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:52.060]
And the only reason he's there is because him and clearance are really really tight jam up and jelly tight

[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.320]
20 before 11 at 560 QAM

[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.220]

[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.500]
She wants me to she

[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.800]

[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.040]
Another one of that Bible thumped bags and look what happened to her man

She's uh, she appears at some casino in the brand. What is that place brand for the

[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.320]
Brand brand uh whatever it is

[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:48.020]
In Missouri and Missouri somewhere right why isn't brand muffin Missouri brand muffin. Miss Missouri

[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.540]
And that's where she's hanging out now because nobody else wants nothing to do with that bitch

[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.700]
Even old Bob green up there in Orlando the this shock

[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.320]
You're not the one you used to work for with a beard that used to try to take to the swing clubs and get laid

[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.660]
I didn't try to take him there. You did take him there

[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.720]
You're trying to get him laid. No, you got him late my business

[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:04.620]
No

[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:10.320]
Anyway, which of these people do you think is the most despised soft-floored a personality radio TV news paper

[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.900]
Street corners anywhere of all time dead or alive Rick Sanchez? He you're right. He may have an insurmountable lead

[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.380]
He got off to such a big like secretary in the Belmont

[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.840]
He's just up by open lengths and just storming away from the crowd

[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.340]
Rick Sanchez 121 is kind of a parting shot to south Florida

[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.080]
Mohawar David though is instant in the second place. He's coming on strong

[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:37.800]
With 11 I mean how do you compare 11 to 128 now

[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:45.520]
Eighth Wayne high zingah has moved into a second place tie with Mo now 11 apiece cookies to rate 10. She's on both their asses

[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:52.720]
Castan over's got seven Larry King has got six. He just won honours already moving up Gloria step on six. She makes my skin crawl

[00:36:53.740 --> 00:37:01.180]
Glenn the bird hill five little alienitos got four Greg Biedel stuck on three nobody knows who you are Greg

[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:08.520]
Probably just as well. I need a Brian's got a pair Alan Courtney two Maryland mitzels got one and none yet for Tony cigaretteo

[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.300]
Little Brian or cross or Sally fits at a 196 vote

[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.400]
Oh and speaking of people being dragged out of the closet

[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:23.100]
The phone kept ringing in one capital hill office hourly daily all leading up to yesterday sent a vote on the

[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:28.020]
Constitutional Memorita van gay marriage Mike Rogers was on the line again. No Mike

[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.600]
He knew something very personal about the press secretary of a Republican House member who supports the amendment

[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.200]
And he wanted to tell someone preferably somebody high ranking that the man is gay

[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.360]
Rogers cannot understand this

[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:44.240]
How can somebody help articulate the opposition to homosexual unions when he himself is homosexual in other words

[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.480]
How can somebody be a subhating fag mat? Oh, I'm sorry

[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.580]
I don't notice mark fouries name in here anywhere our very own Florida representative mark

[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.500]
Foldy. I don't see his name in this article anyways a very long article. It's on our website

[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:02.520]
I'm certainly not going to read it. I don't see Charlie Jesus Christ on here either the Florida attorney general

[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.660]
If you ever seen Charlie Christ and Charlie Nelson righty together

[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.580]
same person

[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:15.400]
Anyway, Rogers a 40-year-old Washington fundraising consultant as wage-day controversial outing campaign in the month leading up the yesterday's vote

[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.880]
He set out more than 10,000 emails encouraging and perpetuating outings

[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.120]
He handed out flyers at the gay pride parade in June asking people to send in names of gay hill staffers working for

[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.960]
senators and representatives who supported the federal marriage amendment

[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.580]
He created a weblog last week listing some of these names. You might want to hop on his log

[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.820]
He made phone calls day and night to the offices and homes of these staffers his message how dare you

[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.940]
How dare you when it goes on at great light

[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.920]
when it doubt

[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:48.600]
Dragon mouth picking on screaming. Yeah, dragon mouth creaking air creaking and creaking in the screaming

[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.440]
Oh listen to this you ever thought that the herald was bad

[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.760]
Yeah, I think the herald's bad suicide note pins blame on Florida newspaper

[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.100]
I think most of the papers in Florida left to make anybody blow their brains out

[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.900]
But this is not the a herald a

[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.260]
former school board member

[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:10.900]
Charge with having had sex with a 12-year-old boy was found dead yesterday near Naples, Florida and an apparent suicide

[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.900]
He left behind a note attacking the local newspaper for publishing several detailed news stories about the case

[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:25.820]
The dead man Nelson Farber, Jr. 52 said it was disturbing when an irresponsible press causes the families of the accused to suffer so much hurt and humiliation

[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.480]
All the name of selling newspapers and ads

[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:34.740]
Police had withheld the content of that note and several others, but the man's attorney sent a copy one of the notes to the local paper

[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.040]
The Naples daily news last night. I'm sure you read that daily

[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.880]
Oh, yeah, Naples daily news. That's a biggie

[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.000]
The newspaper ran a lengthy story about the death of the man who apparently shot himself in the haze

[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.440]
They ran this story this morning the papers editor Phil Lewis told the ENP what's the ENP? Oh editor and publisher

[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.460]
Okay, we wouldn't do anything differently defending their straight news coverage or criminal case

[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.920]
A passerby found the body of Farber on the ground near a swing set in Ridgewood Park

[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.120]
Farber was former Codja County school board member in the note released by his attorney. He wrote

[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.100]
It is sad that in our society and especially our fairly educated communities

[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.040]
Simply the accusation of sexual misconduct is not to destroy an individual

[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.980]
Farber a lawyer had posted a $100,000 bond and left the county jail on June 10th

[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.860]
He had been charged with five counts of unlawful sexual activity with a child

[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:23.600]
Farber had vowed to fight the charges saying he feared how much the case would hurt his own children other family members

[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.900]
Court records said Farber had met the youth in question through his son's little league baseball team and had brought him many gifts

[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.680]
They also described as many as for the potential Farber victims. I wonder if he's going to be related to B Farber

[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:42.900]
The great the greatest woman harness driver of all time and Charlie Farber her former husband members Z lady. No. How about mr. Z

[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.820]
No, mr. Z mr. Z you never met that crowd. We creep did you?

Okay, the man the guy with a fanny bag and the guy with the eyes and all the other chronic's Steve

[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.380]
The guy with a hands for that's Jack with a hands with the funny your hand right Jack

[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.360]
Yeah, there's this one

[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.300]
Yeah, well that goes without saying

[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:14.060]
But until you've met mr. Z mr. Z who just once every two three years. I'll see him at the pomp and o' park

[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:19.320]
Just go away mr. Z. I can't stand you okay. You're up near everything that the world hates about New York City

[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.520]
mr. Z oh

[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.940]
Brother I'm getting spilky just thinking about him

[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:31.200]
Speaking of spilkeys, you know who else gives me spilkeys when I see her I give up but I won't be seeing around no spots for

[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.500]

She's just following it them out because they have taken whoopee off the ads

[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.600]
First of all slump fast sucks anyway, so what's the problem right

[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.020]
If you're pissed off at slump fast don't buy that crap

[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.600]
It's not gonna be lose anyway, and now they come out with a new low carb because there are other stuff like I've put if he

Is loaded with sugar and carbohydrates and it tastes like crap anyway

[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:15.560]
Comedian wippy Goldberg will no longer appear ads for diet aid maker slump fast following her lured ripoff on president bush

[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.320]

Florida based them fast said it was disappointed in Goldberg's remarks. Hey Hank

[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:31.060]
Slim fast general manager Terry Olsen said in the statement adding that the company regrets that Goldberg's remarks offended some customers

[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:37.980]
Too freaking bad, okay? It's America. She spoke her mind. She said that bush is a piece of crap and a few other things that we can't see on the air

[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.420]
I don't dislike her as much anymore

[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.260]
Republicans have expressed I still can't look at her but I'm just like her as much

[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:48.640]
Republicans have expressed outrage over the fundraiser for presumptive democratic nominee John Kerry and his vice president

[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:54.280]
So running me John Edwards which entertainers lined up to skewer the president the New York Post said of Goldberg's appearance at the event

[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:00.480]
Waving a bottle of wine she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual word plays on Bush's name and a riff about female genitaya

[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.200]

All the two things first of all for your plot that bill come all be a good suggestion. She's an excellent choice

I'm the overwhelming majority of the people in there like between I would say 18 and 35. Oh that's great

[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.980]
Another thing also this is going to be well I'll turn 18 on the 29th of October right

Here's the deal at least I'm assuming I mean I'm sure I'm not telling tales out of school there right

[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:33.160]
I really don't know. Well, uh how is that possible and if you're going to be 18 on election day you aren't going to be able to vote

[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.480]
How's that possible if you're black you can't vote in any events? Well, that's true

[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.640]
If you're 180 and you're black you're not going to be allowed to vote because we know you're going to vote for one of them Democrats

[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:47.700]

What are you gonna finally do to lose weight and feel better about yourself if you've tried the low carb and all the other

Who would have thought that you could have three meals and two snacks delivered right to your door daily delivered right to you and still lose weight

[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.800]

You'll get a different menu and maybe someday try will actually get us the the new menu because I'm sure that these are long since

[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.060]
So not the correct items, but nevertheless you have two selections for every meal

[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.160]

[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.140]
There's no cooking no cleaning no carbon calorie counting and you'll definitely lose weight because all the meals are based on the proven zone diet

No, I don't want to play it because if there's one thing I want to avoid like poison today

[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:12.440]
It's shack and any way shape or form, okay? I don't want to do no shack. I mean now

[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:15.640]
Although shack is

[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.240]
rock solid

[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:23.920]

Yeah, you know what I'm saying? I

[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:54.920]
Not already with them who cares whether they have children on me if we could have watched them in the process of making a baby

[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:58.120]
That would be very exciting. I would certainly tune in that and see close to the TV

[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:07.640]
Yeah, but other than that who cares about this contrived crap and whether they got the right groceries and all of this other oh brother

[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.700]

You think that if the Democrats get in the FCC will back off are they going to go on forever?

[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.140]

[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.460]
Vodas in and the farts come back

[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:41.900]
And that be great that doesn't ride well won't come up with something sure

[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:47.460]
Give us the leading parts and we'll bring back the exciting farts

[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.380]
We'll come up with some more exciting than that but nevertheless that's a good start

[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.700]
To get back our fart

[00:52:54.500 --> 00:53:01.060]

Little knowing when you have to dump something is innocuous is I hate the bird that bit

[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:10.640]
I mean that bit is from a hundred years ago that goes to show you how far back in time this coin punch a lunatic

[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:16.700]
Are taken as and by the high head to break the news to mr. Spurm who was always so right wing and for every Republican

[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.700]
That ever came down a pike and defending the Iraq attack and everything else

[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.280]
But as soon as this other crap started coming down from the FCC

[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:28.400]
What does he do he makes a martyr out of himself and oh they're out to get me well hit to break the news to you like I said but

[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.780]
The most the most rabid member of the FCC is Michael cops he makes a

[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:40.880]
Hole in sunday Michael Powell looked like a Sunday school of preacher. That's how he makes him look like a great liberal

[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:49.380]
Michael cops who just happens to be a Democrat and Jonathan Adelstein he's no picnic either he wants he wants 80 billion dollar fines if he could get him

[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:55.280]

Start begins at concession stand a of Joe

[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.500]
The stadium

[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:26.040]
Where each contestant has to drink himself to oblivion or get the highest blood alcohol level first

[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.400]
Goes on to level number two

[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.900]
One down the pedestrian and a whole house home section of the game

[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:40.500]
This league board game police battle and this player has come up with a different excuse to go home and get his license

[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:49.120]
Then it's off to the final leg of the board game higher in a journey go to court and whoever gets off with the easiest sentence wins

[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:56.200]
It's our good fun for the horns and they I can drive like Rick Sanchez or game

[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.180]
The

[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:02.160]
My thank you Paulie there you go. That was pretty good that one and Bill and Ted's excellent adventure

[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.260]
Which they brought in breathlessly and then?

[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:13.420]
Hello can only a Roger is he's playing my bad. See right I tell you he is really a same case you know the original sad sack as in sack of crap

[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:19.660]
The biggest shack of shack of the crap right all right the old sugar. I got an idea

[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.220]
Sugar, so everybody's not all these diets. How about the sugar shack diet?

[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:31.720]
Where do you put the sugar in your head and it swells up to like four times normal size and you and can hang out with shack

[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.720]
Shack it is so

[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.160]
pathetic it is so sad

[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.220]
But then again when you got a bunch of people that are bored schmittless what do you expect as many as

[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.680]
149 Floridians convicted of crimes now the states could be mistakenly barred from voting in November

[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.180]
Dispotted two-year-old agreement by floor election officials that was meant to return them to the roles

[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:59.880]
How do you like that take me back to my roles valet man?

[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.140]
All right, forgot that's right the josh don't like rules roises. He wants a Lamborghini

[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.620]
Let's take it for our

[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:13.360]
I think I was thinking I'm gonna do that pull next to they don't be stealing from me now. He'll settle a pull. I we've never done before. Have we?

[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:21.200]
What's your favorite year and model car of all time even if you never owned or drove one? I don't think we've ever done that before

[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.920]
Now the good one might call and sick on that day. Why is that they'll be calling up everything

[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:34.980]
Well, what's you don't like that pull? I think it's a great manly masculine pull sure it's manly masculine. It'll be a terminal. I think why

[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.720]
Oh, I was a 55 t bird. How about the 30?

[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.400]
57 t bird 67 Corvette stingrays my favorite 55

[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:50.160]
What 55? A t bird yeah, I thought the 57 was a real little funky one a really tiny little collectors and all three 55

[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.500]
56 and seven are well there you go. Well, you see they can argue about that

[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:57.680]
There's nothing wrong with that you're not you're a good one to talk about polls mr. Fuzball

[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.340]
Hey, that was a hot poll. I know that's very I'm still having recovered from that

[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:09.040]
Anyway, the reason lost paperwork and still moving bureaucracies for these people might get smeared off the rules as in smear the hoeders

[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.080]
And all 1240 now we're convicted in states that automatically we stir voting rights to fell into have completed their sentences

[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.540]
administrators of the Florida election the divisions say they've worked hard to repair mistakes from the 2000 election right

[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:24.460]
And they've already reinstated more than 1700 out of state felons, but

[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.440]
There's always a big fat butt rectum in the way

[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.880]
But efforts to restore the rest have been stymied by other states slow to respond to request for information

[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.520]
We've been very tells him we've worked very hard to get this then said dawn Roberts

[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.080]
Directed the division of elections and we've been writing and calling everyone those states that don't an easy task

[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.960]
And we've acted in good faith all along, but civil rights lawyers are extracted the agreement from the state

[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:51.980]
It's part of illegal settlement two years ago. So election officials are plotting unnecessarily and the names should be restored pronto post-taste and look at that

[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.940]
There's John Kerry talking about the neo-Rodger show again

[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.180]
troops in the power

[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:05.100]
He's there talking to the NAACP is getting a warm enthusiasm welcome because they're very excited somebody can to speak to him

[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.120]
Let me tell you something

[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.320]
please

[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:15.280]
Now president is the first president since Warren G. Harding not to speak before the NAAAD

[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:15.340]
D

[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:16.220]
F

[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.340]
The National Association for the Advancement of Dark Folks

[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.260]
The first one and the reason Warren Harding didn't show up is because

[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.500]
I'll give you I'll give you a two-word clue, okay?

[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.520]
That was the reason he didn't show up

[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:33.360]
How many energy harding schedule to peer, but he had the nerve to croak before he got there

[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.060]
So then we have old Calvin Coolidge sticking his nose into it

[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:43.480]
So I'll president he doesn't even show up there real slap in the face of ever there was one because he knows they're not going to vote for him anyway except for Armstrong Williams

[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.100]
There's another one man. Oh brother. Let's see how about

Our general man there who are not only apologies, but groupies

[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.780]
We got some of those silly people which is why you got a sports station there in the first place talking about shack all day

[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:57.320]
Talking about the old sugar shack with Jimmy Gilmer

[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.360]
Oh, here's a good one. Please add the anxious Alice panelists of the list

[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:09.220]

[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:11.060]

[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:37.260]
Oh, and look at this this is excellent. Where did you get this somebody faxed to us from buzzflash?

[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.360]
I love this right

[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.500]
Matt Roger gay a who backs the gay basher's part two

[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:49.340]
Now there's more to this where's the other page you only sent me page one that's that's it. That's all we got

[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.740]
Yeah, we have to be addressed

[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.380]
Damn sure breaks here's what we have a link to it

[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.440]
It says on July 13 we explained why we are we uh running

[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:07.560]
To June 2000 that it to us about Matt Roger being a gay who supports people Republicans who bash gays

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:15.000]
It's a syndrome that affects many Republicans including elected gay Republican congressmen and senators who support bushes anti gay rhetoric and agenda

[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.360]
There are also people behind the bush campaign apparatus

[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:23.700]
We have to be high to be an at-crow administration and the right wing think tanks and conservative values organizations who are gay

[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.720]
One might wonder oh, you know who I can't stand he's not gay, but who makes me oh

[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:32.740]
The worst he's worse than an culture. He's worse than any of them

[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:38.620]
Is that Michael medved that right wing lunatic posing as a movie critic?

[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:44.080]
Yeah, and they keep trotting him out especially MSNBC. He must get paid for by word or something

[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:49.460]
They keep trotting him out over and over and just slapping us in a pain even Paul Zahn had him on the other night

[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.100]
Michael medved

[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.080]
In fact now that I think of it he looks a little swishy too. It looks like Miss Horkheimer

[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.800]
Anyway, it says one might wonder what makes them tick meaning these are closet queens right wing self-hating

[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.220]
Could you be gay and support an anti gay president or a political party? No

[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.100]
Could you be African-American and send money to the KKK? No

[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.920]
Could you be Jewish and support neo-nazis?

[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:09.440]
Oi

[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.720]
Like Paul Wilfowitz

[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:14.220]
We don't pretend to know what goes on and dredges mine

[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.900]
Maybe he's just the ultimate post gay liberation gay a gay and a public denial

[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:22.000]
Otherwise the right to be a complete slime ball just like Karl roe. Well, we can say slime ball

[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.780]
Because we didn't ask about it. No

[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:30.140]
Oh, we better call what's your name that bitch over in Naples and find out if we can say slime ball choice

[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:36.600]
Drugs like all of us must be held accountable for his actions his sexual orientation becomes an issue when it makes him a hypocrite

[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.140]
And republican hypocrisy is number one interest that buzz flash to be continued on the next page and I'll get to it. I'll find it

[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:49.880]
Because this is today on their website July 15 repeating an editorial from June 2000 or two of them appeared

[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.740]
About that self-hating Maddekon

[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:53.660]
Brugarron

[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.320]
Just a pawn of the right wing gay bachelors were you drudge back?

[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:04.800]
Some would know conscience no self-respect and talking about a big head. I wonder who's it Joe Rose mac ms. Rudge or uh shack

[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.360]
Jack

[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:15.380]
When you say head mr. Joe you know gets free nervous 27 and so does that 27 past 11 for a multitude of reasons at 560 WQ am

[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:20.620]
Hey, are you in the atkins the south beats the sugar busters or any low carb sugar free diet a lot of people are

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:25.360]
The lights of west focus help thousands and zillions of low carb divers achieve their weight loss goals because

[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.020]
Today shopping for just the right low-carb products that are really going to do it for you is almost impossible

[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:35.300]
Everything in the world now is labeled low-carb and a lot of those products on grocery store shelves not only won't help you lose weight

[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.180]
Some are full of crap and make you gain weight

Those are the only people that are gonna benefit no matter who gets in is the wealthy and the the connected and he's at least being honest

[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:32.120]
Hey, let me be honest with you about your carpets

[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:37.000]
I mean everybody's carpeting sooner or later gets pretty schmutzie all the dirt that gets ground in there people trampling over

Your dogs and cats and all your pets doing all sorts of unmancipable things on here's the answer for you

[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.180]
Call dry concepts like I've been doing for over 20 years in my homes and

[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:49.080]
Sanitize those carpets and make them look just like brand new today

[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:53.760]
Dry concepts has got certified technicians who you can trust in your home. They'll dry clean your carpet

[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:58.740]
That's why they call it dry concepts dummy because they use the same idea as dry clean your clothing

[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:01.100]
Nobody else in the world does it's an exclusive panted method

[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:04.380]
And that's why nobody else nowhere gets your carpets looking as great as they do

[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:10.640]
Beware those five 95-per-room scam artists who rip you off when to get the job done because dry concepts give you a written

[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:13.960]
Guaranteed price upfront before they start doing anything

[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.220]
So you're gonna have to worry about them up doing a good job and

[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:20.740]
Taking on to the price in addition to which they give you rows when they finish the job you give them a check

[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:24.400]
Everybody walks away happy camper you'll look around and say holy crap

[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:30.360]
You'll say all these things and then some two so clean today entertain that with dry concepts because after they're done

[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.340]
Your carpets are drying just a couple of hours

[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:02.020]
To the economy before we can lay the foundations

[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:04.320]
I'm going to make my eyes open

[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.440]
Leave the foundations of echo

[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:12.560]
Get the John Kerry sleep machine today and with any luck you'll sleep right through the election

[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:19.780]
I'm John Kerry and I approve the John Kerry sleep machine available wherever my sleep machine

[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.540]
By John Kerry

[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:25.900]
And to help with the United Nations global third there you go

[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:30.380]
Let him have it John wake up 14 to noon at 5 60 WQ I am getting back to this

[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:33.780]
Two editorials by busflash.com about miss fudge

[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.480]
It says drugs like all of us must be held accountable for his actions

[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:42.020]
The sexual orientation becomes an issue when it makes him a hypocrite and Republican hypocrisies are number one

[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:47.940]
Interested bus flash because it's the defining characteristic of many people in Republican leadership and media show positions

[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.400]
Indeed around the time that the White House committed national treason by outing a CIA operative Valerie Plame

[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:59.460]
Who's specialized in tracking weapons of mass destruction in order to send a message to Joe Wilson and the intelligence community that the Bush

[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:03.760]
Cartel was going to enforce its Omar talk coded all cost even if it meant betraying America

[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.720]
There was another curiously consmeared that bubbled to the surface of the mainstream press courtesy of Miss Drudge

[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.380]
Here's the background from a July 19th

[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.040]
2003 Toronto star-soura star story

[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:20.140]
Last week ABC's Jeffrey Copman formerly of CBC's the national took a direct hit from the White House

[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:22.060]
It seems via the scoreless drug report

[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:28.600]
That's because Copman a Toronto native now based in Miami gave voice to American troop station in Iraq who spoke out against the war

[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:32.640]
Rather than the peace while calling for US defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld's resignation

[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.060]
ostensibly incensed over Copman's world to the news tonight report Tuesday

[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:41.820]
Which was repeated on Wednesday's good morning America the White House had a dirty trickster tip gossip manga

[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:47.900]
Mac Drudge to how the reporter was up against the wall openly gay and no blindfold no less cigarette canadian

[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:53.880]
And so on Wednesday for eight minutes Drudge's headline screened ABC News reporter who filed troop complaints

[01:25:53.880 --> 01:26:00.700]
A troop complaint story openly gay Canadian before being edited to read ABC News reporter filed troops complaint stories Canadian

[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:08.580]
So at the apparent behest of the White House Drudge leaks a slimeball headline that a Canadian reporter who dared to air that some American soldiers were

[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.100]
Disgruddled with Rumsfeld is gay

[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:15.800]
Yes, that's right. The only news in Drudge's headline was that the reporter was gay which is meant to discredit him

[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.020]
What if he had said ABC News reporter who filed troops complaint story

[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:23.520]
Jew there's no point to the headline except to in essence stir up the right wing white males

[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:29.080]
By implying that the reporter is this loyal untrustworthy because he's gay how much more despicable can you get

[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:33.720]
But it's the one house GOP Drudge scapegoating gutter crawling Nexus had worked here

[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:38.020]
It happens so often it's become acceptable for the mainstream press to consider discriminatory

[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.160]
discriminatory accusations as news

[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.020]
It starts with the GOP right when conspiracy character assassination squad

[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:50.300]
During the impeachment wars Ken Stars team leaked like a faucet full of holes shows up on Drudge and ends up on the television news

[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:56.000]
For the record Drudge denies that he's gay as a communist who covers gays from time to time notes

[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.700]
Cyber gossip Matt grudge says that he's not gay, but one thing is clear no matter his sexual orientation

[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.360]
He's an astie faggot

[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:05.040]
And here's part two Matt grudge are you gay

[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:08.660]
As detailed in bushflash.com report last week

[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:15.860]
Drudge played the gay card to intimidate New York publishers from putting the insane clown posse of book allegedly focusing on the hypocrisy of the Ken

[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:17.860]
Star team and other right wing junkyard dogs

[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:25.080]
Drudge was successful in bullying and intimidating Tina Brown at talk mirror max to publisher to question a sent book before it even hit the galleys

[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:31.820]
During his weeklong barrage of attacks on the insane clown posse Drudge land-based to talk mirror max for daring to disclose personal

[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.480]
Precadillos in his June 7 dispatched

[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:41.300]
Drudge wrote it cannot be revealed that the book the insane clown posse not only digs deep into the private sex lives and business dealings of major and minor

[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:47.620]
Clinton critics but connolly the author's working manuscript also features the rock three sexlers against impeachment players

[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.820]
Details too hot even for the web

[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:54.200]
Matt would have us think he was outraged by an author dubbing into someone's private life

[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.780]
He couldn't disclose the details of the book out of concern for maintaining a sense of propriety on the internet

[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:00.400]
Of course on June 12th

[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:07.120]
Drudge must have forgotten his prudish lives because the Dredge report headline that morning read Esther Hoss book features talking Bill Clinton penis

[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:13.480]
That's right with a horribly unflattering photograph of the president just above the headline looking as if he were sucking on a lemon

[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:16.700]
In Dredge's exclusive report on June 12th he poured on the details

[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:23.160]
Esther Hoss has created a character around President Clinton's penis according to reports a penis which will talk at express opinions in the book

[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.320]
And a gratuitous caddy statement

[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.300]
Esther Hoss will appear live at NBC's today to launch the book on July 18th

[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:36.360]
Host Matt Katie Kuerrick and Matt Lauer could ask the author why he didn't explore flowers claim that the president liked her pleasure himself with her sexual aid

[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:43.780]
Drudge revels in any gutter rumor about Clinton that he can angus Fedora had on but he transformed into a prude when it comes to his friends on the right wing

[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:48.900]
He charges the author of the insane clown posse with slaying derogatory sexlers against impeachment players

[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.600]
Of violating their private sex lives

[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.260]
But drugs only curves out of zone of privacy when his right wing pals are put out of the microscope

[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.660]
Thruggers like a kid at the edge of a lake on a hot summer day

[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:00.660]
Matt just can't wait to jump in except in this case he's relishing

[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:03.940]
He relishes diving into a scum pond again and again and again

[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:08.080]
But only if the Clinton or Democrats are involved otherwise he's in indignant school

[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.540]
Who won't allow others to even approach the murky slime

[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:16.040]
So Matt this weekend Buzz Flash asked you if you were gay or straight because of the harm that you're doing to the gay community

[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.380]
By supporting the right wing agenda

[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:24.120]
Today we asked are you the outrage prude who was aghashed as you read lured tales in the draft of a book about the sexual shenanigans of the

[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:29.820]
Star crowd or are you the reporter who writes blaring headlines and giddy accounts about the president's sexual organs?

[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.180]
Are you the prude of the warrior tell us which

[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:36.720]
Come out come out before it's too late this far Joe. K before you're burning a hell

Anyway, I don't know how long Miguel was gonna be there. I guess till they're all gone

[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.040]
So maybe we still got some left

[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:02.880]

[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:08.700]
Evidently must still have some of the ones you'd have called said I'm going home something like that something like that or maybe

[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.740]
Doing the best feeling for George that I possibly can appreciate that one call it was good

[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:19.200]
Which of these people do you think wazor is the most despise south Florida personality?

[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.320]

But surely see I think if you wouldn't have had that other podium yesterday

Right they would have pulled out all they'd have pulled both girls out

[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:57.000]
I think today it's like you know, he's old news. They got it out of their system

[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.500]
Spooky's the rate 19 Larry King 18 podcast from over 18 doing very nicely

WQA M hello

Neil God yes sir speaking how are you sir?

[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.700]
I have an idea for a poll okay

[01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:05.420]
Did you watch nightline last night?

[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:05.940]
No

[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:10.360]
Well, they did a big thing on all the Mexicans that are in plus him into the United States

[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.580]
Right, uh-huh and uh their idea was to go after

[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.080]
Well, the Americans idea was to go after the people that are giving them

[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:17.820]
jobs

[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.840]
Okay, what a concept

[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:26.560]
I was human I said what a concept I know it that and I was thinking we should have a poll on you know

[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.940]
What should we do about going after the people that are giving them jobs?

[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.580]
You know make them higher legal Americans

[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.020]
If double the American

[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.740]
Uh-huh or something like that

[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.680]
Right

[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.880]
When I love you forever

[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.160]
You're a chief my whole life

[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.580]
I've been listening to the existence. I was 19 years old

[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:53.620]
I used to be because you were fun and now I'm gonna vote this year

[01:32:54.100 --> 01:33:00.500]
I can't get enough news into me. I have to read the favor watch every new shinoe. I can do the best

[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.800]
You're saving the world, Neil. Okay. Thanks for the look job. How are you? How are you?

[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.840]
Thank you. Oh, I feel I better go tell off now

[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:14.140]
Oh, look at this the former army scientist identified by authorities is a person of interest in the 2001 anthrax attacks

[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:18.360]
Sue the New York Times Company and columnist Nicholas Christoff yesterday and that's good

[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:22.960]
I'm glad he did that because Nick Christoff uh, he uh, he said some crappy things about Michael Moore

[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.820]
Yeah, he's not a good guy. No

[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.480]
I apologize

[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.320]
profusely

[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:33.780]
Uh, there's a column I put on there for uh, by Nick Christoff a few days ago and I apologize

[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:37.340]
I guess I didn't read the last part of it. I apologize. Yeah, profusely

[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:38.260]
anyway

[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:45.000]
Uh, against the times in the columnist Nick Christoff printing the paper defend him in the series of comes that identified him is the likely culprit

[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.040]
Okay, and then again they ought to I apologize

[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.020]
And of course we all remember right now. Have they actually caught the guy?

[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:53.100]
I know I keep asking

[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:56.720]
You know me. I'm out of touch because I'm in Toronto. I'm out of the country. I'm out of touch

[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.980]
So maybe they caught that guy

[01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:00.380]
Can we follow the letters with all that anthrax?

[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:04.960]
Anyway, I just was looking for excuse to play anthrax and stalling for time to find it

[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.480]
In fact, I know a lot of guys who just stole for time to find it

[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:17.060]
The lawsuit filed by Stephen Hadfield in the West District Court in Alexandria said Christoff identified him as the anthrax killer to light a fire under investigators in their probe of the anthrax

[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:23.780]
Formalings which killed five people in sick and 17 he accused Christoff of hurling false and defamatory allegations and the times of engaging in

[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:25.580]
substandard and unethical journalism

[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:30.440]
In a series of columns in 2002 Christoff criticized the FBI

[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.960]
For failing to aggressively pursue a scientist. He at first identified as Mr. Z

[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:39.480]
How do you like that? Mr. Z what we just talking

[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.160]
He belongs behind bars

[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:48.500]
He wrote that the bio-defense community had called Mr. Z a likely culprit was buzzing about Mr. Z behind his back in part because the scientist

[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:52.320]
Was familiar with anthrax and was angered at the suspension of his top security clearance

[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:57.360]
Less than a month before the attacks Christoff a peel out surprise winning a urinalist later acknowledged that Mr. Z was had Phil

[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:03.060]
He also wrote that had failed to serve the presumption of innocence and that there was not a shred of traditional physical evidence looking into the attacks

[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.080]
Christoff didn't return a call to his orifice

[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:08.560]
A time spokesman said the newspaper believed this case does not have merit yada yada

[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:11.060]
The lawsuit was the latest attempt

[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:15.340]
I had felt 50 to defend himself since attorney general John Hermann garing junior right

[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:19.160]
I asked for a publicly called him a person of interest in the anthrax probe of 2002

[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:23.160]
And cost him his job and ruined his life and did all of these other minor things

[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:54.920]
That's what I'm hearing that the rumors up here show enough, but not as much as

[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:55.780]
Yeah

[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.760]

There was mark case everybody mark get a like get serious okay. I have no life get coherent

[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:41.620]
56705 60 pond five 60 well against thinking of compassionate conservatives

[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:50.540]
The United States yesterday rejected the UN Secretary General co-co-coffee and ins plea to inject the billion dollar years into global AIDS fund

[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.880]
It's not gonna happen

[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:58.100]
US global AIDS coordinator randled to buy us told a small group of reporters at the 15th International AIDS conference in Bangkok

[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.360]
The person has requested 200 million dollars for next year

[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:07.260]
I think there's that is more than adequate to meet the requirements of the global fund in terms of getting money out for putting programs in place

[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:13.100]
He be saying and in cold on Tuesday for the US to contribute at least a billion dollars a year echoing a plea from Richard

[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:19.100]
Feachum the executive director the global fund for AIDS to vicarlosis and malaria which needs more than three billion dollars for

[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:26.400]
2005 provide said Washington was deleting global fight against AIDS and spending nearly twice as much to fight the pandemic is the rest of the world combined

[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:34.000]
But controversy about its payments to the private fund global fund the public private global fund launched in 2002 as a brainchild of anon

[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.240]
Has overshadowed discussions at the 8th summit this week

[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:42.900]
Critics have condemned the US for pursuing a go at alone strategy and setting up its own 15 billion five year AIDS

[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:47.420]
Action plan rather than folding its efforts in the international body. Well, is that what we're doing with everything now

[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:54.520]
We're out the participating in the world of nations. It's us against the world. Isn't that the way it works now? Yeah, I know it. Yeah

[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.920]
Here's a very disgusting story

[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:03.520]
Life in bushes America. I don't want it. Well, I do. I know I'm only on twice a week now filling in for George

[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:09.620]
And so as a result I better get in my licks while I can you know, I mean did we get a call from the yellow to find out if those David

[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:15.400]
Buster's power cards are gone yet? No, well, like I said go out and get him. Okay. He's probably pretty I rate the fact that

[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:20.340]
He's not getting flooded with people of course if we knew what those were it would probably help well the people that want them

[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.360]
They know what they are right go for the games

[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:28.700]
They're there for the games that David Buster has brought him little games you play, you know games people play not copy

[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.020]
right

[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:32.060]
pencil push

[01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.960]
By the way, thank you Tony oh thanks to Tony's I thought I was that's why I paused there

[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.040]
It sounded to me like somebody had a mouthful show enough by the way we're still said it's still on

[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.760]
It's still on okay. Well, I'm glad to find that out. Thank you Miguel

[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.820]
Now that I don't know how many we got how many a thousand we got

[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:53.560]
Must be what's taken so long to give them out or maybe because of the fact that it's the middle of the summer in dog days

[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.460]
And they're ain't nobody out there. I'll tell you there's something going on. It may be our ruby trap

[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:00.140]
I know that's a big part of it. It's getting tremendous response on our website

[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:06.360]
But man, we are just picking big gigantic hairy smelly ass, you know considering what time of the year it is

[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.500]
Yeah, aren't you shocked?

[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:10.920]
mildly

[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.900]
Oh, that's right. You're reading thanks again to Tony's over there at Northwest

[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:16.720]
Whatever it is second-avernment. I'm not in there. What is it?

[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.340]
one-ninety-third in 441

[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:21.400]
No

[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.340]
Okay, oh, it's not

[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.480]
Trust me. I thought it was Northwest second Avenue in 193. That is 441

[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:36.020]
No, no, it is yeah, it is another was Tony's is on 441. Yeah, I never knew that all of this time

[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:37.840]
I thought I never even thought about that very much

[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:43.660]
I thought 441 was seventh Avenue down south of the Golden Quads it is. I see but then again

[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:45.560]
We're almost to Broward County. We're almost to the

[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:52.720]
Order that takes a hook so go over and see Miguel at the shell station Northwest 87th Avenue 14th Street in Durral

[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.500]
Oh, that's why nobody's going over there who now wants to go over to Durral there's no golf going on right now

[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.060]
Unless maybe most playing with it

[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:03.380]
Stop I'd have picked up a free $10 David muster power card right now and see the lovely Miguel

[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:05.560]
He's waiting for you like to hear rid of that crap and go home

[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:08.440]
And be with his lovely wife. Doesn't he work though his wife?

[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:14.480]
Normally, well, that's right. They got a baby now. He can't afford them. They're kind of salary. He's making a QM

[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.820]
He can't afford no nanny. I guarantee you that. Well, what do you mean normally? Don't need no nanny when you're Cuban

[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:26.700]
I don't understand you've got a boyla's oh a boyla the a boyla's coming there checking out the kids penis

[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:33.260]
Anyway a husband and wife who wore anti-boached t-shirts to the president's 4th of july appearance aren't going down without a fight

[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:39.080]
They'll be represented by lawyers from the east you as they contest the trespassing charges against them today in Charleston

[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.920]
Municipal Court Charleston, South Carolina

[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:45.780]
Police took the cool and Jeff rank away in handcuffs from the event which was built as a

[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:51.340]
Presidential appearance not a campaign rally. They were wearing t-shirts that read love America hate Bush

[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:56.280]
Spectators who were pro-boached t-shirts and Bush chaining campaign buttons were allowed to stay of course

[01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:00.900]
We weren't doing anything wrong said Jeff rank the couple said they had tickets just like everybody else

[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:04.500]
Said they simply stood around the capital steps were steps with the rest of the spectators

[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:08.980]
We sang the national anthem rank said the ranks hardly fit the image of rabble rouses

[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:13.340]
Jeff rank 29 has a master's degree in oceanography Nicole rank 30

[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.920]
Degrees in biological science and marine biology they've been married for seven years

[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.040]
Nicole rank arrived in Charleston soon after the Memorial Day floods

[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.000]
She was working as deputy environmental liaison officer for the FEMA

[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:29.460]
Making sure cities and counties have made federal environmental losses. They repaired roads and bridges

[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:31.180]
After police arrested the ranks

[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:33.680]
They fingerprinted them and took their mug shots

[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.340]
FEMA told Nicole rank she was no longer needed in West Virginia

[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:41.100]
I've not been fired per se she said but I was released from this job and when they release you from a job

[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.000]
You know longer you get paid which is a

[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.740]
Cute way of saying you're fired of course. They can't say that because Donald Trump copyrighted that expression

[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:52.860]
The rank started to go home to Corpus Christi Texas for the only guard as far as road out Virginia

[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:56.280]
What it occurred to them they might not be able to contest their arrest if they weren't Charleston on their court

[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:59.260]
They a phone call confirmed their suspicions so they turned it around

[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:03.800]
We've been living in motels ever since said Jeff rank who spent two digging his motel room with his wife

[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.280]
Their cock or spaniel fineman and their marmalade cat rower

[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.280]
Our road WR how do you say that roar

[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:10.660]
uh

[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.140]
It's extremely difficult financially we can't afford doing this so for a very long

[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:20.820]
But they both had a state and fight the charges because we don't think we're guilty since bush took office early in 2001

[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:25.420]
People have been banned from displaying anti-bush messages that dozens of bush appearances across the country

[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:29.380]
I mean, I'm gonna tell you something boys and girls anybody that supports this kind of fascism

[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:32.620]
You are a fascist you are a neo-nathy bastard you okay?

[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:34.760]
That's a much in self-destructive tool

[01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:38.580]
Right just like Miss Fudgeon at self-hating a phagotry of hers

[01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:44.740]
In September the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against the secret service seeking an injunction against the administration for

[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:47.460]
segregating protesters at his public appearances

[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:54.680]
The secret service agreed that such censorship was wrong said we pulled wallzac one of the lawyers that filed the lawsuit sounds like a polo

[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.840]
They had an internal memo dated September

[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:02.380]
2002 simply wouldn't couldn't treat protesters differently or worse than anyone else at a presidential appearance walls

[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:07.860]
I've said the judge had any agent responsible for doing so could be held liable for damages remember walkers slaysak

[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.560]
No, remember fanny

[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:15.340]
How about short fat fanny with Larry Williams? Oh the echo records. I'm did all this is for book a brinder. Muse him

[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.860]
We have our own little show going

[01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:23.300]
The secret service of the time local police is he quest or anyone displaying an anti-administration message

[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:28.780]
Usually an area is completely out of sight in your shot of bush because the secret service agreed with the ACLU that it shouldn't be doing that

[01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:30.120]
The judge dismissed the case

[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.640]
Prior to our filing our student September we get a couple of confirmed protest zone complaints every month wallsak said

[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:40.720]
After we filed there were practically none we had two documented incidents between September and March one little rock

[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.200]
Arkansas and one in an oxen oxen oxen oxen oxen oxen oxen

[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:49.020]
But now lawyers like wallzac are carefully monitoring cases like the ranks and two similar incidents recently in Pennsylvania

[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:53.820]
We're trying to assess what's going on in these appearances whether these protest zones are resuming

[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:58.800]
He said we are continuing to monitor all campaign events by both republican democratic candidates

[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:01.740]
We're prepared to go back into court to see if discrimination is occurring

[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:07.040]
It's an or what a way to keep speech out of sight of though of those the speeches intended critique

[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:11.300]
We want to nip this in the bud before it becomes a habit of future administrations a bush

[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:15.620]
Most of course didn't return telephone calls he can come out of the necessity of a free speech zone

[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:20.620]
Free speech that I told my fat ass by the way seven and a half pounds and we can have I've lost

[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.280]
Since we had the old mommy in the box

[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.760]
They that sound what

[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.920]
No nothing gets that's how insensitive no, but at least I admit it

[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:35.080]
I never realized it. I never knew it and now you know she lived in 91 and she had a fine life and

[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:39.520]
You know it was well taken care of mostly by me and now she's you know pushing up daisies

[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:45.140]
But in the meantime, I finally discovered miraculously amazingly that I had this kind of 40-in-thing

[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:51.980]
This kind of smothering, nattering, nagging, uh, whatever. How do you want to describe it that prevented me from getting rid of that the

[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:52.920]
compulsion

[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.440]
That sugar urge that horrendous desire to nash

[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.060]
Never heard a zardini and well last can you have got a mouthful of food

[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.220]
We're ready to go back for seconds. I bet you are

[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.700]

So bad news for you

[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:13.860]
A proposed ballot measure to double the state's 25,000-dollar homestead exemption can't go before voters this November

[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.300]
The Florida Supreme Court rule just a short time ago

[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:22.220]
But a proposal to create a six point six dollar fifteen-cent minimum wage can go to the ballot high court be ruling

[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:27.780]
The Supreme Court review citizen initiatives to judge if they're clearly explained and deal with just one subject

[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:35.360]
Those are the only two uh issues. Oh, this is I guess it must be chopped off on your website the only two issues the high court addresses

[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:41.980]
The property tax member was a bank world by a hero beach millionaire who promoted his property tax relief for homeowners

[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:47.260]
But critics argue it was really a tax shift on the commercial and industrial property and local government officials and governor

[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:53.160]
Jam Bush said they worried about the two-billion dollar price tag on the proposal the minimum wage proposal or create a state minimum wage

[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:56.180]
It starts at six dollar fifteen-cent which would double Josh's pay

[01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:02.000]
But increases annually to keep up with inflation. It doesn't yet have to have many signatures needed to make the ballot

[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.440]
But they're working on it just like I'm sure they're still working on that thing to get the slots into the

[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.760]
Race tracks. Oh man. Do we need that bad?

[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:09.700]
or what?

[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:15.400]
If you could see how the people here are packed in at woodbine racetrack even on the days when there's uh

[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.340]
No racing going on at the time

[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:22.500]
You you wouldn't believe it you'd be flabberg hoostin, okay? Oh, you ought to see the engines

[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:23.840]

[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:25.000]
packed

[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:29.840]
And the engines are making all the money while the rest of the state is always

[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:34.480]
On a virgin bank. People are looking for it. That's right. They want to go have a good 10 dollars

[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:38.400]
Go well. They're all going to go bankrupt. They're going to gamble. Listen if they want to gamble

[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.840]
There's no state in the country that's got more gambling than Florida

[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:46.220]
Even in New York state, I don't think they got no high-wire dog racing. Do they? No

[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:50.920]
Florida we got it all we got your thoroughbred racing. We got harness racing. We got dog racing

[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:56.680]
We got a high-wire we got the lottery we got the cock fights in the sweet water in little Havana and high-lyah

[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:58.860]

We don't have this we don't have that people want

[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:13.760]
out of your crap by the way about only fags play the slot machines

[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:15.000]
I hate to break the news to you

[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:19.260]
But there was a very fine young man in his early 20s not bad look at either of Indian descent

[01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:23.160]
Yeah, it was playing a machine next to media today besides that's that fags and old ladies

[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:28.700]
Yeah, well, he wasn't an old lady and wasn't a fang how he doesn't trust me when I tell you I can sniff one

[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.140]
He may have sniffed a little on that uh that

[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:37.020]
Curry side, you know, he smelled a little like he curry now. He was a nice guy and and he uh won

okay

[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:51.020]
And anyway, I just mentioned that in passing because you see one thing about you being such a hard ass you live in this narrow little world

[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:55.060]
You can't afford to be going to Vegas very often unfortunately, which I know you'd probably like to go

[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:56.440]
Especially I get away from your wife

[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:02.500]
But I mean if you could see the real world a little bit more you'd understand you live in a cloistered the environment there

[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:02.980]
I know

[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:04.500]

[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:22.580]
Well, is there a public because they're all nice right except for the one on a colon's out?

Five-direhards Saudi terrorists from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for the same number of unlucky British

By the way gases back up to Duboxagal and our friends say they won't pump anymore oil to bring the price back down

[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:07.200]
And yeah, that was another grotesque story in fact here. They were wild about that. They were just psychotic about it

Got fine for that because it was too funny. So let's get Steve Kane on there mr. ego

[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:30.700]
Mr. Ego junior excuse me and the Stan major

[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:34.300]
Reason I say mr. Ego junior is nobody has an ego like Howard Stern

[02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:38.980]
I don't I know we have a lot of Stern fans will listen to this show fine. I don't you know your title but

[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:44.040]
An ego that is just so out of control and so mammoth and so full of crap, you know

[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:45.900]
supporting all those right wingers all that time

[02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:51.680]
Kissing bushes asked for a long long time kissing up to the war and all of a sudden unacceptable garbage and all of a sudden

[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:57.520]
Capitalizing and exploiting the freedom of speech issue to make himself into a martyr and to like

[02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:07.180]
And he's always threatening to walk out and threatening if Mel Carmas and leaves a whole bunch of us here at infinity or walk

[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:12.700]
He ain't going anywhere, okay? All they had to do is lick his wounds and to put them on a few more of their stations all owned by infinity

[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:15.520]
By the way, and that's it. That's all it took to keep that ego going

[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:20.020]
I mean who else in this business stays on an extra half hour every day pass when their time is up

[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:24.260]
Just because they're ego in other words they haven't finished feeding their own ego yet. See what I'm saying

[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:27.700]
Yeah, I can't I can't take it no more

560

[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:50.740]
She was a model

[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:54.180]
But 10 on the scale

[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:58.180]
Was a fine teacher

[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:01.740]
Her methods were held

[02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:05.560]
The world was a roister

[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:09.280]
But Debbie got nailed

[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:14.760]
That's why this teacher is a tram

[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:20.720]
Her lover was 14

[02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:25.340]

Shame on you Debbie

[02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:38.910]
A newly wedged disgrace

[02:12:40.610 --> 02:12:44.790]
That's why this teacher is a tram

[02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:54.550]
She is a drop dead gorgeous blue-eyed angel who likes their middle school boy

[02:12:55.950 --> 02:12:58.070]
They were her toy

[02:12:59.790 --> 02:13:00.850]
In a back seat

[02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:02.770]

[02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:09.270]
She'll now be a vamp

[02:13:11.150 --> 02:13:14.810]
That's why this teacher is a tram

[02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:16.850]
All right

[02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:24.130]
Talk shows and comics all over the screen

[02:13:26.110 --> 02:13:28.150]
That talking about Debbie

[02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:31.830]
And her young teen

[02:13:33.710 --> 02:13:39.090]
Butterfly tattoos with some Chinese in between

[02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:44.890]
That is why this teacher is a tram

[02:13:48.250 --> 02:13:50.570]
She'll make a million

[02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:54.130]
On her first book

[02:13:56.190 --> 02:14:01.790]
The TV movie will have us all hooked

[02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:05.790]
Her 14-year-old lover

[02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:09.490]
He made her a crook

[02:14:11.230 --> 02:14:14.930]
That's why this teacher is a tram

[02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:19.550]

That's the life she chose

[02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:30.990]

[02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:36.630]

[02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:58.290]
David Lakeland says how come we're not hearing anything about Bush's military records being destroyed

[02:14:58.290 --> 02:15:00.290]
It's been all over our website by the way

[02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:01.930]
They take a peek NeilRangers.com

[02:15:01.930 --> 02:15:02.990]
It's been on her as it in time

[02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:04.550]
That's our in-depth media for you

[02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:06.910]
How come we're not hearing about the Valerie Plame

[02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:09.510]
I mean if it was happened to Clinton would have done that

[02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:11.410]
Somebody in his administration would have done that

[02:15:11.410 --> 02:15:12.630]
Outed a CIA operator

[02:15:12.630 --> 02:15:15.210]
Uh felony a grotesque

[02:15:16.730 --> 02:15:17.530]
Violation of the law

[02:15:17.530 --> 02:15:20.110]
They'd have been uh they wouldn't have stopped ever

[02:15:20.110 --> 02:15:21.790]
They'd still be screaming in the oil on

[02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:25.050]
But just just amazing the crap that goes on in the media

[02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:26.950]
But it would put about the look how well things are going

[02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:28.530]
I mean the 17 dead Iraqis yesterday

[02:15:28.530 --> 02:15:29.950]
But that's that's an aberration

[02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:31.410]
Everything's going really great

[02:15:31.930 --> 02:15:33.650]
They got a good spy organization

[02:15:33.650 --> 02:15:34.790]
They're developing over there now

[02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:37.170]

[02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:45.790]
I got a blank page

[02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:47.510]
Okay so I'm gonna have to go right to my website

[02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.870]

Because Josh there is such a punk

[02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:54.270]

If I can go back here a little bit

[02:16:39.210 --> 02:16:41.550]
On July 10th 1998

[02:16:42.130 --> 02:16:45.450]
The Buffalo bills on the NFL more in the passing of Elijah Pitts

[02:16:45.450 --> 02:16:48.290]

I mean I looked them up over the break too as a matter of fact and

[02:17:00.310 --> 02:17:02.750]
He was a great player man he was a turd

[02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:06.230]
He went on to six super balls with the packers what are you talking to bills

[02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:09.590]
I just looked at his statistics and I'm here to tell you he's a turd

[02:17:10.810 --> 02:17:12.670]
Whether he was a turd or not

[02:17:12.670 --> 02:17:16.690]
Oh look at that North Carolina Bush 48 carry 45 set on the sidon

Why he is just uh and and not only him how can people be that stupid but I still believe that as we get closer to election day

[02:19:49.090 --> 02:19:51.990]
Because he only got like 2% 2 and a half percent in the last time

[02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:54.450]
He's not gonna get any more than that this time

[02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:57.170]
All of that could be it that could be you know

[02:19:57.170 --> 02:20:00.630]

[02:20:54.930 --> 02:20:59.890]
They're not getting sucked under that phony baloney self-aggrandizing ego bandwagon of Ralph Nator

[02:20:59.890 --> 02:21:02.850]
Now what was I just saying? Oh, yeah kitty corner of the um

Or you went in there now where did you stay? I stayed at the MGM and the Trappocaner

[02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:21.030]
This time yeah, I'm a hotel hopper, you know

[02:21:21.930 --> 02:21:26.030]
I never heard of such a thing. I like to experience all the hotels. What's wrong with that?

[02:21:26.790 --> 02:21:29.470]
But you can experience all the hotels by going you mean the rooms?

[02:21:30.270 --> 02:21:31.290]
No, just you know

[02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:36.530]
You can experience the casinos by like hopping around which everybody with a brain does

[02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:38.510]
Yeah, that's what I did. I just went from casino to

[02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:43.390]
But why would you stay there? I don't know they're right across the street from each other right?

[02:21:44.290 --> 02:21:48.470]
Oh my god, you better get this guy some um we help

I'm serious

[02:21:50.650 --> 02:21:56.690]
But anyway, and the only time people stayed at different hotels if they book it ahead of time and like the hotel isn't available

[02:21:56.690 --> 02:22:00.630]
I'm one of the nights they're gonna or two nights are gonna be there and so then you know they hop across well

[02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:03.950]
Whatever well that's what happened, but I didn't mind it. Oh, well why didn't you say that?

[02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:07.330]
Okay, it's they're making yourself sound like some kind of a misfit like they kicked you out one night

[02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:12.090]
Because you have it in orgy in your room or something or because you were doing a whole lot of drugs or because you were tearing up the room

[02:22:12.090 --> 02:22:13.290]
Like some of your athletes

Is that my athletes the hockey player? Yeah, that's your Elijah pit. I'm sorry

[02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:21.590]
Yeah, like you quit knocking the lives of pits. I

[02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:25.630]
Remember what superbowl they were screaming pits pits and I said yeah, it is

[02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:29.710]
I remember which game that was bills must have been it anyway. What am I talking about?

[02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:34.710]
Oh a kidney corner across the street or right across from the trap of canna is where they have all the casinos I despise

[02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:40.110]
The uh what's the uh the pyramid one their Luxor

[02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:44.430]
The manly and you know after they built the Mandalay bay

[02:22:44.430 --> 02:22:49.490]
They weren't sure that it was gonna settle properly and they they waited to held their breath to make sure that it wasn't like follow

[02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:51.510]
Seriously, what's wrong with the Luxor

[02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:56.950]
hated and then once they went on the corner there the circus one the alibur that

[02:22:56.950 --> 02:23:05.210]
Oh man kids it's the kitty crap. Yeah, it's strictly like Disney world for uh for uh gamblers and it's chinsy

[02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:11.790]
Chinsy and the food there sucks. I mean you go to a place in Vegas with bad food and you really have to search because man

[02:23:11.790 --> 02:23:13.450]
There are so many great restaurants in Vegas

[02:23:14.670 --> 02:23:20.130]
Am I right Josh? That's right. I mean Josh was there at uh eating at that burger joint

[02:23:21.310 --> 02:23:25.430]
Now where did you eat? Oh, that's where you ate the emeralds. Yeah, that was uh

[02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:30.450]
But I was a good choice because the brown Derby Niem gym is it's okay, but it's overrated and that other one

[02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:36.150]
Wolfgang Schmuck. Oh man. They give you a big portion if you just a pig that likes a whole bunch of food on your plate

[02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:39.210]
That's fine, but I wouldn't wish it on a hungry Kimmer or Gregory

[02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:44.150]
Five C.C. The radius of yours

[02:23:45.490 --> 02:23:46.530]
You win

[02:23:48.290 --> 02:23:53.470]
Oh, there's this guy the real and when I'm up in Boca Tiga slapping old women with painted lips around the pool

[02:23:53.470 --> 02:23:55.430]
I listened to the Neil Rogers one to two

[02:23:56.270 --> 02:23:59.430]
I mean I listened to the Neil Rogers here in balance one to two hours

[02:24:00.910 --> 02:24:08.170]
US-Wed coalition has transferred sovereignty to an in-roam Iraqi government two days earlier than anticipated

[02:24:08.170 --> 02:24:11.410]
Here now is an excerpt from the official proceedings

[02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:18.270]
This is an amazing day in the history of two countries. What's going on the United States and Iraq?

[02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:20.810]
That's you and me. What are we doing here chief justice?

[02:24:20.970 --> 02:24:22.350]
Mama hello

[02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:30.570]
Here you go. Here you go. Why put these keys. It's all yours. What's all mine? You give me a car? No, no, no Iraq Iraq

[02:24:30.570 --> 02:24:34.870]
It's under your control. We're at it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute Paul

[02:24:35.270 --> 02:24:39.730]
It's too early. You got two days left and then I was going to talk to you about that. I think we should push them back

[02:24:39.730 --> 02:24:43.190]
Well, no, we figure since we should get a little ahead of schedule. We're gonna get cold. Okay?

[02:24:43.190 --> 02:24:50.250]
Wait a minute. I had a schedule. I don't even have shoes. I don't have no police. There's no cars. They've got to throw the rocks. We got nothing

[02:24:50.250 --> 02:24:54.750]
We're gonna get out of the green zone. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, go from the green zone. You mean?

[02:24:54.930 --> 02:25:01.510]
I've got deep breath and relax. I've stayed a little while. I got you the nice place. It's it's only two days. What's the difference?

[02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:11.950]
It's so much. It's too fast. No, we're fine. We're gonna get out of here. Wait a minute. Don't go. We're not ready. You're fine. We are not ready. I don't own a pair of shoes.

[02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:20.490]
Maddie, you're very funny. We're gonna get going. No, no, no, no. That's to be funny. Say this all while we're gonna get out. No, we're not ready. You can't come in bomb half my country

[02:25:20.490 --> 02:25:27.290]
and then give me the keys and say it's all yours. But it's all coming together. It's all coming together. They shoot at me in the road.

[02:25:27.290 --> 02:25:34.070]
The people are happy now that Saddam is gone. No one is happy. Look at that kid over there. Is any happy smiling over there?

[02:25:34.090 --> 02:25:37.670]
That's what your president says. They love, they love, they love. They don't love.

[02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:45.830]
As soon as you leave, I get one between the eyes. It's over. Well, that's why I'm leaving. I, I, I, I hurt my foot. I can walk.

[02:25:46.330 --> 02:25:51.950]
I talk about a word to nail. The interim prime minister, Eli Alawahi says everything's gonna be okay.

[02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:56.630]
Alawahi, wait a minute. What are you telling them? Everything's gonna be okay for this is stupid.

[02:25:57.070 --> 02:26:02.710]
I didn't think he took me seriously. What are you doing? What are you doing?

[02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:08.050]
The prime minister even said to me that you guys are capable of controlling the security situation.

[02:26:08.090 --> 02:26:14.170]
I'm here to tell you, poor brother. We are not. We cannot control nothing. Do you understand that?

[02:26:14.330 --> 02:26:21.070]
Not even my blander. Look at him. He beat himself. We can't control this. You stay. You gotta stay. Please step up. Please stay. Don't go.

[02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:25.730]
Please stay. Or don't leave. This is just a stop. Stop leaving. We're out of here.

[02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:28.710]
On the phone. Bye bye. Leave the guns. We're gonna die for him.

[02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:33.790]
The United States of America. Glad they're help.

[02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:39.450]
103 and 560 WQM. It's our big one to two hour. We got Curtis Stevenson for the mad dog today because, you know,

[02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:44.310]
two, three days a week is plenty. And then we got to hump it for who just went on to our pull.

[02:26:44.410 --> 02:26:47.890]
Let's see how he's doing. In fact, let's take a look. Which of these people do you think

[02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:53.110]
is or was the most despised software to personality of all time? Rick Sanchez. Nobody's gonna touch him and who

[02:26:53.110 --> 02:26:58.990]
would want to quite frankly. You know, he's about like two feet tall. How many feet? Three, one and a half.

[02:27:00.370 --> 02:27:07.070]
Comes up to your kneecap. Rick Sanchez 287. Wayne Heising is 70. I mean, what kind of a no contest?

[02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:14.710]
Even OJ who passed Mo like he was in a prone position. OJ's got 59. Mo's got 50. I need to brine 26.

[02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:24.310]
Spooky's the rate 21. Lyrii King 19. Podcast for no but 19. Gloria Stepan 19. Neil Roger 16. I'm moving on up to the east side.

[02:27:25.930 --> 02:27:31.950]
Our alien Gonzalez 15. Miriam Ella Elephant 14. Alex Pinkis Penelos.

[02:27:34.110 --> 02:27:42.150]
Has got 13. Dr. James Kennedy. A bigot if we ever saw one's got 11. A rabble-rousing right wing lunatic.

[02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:48.910]
Janet Reno 6. Glenn the bird heel of five. Greg B. Delphine. Brian Orcross 4. The crows got four.

[02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:54.610]
Joy Reynolds has got three. Must be the god of the eyes and then Boba Boba Boba. His cousin Boba

[02:27:54.610 --> 02:28:00.310]
Billy or whoever that guy was, remember? No. Oh yeah. Well, you're you're doing your

[02:28:00.310 --> 02:28:06.890]
eye. I don't remember the cousin. Twenty cigarette or three. Alan Courtney 2. Sally Fitz 2. Rall Martinus 2.

[02:28:07.470 --> 02:28:15.070]
Hank Goldberg the hubbers got up here. Marilyn Mitchell 1. Steve Kane. Mr. Ego Juniors got one. Josh

[02:28:15.070 --> 02:28:20.630]
Beckett finally got about nice going. Josh. All right. Bill Kamaos. He's got one in stand major.

[02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:25.470]
You don't have any and everybody's saying out of 681 votes. Stand don't have any people are saying who?

[02:28:26.090 --> 02:28:30.890]
Oh, the candy bar guy. Don't you remember? Anybody buy a good watch lately? Any have a milky way light?

[02:28:30.890 --> 02:28:38.430]
If you people were going off your duff. Come on, Josh. Get off your duff. WQM. Hello.

[02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:41.030]
Hey, Neil. How you doing, buddy? Pretty good, Pally.

[02:28:41.730 --> 02:28:45.150]
Then I missed your show. I'm not going to watch coast now. So I don't get to hear you that much.

[02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:49.090]
But I heard this interesting story now. I would like to share with you.

[02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:55.570]
Basically, it was on I heard of a radio and it came from an AP from the Washington Post.

[02:28:56.030 --> 02:29:00.430]
Yeah. There's this song. There's this folder of Lee Boehring. It's by his post, right?

[02:29:00.890 --> 02:29:07.010]
And they say corn through other places. They said that his brother lost shot him in the leg because

[02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:12.930]
there was a rattlesnake around his leg. But no one ever saw the rattlesnake. She didn't even leg.

[02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:17.390]
Yeah. But the funny thing is that the Washington Post has in the last three months.

[02:29:17.570 --> 02:29:23.270]
There's been a hundred mysterious. The soldiers getting hurt. You know, when they're over here,

[02:29:23.390 --> 02:29:28.690]
Lee Boehring from the war. I think it's pretty interesting. You know, the bush she's talking about,

[02:29:28.690 --> 02:29:32.490]
they're all happy over there. I mean, it's like they come over here leaving. I get broken

[02:29:32.490 --> 02:29:37.350]
legs and all of a sudden you got to go back. I think it's all for fun. You know, well, okay.

[02:29:37.470 --> 02:29:41.530]
Well, we'll see if we can drop up some laughs for you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 8. Do you understand that?

[02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:45.270]
You know, one thing we haven't had. Maybe you did this week since it's the debut of

[02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:50.650]
Air America and the liberal, the progressive butcher craft. They got a 940 there, including the

[02:29:50.650 --> 02:29:56.990]
goddess on, for 75 hours on tape, all but one hour on tape. And of course, Al, frankly speaking,

[02:29:56.990 --> 02:30:03.410]
I'm not Bill O'Reilly, Frank. Do you have any spy reports? No.

[02:30:03.810 --> 02:30:06.810]
No. Is anybody talking about it? I mean, we were starting to have that one earlier,

[02:30:06.890 --> 02:30:10.930]
which I thought was a real one. That turned out to be rapid jauness again. So who needs? I mean,

[02:30:10.990 --> 02:30:16.170]
we like this spy report. We just wanted from him. By the word facts. What said they suck?

[02:30:16.890 --> 02:30:22.930]
Oh, well, we knew that. WQM. Hello. Yeah, I talked Neil speaking. Hey, Neil, I know this is a

[02:30:22.930 --> 02:30:27.550]
film. What about Sheriff Navarro? Nick Navarro is the next one.

[02:30:28.350 --> 02:30:32.430]
Surprise. He never made it. Well, he made it now. And the sports day.

[02:30:33.630 --> 02:30:36.510]
Oh, yeah. The favor of the sport. No, she wouldn't look.

[02:30:36.730 --> 02:30:40.210]
She was the star of Duncan Donas. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot, Sally.

[02:30:42.610 --> 02:30:45.250]
Nick Navarro, you got him on air? Navarro.

[02:30:46.210 --> 02:30:49.410]
Please go in a way. Navarro.

[02:30:49.410 --> 02:30:54.190]
He's the cause of so much grief and sorrow. He yesterday.

[02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:59.790]
Navarro. Navarro. He's leaving.

[02:31:00.730 --> 02:31:04.450]
Navarro, but he's just a good step away.

[02:31:05.550 --> 02:31:08.930]
What solid. 108 at 560. Nick Camaro, I get some votes.

[02:31:09.770 --> 02:31:12.330]
I remember that night I was eating dinner at Ruth Christian. He was sitting there at the

[02:31:12.330 --> 02:31:18.750]
table across. And I saw him and he saw me. We kind of like a wave. And then I forgot he had been

[02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:22.150]
there and on a way out. I wasn't trying to be rude even though I can't stand him. We hate each other

[02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:25.850]
like poison. I wanted to stop and shake in his head and said hello, but I forgot he was there, you know?

[02:31:26.430 --> 02:31:31.630]
Yeah. But seriously, I really did. I wouldn't make that up if it weren't true, but I'm glad I didn't

[02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:36.930]
stop and shake his hand. I don't worship me at any time. Make us nauseous, Nick Navarro. Okay,

[02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:41.430]
Nick is your disgusting speaking of fascist. Oh, speaking of fascist, list of bushes,

[02:31:41.650 --> 02:31:45.770]
teams lies. Keep growing since the Madison, the capital times. I don't believe it.

[02:31:46.450 --> 02:31:50.970]
This isn't very long or ponderous. Supporters of President Bush insist that despite the

[02:31:50.970 --> 02:31:54.750]
problems be setting as administration, at least he's brought morality back to the White House,

[02:31:55.050 --> 02:31:59.770]
contrasting him of course with his predecessor, Bubba. I guess it depends on, says Dave's

[02:31:59.770 --> 02:32:03.670]
wifeful, what your definition of morality is. If lying is immoral, then Bush surely has nothing

[02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:07.470]
over Clinton. Clinton lied about his a favorite moniker when scheme was nearly tossed out of

[02:32:07.470 --> 02:32:11.250]
office as a result. His insistence they didn't have a relationship with that woman was

[02:32:11.250 --> 02:32:14.670]
pounced on by the likes of Kenneth Starler, Republican, Majority, and Congress, and Milfer

[02:32:14.670 --> 02:32:19.570]
everything was worth. The, this cabal and the Clinton haters among them, see to this very day.

[02:32:19.810 --> 02:32:23.850]
Somehow, I'd rather have a president who lies about his personal sex life than one who lies to

[02:32:23.850 --> 02:32:27.850]
get us into a war where hundreds of young American men and women die, thousands more suffer serious

[02:32:27.850 --> 02:32:32.370]
injuries, and precious taxpayers' dollars are squandered, relegating programs for America's

[02:32:32.370 --> 02:32:36.670]
own needs to the backburner, along with the real war on terror against Osama Yamama and Al-Qaeda.

[02:32:37.470 --> 02:32:41.070]
The only real casualties of Clinton's lies were his own domestic relationship in the

[02:32:41.070 --> 02:32:45.910]
unfortunate impact on young Monica's own life if only Bush could say the same, but lying has

[02:32:45.910 --> 02:32:50.110]
become pervasive among the Bush crowd. Just a few days ago, the Inspector General for the

[02:32:50.110 --> 02:32:54.010]
Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the administration purposely held back the

[02:32:54.010 --> 02:32:58.210]
true cost of the convoluted Medicare prescription drug bill from Congress. No laws were broken,

[02:32:58.210 --> 02:33:02.330]
he said, but indeed Thomas Scully, the administration's Medicare chief at the time,

[02:33:02.430 --> 02:33:07.070]
as they named Scully Square after him, threatened to fire Medicare Actuary, Richard Foster,

[02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:09.830]
if he gave two cost figures to Congress when it was debating the bill.

[02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:14.470]
Indeed, the administration-log Congress to whack under false assumption that the cost of the

[02:33:14.470 --> 02:33:19.650]
Medicare bill would be $395 billion over 10 years when it knew the real cost was $534 billion.

[02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:24.290]
Democrats who fought the bill are outraged. It sounds as though the Bush administration examined

[02:33:24.290 --> 02:33:29.150]
itself and powdered it nothing wrong, half-represented Pete Stark or California, in relation to Jim Stark,

[02:33:29.430 --> 02:33:33.190]
who fought the bill for being too generous to the powerful pharmaceutical operations, but many

[02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:37.330]
Republicans aren't happy either, especially those who consider themselves physical conservatives.

[02:33:37.530 --> 02:33:42.970]
The question remains, how many lies can this administration get away with? 30,000.

[02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:49.670]
Just like they keep insisting, Tony Blair comes out the other day and says, well, we met well,

[02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:53.370]
we never stole a freight train, but it was flawed intelligence and all that stuff we told

[02:33:53.370 --> 02:33:58.490]
it was a bunch of crap. It was all BS. No weapons, no threat, no imminent threat, no 45 minute

[02:33:58.490 --> 02:34:03.410]
attack waiting, it was all a bunch of crap, but we met well. And there's still talking,

[02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:06.350]
Cheney and Bush, there's still talking, there's still going, there's weapons there, and there

[02:34:06.350 --> 02:34:11.610]
was a connection between the United-Element Commission comes out and says there was absolutely,

[02:34:12.170 --> 02:34:18.410]
positively, no connection between Iraq or Saddam Hussein and 9-Element, and the Cheney still keeps

[02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:26.890]
this split in the same crap, I think his pacemaker must be stuck. God, I got to play that.

[02:34:27.930 --> 02:34:30.250]
He is just such a... oh, I really do.

[02:34:34.690 --> 02:34:42.230]
Such a crook, such a liar, such a piece of truth, you turn to the crappy heart.

[02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:04.430]
I'm dying off a head.

[02:35:14.530 --> 02:35:16.690]
Hope it don't explode.

[02:35:20.490 --> 02:35:24.530]
He has the vision.

[02:35:26.890 --> 02:35:37.690]
under his control while pushing jogging, thick stanza clogging and that's what happens

[02:35:37.690 --> 02:35:44.050]
when your heart is old and it's full of hope.

[02:35:46.730 --> 02:35:51.030]
Yeah, the chain is not a heart that's old.

[02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.770]
Rock solid.

[02:35:54.770 --> 02:35:57.090]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:35:57.590 --> 02:36:01.410]
He'll keep on working till his heart is cold.

[02:36:01.510 --> 02:36:03.250]
Hey, we got track in case you missed it.

[02:36:03.410 --> 02:36:06.890]
He'll keep pretending that his heart ain't old.

[02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:10.750]
But it's really old.

[02:36:12.170 --> 02:36:15.090]
He is the major chigger in a wood pile, Dick Cheney.

[02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:16.130]
Make no mistake about that.

[02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:18.590]
113 at 560 WDQM.

[02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:20.570]
Let me tell you right now about the pizza lot in Davy.

[02:36:20.590 --> 02:36:22.410]
They've been doing it right for a long, long time.

[02:36:22.950 --> 02:36:24.850]
And now they can make you an offer you really shouldn't refuse.

[02:36:25.010 --> 02:36:25.910]
It's a money back guarantee.

[02:36:26.090 --> 02:36:26.570]
That is correct.

[02:36:27.090 --> 02:36:30.050]
Either you get the best pizza at the lot in town or they give you your money back.

[02:36:30.210 --> 02:36:35.210]
Jeff Cohen, the entrepreneur, the chef, the owner and the egotist at the pizza lot.

[02:36:35.470 --> 02:36:37.230]
Guarantees, you'll be thrilled with the food at the pizza lot.

[02:36:37.290 --> 02:36:40.190]
He's so sure you're going to love with his three different kinds of great pizza

[02:36:40.190 --> 02:36:42.890]
that he guarantees you the best pizza in town to give you your money back.

[02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:46.150]
In fact, as you drive it around, you look up in the sky and there he is, Jeff Cohen.

[02:36:46.410 --> 02:36:47.630]
You listen to the show, there he is.

[02:36:47.870 --> 02:36:49.650]
You open the door in our studio and there he is.

[02:36:49.650 --> 02:36:50.210]
He's everywhere.

[02:36:51.650 --> 02:36:53.690]
The best pizza in town are your money back.

[02:36:53.850 --> 02:36:57.370]
After 27 excruciating years in South Florida, pizza lot has earned a reputation

[02:36:57.370 --> 02:37:01.510]
for consistently great quality food and service far beyond expectations.

[02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:05.490]
Not just another pizza joint, but a fantastic restaurant where they give you big, fresh portions.

[02:37:05.850 --> 02:37:06.710]
Everything is cooked order.

[02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:08.330]
They got the best garlic rolls in town.

[02:37:08.810 --> 02:37:12.810]
They got every kind of pasta dish ever invented and the lots more, too.

[02:37:13.210 --> 02:37:14.970]
Jeff is inviting you to stop by pizza lot today.

[02:37:15.090 --> 02:37:16.770]
Take him up on his offer for the best pizza in town.

[02:37:17.230 --> 02:37:19.090]
And I guarantee you, I'll bet you George's life on it.

[02:37:19.170 --> 02:37:20.450]
You'll become one of the regulars there, too.

[02:37:20.890 --> 02:37:25.750]
And now they offer you a balanced for life zone diet menu items as well as whole wheat pizza and whole wheat pasta.

[02:37:26.190 --> 02:37:31.290]
The pizza lot in Davie, you'll find him on university driving a pizza lot of plaza right between Griffin and the 595.

[02:37:31.710 --> 02:37:34.390]
And pizza lot is open every day, seven days a week for lunch and dinner.

[02:37:34.390 --> 02:37:38.410]
They deliver to most of Southwest Broward, fantastic catering, too, for those 5 bucks ahead.

[02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:40.770]
And those 5 bucks ahead.

[02:37:40.970 --> 02:37:43.130]
I don't forget they got lots of people parking there too right in front.

[02:37:43.430 --> 02:37:46.810]
Oh, I heard that they're redoing that plaza by the way that I ever mentioned this.

[02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.870]
How many times?

[02:37:49.350 --> 02:37:49.850]
I would say.

[02:37:50.510 --> 02:37:54.870]
Oh, seriously, they're redoing the plaza and Jeff has gotten some, I don't know what they'll never find it.

[02:37:55.810 --> 02:37:56.370]
He'll find it.

[02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:59.690]
Pizza lot, column at this number for delivery, take out catering.

[02:37:59.690 --> 02:38:02.450]
9.5.4.916.8880.

[02:38:02.830 --> 02:38:04.350]
916.8880.

[02:38:04.410 --> 02:38:07.250]
It's legendary. It's the pizza lot, come with a money back here and take.

[02:38:07.470 --> 02:38:09.650]
Oh, my name is Neil Gawr.

[02:38:10.030 --> 02:38:11.890]
Here's sports radio 560.

[02:38:12.790 --> 02:38:13.390]
QAM.

[02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:16.910]
Got your breasts are beautiful.

[02:38:17.250 --> 02:38:18.890]
And I'm the big O.

[02:38:19.250 --> 02:38:20.490]
What's that stand for?

[02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:21.170]
Four gather?

[02:38:21.450 --> 02:38:23.910]
No, that's just short for Orlando Blue.

[02:38:24.250 --> 02:38:25.370]
You don't look, Julie.

[02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.950]
No.

[02:38:26.270 --> 02:38:26.870]
No.

[02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:27.270]
No.

[02:38:27.890 --> 02:38:28.370]
No.

[02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.630]
No.

[02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:31.190]
Now Neil's gonna rip me for four hours.

[02:38:31.350 --> 02:38:34.270]
Well, I've been asked to keep distance, wrist confidence.

[02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:39.110]
But in case you wonder why we're here, Joe got suspended.

[02:38:39.650 --> 02:38:40.990]
Joe got suspended.

[02:38:41.570 --> 02:38:47.270]
Well, maybe we should take this call from our special guest, Roberto L'Awango.

[02:38:47.390 --> 02:38:48.130]
Hi, I'm Roberto.

[02:38:48.750 --> 02:38:50.990]
You know that I'm the voice of the Panta's now.

[02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:54.590]
Yes, I'm sure that's squeaky voice guy that goes by all the time.

[02:38:54.590 --> 02:38:56.290]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:38:56.290 --> 02:38:59.290]
You got me confused with a character on another show.

[02:38:59.610 --> 02:39:00.610]
That's not me.

[02:39:01.010 --> 02:39:02.850]
I have children in those.

[02:39:02.930 --> 02:39:03.290]
Do it, do it.

[02:39:03.570 --> 02:39:04.670]
You have a funny name.

[02:39:05.170 --> 02:39:05.390]
Yeah.

[02:39:05.810 --> 02:39:07.470]
I'm just gonna get caught up on you.

[02:39:07.570 --> 02:39:08.490]
Do it, do it, do it.

[02:39:08.490 --> 02:39:09.350]
Do it, do it, do it.

[02:39:09.390 --> 02:39:10.750]
We take it into that right now.

[02:39:11.050 --> 02:39:12.730]
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

[02:39:12.730 --> 02:39:12.730]

[02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.870]
Hey Joe.

[02:39:17.290 --> 02:39:20.130]
I don't watch what you're doing with your dead thing in your head.

[02:39:22.650 --> 02:39:23.610]
Come here.

[02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:26.830]
I'm gonna crush you if I can do that.

[02:39:29.950 --> 02:39:35.210]
One twenty a.q. and the thing about suspensions, of course, that goes back to Greg Readen, his juvenile mentality.

[02:39:35.350 --> 02:39:37.670]
Like the sandbox mentality, the whole radio station operation.

[02:39:38.170 --> 02:39:38.530]
Sandbox.

[02:39:39.230 --> 02:39:41.910]
Kids in a sandbox with a pale on the shovel.

[02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:44.970]
I never worked at a place in my life.

[02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:45.650]
Anywhere.

[02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:46.930]
I've worked at how many radio stations.

[02:39:47.010 --> 02:39:47.910]
About 30 men.

[02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:49.530]
Where there were so many suspensions.

[02:39:49.530 --> 02:39:55.390]
Oh, this one got suspended because he looked at Greg Crosside or because he talked nasty to screw in or the water now.

[02:39:55.390 --> 02:39:58.010]
See, it's like juvenile jury all over again.

[02:39:59.250 --> 02:40:01.510]
Like Ding Dong School without Francis Horwich.

[02:40:02.310 --> 02:40:05.070]
I've actually judged on who Francis Horwich is.

[02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:06.450]
You're ready about that?

[02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:07.290]
Yeah.

[02:40:07.970 --> 02:40:09.450]
Oh, come on. Ding Dong School?

[02:40:09.730 --> 02:40:11.050]
Yeah, here old-timers talking.

[02:40:11.170 --> 02:40:11.790]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:12.890]
Old Farts know that stuff.

[02:40:13.130 --> 02:40:15.050]
But Elijah pits my God.

[02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:16.930]
That is the screen.

[02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:18.270]
Then he's trying to walk you stunk.

[02:40:18.390 --> 02:40:19.390]
I looked at his stats.

[02:40:21.130 --> 02:40:23.410]
Is that radio station man is just like a...

[02:40:23.410 --> 02:40:24.930]
And of course, what do you have to do with Jack?

[02:40:25.310 --> 02:40:26.130]
Do you have anything to do with Jack?

[02:40:26.310 --> 02:40:26.470]
No.

[02:40:26.610 --> 02:40:28.270]
I rest my kitchen when we're talking about him for.

[02:40:28.570 --> 02:40:29.010]
That's it.

[02:40:29.350 --> 02:40:29.990]
That's all we need.

[02:40:30.430 --> 02:40:31.450]
That's all we need.

[02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:32.570]
WQA and Hello.

[02:40:33.130 --> 02:40:33.730]
Hi, Neil.

[02:40:33.730 --> 02:40:35.710]
I got a couple of spy reports for you.

[02:40:35.890 --> 02:40:36.190]
Okay.

[02:40:36.610 --> 02:40:40.670]
I don't know if anybody told you, but when you played the I hate the bird bit this morning.

[02:40:40.670 --> 02:40:41.870]
It did not get dumb.

[02:40:43.630 --> 02:40:44.230]
Oh, well.

[02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:46.030]
Well, we give our best shots.

[02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:46.390]
Sure did.

[02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:50.130]
And I did hear that word also on Air America this morning.

[02:40:50.370 --> 02:40:51.830]
Oh, well, if they can say what we can say it.

[02:40:52.330 --> 02:40:53.070]
Hi, that I agree.

[02:40:53.650 --> 02:40:55.710]
Too bad they don't play fart sounds yet.

[02:40:55.890 --> 02:40:56.950]
And maybe that's the next thing.

[02:40:57.170 --> 02:40:58.410]
Then we can get it back.

[02:40:58.570 --> 02:40:58.690]
Right.

[02:40:58.810 --> 02:40:59.630]
I think that's the deal.

[02:40:59.690 --> 02:41:01.650]
If Air America plays fart sounds, then we can get them back.

[02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:03.490]
Okay, well, I'll call and request that.

[02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:04.030]
Okay.

[02:41:04.410 --> 02:41:05.870]
Anyway, it's really not that bad.

[02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:12.230]
I don't think Air America, the guys in the morning can be kind of amusing.

[02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:16.830]
And it's interesting because it's stuff that I agree with just like you.

[02:41:17.090 --> 02:41:23.550]
You know, I could never listen to their rush because I hate everything that he says and everything that he thinks.

[02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:30.250]
But, um, Al Franken, you know, if he's interviewing somebody, it's interesting.

[02:41:30.810 --> 02:41:32.830]
Like he had Carl Heiss and on the other day.

[02:41:32.970 --> 02:41:33.890]
Oh, God.

[02:41:34.210 --> 02:41:35.010]
Oh, gee.

[02:41:35.450 --> 02:41:36.990]
Oh, oh, no.

[02:41:37.310 --> 02:41:39.450]
Carl Heiss and oh, my God.

[02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:42.390]
They were talking about voting machines.

[02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:47.450]
Oh, you know, it's funny that you should mention that because I was thinking a couple of days ago.

[02:41:47.490 --> 02:41:52.670]
I don't know what made me think of it back in the INZ days when they first put me on in the daytime after being on a night for a long time.

[02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:54.550]
And I remember one of my early issues.

[02:41:54.750 --> 02:41:57.210]
I had Tom Feetler and Carl Heiss in from the Harold.

[02:41:57.670 --> 02:42:01.770]
And all the years I was on, I can't think of a more boring coma inducing show.

[02:42:02.350 --> 02:42:02.530]
I think so.

[02:42:02.530 --> 02:42:04.070]
Oh, so better him than me.

[02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:04.870]
It's all I can tell you.

[02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:07.850]
Anyway, when he's with a guest, he's not too bad.

[02:42:08.810 --> 02:42:20.090]
But when he tries to do something funny, like he does impression sometimes of Dick Cheney and the other day was doing strong sermon, it gets really, really old fast.

[02:42:21.010 --> 02:42:22.250]
So that's really hard to take.

[02:42:22.450 --> 02:42:23.830]
But other than that, it's not too bad.

[02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:25.490]
It's, it's listenable.

[02:42:25.690 --> 02:42:29.270]
And when there's nothing else in town, that's all you got.

[02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:34.170]
So, but Randy, the problem with Randy is, today,

[02:42:34.170 --> 02:42:37.210]
they played the same code that they played yesterday.

[02:42:37.610 --> 02:42:38.010]
All right.

[02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:39.350]
Nice going, Pete Volger.

[02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.770]
Oh, right.

[02:42:39.770 --> 02:42:40.250]
Oh, man.

[02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:42.010]
She's channel rules, man.

[02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:42.390]
Yeah.

[02:42:42.490 --> 02:42:43.130]
But no question about it.

[02:42:43.550 --> 02:42:45.270]
And after I immediately turned that off.

[02:42:45.570 --> 02:42:52.690]
But the one found with her, and it's the same thing when she was being funny back before she became the liberal guy.

[02:42:52.690 --> 02:42:54.650]
Before she decided to say the world right.

[02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.290]
Right.

[02:42:55.750 --> 02:42:56.810]
She does the same thing.

[02:42:56.910 --> 02:43:01.770]
If she does say something funny, she'll say it over and over and over.

[02:43:01.770 --> 02:43:05.850]
And it's, that's like what my, what my husband does.

[02:43:06.090 --> 02:43:06.750]
You know, it's okay.

[02:43:06.990 --> 02:43:09.890]
I'm not going to laugh because you'll just keep saying it.

[02:43:10.110 --> 02:43:12.070]
You know, like a little soft, more it's hit.

[02:43:12.510 --> 02:43:15.810]
So, but he's, he's Randy.

[02:43:15.970 --> 02:43:16.850]
She's all she ever was.

[02:43:17.250 --> 02:43:17.850]
There you go.

[02:43:18.190 --> 02:43:19.190]
Well, that's just it all again.

[02:43:19.250 --> 02:43:26.250]
Wow, wow, but I hope that it is successful to tell you the truth because word has to get out there

[02:43:26.250 --> 02:43:28.650]
and we're being taken over by the right wing.

[02:43:28.970 --> 02:43:30.210]
And it has to stop.

[02:43:31.010 --> 02:43:32.110]
So, good luck to all of you.

[02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:35.410]
Well, if I thought they were going to make any difference, I'd say, hey, how will Luya?

[02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:38.250]
But I don't think they're going to make a, who's worth a difference?

[02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:42.150]
Well, the only thing is it's something different to listen to.

[02:43:42.410 --> 02:43:42.810]
There you go.

[02:43:43.330 --> 02:43:46.290]
Because N.T. argues a little boring and how and if sometimes too.

[02:43:46.890 --> 02:43:49.070]
Yeah, but he can't have too much force. Don't forget that.

[02:43:50.290 --> 02:43:51.670]
That would be a great, great day.

[02:43:52.130 --> 02:43:52.430]
Okay.

[02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:53.510]
See you, bye.

[02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:55.290]
Can't have too much shack.

[02:43:55.530 --> 02:43:56.930]
It's all shack all day.

[02:43:57.170 --> 02:43:58.470]
We got shack and we're back.

[02:43:58.670 --> 02:43:59.890]
They hate to hate to hate.

[02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.990]
We can't beat the heat.

[02:44:01.950 --> 02:44:04.330]
What a phony bunch of, oh man.

[02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:07.390]
It's just, it's just amazing, unbelievable.

[02:44:08.510 --> 02:44:13.750]
And of course, to show you how very narrow the town is because when a passage got Pavel Burry,

[02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:17.110]
just, just like when Josh said, the body lodge of pits, who, who that?

[02:44:17.850 --> 02:44:22.290]
It was the same thing with Pavel Burry because in South Florida, how do we have a hockey team?

[02:44:22.290 --> 02:44:23.270]
How is it possible?

[02:44:24.470 --> 02:44:30.190]
Man, oh man, you should find Alan Cohen and tell him for 20 million, you'll send him some primo real estate in the middle of the Everglades.

[02:44:31.870 --> 02:44:33.030]
In fact, we'll give him a discount.

[02:44:33.050 --> 02:44:34.810]
I'll buy 10 million. We'll just split it three ways.

[02:44:36.470 --> 02:44:42.590]
Brother, a hockey team in South Florida, they wouldn't know Pavel Burry from Pavel of the Dog.

[02:44:43.810 --> 02:44:45.830]
Pavel Burry's got a huge pair.

[02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:47.230]
Well, I'm sure you've seen him.

[02:44:47.310 --> 02:44:49.950]
There's Randy Declan-Molar, another silly person.

[02:44:51.610 --> 02:44:55.810]
56070560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:44:57.270 --> 02:44:57.990]
WQA, hello.

[02:44:59.150 --> 02:45:00.010]
How may I?

[02:45:00.350 --> 02:45:00.670]
Yes.

[02:45:01.390 --> 02:45:05.030]
Hey, for your poll, how about the lovely, the beautiful Kathy Willett?

[02:45:05.550 --> 02:45:07.350]
Oh, Kathy Willett, so well, there you go.

[02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:10.330]
Nobody, I don't like Kathy with all of them, I modeled the things on her skin.

[02:45:10.430 --> 02:45:11.130]
Okay, thanks, Pally.

[02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:15.790]
Kathy Willett's, I'm curious, huh?

[02:45:16.990 --> 02:45:17.190]
What?

[02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:18.990]
I think that's dropping it.

[02:45:19.050 --> 02:45:20.210]
We got to think we can still play it.

[02:45:20.210 --> 02:45:21.510]
Hey, Neil, it's true.

[02:45:21.790 --> 02:45:24.710]
I can't have an orgasm just driving down I-95.

[02:45:25.330 --> 02:45:28.430]
But only if you're driving beside me.

[02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:29.470]
What a grotesque thought.

[02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:31.030]
No, she's got that, what do you call that?

[02:45:31.070 --> 02:45:31.870]
That modeled scale?

[02:45:31.870 --> 02:45:33.450]
You know, fried hamburger flesh.

[02:45:34.850 --> 02:45:35.830]
Yeah, that's her.

[02:45:37.410 --> 02:45:38.290]
I know.

[02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:40.950]
It's just 420 on the ice today.

[02:45:41.470 --> 02:45:42.510]
You weigh him.

[02:45:44.050 --> 02:45:45.690]
Now I-95!

[02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:46.750]
Oh!

[02:45:47.370 --> 02:45:53.290]
In the criminal justice system, there is a threat so grave, so terrifying, so skanky,

[02:45:53.430 --> 02:45:55.890]
it requires an elite force of investigators.

[02:45:56.390 --> 02:45:57.750]
It's law and order.

[02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:59.150]
Courtney Love Unit.

[02:45:59.410 --> 02:46:01.390]
We got to suspect who matches the description.

[02:46:01.650 --> 02:46:04.230]
Stragally leeched hair, slept makeup, dressed like a hooker.

[02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:06.150]
She's stumbling under speech and slurred.

[02:46:06.250 --> 02:46:06.890]
Gold Tours 2?

[02:46:07.170 --> 02:46:07.630]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:07.850 --> 02:46:09.690]
Just as I thought, it's Courtney Love.

[02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:10.490]
Let's roll!

[02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:13.190]
No miss, law and order.

[02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:14.370]
Courtney Love Unit.

[02:46:14.650 --> 02:46:15.250]
Oh!

[02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:17.230]
Freeze, Courtney Love!

[02:46:17.470 --> 02:46:19.610]
Hey, back off, copper Earl!

[02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:20.830]
Whip it out!

[02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:21.690]
Oh, no!

[02:46:22.110 --> 02:46:23.650]
She's gonna flash your breast again!

[02:46:24.030 --> 02:46:24.450]
Take cover!

[02:46:25.150 --> 02:46:25.150]

[02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.670]
Oh!

[02:46:27.690 --> 02:46:27.770]
Oh!

[02:46:27.770 --> 02:46:28.710]
Oh, nasty!

[02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:31.150]
Stories ripped from today's headlines.

[02:46:31.570 --> 02:46:33.770]
About a pseudo celebrity who's always ripped.

[02:46:34.310 --> 02:46:35.050]
Law and order.

[02:46:35.470 --> 02:46:36.370]
Courtney Love Unit.

[02:46:36.590 --> 02:46:38.210]
Now you'll get the punishment you deserve.

[02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:39.830]
We're putting you in the hole.

[02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:40.550]
Paul!

[02:46:41.090 --> 02:46:44.530]
You mean you're putting my band back together?

[02:46:45.130 --> 02:46:47.470]
No, that would be punishing everyone else.

[02:46:48.030 --> 02:46:49.030]
Law and order.

[02:46:49.370 --> 02:46:50.170]
Courtney Love Unit.

[02:46:50.490 --> 02:46:52.970]
Fighting crime has never been this unclean.

[02:46:53.490 --> 02:46:54.170]
131, man.

[02:46:54.310 --> 02:46:55.830]
She is just a pathetic tragic.

[02:46:56.890 --> 02:46:58.210]
There are no words to describe that bitch.

[02:46:58.450 --> 02:46:58.710]
Nasty.

[02:47:00.050 --> 02:47:03.750]
Just, she needs to be put into like Terry's law, you know?

[02:47:04.930 --> 02:47:07.310]
Yeah, just put her right next to Terry Shival and see if she

[02:47:07.310 --> 02:47:08.550]
can help her ass out.

[02:47:08.590 --> 02:47:08.810]
Hmm.

[02:47:09.730 --> 02:47:12.610]
Real estate developer and top democratic political fundraiser, Charles

[02:47:12.610 --> 02:47:17.030]
Kushner of Livingston, New Jersey was charged by federal prosecutors this week with conspiracy

[02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:20.390]
obstruction of justice and interstate promotion of prostitution.

[02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:21.030]
All right!

[02:47:21.810 --> 02:47:25.430]
The charges were announced by US Attorney Christopher J. Christie for New Jersey.

[02:47:25.770 --> 02:47:26.290]
Chris Christie.

[02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:28.950]
I wonder if he's kind of Luke Christie.

[02:47:30.090 --> 02:47:32.470]
In fact, I wonder if Josh knows who Luke Christie is.

[02:47:34.310 --> 02:47:34.730]
No.

[02:47:37.930 --> 02:47:38.750]
Luke Christie?

[02:47:39.510 --> 02:47:40.350]
Luke Christie.

[02:47:40.890 --> 02:47:41.050]
No.

[02:47:46.030 --> 02:47:46.990]
Don't act surprised.

[02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:50.170]
Should be surprised, I know who he is.

[02:47:50.930 --> 02:47:54.790]
No, if you didn't know who Luke Christie was, I mean that would be...

[02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:58.430]
Let's be for my time only because I asked you to listen before my time.

[02:47:58.630 --> 02:48:02.390]
Well, we better get Josh there and listen to Magic 102 points similar these days when he does something

[02:48:02.390 --> 02:48:04.950]
really bad, just took him up to a chair and crank it up real loud.

[02:48:06.750 --> 02:48:10.110]
You'll have the righteous brothers until he's got even the dead one coming out of his

[02:48:10.110 --> 02:48:11.530]
back home years.

[02:48:12.890 --> 02:48:16.910]
In February 2003, Christie's office began investigating Kushner for alleged violation of federal

[02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:20.350]
facts and fraud statutes and for purported violation of federal campaign

[02:48:20.350 --> 02:48:21.230]
contribution laws.

[02:48:21.630 --> 02:48:24.530]
According to the indictment, two of the cooperating witnesses in investigation, a very

[02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:28.170]
couple described as close relatives of Kushner, provided information against him to federal

[02:48:28.170 --> 02:48:28.950]
investigators.

[02:48:29.810 --> 02:48:34.290]
The indictment alleges that Kushner initiated a scheme to orchestrate a court, I am sorry,

[02:48:34.510 --> 02:48:39.310]
a covert, videotape seduction of the cooperating male witness in an attempt to thwart the investigation.

[02:48:40.470 --> 02:48:44.190]
The indictment says Kushner recruited two individuals to hire a woman to have sex with the male

[02:48:44.190 --> 02:48:48.030]
witness and later instructed them to mail the video tape to the man's wife who was the other

[02:48:48.030 --> 02:48:49.610]
cooperating witness in the investigation.

[02:48:50.130 --> 02:48:53.710]
Benjamin Broppman, Charles Kushner's attorney, calls the charges baseless.

[02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:58.590]
Charles Kushner is one of the most respected menace leaders in the community and widely known

[02:48:58.590 --> 02:49:02.230]
as a generous philanthropist, Broppman, said in a statement, the charges filed are entirely

[02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:02.810]
basely audio.

[02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.730]
So there you go.

[02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:09.230]
There's a Democrat on a hot seat for being a pervert, a violator.

[02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:14.650]
Oh, and speaking of that, the other way around, Democrats to the Republican Party State Committee

[02:49:14.650 --> 02:49:18.690]
and New Hampshire and its former executive director over the jamming of telephones set up to take

[02:49:18.690 --> 02:49:21.770]
calls from Democrats seeking rights to the polls on election day 2002.

[02:49:21.770 --> 02:49:23.010]
This is the administration.

[02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:27.010]
These are the people that we're going to bring morality and decency back to politics.

[02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.490]
Remember that?

[02:49:27.690 --> 02:49:32.650]
The compacts of conservatives who want to do gay bashing because they want to have you think about

[02:49:32.650 --> 02:49:35.330]
anything except all the people dying in Iraq and all the lives they told everybody?

[02:49:36.750 --> 02:49:38.610]
And all the people out of business out of work?

[02:49:39.530 --> 02:49:43.190]
The lawsuit also names the head of a telemarketing firm has been charged in a separate federal

[02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:47.770]
investigation with conspiring to jam five telephone lines at Democratic Party orifices.

[02:49:47.770 --> 02:49:51.770]
This week, Dirty Politics has no place in our electoral process.

[02:49:52.370 --> 02:49:53.530]
Oh, yeah, what a joke.

[02:49:53.690 --> 02:49:54.770]
Said State Senator Lou Dillesandro.

[02:49:57.530 --> 02:49:58.610]
Ovid Lamotanyye.

[02:49:59.410 --> 02:50:00.310]
What kind of a name is that?

[02:50:00.450 --> 02:50:00.750]
Ovid.

[02:50:00.930 --> 02:50:02.870]
Ovid, Ovid Lamotanyye.

[02:50:03.430 --> 02:50:06.870]
Attorney for New Hampshire Republican Party said the lawsuit disrupts the federal investigation,

[02:50:07.210 --> 02:50:09.390]
confusing and orderly and appropriate process.

[02:50:10.190 --> 02:50:17.750]
The lawsuit seeks an injunction preventing the GOP from engaging in illegal activities in the

[02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:19.730]
telephone lines for getting voters to the polls in 2002.

[02:50:20.290 --> 02:50:22.210]
Prosecutors say the lines were jammed for about an hour.

[02:50:22.990 --> 02:50:24.350]
Says here for about one hours.

[02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:25.290]
Says the AP.

[02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:27.310]
For about one hours.

[02:50:28.510 --> 02:50:33.590]
Oh my God, when that lady tells me that he had a crawl highest in the other day, all I can say to that is,

[02:50:33.610 --> 02:50:34.610]
Oh my God.

[02:50:35.310 --> 02:50:35.670]
Gosh.

[02:50:36.770 --> 02:50:40.050]
I mean, you talk about terminal and coma inducing.

[02:50:41.430 --> 02:50:42.750]
Let's have a bunch of writers on.

[02:50:42.850 --> 02:50:43.570]
How about Bob Woodward?

[02:50:43.650 --> 02:50:46.150]
Let's get him on to talk about the sec criteria of state.

[02:50:46.150 --> 02:50:46.910]
Okay.

[02:50:48.010 --> 02:50:51.070]
I mean, there are just a lot of people who are very brilliant people.

[02:50:51.310 --> 02:50:58.150]
They're good writers, but they just can't articulate and they tend to be a little boring and ponderous,

[02:50:58.150 --> 02:51:01.530]
especially when they talk about the sec criteria of state.

[02:51:02.890 --> 02:51:03.850]
Secretary of state.

[02:51:04.090 --> 02:51:05.090]
I think his lady was talking about.

[02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:07.650]
Now, what is this thing you just said to me?

[02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:08.410]
Have I seen this?

[02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:11.270]
What do you do when some morons criticize you and a news report?

[02:51:11.270 --> 02:51:15.870]
If you do us attorney for the Southern District of Florida, the top federal cop, the answer is these.

[02:51:15.870 --> 02:51:17.110]
You black ball the news reporter.

[02:51:17.170 --> 02:51:18.350]
No, I have not seen this.

[02:51:18.390 --> 02:51:19.050]
This is what it says.

[02:51:19.330 --> 02:51:19.870]
Page one of six.

[02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:22.890]
I only sent you two because that's where the link is on the second page there.

[02:51:23.010 --> 02:51:24.410]
Well, I'm not going to go through.

[02:51:24.510 --> 02:51:25.970]
Are you thinking I'm going to read six pages here?

[02:51:26.330 --> 02:51:26.550]
No.

[02:51:28.010 --> 02:51:34.250]
When you us attorney general John Ascroff visited Miami two weeks ago as part of an Asian-wide blitz to promote the Bush administration's war on terror,

[02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:35.670]
he should a scary warning.

[02:51:36.930 --> 02:51:38.830]
Multiple available streams of intelligence.

[02:51:38.830 --> 02:51:41.590]
I wonder if Josh Beckett is found where those streams are.

[02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:49.170]
Multiple available streams of intelligence indicate the West that Al-Qaeda plans to attack the U.S. this year and to hit us hard, he declared.

[02:51:49.610 --> 02:51:52.170]
The USA paint-through act is working to protect America lives in liberties.

[02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:56.330]
And it makes it possible for us to bring charges against individuals that threaten the U.S. and our security.

[02:51:56.750 --> 02:52:04.790]
In anticipation of Ascroff's Miami appearance, his host, U.S. attorney, Marcos D. Jimenez, no relation to Jose Jimenez, issued his own warning.

[02:52:05.430 --> 02:52:12.090]
Though this one was directed at a local news organization, not the nation at large, and though it did not concern terrorists, it was chilling in its own way.

[02:52:12.370 --> 02:52:21.130]
Jimenez instructed his special counsel for public affairs, Carlos Castillo, in a relation to her birth, or Castillo, Jr., to phone in some extraordinary news to Channel 6.

[02:52:21.510 --> 02:52:22.870]
Ike Siemens, that old hack.

[02:52:23.790 --> 02:52:28.370]
Senior correspondent for the NBC Own Station would be banned from Ascroff's June 30th news conference.

[02:52:28.510 --> 02:52:29.530]
Stop turning, man!

[02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:41.770]
At the Federal Justice Building in downtown Miami, he said, if you send Ike, he will not be allowed in Reconcert WTVJ, Rasperson, F Newsiew, Vent Milley, Miley, whatever name is, who took the call.

[02:52:42.250 --> 02:52:46.250]
She said she responded to Castillo, that's shocking! Shocking, as in...

[02:52:46.250 --> 02:52:47.190]
Oh my God!

[02:52:47.770 --> 02:52:54.590]
You can't really dictate to us who will send a cover in the event. I asked him what his issues were in my wing. He would even try to go down that road and talk about a past story.

[02:52:54.590 --> 02:52:55.830]
Oh, this goes on forever.

[02:52:57.090 --> 02:53:07.850]
About Siemens did this, an NBC news hire him as a principal correspondent in Latin America, when spent several years covering the Bloody Civil Wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Yadi, Yadi, Yadi, Yadi, Yadi, just whatever.

[02:53:09.570 --> 02:53:16.410]
Jimenez looked uneasy, but held his position when I lose confidence in somebody because of the fairness of his reporting, then that's something that needs to be hashed out.

[02:53:16.770 --> 02:53:20.490]
Vogueer then informed Jimenez that had Siemens been in town, he very likely would have shown up.

[02:53:22.530 --> 02:53:26.610]
So I guess they sent him on vacation. He's a long vacation anyway, you're an old hack, Ike, okay?

[02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:32.070]
I don't blame them as much as I despise John Ascroft, and all the Nazis around him. I don't blame them for not allowing you there, okay?

[02:53:32.670 --> 02:53:38.550]
I wouldn't let him anywhere near me or my house or my dogs if they were still alive or even now that they're dead, even my mother.

[02:53:39.230 --> 02:53:46.290]
You're an old buddy, Dutty, you're an old hack. You and Mickey Ererson have a great life. Well, I bet you he's all whipped up now that we got Shaq.

[02:53:46.290 --> 02:53:50.570]
Y'know what I said we? We got Shaq, alright. We got Shaq, alright.

[02:53:52.750 --> 02:53:54.130]
Shaq is Shaq, Shaq.

[02:53:56.010 --> 02:53:59.530]
Oh man, play the whole thing.

[02:54:00.250 --> 02:54:09.630]
Shaq is Shaq. Shaq, Shaq. Shaq, Shaq.

[02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:13.910]

Shag, shag, shag, shag, shag!

[02:54:19.750 --> 02:54:20.950]
Shag, shag, shag, shag!

[02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:23.870]
Don't be too immature, shag, shag, shag!

[02:54:25.090 --> 02:54:29.070]
Yes! Shag, shag, shag, rock, rock, rock, rock!

[02:54:29.430 --> 02:54:30.450]
Look who's here.

[02:54:31.030 --> 02:54:31.590]
It's Shag!

[02:54:31.870 --> 02:54:33.810]
Ooh, who's here? It's Shag!

[02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:34.690]
Shag, shag!

[02:54:34.830 --> 02:54:37.990]

[02:57:12.970 --> 02:57:16.210]
That's how desperate the Republicans were because of the other guy who had like a little hanky

[02:57:16.210 --> 02:57:19.770]
Panky problem going on here, but at any rate so Mike did cuz this is

[02:57:20.310 --> 02:57:24.550]
He says I can't stand the fags and this already makes me want a gag, but nevertheless

[02:57:25.070 --> 02:57:26.350]
And he probably would have won

[02:57:27.390 --> 02:57:33.950]

You know he's paying bills, but we're see how even while he's paying my bills. We're supposed to care about Shaq

Holy man. Well, but he is rock solid no question about that

[03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:57.330]
This I'm serious the sports nerds. No listen

[03:00:57.330 --> 03:01:05.250]
This is like this radio station 20 hours a day exception of 10 to 20 hours a day. This is like a on-the-ear mental institution

[03:01:06.210 --> 03:01:11.850]
All the crazy I'm not that we don't have our own it's a different variety. We have our own garden variety not case

But I mean all these sports not just sports nerds, but I mean way be whatever is beyond that

[03:01:18.390 --> 03:01:20.830]

See Josh if you don't know a lot of pits. You're just you're not gonna be allowed to be in that category

[03:02:07.630 --> 03:02:09.790]
I mean, you know because he had lined up 50

[03:02:10.930 --> 03:02:16.530]
bombings and world war one and he shot 49 of them with bullets coated in pigs

[03:02:16.530 --> 03:02:23.530]
Why then yeah, there you go. That's a good idea five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[03:02:23.530 --> 03:02:26.530]
