Jesus not even we're gonna find that thing I was just playing well. We don't have time anyway, so you just heard a little bit of it

[00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.370]
I always I think I'm losing my mind

[00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.650]
Well, because my first inclination is I'm looking around like what what am I doing here? What it must be my bad

[00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.310]
It couldn't possibly be on that end

[00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.550]
But it could be on that end. Oh no must be somehow function at the junction here

[00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.710]
I was a lot of funny bit because they need to drive the Sarasota for doughnuts this morning. I see I'm not talking about that whole morning thing

[00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.750]
All right, I'm up getting involved now. I just glad that Joe roses back today

[00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.710]
What a breath of fresh air after you're having to follow that bowzo the big oh yesterday good guy

[00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.930]
It's not personal man. You just suck on the air. You're an idiot. I mean on the air and off the right

[00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.310]
I don't know if you think is the an idiot off the air or not

[00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.930]
Isn't nice guy haven't talked to him all that much so like I said it's business definitely not personal

[00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.810]
But boy he blows anyway now let me ask you another question since we got a lot of fish to fry him

[00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.130]
We only got two and a half hours to do it

[00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.150]
Well, we really only have two hours, but I've been on tell the audience that wish I'll give her that for noon to 12 30 hour

[00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.330]
Anyway, where is Todd direct with my fast train copy that he was gonna bring in how that quizzing that little simple then

[00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.150]
That it's in the very first break coming up in just a few minutes here. Where is Todd direct?

[00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.610]
Where is the evidence that this man is doing some work at WQ a M?

[00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.750]
Do we have any evidence whatsoever? No, not yet

[00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.150]
All eyes are focused on that door. I'm sure waiting for that little quizzling become maybe he'll just slip it under the door and

[00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.630]
the copy too

[00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.470]
Mary McGurray's dead who

[00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.850]
I don't say that you know who Mary McGurray was

[00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.370]
She died legendary newswoman covered a half century of Washington columnist Mary McGurray

[00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.170]
a major figure in the 20th century American journalism a writer of lasting influence

[00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.770]
Wonderful. Yes, and I never heard of it. Well, let's see she was born August 20, 1918 so that made her 82 85

[00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.290]
Well, it says right here. She was 85 but I guess the most luminous writer and clearist anchor in the business New York Times

[00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.910]
Communist Marine Dow declared a migraines attribute to her career several years ago and this goes on a great life

[00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.870]
Mary McGurray is dead at 85

[00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.770]
If you know who that was then you're like a left American probably

[00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.190]
Let's take a look we got lots of fish to fry here today. We got two pulls for the price of one

[00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.990]
Yesterday's pull the most important athlete of the 20th century was as much as they hated that pool

[00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.150]

Love you Danny. You just don't call out in his list. Oh, no, he did it. It's out for the thing

[00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.950]
How come John always not on here?

[00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.590]
Let me ask you Josh did John L. Waywin Super Bowl. Yes, he did. Yes

[00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.730]
Dan marino when I see that's a bad argument, but he just don't belong under Michael Jordan 82

Jesse O'on's 139

[00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.150]
Complexion of baseball if we can say that

320 votes and no athletes are important 515

[00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.970]
20 and a percent. Oh, there's your body money. It will be just spitting blood

[00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.270]
But I was sure they I wish we had that clip from yesterday

[00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.190]
He was foaming it the month almost got to the point where I liked him

[00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.510]
By the way John Kerry is just to make him be synchronized stomach. Yeah

[00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.790]

His thing the differences between handed version and no matter what the issue is now

[00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.590]

Whether it's in fact you came and had a great line out with I miss this morning that you can't we talked about immediately

[00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.850]
Soon as Bush announced his marriage with the devil with Sharon on those settlements, which is totally unacceptable

[00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.290]
So Kerry went out of the condo's and Florida Pat said and started saying hey, you know Bush has a great idea

[00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:42.570]

Nancy Drew, Mr. East you played Nancy Drew. Why didn't know that I did

[00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.730]
Because I never watched an Nancy Drew. Mr. I watched a hardy boys because yeah, because they're party

You to fight a man so much there she is she's Pamela Sue Martin and you will not be too pleased with the fact that

[00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.510]
There isn't an awful lot showing there, but it's the best we could do and it's a real picture. It's a ripple

[00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.450]
Thank you, pardon

[00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.990]
Now here's the first poll today and let me say again. We have real heavy duty

[00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.970]
We don't have much time to be little in the mouth. It's probably an act of God

[00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.430]
I would think yeah, good Josh screwed up the opening there was playing Tommy squeaking through that spot

[00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.030]
Whatever that was that was that was just mind blowing

[00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.990]
In fact, I got a great idea what we can do for those of you who pick up our HD TV radio whatever the thing is in stereo

[00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:43.250]
Through the left speaker you'll be here in spots and we'll be doing our show and you'll hear the comedy bits in the right speaker just to conserve time

[00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:50.890]
And I'm not complaining believe you me because we love our Florida Marlins band after that thrilling unbelievable victory

[00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.350]
Mike Lowell his three home runs takes 12 meetings in Philadelphia

[00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.070]
The lead goes back and forth eight to seven Florida Marlins win as they're back on the right track again

[00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.430]
How do you like that am I jumping on the bandwagon? No, but I like them a lot when they play really games

[00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:10.750]
Pull number one today should the US reinstate the military draft and I'm gonna tell you I saw this

[00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.170]
Chuck from Nebraska, haven't last night

[00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.450]
He's a crazy person. Yes. He's out of his mind. He was saying things that just made my blood boil well

[00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.090]
You know the president's on the right track

[00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.090]
We're doing the right thing over there

[00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.090]
But we're gonna need the troops and with all the involvement of finding terror around the world and it's a great

[00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.370]
You know a really good idea this yeah, it's a really good idea

[00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.690]
And I'm thinking about so here we go with Vietnam all over again

[00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.490]
We didn't learn our lesson the first time how many young people and middle-aged people end whatever they are

[00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:41.250]
How many of our people can we bring back in body bags? That's the question. How many thousand

[00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:48.230]
But we can do better than that. Yeah, these people have their way it builds character and this baloney that somehow the draft is gonna like

[00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.870]
Catch your all of the you know the wealthy people sons and daughter. They all forget about that who the hell you can

[00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.970]
Never did before and wouldn't do it again

[00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:03.230]
But if the republicans like and of course also on there in doing units are castically is my good post-friend from

[00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.550]
New York, what's his name Charlie Wrangle? They were on CNN yesterday. Well, at least Charlie was

[00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.070]
And Charlie says well if you want to support the war in Iraq

[00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.690]
They you know if you're gonna be for it then go and fight it right is what he's saying

[00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.530]
So I think Rumsfeld and all the other neo cons who never fought will never serve one day to move her in their lives for their country

[00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.610]
I think those people ought to be over their fighting right now

[00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:31.370]
Anyway, should the US reinstate the military draft. Yes our troops are overestimated. Yes, everyone should have to serve

[00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:37.550]
Yes, that'll hit young people to vote. No, don't send our kids to be slaughtered or no, it's fine to wait is now those year for five choices

[00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.250]
I can't imagine anything else. Can you?

[00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.590]
No, okay now this pulls up only the first hour because then we got heavy duty that other pull that's gonna

[00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.490]
It's gonna probably be the longest there when we ever did in terms of how well maybe not we did that one hit wonders

[00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:57.090]
But we change that every day this one's just gonna be like slopping over you know what I mean? What do you mean?

[00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.890]
Slopping over just think of screwing you know what I mean where is Todd right by the way

[00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.310]
What where is Todd wreck oh, I just got the copy

[00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.610]
See yeah, well put it in that fast machine right now because we got a couple minutes there you go

[00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:17.730]
And I swear Todd see you can actually do it you well. I haven't seen it yet. I wrote the date out there just you know for reference

[00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.170]
No, no problem. He'll just change it anyway

[00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:28.770]
The worst hit song this is the pull that starts at 11 o'clock the worst hit song top 40 of all time is he went ahead and defined hit song

[00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.890]
Well, all the reason that I'm doing this is because it's a big now. It's everywhere as a matter of fact because it is

[00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.330]
What's that magazine again what you seem to know and I have no idea what blender?

[00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.710]
Maxim blender which you can make some great smoothies in there too as a matter of fact

[00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:52.390]
But they have the worst and again, I've got their list of the worst 50 I originally had only the worst 10

[00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.110]
But now thanks to the Houston Chronicle

[00:10:54.110 --> 00:11:00.510]
I got their list of the worst 50 songs of all time and I would certainly take great issue with some of these which you are agreeing before the show

[00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.450]
I don't I mean what for example is wrong with

[00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.570]
With

[00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.570]
What's up by four non-blans here the inspiration by Chicago?

[00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.770]
Nothing they're just whatever they're fine. I mean once they get to

[00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.670]
courtesy of the red white and blue the angry American with Toby Keith. I say right on your spot on man

[00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:23.290]
I got hockey anyway, so here's what we start it with the worst hit song top 40 of all time is ring my bell

[00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.650]
You light up my life seasons in the sun the anxious Terry jacks

[00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.130]
We built the city starship now these these additional ones that are on here

[00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.230]
This is the top 10 from that Max and Blender pull

[00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:38.710]
We built the city starship a key breaking heart Billy Ray Cyrus everybody have fun tonight Wayne Chung

[00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.910]
Roland Limpusket ice ice baby vanilla ice

[00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.670]
The hard rock and roll here we lose and the news don't worry be happy about me with Ferran or yeah

[00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:54.490]
Party all the time Eddie Murphy couldn't sing a lot of a paper sack even if he was dressed up in drag

[00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.710]
American life Madonna everything I repel McCarty and Stevie. I wonder why they made that song

[00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.230]
So there's there's the starter list for you to get you going

[00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.330]
Let's see you're oh, yeah, I saw this already somebody fact it but I did not print the shots around as well

[00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.870]
It's on a Michael Moore website

[00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.910]
He points out that he just got worded his new film Fahrenheit 9-11 has been selected by the Cannes Film Festival the premier in competition

[00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:15.950]
No

[00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.330]
Back in the day when someone's ever strong

[00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.090]
We didn't take their crap

[00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.410]
In Pearl Harbor when the judge dropped their box

[00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.270]
We found them back in other

[00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:36.530]
They hit us hard and on our cards are little plants

Alright

[00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.310]
The United States

[00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.510]
By

[00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:04.790]
To

[00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.590]
In the USA and the USA

[00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.990]
What's a few thousand innocent lives?

[00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.430]
Stop living in the past

[00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.670]
The new ones that yes you feed you drive

[00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.350]
You're gonna need more gas

[00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.730]
It's the greatest country in the world

[00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.250]
They bring us to the beach

[00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:45.050]
And anyone who says that obviously

[00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.250]
You're gonna need more

[00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.110]
And that embarrassed to be an American

[00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.130]
Where we pay three odd-to-three

[00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.250]
We've a flagon with acid with our head in the sand

[00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.330]
And blindly follow the powers that we have ascending

[00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:35.690]
And you're gonna need more gas

[00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.730]
it's turning into another Vietnam. I lived through that era and it was horrible. Then he goes on to say,

[00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:45.950]
however, we need a draft, not for this war, but because we spend a fortune now advertising on TV and

[00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:50.130]
radio to try to entice people and to volunteering to join the Armed Forces. Plus, we spend a fortune

[00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.830]
in perks to get them to volunteer with a draft we could stop all this experience. This draft should

[00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.730]
just be able to stop the Army with people not for this jerky war. Well, I hate to break the news to you.

[00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.790]
Arnie, we're already there. And if we do reinstate the draft, which it never going to happen,

[00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:09.450]
at least not during before the election. But if they did do that, what it basically means is that,

[00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.930]
as you see, Arnie obviously don't have any teenage sons or daughters because if he did,

[00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.810]
he wouldn't be talking that crap. Then your sons and daughters could be sent off to be slaughtered

[00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.450]
just like they were during Vietnam. So if you do have any recollection of how grotesque and

[00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:25.170]
horrible it was and the 58,000 people who came back in body bags, you ought to be keeping that in mind

[00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.130]
again for a totally illegitimate war that was fought based on lies, the Gulf of Tocque in Resolution,

[00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:35.210]
just like this war was fought based on lies, the WMDs, the L-Kyde connection, all of these things.

[00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:40.110]
So there you go. And you people on this pool, I just put it under just to, you know, see how the

[00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:46.370]
how the things falls out. But I guarantee you that nobody who's got teenage sons or daughters

[00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.970]
is voting. Oh, yes, we need the draft back. And certainly no, no 18, 19 year old kids out there

[00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.570]
are voting. Oh, yeah, we want the draft. No way. As a matter of fact, I'll be checking at the

[00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:59.450]
border. Okay, who can come up here and who can't? If you're real ugly, you got no chance.

[00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.250]
111 votes to the US re-instate the military draft. No, don't set our kids to be slaughtered 56.

[00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:11.050]
No, it's fine. The weight is now 22. Yes, that'll get young people to vote 18. Yes,

[00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.010]
everyone should have to serve 12. And yes, our troops are over extended three. So the yeses,

[00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:21.910]
for whatever the three reasons, you got let's say 13, but almost 30,000.

[00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:27.730]
This crowd thinks, oh, sure, we need the draft back. Oh, man, we're going to hit you the same

[00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:33.830]
cure that Chuck Hagel needs here in Nebraska. I mean, what does it take now? I mean, I'm going to

[00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.750]
tell you the bottom line I've been telling you this all along and the more I watch BBC and the

[00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:42.450]
CBC, the more I realize that America's got no, unless you go on the internet, unless you care

[00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.950]
enough, which most people don't have the inclination or the time or either one, unless you go in

[00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:52.470]
the scour to find the truth for yourself, you're not going to find it on NBC or ABC or CBS or CNN

[00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.910]
or MSNBC and certainly not on Fox. No, it's just ain't there. So I'm channel surfing last night

[00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:04.870]
and there's a show that's on every week on a CBC called Counter-Spin. And they take a topic,

[00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.850]
whether it's a rack or whatever the hot topic is and they have guests on who actually know what

[00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.630]
they're talking about. And one of the guests was Greg Polast. Well, it seems to me that we've had

[00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.730]
some of his articles on our website over the couple last couple of years. Greg Polast, who

[00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:22.350]
for the name, and anyway, he's a, he does his work mostly for the BBC because the American

[00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.750]
networks won't touch it with a 10 foot pull. He's got his own website. I immediately have not

[00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:32.350]
sooner emailed Eric and said put a link on our site, GregPolast.com because you can go on his

[00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.610]
site and you can not only read some of the articles, but you can also watch the video of some of

[00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:41.670]
his BBC reports on, for example, out of bushes, Jeb and the Captain Harris and some of the other

[00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.690]
people helped W. Steele Florida, how they promised him Florida before the election,

[00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.370]
and how thousands and thousands of names of black mostly Democratic voters were purged from the list.

[00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.730]
All of these things, I watched it and I wanted to cry. But anyway, there's just one short clip I

[00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:00.990]
wanted to play just a few seconds from Greg Polast last night on a show. Here you loud and clear,

[00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:05.530]
here you both admitted that these are the creation of the administration and the monsters are coming

[00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.910]
back to bite you in the behind. I don't see you in American TV. I just came back yesterday from

[00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:14.590]
the States. I travel a lot. Nobody says this. You guys are not on Fox News. You're not on the

[00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:19.350]
on the righty factor. You're not on all these shows. They're talking about all these crazy Muslims

[00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.730]
and Arabs running around killing people. We are the only one called terrorists. Things seem

[00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.430]
like very school, the Oklahoma bomber, Harbily Oswald is called the Kennedy Assassin. Everybody

[00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.350]
has a different thing. Only Arabs and Muslims are being called terrorists. Nobody talked about

[00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:37.270]
the mistakes of the United States. Are you planning to talk about it? What is the solution that you

[00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:41.610]
are going to think? Answer me, please. Greg Polast, how do you feel that the media has been

[00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:48.550]
handling this issue, the matter of 9-11? Well, it's just been absolutely awful. I can tell you,

[00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:54.150]
I report for BBC television. Thank you for having me on in Canada. But the signal basically

[00:20:54.150 --> 00:21:01.050]
bounces off the electronic Berlin Wall in America. Why? We have a solid wall of official propaganda,

[00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:11.530]
which is as close to his western propaganda as the Soviet leaders used to dream of. We even have,

[00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:18.030]
for example, Bob Woodward now being praised, he's the manager of the Washington Post, being praised

[00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:25.550]
for suddenly letting out Colin Powell's excuses don't blame me for the war. One year ago, Bob Woodward

[00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:30.350]
wrote a book called, Bush at War, saying that our president was really at least focused so we

[00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:34.670]
were only on fighting terrorists. This year he said, well, that's not really true. Here's the real

[00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:39.570]
story. He was really focused on a raft. Maybe next year, Greg Polast will get ready to get

[00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.830]
ready to get interrupted. That was the end of the show, too bad of an odd time. It was a hell of an

[00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:48.690]
hour, man. I'm not going to play any more than that because, you know, like Jack Nicholson said,

[00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:54.710]
we can't handle the truth. Michael Jackson and Diedad. All right. They were hyperventilating like

[00:21:54.710 --> 00:22:02.310]
crazy on the number of slides. Night about this. Are you surprised? No. A grand jury investigating

[00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.630]
allegations that Michael Jackson molested a boys and targeted the pop star ABC News has learned.

[00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.650]
The panel has been meeting in Santa Barbara, California for 13 days to consider whether there's

[00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.970]
enough evidence to charge Jackson 45. The precise charges returned against the singer were not

[00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.950]
immediately known. And do we know it all now? I didn't look for an update on this, but I don't

[00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:27.510]
see any more on this. The incident means the grand jury concluded there is enough evidence to believe

[00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:32.510]
that Jackson is committed to crime and should face trial and he will. April 30th, I believe, is the

[00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:38.250]
arraimentate April about 30, man. Right. The day after the numbers come out, by the way, next Thursday,

[00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.770]
a week from today, you think today's a big day with the Marlon game at 1230 pre-game. Next

[00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:47.450]
Thursday's a humongous day. Then we'll see. And you I'm going to make a prediction right now,

[00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:54.330]
which I really do. And that is WBGG. This is not, you know, it's an old brainer. Big 106 is going to

[00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:59.810]
fall off the face of the earth. Yeah. Right. You didn't have to be psychic for that. Well, that's

[00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.630]
what I'm saying. It's a safe prediction. It's going on in a very short limb. And some of us can relate

[00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:08.350]
to a short limb. It's just, I mean, they're going to vanish. Because once they're in what off of

[00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.850]
it, we saw just one week of the last round out of the 12 weeks, the last week was the first one where

[00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:17.350]
he was off of Big 106. And they already started tumbling down like, like we never ain't seen,

[00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:22.570]
like an avalanche. So you'll see next Thursday. That's the one thing that we do know for sure is

[00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:31.750]
that the Big 106 finito man done finished by 27 past 10 at 560 WQM when your hair is fallen out

[00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.750]
and clumps man. There are a lot of different things you can do about it. Now, but why don't you

[00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.370]
go out and catch a muskrat in the art, put it on your head and look just like mold. Absolutely.

[00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:43.250]
But you can always spot a bad hair system. You can look like sand a Donaldson if you want like a

[00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:47.090]
clown. You look like Aaron Brown, little red on the top and black on the sides and whatever in

[00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:51.050]
between. But if you want a really great hair system, Charles Alfie Erie's design and supply

The thing I didn't know about your dancing. Of course, it's not even flying back there from

[00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.690]
Nigel Seven. I know. Thank God. I'm here.

[00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.450]
It's all over for you, poor Schlefstuckerner. There's an indow, well.

[00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:06.710]
Well, if you're lucky, that crackhead is the last bus to rig an election. Who's on this line?

[00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.710]
W.J.A. Mr. Rogers?

[00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:09.350]
Speaking.

[00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.030]
You know what this is doing.

[00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.790]
Got him off.

[00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:35.710]
That's right.

[00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.030]
Two brake stones, but a price that don't brake stones, cottage cheese.

[00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.410]
When the coupon clearly stated.

[00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:47.070]
Well, use the cottage cheese that's grown in your toenails. Now, who's this line?

[00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.670]
Seven and nine.

[00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.470]
Klingon Pinocollary. Hello. I forgot it.

[00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.710]
Three tires.

[00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.430]
No. I got a, okay. I'm not known.

[00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.170]
You know, I got a renegotiator. I hate my contract.

[00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.150]
How about a one minute, huh?

[00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.090]
You can certainly have a three minute. That's right.

[00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.950]
Boyle, come here behind his next.

[00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.390]
George. Bye, bye, bye.

[00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:15.490]
That's beautiful. Yeah, muffled like that. He wants me to renegotiate another like 17,

[00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:21.010]
20 years on my contract so we can feel safe, feel secure. Wait till you hear this.

[00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.550]
All right. I've scrapped it.

[00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.790]
This is good news. Can't, now, let me ask you this. Can we like change our mind?

[00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.250]
Of course. I mean, Florida's primary, luckily, Florida didn't have any impacts.

[00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.870]
They don't play me for the fact that that carries the candidate.

[00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.690]
But how about we go back and start over again? How are jeans started to look like better now?

[00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.610]
Yeah. How are these presidential campaigns still making money?

[00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.430]
So even though we drop down February?

[00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:44.050]
Is it really?

[00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:48.490]
The campaign received 626 grand plus and contributions in March,

[00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:52.170]
according to a filing this week with the FEC's campaign at 2 million in bank

[00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.890]
and owed 1.2 million. So they're doing pretty good.

[00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.210]
They got some big bucks. This is all just, this is what you call,

[00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.410]
we're sucking into bush people.

[00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.170]
Carries just the stump candidate.

[00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.330]
You know, he's a fake candidate and then we're going to pull out the real one again.

[00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.210]
We hope. I mean, isn't it?

[00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.790]
You know, I don't know.

[00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:16.150]
I'm serious. Like, carry to me, everything he's done so far, no matter what the issue is,

[00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:18.470]
he's either the same as bush or even weaker.

[00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.590]
He's not offering any alternative. What is his plan?

[00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.550]
He voted for the Iraq War resolution.

[00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.450]
Unlike, for example,

[00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.890]
Kennedy, well, being was another descendant.

[00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.450]
But I'm just saying, right?

[00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.190]
He voted for unlike Bob Graham, for example, who voted against it.

[00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:41.410]
So if you talk about Iraq, he's got really no real plan on how to get that out.

[00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.110]
No matter what, as far as censorship, freedom of speech,

[00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.370]
here was John Kerry's take on that.

[00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.490]
Howard Stern, he thinks Howard Stern's got a right to do his program however he wants,

[00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.890]
but he also says that Cleared Channel and Fittity have a right not to have him under stations

[00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.830]
if they want. That was his bold statement on censorship and the FCC and all this other crap

[00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.830]
that we're going through right now.

[00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.450]
The marriage, oh, he's for domestic partnerships.

[00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.510]
Any issue that you can find?

[00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.090]
Like, he doesn't want to piss anybody on.

[00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.170]
He gives you that wishy-washy safe answer.

[00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:17.170]
That's John Kerry so far. His campaign, they showed the opponent's president Pennsylvania,

[00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:21.030]
right now, which Pennsylvania ought to be safely in his column. I mean, Gourwant it's easy.

[00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:26.630]
He's down, I think it was like 57, 39 or something like that. He's down big time in Pennsylvania.

[00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:32.550]
So unless all of a sudden he has some kind of a metamorphosis and they like quits stretching

[00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:36.350]
that skin so it's head over his cheekbones, we ain't got a chairman's chance.

[00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.890]
Those of us who would like to say goodbye to the neo-cons, to the fascists.

[00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.710]
Okay, let's get out of this. We've got a very short period of time. Let's get into this heavy duty pool

[00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.990]
because the first one we got up there right now, if you want to vote on it, if you want to sound

[00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.770]
in as they say, you only got to 11 o'clock because right at 11am we're changing, we're doing it.

[00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:59.070]
Are we? We're doing something. Although you never know because the way we started technically,

[00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:02.470]
it's just a well one for me, one for Josh, how George can screw something up?

[00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.570]
All right, I'll save it for a good one.

[00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:09.330]
Should the US reinstate the military draft, that's our first question on neo-ranges.com,

[00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.270]
219 votes? No, don't send our kids to be slaughtered at 122. No, it's fine. A way it is now 45.

[00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:20.850]
Between those two, that's 76.2%. Yes, that'll get young people to vote 27. Yes,

[00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:25.690]
everyone should have to serve 21 and yes, our troops are overstated for only 1.8%

[00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.810]
to be more troops to continue being slaughtered over there in a word that is illegitimate no matter

[00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:35.330]
how you look at it by any account. And Greg Pulasz said, are we a good tape there on Bob Woodward,

[00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:39.250]
too? And I mentioned this today about his Faunting Book Bush at War that he wrote last year.

[00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.950]
So now I guess what Bob Woodward would like to do, he wants to sell that book to the Bush people,

[00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.130]
and then he wants to sell this book for those people who have their doubts. There you go.

[00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.650]
For the anti-bub. He's got something for everybody, Bob Woodward.

[00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.830]
Somebody QA in, hello. I mentioned this today about his Faunting Book Bush. QA in. Hello Neo.

[00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.230]
Yes, sir. I'd like to have your boldly. Please. How about come on, Ileane?

[00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.870]
Come on, Ileane. That's his midnight preview. Okay, thanks.

[00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:10.670]
Yeah, too bad to get that on. That's his midnight duty bags. Right, see what we can say that.

[00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:18.110]
Okay, you got to come on, Ileane. Got it. See, this is why he's guy at the end. He wanted to sneak in a...

[00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.910]
Hi, Ileane! But my fingers too fast for him.

[00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:22.350]
WQA, hello.

[00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.650]
Neo. Yes, sir. How are you?

[00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.850]
Great. I have a question about a room where I've been hearing.

[00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.790]
Yes. I happen to listen to kids when I'm not listening to you.

[00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:36.070]
Yeah. And they have their general manager come on to say that they're going to urban on Monday.

[00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.270]
Yes.

[00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.470]
Kiss is going urban on Monday? Yeah. What?

[00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.630]
I mean, in the country? I guess urban music.

[00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.410]
No, he didn't hear this today, didn't he? Yes, I did.

[00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.790]
Well, the general manager kisses the same as our general manager.

[00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.370]
That would be Greg Reed. Is that what he's not?

[00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.710]
Is that not the other different GM? Yes.

[00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.290]
Oh, who's that? I don't know. Oh, we don't know.

[00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.250]
Well, we'll find out. We'll look into it, Palli. Thank you.

[00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.710]
You bet. Get the message up and down the hallway.

[00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.850]
There are kisses that have changed format. Why would they do that? They'd have good numbers.

[00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:09.250]
They got a license to steal. They got all the those picking audience lined up in the bag.

[00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.770]
Wow. Maybe they're just going to kind of kiss it off.

[00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:17.850]
Dominic QA-M, hello. QA-M? Yeah. Hello.

[00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.950]
What are you on? Yes, you are. You're on, man.

[00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:26.230]
Hey, I forgot feelings. I don't know who sang it, but that was...

[00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.150]
Oh, Morse Albert. Morse Albert in the...

[00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.250]
Morse the cat hates her. Thanks a lot of time. You're right feelings.

[00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.110]
Oh, man. That makes... Oh, brother.

[00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:41.670]
Twist my kiss me when I hear that. Morse Albert. Remember that?

[00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.430]
Oh, brother. Hella hurt. I had a play.

[00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.370]
That could be. That could be the winner, man. He might have had a summer right on it.

[00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:51.850]
We better move this baby along, but I'm telling you, because once we get to the 12 to 12 30 commercial hour,

[00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.270]
man, it's going to be hell on wheels.

[00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.530]
I'm going to be a lion, I'm going to be a lion.

[00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.290]
This is 420 of my city.

[00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.910]
QA-M.

[00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.110]
Then the arrive. Longly $50.

[00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:06.330]
Man!

[00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.450]
Well, thank you, Newman. Thank you, everyone.

[00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.950]
So, see, if the president knows who we call.

[00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:15.830]
Hmm.

[00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.970]
And the only thing that knew was what you see on TV.

[00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.750]
Was reading most instructions for how I got back to the US.

[00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.450]
You should come out and go be more.

[00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.250]
Back to the US.

[00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:31.010]
And...

[00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.190]
Hey, see, I'm a puppy with my SUV.

[00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.270]
It's gone for me to live with the plane.

[00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.950]
I'll make my auto-teachers busy back in B.

[00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.830]
And have the Sony Tesla power that way.

[00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.790]
I'm back in the US, I say it.

[00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.710]
You should come out and go be more.

[00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.490]
Back to the US, I say it.

[00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.790]
Here's the plug, screw, screw, screw.

[00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.310]
Really hard to get out.

[00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.790]
We've got a bit of stuff that can be used.

[00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.790]
But I just, this is a question of dollars.

[00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:07.950]
And hope there's always a lot of money.

[00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.570]
I'm a lot of money.

[00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.150]
I'm happy.

[00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:15.570]
Shows me where they got a lot of food to feed.

[00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.390]
So I hope there's better still a lot of dollars.

[00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.130]
I want to put my face into a table with me.

[00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.190]
It's better to go to sit back.

[00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:26.530]
Now I'm back in the US, I say it.

[00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.590]
You should go out and go be more.

[00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.310]
Back in the US, I say it.

[00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:36.930]
I'm going to get a shoulder gun.

[00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.810]
Now I'm back in the US, I say it.

[00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:43.810]
Three, four, ten bucks, not too much of my time.

[00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.170]
My hands are like a triangle.

[00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:47.050]
I'm going to get a shoulder gun.

[00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.330]
Oh, what a budget.

[00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.290]
1046 at 560, WDQAM, that was great.

[00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:58.770]
But then again, aren't they all?

[00:34:59.330 --> 00:34:59.970]
Well, most of them.

[00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.190]
Dave the cop says, and also, big already,

[00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.210]
wants to be forgiven here.

[00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:04.810]
Correct, but he don't want no draft for this war.

[00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.650]
Well, that's where we are right now, big already,

[00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.910]
saying, and this war ain't going to be in no time soon.

[00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.350]
So I'm glad that Arnie finally came to a senses.

[00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.590]
Dave the cop has redeemed his life.

[00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.950]
He says, this entire talk of the draft is of scene.

[00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.350]
We're going to spend a crapload of kids.

[00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.670]
We're going to send a crapload of kids to their early graves.

[00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.570]
All the name of an expansionist regime

[00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.530]
who is lied repeatedly about why we need to invade a rack

[00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:26.810]
and subsequently got away with it.

[00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.890]
The reason why we main needed draft

[00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.670]
is due to the terrible way the servicemen and women

[00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.990]
have been treated by the administration.

[00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.590]
Nobody in their right mind will re-up after they've been lied

[00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.170]
to since the entire Fiasco began.

[00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.070]
The rich pigs will still get deferments

[00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.430]
to like our VP or jump to the top of list

[00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.210]
in some obscure military post here in the States

[00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.110]
guarding golf courses like Dan Quail.

[00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.250]
National guardsmen should never be mobilized more than six months.

[00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.710]
Since he had many have been gone for close to 18 months.

[00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.570]
Bush has done great by spreading the military so thin.

[00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.290]
I sure as I'll know on my boy fighting for some ass backwards

[00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.050]
Saudi I couldn't give a damn about them.

[00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.270]
Thankfully my family's over in Sweden since day.

[00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.130]
I'm not allowed to let my boy come back in a body bag

[00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.150]
for some at Mid-East.

[00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:03.610]
Crap.

[00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:05.730]
Country, crap country, very well put Dave.

[00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:06.430]
Excellent facts.

[00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.430]
You go boy.

[00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:08.370]
The Sweden.

[00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.750]
Good choices matter fact.

[00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:11.370]
Indeed.

[00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.610]
Because those Mid-East countries who they hold these out

[00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.610]
and if they didn't have oil,

[00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.310]
to me it's the same thing as Florida without sunshine.

[00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.330]
If Florida didn't have the good climate

[00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.510]
how many people would be living there?

[00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:22.890]
Absolutely.

[00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.470]
Right?

[00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:24.630]
By 30 men.

[00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.010]
Right.

[00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.510]
Those didn't mean that they would still be living here.

[00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:27.130]
Well good.

[00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.470]
Let them have a good time.

[00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.050]
Let them go to the casinos.

[00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:33.670]
And the same thing with the Middle East

[00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.930]
if they didn't have oil with anybody

[00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.250]
care about those people over there.

[00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:36.830]
Of course not.

[00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.430]
Who gives a crap except the course

[00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:40.730]
some of the designers to obsess with all that bull crap?

[00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.570]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18 and T

[00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.510]
and for eyes of Marlos Lines.

[00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.990]
The worst hit song top 40 of all time is.

[00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:50.950]
And we'll put that pole up there

[00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.630]
30 and 11 and of course all through tomorrow.

[00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:53.770]
Can you imagine by the weekend

[00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.950]
we'll have thousands of songs on there?

[00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:56.890]
By 30 men.

[00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.130]
Because there's so many bad ones.

[00:36:58.350 --> 00:36:58.590]
Indeed.

[00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.450]
WQM, the famous line nine.

[00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:00.750]
Hello.

[00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.430]
Hey George, this is Neil.

[00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:03.370]
Yes it is.

[00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.530]
Neil, good morning sir.

[00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:05.570]
And back to you.

[00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.150]
Hey listen.

[00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.710]
You know, I always wondered why the Republicans

[00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.670]
were so strong about getting rid of the independent council.

[00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.850]
Now I understand why.

[00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.690]
You know investigations on this administration.

[00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.570]
I only wish that a few Republican moderate,

[00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.870]
Republican congressmen would take those cherry pits they've

[00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:29.950]
got and turn them into some good sized oranges and investigate,

[00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.830]
especially the deal about appropriating money

[00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.210]
that was supposed to go to.

[00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.310]
I'm going to show you the difference

[00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:40.410]
between the steadfastness of the two parties.

[00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.190]
On the one hand you had a presidential of a blue dress

[00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.230]
and we had to go through impeachment hearings on that

[00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.630]
and spend $75 million of taxpayer money

[00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.630]
away two or three years that the Clinton people

[00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.130]
could have been fined in a kill in Osama.

[00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:52.470]
That's on the one hand.

[00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.370]
But now we've got all these things going on now.

[00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.470]
And all we get is the pre-9-11 hearing,

[00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.050]
which is nothing but a bunch of window dressing,

[00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.050]
a dog and pony show.

[00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.330]
And that's basically it for a present and a bunch that

[00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:02.770]
ought to have been impeached a long time ago.

[00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.570]
So that's the difference between the Republicans

[00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.030]
who are militant and hard-ass and the Democrats

[00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.630]
who are basically just went out.

[00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.230]
They gave up.

[00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:12.230]
Well according to Article 9, the Constitution,

[00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.790]
I should say Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution,

[00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.170]
there should be no money from the Treasury.

[00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:21.010]
This should be appropriated unless it's done through Congress.

[00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:21.930]
That's what.

[00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:22.830]

[00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:23.550]
That's a surprise.

[00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.830]
And all we ask are one of the impeachment hearings started.

[00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.290]
Yeah, only which is good.

[00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.010]
Listen, one other thing I wanted to tell you

[00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.150]
is I love the dance and George Bush down here.

[00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.810]
On your website, that is incredible.

[00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:33.730]
It's the best.

[00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:34.810]
Well, we know he did something well.

[00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.330]
Hey, one other thing too is I like to,

[00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.730]
can I make an addition to the poll?

[00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.390]
I mean, about the poll you have for the,

[00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.970]
can we do this draft, especially in the pre-9 poll?

[00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:47.950]
What's the wait for that?

[00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.230]
After, after Bush is fired.

[00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:53.030]
Okay.

[00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:53.970]
Is that possible?

[00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.310]
No, have a great day.

[00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.410]
Having my baby, you may want to turn my house

[00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:59.890]
in an abortion clinic, says, Bob.

[00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:02.790]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.890]
Having my baby, I call Anker to man with a canker.

[00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.650]
Yeah.

[00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.270]
What we see is 11, he's also Canadian.

[00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.190]
He's like Canadian by way of love and honor

[00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.810]
the other way around.

[00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.590]
Something like Jimmy Gilmore in the Sugar Shack

[00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.230]
says your friend Rich Pacta.

[00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.390]
Oh, no.

[00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.390]
I'm getting a canker just from here

[00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:25.270]
the first note to that.

[00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.450]
Holy moly, man.

[00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.030]
In fact, now that you mentioned it,

[00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:30.870]
what are you calling this?

[00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.990]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.310]
Zager and Evans in the year 2525.

[00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:35.390]
Why is that a bad record?

[00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.470]
There's nothing wrong with that.

[00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.550]
Another kind of novelty-ish.

[00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.370]
Yeah, I don't think it's a novelty record at all.

[00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:44.530]
I think it's a good song in the year 2525.

[00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:45.250]
I like it a lot.

[00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:46.970]
I mean, it's a little bit corny.

[00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.150]
Yeah, I think that would be good with that.

[00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:48.690]
It's corny.

[00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.450]
But to say it's the worst top 40 hits song of all time,

[00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.630]
I think his outrageous is what it is.

[00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.650]
Well, Rich Pacta shouldn't be a lot to put too on here.

[00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.170]
I think we out of a congressional investigation,

[00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.150]
he should have quit with Jimmy Gilmore in Sugar Shack.

[00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.190]
We have no problem with that.

[00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.710]
In fact, how about the Archies in Sugar Shiver?

[00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.850]
I like that song.

[00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:04.730]
You do?

[00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.110]
You like the Archies in Sugar Shiver?

[00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:08.090]
Well, with the Archies.

[00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:10.050]
Bob will go and will write your teeth out, man.

[00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:10.770]
You better get with it.

[00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:12.490]
You better be your parody straight new.

[00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.910]
Also, big on jingle jangle.

[00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:15.010]
Jingle bells?

[00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:16.850]
How about jingle balls?

[00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:18.250]
Can't even say that anymore.

[00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.630]
Can't say jingle balls no more.

[00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:20.150]
Am I right?

[00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.610]
You get out of here, Moe.

[00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.870]
And by the way, the word is out on you.

[00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:23.790]
He got lucky yesterday.

[00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:25.150]
You won't get lucky again.

[00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.250]
We're going to have a congressional investigation

[00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.510]
to go back through those tapes.

[00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:31.950]
Should the US re-instate the military draft?

[00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:33.470]
That's our first full question today.

[00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.310]
110 votes?

[00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.850]
That's not too bad in about whatever minutes it was.

[00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.610]
No, don't set our kids to be slaughtered,

[00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.170]
which is obviously the correct answer.

[00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.330]
168, 54.1%.

[00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:44.610]
No, it's fine.

[00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.530]
The weight is now 66, which is OK.

[00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:48.350]
So you got 75.3%.

[00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.350]
Then you got the rest.

[00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.730]
Yes, that'll hit young people to vote.

[00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.210]
36.

[00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:53.710]
Well, I mean, I do understand that.

[00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:54.790]
And of course, I give them that choice.

[00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:57.430]
So, you know, that's kind of come see, come saw.

[00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.230]
Before they send you off to be slaughtered, you can go vote.

[00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:05.030]
Yes, everyone should have to serve 31, which is 10%.

[00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.450]
And yes, our troops are overestated.

[00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:07.650]
9, 2.9%.

[00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:09.630]
So only 12.9% we're here seeing.

[00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:12.370]
We want the draft for like to have more people to go get killed.

[00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.110]
But the way something.

[00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.270]
Yes, I'm throwing away all facts

[00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.530]
is to contain lists of songs.

[00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.330]
Oh, anyways, it affects it more than one.

[00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:21.410]
Maybe two, OK?

[00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:23.770]
What about one?

[00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.990]
What?

[00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.750]
How about one?

[00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:25.890]
I understand.

[00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:26.750]
We want one.

[00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:28.650]
But I mean two, sometimes they have two

[00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:29.770]
that they can't choose between.

[00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.550]
All right, don't be such a hard ass.

[00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.670]
Man, I'm a hard ass and I plan to be.

[00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:35.570]
A hard ass, man.

[00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:38.010]
Oh, there's a bushbot showing Carrie

[00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.790]
with it, the skin streaked over.

[00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.610]
I'm all for Carrie, I hope he wins.

[00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:45.470]
But I also hope he grows into her sometime between now

[00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.890]
in November.

[00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.210]
He's got to start pushing up a little bit.

[00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.490]
Not just under like Bush Jr.

[00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:52.130]
Give us a choice.

[00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.890]
Give us something that we can latch onto.

[00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.930]
Like how our dean did.

[00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.410]
We all how our dean and apology.

[00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.770]
I'm one of the biggest.

[00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:01.370]
And you two, you held on to about two, three days

[00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.450]
longer than I did.

[00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.450]
I never stopped liking it.

[00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.430]
But I had to agree that he didn't have a chance.

[00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:08.450]
No, no, that's not where you go now.

[00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.870]
That's it.

[00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.630]
Well, see, we got sucked into that.

[00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.690]
That's what they convinced us that he had no chance.

[00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.670]
Like you said, somebody somewhere decided

[00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:16.810]
that some group of people somewhere

[00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.810]
decided that how our dean was dangerous,

[00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.350]
that he was too much anti-establishment.

[00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.450]
See, they're always talking about a washing outside

[00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.090]
or an outside.

[00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.810]
Well, that's not really what it is,

[00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.930]
but he's just not partly establishment.

[00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.430]
Right.

[00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.490]
Carrie certainly is.

[00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.230]
And as a result, they decided, well, guess what?

[00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.270]
We're going to do everything we can.

[00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.410]
And if you look like an ass, can put you on a spot,

[00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.830]
can I do an, of course, ABC, they did all of the damage,

[00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.410]
them and all the other, that we're showing a clip

[00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.450]
about four million times.

[00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:47.550]
Then they show a couple of times.

[00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.750]
Well, actually, if you listen to the crowd noise,

[00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.570]
the only reason he was screaming so loud is because,

[00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.790]
because they just, they took their clips from a,

[00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.870]
from a directional microphone that you couldn't hear

[00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:57.570]
to crowd in the back.

[00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.410]
But if you heard the overall, if you want to stage,

[00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.710]
quite a many people who were there in that auditorium,

[00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.610]
you could, the crowd was so loud and going wild,

[00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:07.130]
that he had to be doing that to try to scream over the crowd,

[00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.350]
which was fine.

[00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:10.610]
But they made him look like a loose cannon,

[00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:12.630]
like a lunatic, and, of course, even before that,

[00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.950]
they had to talk about, well, he's temperamental,

[00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.610]
he's just an ad, he's out of control.

[00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.470]
And then the real peace they resistance,

[00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.470]
the real frosting on the cape, was shown as his wife.

[00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.590]
Oh, bad move, Howard.

[00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:25.670]
Bad move.

[00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.570]
Should've got a stunt light.

[00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:28.530]
Oh, my God.

[00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.730]
Although, I will say this, I was thinking about this yesterday,

[00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.110]
which shows you how full my life is.

[00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.930]
I was thinking about how, no, listen,

[00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.490]
why this is the first lady has to be beautiful,

[00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:39.630]
other than Jackie Kennedy.

[00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:41.150]
Can you name me an even attractive,

[00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:43.090]
even even Laura Borscher, I would say,

[00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:45.650]
she ain't no beauty, but she's not bad looking.

[00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.790]
You know, she's okay, especially for a vozel like him.

[00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.570]
But other than that, I mean, you got Hillary,

[00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.310]
the ice princess, grotesque, right?

[00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.510]
I didn't think Jackie was all that,

[00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.330]
but everything relatively,

[00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.850]
at least wait till we get to the other ones, okay?

[00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:56.630]
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

[00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.930]
Then you had Pat Nixon who looked more macho than he did.

[00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.010]
Stone face pat, Barbara Bush.

[00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:03.390]
Yeah, you had Mamie Eisenhower.

[00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:04.070]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:05.010]
Best Truman.

[00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.210]
Wow, Lady Bird Johnson.

[00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:09.090]
Woo!

[00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:11.350]
Holy cow, Rosalind Carter.

[00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:12.950]
Yeah, I know.

[00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.470]
Nancy Reagan, don't step on her now.

[00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.230]
You might mess up that red dress.

[00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.630]
And the ultimate beautiful wife, Eleanor Roosevelt.

[00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.470]
Why?

[00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:23.610]
Old donkey face.

[00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:25.890]
Is that incredible or what?

[00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.610]
Yeah, so you're right.

[00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.830]
So the idea that we have to have a beautiful first lady.

[00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.310]
I mean, we haven't had too many of those.

[00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:31.510]
I never seem to make a difference.

[00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:34.430]
In fact, Roosevelt was married to that ugly bitch for all,

[00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:35.190]
held up a long time.

[00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.410]
What?

[00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:37.850]
Yeah, last time I checked,

[00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.310]
they're not the ones running for office.

[00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:40.410]
No, no, listen to me.

[00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.750]
Right.

[00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:42.330]
And he got elected four times.

[00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:42.990]
Right.

[00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.730]
So the public didn't care that he had a nasty,

[00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.510]
bull-like, ugly, looking wife.

[00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:47.870]
Didn't care about that.

[00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:49.230]
They just cared that he was a great leader.

[00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.210]
And was a great, you know, had that long cigarette holder.

[00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:55.370]
You know, he just, even the fact that he was in the wheelchair

[00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.570]
seemed to have, even though most people didn't know that until very late in the game.

[00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.370]
Because they used to prop him up.

[00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:03.010]
He would stand up to put him, they realized that he was a handicap.

[00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.950]
A crypt.

[00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.690]
But in any way, even though when you see those pictures,

[00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.770]
he's got the long cigarette holder, very fashionable.

[00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.130]
He just, he looked like a president.

[00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.910]
Woodrow Wilson looked like a president.

[00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:17.230]
What we got now, looks like Vosomand,

[00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.750]
with all due apologies to all clowns, all places.

[00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.870]
10.56 at 5.60 QN, Marlon Pregame, Marlon Zenefili's man,

[00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.050]
he keeps him as last night took for ovens 8 to 7.

[00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:27.770]
Three home runs by Michael Oler.

[00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:28.710]
How does it pistol again?

[00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.710]
Game time, 105, Pregame 12.

[00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.710]
This is my end local.

[00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.630]
I'm your sports radio, 5.60 QN, QAM.

[00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:39.910]
The crap you can unwrap.

[00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.590]
All the slime, all the time.

[00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:53.430]
Everybody's going back to see Mill's movie now.

[00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.650]
Now's it, movie about the first of fiction.

[00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:00.230]
Just get past the violence, the movie's from back now.

[00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:04.130]
Then he's gone, seen the first of fiction.

[00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:07.410]
It's all not even though it's only fair.

[00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.250]
Making this movie was not just too fair.

[00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.790]
So come on, come on, boss.

[00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.070]
All the bad mood songs all the time.

[00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.770]
That's a good one though.

[00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:20.670]
We love Locomotion.

[00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.790]
Anybody heard it for that man?

[00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.450]
We'd come and give him what for?

[00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:26.150]
Yeah, nobody, nobody don't like that song.

[00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.670]
No matter who, which version they like.

[00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.690]
But anyway, here's the fact this is the absolute worst ever.

[00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:34.910]
The Serfen bird by the cramps.

[00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.890]
Why did the cramps, the trash man?

[00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:39.510]
Right, the Serfen bird.

[00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.750]
You turd.

[00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:42.370]
You turd.

[00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.870]
Anyway, can you just remember those inspiring lyrics?

[00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:47.250]
Yeah, I can.

[00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.190]
Everybody's heard about the bird.

[00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:50.110]
It goes on and on and on.

[00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:51.030]
That's what it's very like.

[00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:52.870]
We miss the bird.

[00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:54.670]
Anyway, it's a divorced Serfen bird.

[00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:55.630]
Okay, we got to get out of there.

[00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:55.950]
I'm sure.

[00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:57.110]
I sure hope Josh is right.

[00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.490]
He's all on there because you're going to have to see it.

[00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:01.070]
Any minute, this is going to be a work of a labor of love.

[00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.530]
I'm sure.

[00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:04.330]
Heracle teacher about those labor of love.

[00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:09.530]
Anyway, should the US weekend, the Schmidt can at the first poll, Eric.

[00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.350]
Get that second one up there so we can get heavy duty with him.

[00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:14.550]
We can dive ahead along because we really have 58 minutes left.

[00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.350]
The noon to 1230 hours is commercials.

[00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:17.970]
I mean, I'm not going to lie about it, right?

[00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:19.330]
They would like me to lie.

[00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.990]
I just, I mean, I can lie about things that are worth lying about, but the same one of them.

[00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:27.050]
We just have a lot of spots that we're going to get in because we're a bunch of grave robbers.

[00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.370]
We don't care so much about entertainment.

[00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:31.090]
We certainly don't care about this show because it is not new with sports.

[00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.830]
So, you know, the 1230 hour we got out of spots.

[00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:35.730]
And then we'll like whistle of tune or something in between.

[00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:36.750]
Right?

[00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.170]
We want them to go battle to it.

[00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:46.750]
Should the US reinstate the military draft, that was our poll question this first hour because crazy people like Ty Cagolor said,

[00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:50.050]
oh, yeah, we need the draft so that everybody can serve and write.

[00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:54.290]
So we can send a bunch of people off to be slaughtered, mostly young people,

[00:47:54.330 --> 00:48:05.010]
but regardless, human beings who deserve a better fate to be slaughtered for another president who's inventing another war based on a rival lies in a bunch of oil and a bunch of big business interests.

[00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.670]
You ever notice how the biggest courts are well, most of not all of them.

[00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:10.990]
I mean, Nixon wasn't from Texas. He was from California.

[00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:16.830]
But they did like Johnson, the bushes from Texas, at least this bushes from Texas.

[00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:19.490]
The other one's from my work, Connecticut, something like that.

[00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.410]
Whatever it really was, from Hungary.

[00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:26.450]
And then of course, we got the Jemster, well, be sure and watch the name of the book.

[00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:27.830]
I Schmidt, Ken Neuiden.

[00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:34.470]
The best democracy money can buy Greg Polas that he's updating with the new version coming out April 26, which is just four days.

[00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.210]
Let's see, third on Monday.

[00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:40.150]
The best democracy money can buy Greg Polas, P-A-L-A-S-T.

[00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:47.010]
And if you go on that website and you see the piece about the Jeff Bush and Catherine Harris and the senior of the 2000 election,

[00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:52.470]
and this chiseling that they hired to cook the books on the voting of roles.

[00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.090]
In fact, he went to interview Greg Polas, was he interview the guy?

[00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:56.230]
Yeah.

[00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:58.510]
It said, you mean they paid you a million dollars to do this?

[00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.450]
And you just, I'm not even really checking these names to see if they were valid.

[00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:07.510]
And the guy took off the microphone he had on his, and he just got up and walked away.

[00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:08.730]
He pulled a truck hastin.

[00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:14.750]
He just walked away from Greg Polas, and he kept trying to follow him and then finally he sent the security guards out and I was in that interview.

[00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:18.210]
Didn't come back when push come to shove about them.

[00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:23.610]
Thousands and thousands and thousands of voters whose names were exposed illegally and incorrectly off the voter rolls.

[00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:27.670]
So you dark folks in Florida most of you couldn't vote because they know you're going to vote Democrat.

[00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.250]
And of course, they'd go on the election.

[00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.710]
There is no doubt about that, no more.

[00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:37.930]
Now in a real country where the people are educated, where they really care about something, where they really care enough to send their very best,

[00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:40.990]
there would have been like the public would never set still for it.

[00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:44.970]
There'd have been like a mini revolution, maybe a major revolution, not in the USA, though.

[00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.010]
Anyway, should the US reinstate the military draft?

[00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:53.270]
No, don't send their kids to be slaughtered 190, 54%.

[00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:57.170]
No, it's fine the way it is now, 76, 21 and a half percent.

[00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.710]
Yes, everyone should have to serve 39.

[00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:01.750]
Yes, that'll hit young people to vote 39.

[00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:03.550]
And yes, our troop server stated 9.

[00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.850]
So you've got 24 and a half percent of those people who are ampulled.

[00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:10.850]
Popcorn, so he says, I don't know who did it, hot butter.

[00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:13.050]
And you're right, that's your just writing, I'm sure.

[00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:13.570]
Yes.

[00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:15.170]
Hot butter did popcorn.

[00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:38.570]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:38.570]

[00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:38.570]

[00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:38.570]

[00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:38.570]

[00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:38.890]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:39.250]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.410]

[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.410]

[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.410]

[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.410]

[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.410]

[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.410]

[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.410]

[00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.810]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:39.810]

[00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:40.130]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.730]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.730]

[00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.650]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.030]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:45.150]
That's what that's all about.

[00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.550]
Yeah.

[00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:47.290]
These pieces.

[00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:53.370]
See, I don't understand just like also if you look on the original list here by Maxim Many Pads or whatever that is.

[00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:57.490]
Sound of Silence is number 42 is the worst song of all time.

[00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.610]
I take great exception of that, sir.

[00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.410]
Man, whoever you are.

[00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:06.690]
Anyway, this Scarborough lyrics is, makes me want to pierce my eardrums with an ice pick.

[00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.370]
Well, I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun.

[00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.610]
It says, if Rick and Sons were still on here, could they say, but load anymore?

[00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:14.110]
Very good question, Bob.

[00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:15.110]
It's true, but facts.

[00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:17.150]
Could they say but load?

[00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.530]
We'll probably have to send that to committee.

[00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:23.610]
We'll probably have to set it up to Michael Powell and he can check out his but load.

[00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:27.650]
And if you look at that picture on our website, that's one heavy load.

[00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:29.330]
He's carrying it around that old Mikey Powell.

[00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:30.090]
That's a wide load.

[00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:31.770]
Yeah, he's carrying a heavy load.

[00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:33.430]
Let's see.

[00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.690]
I will always love you by Whitney Houston says Jim.

[00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:39.010]
Those screening bits that were 100 times more offensive than fart sounds.

[00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:40.430]
They made Howard Dean sound like an amateur.

[00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:44.750]
Also, the bodyguard movie where it came from was awful just just for the frosting on a cake.

[00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:47.490]
I will always love you by Whitney Houston, the wailer.

[00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.010]
She should have played hockey man with a heart-for-dwailers.

[00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:52.650]
She was a shwire, a screamer and still is.

[00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.590]
Whitney Houston.

[00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:56.050]
That's what Bobby Brown says.

[00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.450]
She screams as loud as any bitch he ever slapped up.

[00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:00.650]
Huh?

[00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.270]
Yeah.

[00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:03.010]
Remember, Christy White.

[00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:04.290]
She's got a lot of practice.

[00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.890]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pounds, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:09.710]
Here we go.

[00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:11.870]
How do I, I'm just going to get started.

[00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:12.970]
I'm just going to vote for one.

[00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:16.730]
Because I have to have a my baby, I don't know, Paul Anker.

[00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:17.830]
I don't know.

[00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:19.010]
He never still were afraid for him.

[00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:20.370]
Seasons of this is tough.

[00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.850]
This could be the toughest pool we've ever done in the show.

[00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:23.890]
But you know something?

[00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:24.890]
I just clicked my vote.

[00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.550]
You know what it was for?

[00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:29.510]
I voted for Abinnie and I voted for feeling.

[00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.010]
Oh man, I'm so glad that somebody called that and Morse Albert.

[00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:34.970]
That old brother.

[00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.530]
Top Morse in the microwave, along with Albert DeKat.

[00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:38.390]
Or was it Morse DeKat?

[00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:40.010]
Remember Morse DeKat?

[00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.370]
Sure.

[00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.350]
Little unknown fact, little piece of trivia for you.

[00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.830]
When Morse DeKat got to be in his very, very ancient last years,

[00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:48.390]
a good friend, Larry Box.

[00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:49.570]
Box.

[00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.070]
Remember Larry Box called a couple of times?

[00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.670]
Yeah.

[00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:53.950]
He had Morse DeKat.

[00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:57.250]
As a pet, in fact, I think I saw Morse DeKat in his house a couple of times.

[00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.370]
Really?

[00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.930]
And he liked that.

[00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:00.230]
See, you met Morse DeKat?

[00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:00.630]
Wow.

[00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:04.190]
And Algarantia was the only f*** he ever had in his house.

[00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.630]
It's a brush with greatness.

[00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:06.810]
5, 6, 7.

[00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:07.730]
Yeah, Morse DeKat.

[00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.690]
Nice to meet, Odee.

[00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:10.970]
We want to go near that thing, man.

[00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:11.230]
Ah!

[00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:12.510]
Like that kind of like our audience.

[00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:15.110]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:17.510]
QAM.

[00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:21.590]
Even the cats in South Florida, anti-social.

[00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:22.590]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:24.050]
You're getting taught to us.

[00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:25.350]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:27.230]
Yeah, be good.

[00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:28.310]
You light up my light.

[00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:29.890]
I think we got it on there.

[00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:30.590]
But thank you, Virgo.

[00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:31.410]
It's on there.

[00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.650]
Somebody thanks that in yesterday in advance of this.

[00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.070]
They're going to be five G'day into these on there, you know?

[00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.870]
They'll make you eight.

[00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:38.250]
Take that.

[00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.110]
And now, what about more and more and more?

[00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:42.990]
Let's have.

[00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:44.810]
And we'll do more and more with you on there.

[00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:45.950]
Oh my God.

[00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:47.050]
Oh my God.

[00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:47.710]
How about you?

[00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.470]
How about you?

[00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:49.870]
Less, less, less.

[00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:50.650]
Exactly.

[00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.410]
Good one.

[00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.890]
Thanks, Valley.

[00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.350]
Thanks.

[00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:53.890]
Later on.

[00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:57.290]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.

[00:53:57.590 --> 00:53:59.870]
So many bad songs in so little time.

[00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.650]
We have an extended for like the next two and a half years, I'm thinking.

[00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:06.970]
See, I'm also thinking since a month once, it's been so bad.

[00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:10.630]
I just thought it was a little extension on that contract because he realizes that once I go,

[00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:12.190]
it's by, duff, by, by.

[00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:17.550]
You know, I mean, nobody else, the no sports guy, and is going to need his own program director to monitor his show.

[00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:22.670]
So I'm thinking, and of course, you need something to keep going.

[00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:24.890]
So I'm thinking, why don't we start like tomorrow?

[00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.270]
You know how I do in July and August like two days a week?

[00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.650]
Right.

[00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:33.070]
I'm thinking, some months a year, I'll do like three days and then other months I'll just do the two days.

[00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:33.550]
Okay.

[00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.690]
And you'll do the rest.

[00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:34.970]
Right.

[00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:36.130]
You can just the private.

[00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:38.310]
And we'll do, kind of, yeah, that's right.

[00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.470]
Something's some days you'll just have to find out in the morning.

[00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:42.010]
If I'm here fine, if not, I'm sleeping.

[00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:45.270]
And we'll just mix and match it.

[00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:46.310]
Just the salary accordingly.

[00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:47.570]
You'll goose you up a little bit.

[00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:49.490]
Maybe you're like 15, 20 bucks a week.

[00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:50.070]
Sure.

[00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.710]
I'll take a good, and then we can even take it off of my paycheck.

[00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:53.310]
I like that.

[00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.930]
I'm, you know, me.

[00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:54.570]
I'm a big spender.

[00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:55.610]
15, 20 bucks a week.

[00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:56.870]
I can handle it.

[00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.330]
And I think that's a red, I did extend it a couple of years.

[00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:01.350]
What do you think?

[00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.410]
Starting, of course, it would have to start right now though.

[00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.110]
Right.

[00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:06.690]
So let's see, you be working tomorrow.

[00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:12.450]
And Monday, well, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60.

[00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:15.230]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:16.150]
WQA, and hello.

[00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:17.730]
Hello, I'm just cherished.

[00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:18.270]
Is this...

[00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:19.150]
Cherished by it now.

[00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:20.310]
I'm cherished by the association.

[00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:21.170]
Yes, exactly.

[00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:22.390]
Okay, it's syrupy.

[00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.730]
Thank you.

[00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:23.330]
Oh, man.

[00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:25.350]
Oh, oh.

[00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:27.470]
This is a great topic.

[00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:32.430]
And again, I want to thank my friends at the Maxim magazine, a MaxiPads, whatever that is.

[00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:33.130]
What is it, Maxim?

[00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.390]
What?

[00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.630]
Blender.

[00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:36.070]
I know it.

[00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:37.490]
I'm just testing your knowledge.

[00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:39.830]
Maxim Blender.

[00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:44.310]
Oh, and speaking of the blender, this story I can't even see an M was grabbing on to.

[00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:45.110]
What's on their website?

[00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:51.510]
Just for those of us who are looking for sympathy for our addictions, and those of us who don't run around say,

[00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:53.570]
well, AA, and I'd build a...

[00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:56.110]
What was his name, the guy from AA, that they wanted to put on a pool?

[00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:56.910]
Oh, man.

[00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:57.930]
Yeah, like I remember.

[00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.910]
Yeah, Bill Shminder, whatever his name was.

[00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:05.050]
People who say they were addicted to chocolate or pizza may not be exaggerating.

[00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:08.770]
US-based scientists finally said Tuesday, finally getting around to saying,

[00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:09.590]
hey, guess what?

[00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:11.150]
That fat figure in Miami is right.

[00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:12.190]
Yeah, I heard that story.

[00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:12.950]
Yeah.

[00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:14.550]
Me too, and guess what?

[00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:15.450]
I ain't no van leader.

[00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:21.490]
A brain scan study of normal hungry people showed their brains lit up when they saw and smelled their favorite food.

[00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:25.430]
And much the same way as the brains of cocaine, that is when they think about their next snort.

[00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:26.310]
How do you like that?

[00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.250]
Is it having a rich snorting good time?

[00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:31.830]
Like our speaking of El Presidente.

[00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:34.110]
What?

[00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:36.410]
He's a rich snorting good guy.

[00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:37.450]
I mean, good old cowboy.

[00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:38.350]
Because it's true.

[00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:39.770]
We're going to take him dead or alive.

[00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:41.350]
Okay, we're going to send the Paseas.

[00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.810]
We're going to smoke them steaks out of their holes.

[00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:50.590]
Food presentations significantly increase metabolism in the whole brain by 24%

[00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:58.190]
and these changes were larger than superior temporal, anterior, insula, and all but all but all but all frontal and all cortices they wrote.

[00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:00.130]
Including Josh Cortes.

[00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:01.670]
Cortices?

[00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:03.870]
Old widow frontal cortices.

[00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:06.130]
Well, that's the Cortes family, the Cortises.

[00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:10.090]
These areas are associated with addiction and estimated 30%.

[00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:11.110]
About 30, man.

[00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:14.510]
Other Americans are obese meaning they have a body mass index of more than...

[00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:15.430]
About 30, man.

[00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:19.590]
This ratio of height to weight usually works out to be, to being about...

[00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:20.670]
About 30, man.

[00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:24.270]
It pounds overweight for a woman and 35 to 40 pounds overweight for a man.

[00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:25.490]
How do you like this?

[00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:27.770]
This is...

[00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.070]
The guy's name was Wang.

[00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:30.010]
Is that what his name was?

[00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:31.350]
Where did it kind of say Wang?

[00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:32.630]
You can't say that.

[00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:34.710]
No, no, seriously.

[00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:36.850]
I'm looking for where it says earlier in the...

[00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:39.690]
It doesn't even mention his name and then all of a sudden it just comes up with Wang.

[00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:44.690]
Wang and colleagues studied 12 men and women with an average of 28 age.

[00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:47.870]
The volunteers fasted for just under a day then underwent...

[00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:52.070]
Tows of trony emission teleographer, your pet scans, which measured brain metabolism.

[00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:53.810]
I don't think we can say emission anymore.

[00:57:54.050 --> 00:57:58.510]
They were asked to describe their favorite foods and how they like to eat them while they were presented with some of those foods.

[00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:02.970]
A cotton swab and prey data with the food was placed in their tongue so they could taste it.

[00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:03.690]
The researchers wrote,

[00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:08.090]
The favorite items most frequently selected by the subjects were...

[00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:08.390]
Pizza?

[00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:10.430]
Bacon and cheese sandwich.

[00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:11.090]
Oh.

[00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:12.290]
Cinnamon bun.

[00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:13.470]
Oh, I love that cinnamon bun.

[00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:14.410]
Just a smell.

[00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:16.150]
I just hang out there in the airport and just...

[00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:18.990]
Pizza, hamburger with cheese.

[00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:20.010]
That's called cheeseburger.

[00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:20.950]
Fried chicken.

[00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:21.970]
Lasagna.

[00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:23.210]
What's this hamburger with cheese?

[00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:23.690]
Cheese.

[00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:24.730]
Fried chicken.

[00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:27.410]
Lasagna, barbecue, ice cream, brownie and chocolate cake.

[00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:30.730]
They didn't tell us whether or not those were the brownie hounds, ones like the brownies event.

[00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:33.550]
11, 13, and 5, 60, WQM.

[00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:35.310]
We got the big Marlon pregame show at 12, 30.

[00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:37.150]
I can smell another world championship in Miami.

[00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:38.310]
Let's go down the stadium.

[00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:38.770]
What do you say?

[00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.890]
No.

[00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:44.750]

1119. That's one. I don't know how you say that but crash test. That means that's one of the ones that's on the worst 50 of all time on this other list.

[01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:27.370]
From macro blender, whatever that is.

Let's see. Well, I guess you know, here's a good one. She bangs Ricky Martin. Oh man.

[01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:55.370]
I should have. I should have. I got that. Well, talk about fiction. She bangs by Ricky Martin.

[01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:48.410]
I'm sorry, Jackson. The surf and bird three. See the surf and birds in novelty song. It's not defending it.

[01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:52.710]
It is horrendous. What's the other one like that? Papa Uma Ma. Why the living didn't surf?

[01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:58.350]
Do we want to put that on there? No. Why not? Papa Uma Ma.

[01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:04.770]
Because it's not so much. It's close enough. Well, if the surf and birder can be on there,

[01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:12.610]
how about Papa Uma Ma. Mr. I wanted on there. I will always love you. The anxious Whitney Houston three party all the time.

[01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:19.810]
Three scrubber affair. Two. I don't get it. I guess our crowd don't like syrupy songs, but I mean in your 25.

[01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:24.330]
25's got one American life one, cherish one and only for a whole bunch of other ones.

[01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:32.250]
Let's see. Tucker says it really comes down to a coin flip between two who left the dogs out the bar.

[01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:39.830]
Amen. Grotesque. Who who and he just makes me ill or of course. Let me see if I can find it. I give you a little.

[01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:48.430]
That's enough. The Macarena not only to wear a song, but overplayed the point of just you had the Macarena come out of your ass.

[01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:52.350]
It was just the grotesque can't decide which one or both show up. Please put them on there.

[01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:59.070]
So we're getting both on there. The Macarena and was the other one who let the dogs out.

[01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:06.290]
Who who every time I hear that song, I think of what's his name? The mad dog. No, not the mad dog with a little dog.

[01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:12.490]
Not the what's his name? Arsenio Hall. Oh, with a hoot. With that hoot and crab. He should have been a hoot and Annie.

[01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:19.810]
Anyway, here's one that says without a doubt. There's so many good ones. This is this like I said, this may be the most difficult poll in history.

[01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:30.750]
Taya yellow ribbon round the old oak tree Tony Orlando and Dawn. My God. Talk about puke inducing man or man. That is a good one.

Hi, I'm calling. I just said you guys a fact. Yes. It's the one about the news reports on the US planning WMDs in Iraq.

[01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:55.110]
We had that today's ago. You had that day ago? Uh-huh. Okay. I just I just know what you got. I just want to make sure you got it.

[01:04:55.210 --> 01:05:02.870]
Okay. Thanks a lot. Yeah. We're we're in fact. Remember I said let's save these. We have two of those stories about the planning WMDs for that October surprise.

[01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:10.390]
Yeah. Guess what? We just found them. We had both of stories. They were both on our website too. It was to be good to the archives and you're curious.

[01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:17.310]
So you'll find a monitor. I am curious yellow ribbon around an old oak tree. 5 6705 60 don't fax that to me by the way we have the story.

[01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:07.930]
All on old Eddie Belford man. He should have been on that pull the other day.

[01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:14.510]
Tommy Tammelon is just one of the greatest goals in NHL history. Okay. Calm down Joe. 5 670.

I think 60. Tom 560. See at least one thing man. They're enthusiastic here about something.

[01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:24.550]
They may be hockey. Yeah. But at least it's something right besides early bird dinners.

[01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:29.310]
If you had to choose between people who enthusiastic about hockey or early bird dinners.

[01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:37.370]
I don't think it's too much of a choice. Or of course, Ilya. Ilya. I wonder if the Aboiles are still checking out his parts.

[01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:31.290]
I'm going to take it into the ball game.

[01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:33.350]
Just we play weapons of mass destruction, St.

[01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:33.490]
Sainzhan.

[01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:34.610]
I know that.

[01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:35.790]
But that's great.

[01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:36.670]
That's not the air world.

[01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:39.750]
And that one's not the pressing world really is.

[01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:41.870]
That's just bozo-stooled election.

[01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:43.770]
All those people are dying over there based on nothing.

[01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:47.690]
And let me say one other thing too, because one, every time there's another grotesque thing

[01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:49.430]
like the car bombs yesterday in Basra.

[01:07:49.850 --> 01:07:50.950]
Oh, well, it's Al Qaeda.

[01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:52.330]
We're not really sure if we think it's Al Qaeda.

[01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:54.830]
Al Qaeda wasn't blowing anybody up in Iraq before.

[01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:57.550]
We did them the wonderful job of going in there and killing all of them people.

[01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:01.510]
So even though Iraq wasn't a hotbed of terrorism before,

[01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.510]
a year ago, March, all of a sudden it is.

[01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:04.090]
So you're welcome.

[01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:05.750]
How do you Iraqi people?

[01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:07.190]
The ones who are still alive.

[01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.710]
You're welcome.

[01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:12.770]
So we couldn't prove that it was a hotbed for Al Qaeda and other terrorists before.

[01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:17.790]
In addition to which one point that was brought on in this counter-spin show that I have to mention right now last night on CBCA,

[01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:22.630]
was the fact that, and remember a few months ago they kept telling us,

[01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:26.350]
oh, Al Qaeda has been disemboweled and they're just a shadow of what they were.

[01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:29.190]
They don't, you know, they still got a Sama and a Mullah Bula,

[01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.670]
but other than that, the organization has basically finished.

[01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:32.530]
Look, that's what.

[01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:34.590]
Thanks to the Iraq attack,

[01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:37.230]
other organization terrorist groups around the world,

[01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:39.410]
which previously had been like competitors where, you know,

[01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:40.530]
they're all got their own thing.

[01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:42.750]
Now they're joining forces with Al Qaeda,

[01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:46.410]
and Al Qaeda is supposed to just be in Afghanistan in certain parts of the Middle East,

[01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:48.150]
generally speaking in a few cells elsewhere.

[01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:49.870]
Now they're worldwide, baby,

[01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:54.010]
with a cooperation of every nutcase terrorist group in the world.

[01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:55.190]
It's a nice going, W.

[01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:58.370]
So this crap about how much safer we are in other than we were before,

[01:08:58.850 --> 01:08:59.030]
right?

[01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:00.190]
Only a moron.

[01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:01.990]
Moron, believe that.

[01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:05.730]
And we obviously got about 50% of the country were a bunch of morons.

[01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:09.650]
27 after 11 at 5, 60 W.

[01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:09.890]
Q.

[01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:11.390]
Even hear me talk about Dalmatian,

[01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:12.950]
their spectacular customer service,

[01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.550]
that when you call 1-800-Matris,

[01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.190]
you'll speak with an expert vet and consult her,

[01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.290]
answer all your questions,

[01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:19.690]
and give you the customer service you deserve and want.

[01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:22.670]
The Dalmatian's commitment to service recently caught the attention

[01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:23.830]
to the better business bureau.

[01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:26.890]
Dalmatians has been part of the South-Order community for over 12 years,

[01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:28.110]
with their main office in the Northeast.

[01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.850]
They've earned a coveted torch of excellence award for 2004

[01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:32.590]
from the Boston Better Business Bureau.

[01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:36.950]
This award is given annually to a company that embodies the Better Business Bureau's values of honesty,

[01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.170]
integrity, and ethics in a marketplace.

[01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:42.870]
To receive this award is especially impressive for Dalmatians because, guess what,

[01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:44.170]
they don't even have any stores.

[01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:48.490]
And 1-800-Matris wants you to know that one criterion judging this award was truth

[01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:50.950]
in advertising, no BS, no lies.

[01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:53.950]
You can rest assured that everything I've been telling you about Dalmatians is absolutely...

[01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:57.150]
...100%!

[01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:59.570]
So pick up the folder right now, like I've been doing for years,

[01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:00.850]
when the old mattress is worn out,

[01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:03.810]

[01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:05.870]
with a fantastic deal on name brand vetting.

[01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:08.950]
If you call 1-800-Matris, you'll be just as satisfied as me

[01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:11.250]
and George and everybody else has been using for a long time.

[01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:14.570]
Call them today, 1-800-Matris-MAT-T-R-E-S,

[01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.570]
or log onto their website, mattress.com.

[01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:19.710]
Dalmatians, the honest, smart way to get you a great night's sleep

[01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.050]
for a coons' age to come.

[01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:25.550]
And you'll be just 4-3-0 by 6-1.

[01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:27.070]
Oh, yeah.

[01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:32.670]
I got your breasts, our beautiful night on the 9 o'clock movie

[01:10:32.670 --> 01:10:34.710]
with a defenseless, get big darn.

[01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:36.150]
Hey, come on, stop that!

[01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.930]
Leave me alone!

[01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:39.070]
When the weak become victimized.

[01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:41.370]
Oh, sure, fine. Take my parking spot.

[01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:43.670]
I wasn't just waiting here for it or anything.

[01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:44.690]
Don't run ahead.

[01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:46.950]
And when old ladies attack.

[01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:48.730]
Out of the way you little grunt.

[01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:51.010]
Ah, stop hitting me with your motorbike.

[01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:52.490]
We'll cheer you old back.

[01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:53.130]
That hurts.

[01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:55.790]
It's a attack of the blue hairs.

[01:10:56.230 --> 01:10:57.550]
Oh, my snowmaring else!

[01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:58.430]
And stop whining.

[01:10:58.730 --> 01:10:59.870]
Shut my pain.

[01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:01.070]
Who far up here?

[01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.890]
Without warning.

[01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:02.910]
Without fear.

[01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:04.810]
And they can strike at any time.

[01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:08.230]
A attack of the blue hairs tonight at 9 o'clock.

[01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:11.010]
It's all of the 32 or 560,

[01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:12.330]
W. Who haven't said this, facts?

[01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.990]
Who would have guessed draft talk on the near-rounder show?

[01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.470]
What does that mean?

[01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:17.210]
Get it, we're talking about the draft.

[01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:22.350]
They talk about the drafts on other shows on the station.

[01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.950]
We never do.

[01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:23.490]
Get it?

[01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:24.150]
R-R?

[01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:25.070]
No, I'm good.

[01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:26.790]
The full question is this slam dunk.

[01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:28.990]
The most annoying song ever was Bobbie and Corozaunner.

[01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.770]
Don't worry, be happy.

[01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:33.030]
Remember back in the late 80s when Channel 6 and 7 made the big switch to them.

[01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:33.750]
So yes it was.

[01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:38.170]
Just wondering, would the FCC allow you to refer to the right-wing Bible Thumpers

[01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:40.370]
as Sunday Mass Holes?

[01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:41.090]
I like that.

[01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:41.750]
Mass Holes?

[01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:42.930]
That's the best.

[01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:44.650]
That is the best of all time.

[01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:45.350]
Thank you so much.

[01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:47.570]
This was a marginal facet until we got to the last line.

[01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:49.090]
And you redeemed yourself big time.

[01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:50.270]
You got redemption, man.

[01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:51.730]
There are much of Mass Holes.

[01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:53.170]
Oh, that is sensational.

[01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:54.170]
Oh, yeah.

[01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:56.410]
It's got to roll off your tongue there like a wafer.

[01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:57.150]
Right.

[01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:59.010]
That is so much better than ant Holes.

[01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:00.530]
That is beautiful.

[01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:04.590]
During the day, the springs never heard of this bled or magazine that's got the tough 50.

[01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:06.670]
We're song 7 and Garfun with Sounds of Silence is great.

[01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:07.550]
So I'm going to do a jury.

[01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:08.070]
Hey, too.

[01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:11.170]
Columbia Records had released a song on a full-calde by the duo.

[01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:14.750]
While Simon and Garfunkel were playing in small clubs in Europe, Columbia edited a base guitar

[01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:16.490]
and drums to the song, released a business single.

[01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:17.770]
It became a top 10 in the US.

[01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:22.170]
And the record company had trouble finding them in Europe to come to get their asses home and cut another album.

[01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:23.850]
Oh, here you go.

[01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:24.230]
Here's one.

[01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:26.050]
You'll have to express yummy, yummy.

[01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:27.470]
You'll see yummy, yummy, yummy.

[01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:28.390]
I've got a lot of my tummy.

[01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:30.490]
It says, now there's a bad song.

[01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:30.930]
Got it?

[01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.750]
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

[01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:33.410]
Novelty song, but it's bad.

[01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:34.790]
It's a bad novelty song.

[01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:38.230]
There were good novelty records like Flying Saucer by Buchanan in Goodnoon.

[01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:39.030]
Right?

[01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:39.750]
Right.

[01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:41.370]
Here's another one.

[01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:43.290]
Another song for your worst list is Drea.

[01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:45.110]
I like dreaming by Kenny Nolan.

[01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:46.350]
I never heard that.

[01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:47.390]
He never says dreaming.

[01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:48.210]
It's always Dweeman.

[01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:50.470]
I love Dweeman.

[01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:53.630]
Maybe he knew Bob Obawa or maybe he knew Tom Bokoff.

[01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:55.230]
No, no, no, no.

[01:12:55.730 --> 01:12:57.250]
Tom Bokoff is getting off the air.

[01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.670]
Thank you.

[01:12:57.730 --> 01:12:58.950]
Something good's going to happen this year.

[01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:04.030]
If you live that long, Charles and Deerefield beach at the risk of George's you're just smith-canting this.

[01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:06.250]
I'd have to say for me it's a tie between Honey.

[01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:08.850]
Oh, two bad records both by the same artist.

[01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.730]
Bobby Grohl's bro.

[01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:11.610]
The incomparable tune smith.

[01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:13.570]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:15.350]
Oh, Charlie, you got a great sense of humor, man.

[01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:17.570]
Honey and watching Scotty grow.

[01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:20.890]
I don't think watching Scotty grow is better looking out to talk about it.

[01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:26.390]
Although Prince Charles is watching William and the Shower right now.

[01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:28.490]
Let's see, watching Scotty or Bobby Grohl's bro.

[01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:29.070]
Let me look him up.

[01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:32.750]
Because I don't want to put stuff because you wait till tomorrow, man.

[01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:35.970]
Because these people are going to be researching it during a between-out tomorrow.

[01:13:37.190 --> 01:13:40.210]
Let's see, watching Scotty were- oh, yeah.

[01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:43.210]
It was on 11 weeks ago all the way up to number 11.

[01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:44.530]
Holy moly, man.

[01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:45.770]
That was 80 pressing song.

[01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:47.010]
Bobby Grohl's bro.

[01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:48.810]
The incomparable tune smith.

[01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:50.090]
What, what are we putting under?

[01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:52.950]
Honey and watching Bobby grow.

[01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:55.450]
Oh, that honey.

[01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:56.190]
Let me talk about it.

[01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:59.310]
So, what was that other, what about patches by Dickie Lee?

[01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:02.450]
Talk about depressions to the side.

[01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:05.530]
Oh, Dickie Lee.

[01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:07.230]
No, you're thinking of a brindly.

[01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:13.450]
56670560, pound 560 on the- you're thinking of Lee Allen from WSYZ Detroit.

[01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:18.110]
I don't know any harness drivers by the name of- I know what's his name.

[01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:20.130]
Dick refined junior.

[01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:21.030]
What's his name?

[01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:21.730]
Donner v. junior.

[01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:22.130]
I don't know.

[01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.890]
Dick.

[01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:28.230]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.310]
That was- you have no idea.

[01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:36.710]
I mean, just riding along the razor's edge right there, I feel like a chafe on the bottom of my heels right now.

[01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:37.070]
Wow.

[01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:40.790]
I feel wire burn right on the bottom of my left heel.

[01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:42.650]
W.A.M. Hello.

[01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:45.310]
Q.A.M.?

[01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:47.090]
You're getting thunderous.

[01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:47.890]
Oh, God.

[01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.170]
Talk about thunderous.

[01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:50.730]
Go jump off a small cliff.

[01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:51.650]
Okay, not a big one.

[01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:52.590]
We don't want you to get hurt.

[01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:53.950]
W.A.M. Hello.

[01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:55.810]
How are you doing today, sir?

[01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:56.750]
Pretty good, pal.

[01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.970]
Two things.

[01:14:58.190 --> 01:14:58.450]
Two things.

[01:14:58.450 --> 01:14:58.650]
Yeah.

[01:14:58.890 --> 01:15:01.830]
Mr. Obama, by 6th and anything David has a lot of things.

[01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:06.050]
The blue hash along had a top 40 hith.

[01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:07.790]
I don't know.

[01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:10.410]
Yeah, get out that damn phone.

[01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:14.290]
That was great.

[01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:16.290]
That was one of my best calls in the year.

[01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:21.150]
56670560, we got to Marlin coming up the Marlins out back in 1230.

[01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:22.810]
Marlins had to fillies in 105.

[01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:27.850]
And as you look for the sweep in the series, the Humper follows the Aboggan, the Hebrew Hammer, till 7th.

[01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:29.670]
Then we got Hurricane Hotline, 7-8 o'clock.

[01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:32.550]
The big 8-10, that's perfect for him.

[01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:33.970]
Just about the time the sun is going down.

[01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:35.370]
When the signal goes down to about 10 watts,

[01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.950]
80k from a 10-2 and overnight forget it.

[01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:41.030]
5-6-7-0560, let's do line nine.

[01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:41.770]
QA and hello.

[01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:43.290]
Hey, New York, how's it going, boss?

[01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:43.970]
Pretty good, pal.

[01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:45.110]
A question question.

[01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:46.490]
What's going on with the internet?

[01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:48.110]
I've been able to get through some stuff yesterday.

[01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:52.170]
It's on there, where you're the first person to tell me that.

[01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:53.970]
Yeah, I can't get through.

[01:15:54.170 --> 01:15:54.910]
I'm on AOL hell.

[01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:57.450]
What I have to be the problem, and they blow.

[01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:02.470]
Usually I let me get through, but it keeps saying my connection is offline,

[01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:03.550]
but I can get through everywhere.

[01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:05.410]
Don't take it personal, but it's got of a U-man.

[01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:06.850]
No way, man.

[01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.870]
I can't deal with this way.

[01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.290]
Way.

[01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.970]
OK.

[01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.930]
Turds in.

[01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.370]
Way.

[01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:12.690]
OK, good luck, you man.

[01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:15.030]
5-6-7-0560, have you had anybody else say that?

[01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:17.350]
Eric hasn't reported you that way of any problems on there, right?

[01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:17.770]
No.

[01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:19.970]
When a problema, he would have.

[01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.670]
Hikini.

[01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:22.630]
He would have reported it.

[01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:25.330]
He would have shouted it from the mountain tops of the mountain in Orlando.

[01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:28.150]
How many QA and hello?

[01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:28.790]
They have mountains.

[01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:30.470]
QA.

[01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:32.070]
I got two for you.

[01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.810]
OK.

[01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:34.950]
Billy, don't be a hero.

[01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:36.150]
I don't really.

[01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:37.130]
Don't be a hero.

[01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:37.970]
Who did that?

[01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:38.590]
Who did that?

[01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:39.190]
I don't know.

[01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:40.030]
Chicago died.

[01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:41.170]
And then, I don't know.

[01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:41.310]
And then, I don't know.

[01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:43.130]
And then, I don't know.

[01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:47.030]
And also, the next one, afternoon delight.

[01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:48.450]
Oh, horrible.

[01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:48.950]
Starlight.

[01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.470]
Starlight.

[01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.430]
Starlight.

[01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:51.550]
The road test van.

[01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:52.030]
Thanks a lot.

[01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:53.170]
Two good choices.

[01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:56.050]
Now, what was the first one?

[01:16:56.490 --> 01:16:57.370]
Billy, don't be a hero.

[01:16:59.510 --> 01:17:01.150]
Billy, don't be a zero.

[01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:02.710]
To that, we can't play zero anymore.

[01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:04.190]
The Enrique thing, I love that.

[01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:06.490]
We can't play that no more.

[01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:07.010]
No chance.

[01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:12.530]
He said it looks like a big something like that.

[01:17:13.530 --> 01:17:14.090]
Billy, let's see.

[01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:15.070]
Big girls don't cry.

[01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:16.370]
Big log.

[01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:17.230]
Oh, geez.

[01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:18.670]
I don't even think we can say that.

[01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:19.050]
Can we?

[01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:19.910]
Big log?

[01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:20.090]
Well, definitely there's one point.

[01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.990]
Billy Jean.

[01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:25.730]
Billy Jean, by the end, recently

[01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:26.830]
in that at Michael Jackson.

[01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:29.130]
Billy and Sue, by BJ Thomas.

[01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:30.570]
Billy to be hero is by for it.

[01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:31.730]
Boy Donaldson and the a head.

[01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:33.210]
Wow.

[01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:36.290]
Boy Donaldson and the ha wards and

[01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:37.230]
religions are smash.

[01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:38.390]
Billy will be here on ones

[01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.930]
the other line did.

[01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:40.170]
I don't know.

[01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:41.590]
The guy that's just not on

[01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.370]
talking about his guidance,

[01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:44.330]
what he called out man a

[01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:45.690]
lot.

[01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:47.010]
We're Bridget Wyll.

[01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:47.150]
I will get out of that.

[01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:47.850]
Yeah, I will.

[01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.890]
I will get out of that.

[01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:53.210]
Great list here. I'll tell you one thing. Our list I think is a hell of a lot better than his damn

[01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:58.890]
music box blender whatever that magazine is. What is the magazine? Maximum maxi pad blender.

[01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:04.210]
All you girls out there man. Don't be sticking to your maxi pans into blender. It's really

[01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:09.150]
screws up that smoothie something fierce. Unless you're making maybe a scene. I don't want to say

[01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:17.890]
bloody Mary. That would be bad. Okay. What? Nothing. 166 votes on this pool here. And of course a lot

[01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:22.450]
of people are waiting because they don't see there's yet. The worst hit song top 40 of all time

[01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:28.710]
achy breaky are 24. You light up my life 22 so far they got a life in that struggle between

[01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:33.730]
Debbie Boone and Billy Ray Cyrus. Both of them genetically challenged Debbie because your father

[01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:38.790]
was Pat Boone and Billy Ray because he's a country guy. He's from Nashville or somewhere like

[01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:43.370]
that some Mugwam place. I never have been able to figure out why do they all look like that.

[01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:47.570]
Why they all got that like because he's not really a bad looking guy. Billy Ray he's

[01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:51.910]
he is probably about as close to human looking as any of the country singer types you know.

[01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:56.570]
Yeah but when you look at them they're like a little bit off you know what I mean. I know why.

[01:18:56.910 --> 01:19:02.110]
Why is that all that good breeding? I see that inbreeding. Yeah and half breeding.

[01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:07.110]
Because you have my baby speaking of that. Speaking of that. I have my baby 15. Feelings is moving

[01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:11.670]
up. Thank them. It's 13. We both the city 12. Macarena 11. Ice Ice baby 10.

always love you 5. Surf and Bird 5. She bangs 3. Sugar Shack 3 and out of go.

[01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:28.730]
But the Bobby Goldsboro ones will do very well. He is just uh what was the term he used?

[01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:37.110]
He's no joke. That was a beautiful thing. 20 till noon at 5 60. We better hurry a bank

The

[01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:31.470]
These rags that such a crack, are bundled with torched

[01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:35.690]
convoy bridges, from from Garland Day.

[01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:43.010]
Four people moving 5, 60, Nobody Cue, when Carol Commer died, I know you've been

[01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:44.170]
a riff jazz came for his drug of dick!

[01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:48.010]
But nevertheless, when he died, it said to me like some day of a national holiday

[01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:54.130]
in America. He was just, I don't know why he died. He was a monster. He was a legend. He

[01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:58.730]
was a giant. He was like, he may have had more impact on everybody than almost anybody

[01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:01.790]
on television. I loved him dearly even though he was full of crap about his son.

[01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:08.150]
Oh wow, but again, I was told his last daughter, he had a broken heart because he was in denial,

[01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:13.510]
okay? Does any parent, especially celebrity parents, but any parent whose kid winds up being

[01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:23.550]
a, uh, carefully a sleaze bag just because of being a, a, a, a, a sleaze bag. Uh, you know,

[01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:27.510]
it's not this fault. It's never their fault. Right. Well, I'm, you know, it was his fault. Maybe

[01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:30.930]
he was a good father. Maybe he was a bad father. Most show business people are crappy parents.

[01:22:31.190 --> 01:22:35.550]
Right. If you watch the biography channel, you'll find out that 99% of show business people,

[01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:39.810]
because they're never around. They're busy making a big living. So it's a mixed bag. I understand.

[01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:43.410]
It's a mixed bag. I don't want to hand the kids have all the luxuries that I got all I'm wanting

[01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:46.890]
and all this, but on the other hand, sometimes they don't have any wire coat hangers. I don't blame

[01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:50.330]
that. He had blamed the kid, but that's what he said. He didn't have any wire coat hangers.

[01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:54.350]
Right. I understand. I caught it. Now, here's, I used to get, you caught it all right. I used to get

[01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:58.950]
bed out of shapes as a Frank listening to a baggy wimpy skinny Michael Jackson singing, bad,

[01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:04.810]
I'm bad, I'm bad. Yeah, bad. Get bad on earth. It'd be bad. It'd be real bad. He was just being honest.

[01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:10.330]
He's bad. He's a bad act of man. He'd been acting up and that Jesus do. Now, it's really

[01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:14.050]
interesting on this show. Even though I used to get a lot of crap for reading all that stuff out of

[01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:20.030]
the tabloids and whatever these articles on here. How many months ago? About third man. Did we reveal

[01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:24.570]
thanks to our friends at the inquirer about that Jesus do's thing, including that big words

[01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:29.830]
he had in Vegas that we haven't even heard about yet. Was it the Mirage, I think? The Villa is

[01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:34.170]
behind the Mirage. Whatever one it was. Yeah. The Jesus do. That was no secret to us,

[01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:39.650]
because we already knew about that way ahead of these. See, I'm going to tell you again. For

[01:23:39.650 --> 01:23:43.630]
example, last night they were talking on this counter spin show and I hate to keep bringing it up

[01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:50.230]
because I don't know nobody saw it, but about the fact that within days after they finished in

[01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:54.290]
Afghanistan, what they considered being finished as usual, like walking away, just walk away.

[01:23:55.210 --> 01:24:00.630]
They were already making the plans out to split up the oil and all the other assets of a rack.

[01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:07.090]
This was already on the table. You got it? I got it. Okay, just mention that in passing.

[01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:12.530]
For anybody who doubts all of this stuff on, by the way, speaking of lies, the Pentagon deleted

[01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:16.010]
from a public transcript, the statement of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made to walk

[01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:19.670]
a Bible over and suggesting the administration gave Saudi Arabia two months heads up,

[01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:23.310]
the president both decided it would be the right. They just deleted the from the transcript.

[01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:28.190]
And then they tried to say it was by mutual agreement with Bible, and more than words say,

[01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:31.190]
yesterday, no way I would have agreed to that. No chance.

[01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:37.750]
And then they Rumsfeld, at his press conference, they passed him and know while he was in total denial,

[01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:44.550]
that business about what was the line again about, oh yeah, you can take it to the bank that this

[01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:48.630]
is going to happen. He says, oh no, I never said it and you can take that to the bank. Yuck, yuck,

[01:24:48.630 --> 01:24:51.750]
yuck and of course all of his butt liquors there and they're the Pentagon news briefing.

[01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:57.050]
Oh, yes, how funny, Danny. Ah, rubbery or a panic. And then they slipped him and

[01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:59.450]
they don't know if he didn't even understand. They say, well guess what, they're already admitted

[01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:05.670]
they deleted and you could say that, oops, oops, time's up, time to go. Time for another

[01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:10.250]
on the Ocon and P-NAC meeting. Would you have bush. That's what they got in the pipeline,

[01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:13.190]
keep in mind. I just mentioned that in passing. Again, that's what their plans are.

[01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:20.170]
Four more years for W, then eight years for for Jed. And then another eight for George P.

[01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:25.030]
Right. And then of course, they're like that fifth and grinded. What about Noel? Once you get

[01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:32.690]
all pulled out. Deputy QA and hello. Hey, how about old rivers by Walter Brennan?

[01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:42.290]
What was that? Is that really the name of the song? I don't know. Is it like old bad river? Is that

[01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:48.150]
something? No, no, no, that's it. Oh, no, you must have been eating it macaroni grilled too often.

[01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:52.470]
I like the macaroni grilled by the way. Walter Brennan, old rivers, that is the name of the song.

[01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:56.210]
And then they made number five holy moly. Very good, Pally. Old rivers.

[01:25:57.930 --> 01:26:01.450]
Holy, maybe it's talking about Johnny Rivers. I do love Johnny Rivers. Don't anybody put any

[01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:04.830]
Johnny Rivers songs on here? We'll come to the house now. Look at Bratzi beat the crap body.

[01:26:05.170 --> 01:26:08.810]
Old rivers, you got it there, Josh? I got it there. I'm right. Maybe it's talking about Mickey Rivers.

[01:26:09.850 --> 01:26:13.190]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 6, you're maybe Mickey Bridges.

[01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:20.610]
Underrated trot man there. Look at that. Now Dick Feinberg. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T

[01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:25.190]
and Verizon wireless line. I'll tell you one thing. Eat normal shell brainer. WQAM, hello.

[01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:32.130]
Hello? Yes, sir. Neil here? Speaking. You're out. Yes. How about Donny Osman Popylo?

[01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:39.610]
Popylo? Oh, that was that Afghan song. I think he had his Afghan hound on his life, but he was a

[01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:44.750]
singing that song. Popylo by Donny Osman. Very very embarrassing and a big hit.

[01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:49.810]
Don't be knocking my good friend Donny Osman out. Let me drop a name. I only got two names to

[01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:53.490]
drop. Dion and Donny Osman. Do I know anybody else? And Dave Johnson? Anybody else I know?

[01:26:54.970 --> 01:26:58.570]
I'm talking about famous people, celebrities. You know how we're David?

[01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:03.710]
Well, now we're talking big time. Absolutely. I don't want to just drop that name around anywhere.

[01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:11.390]
WQAM, 70 QAM, hello. Hello. Yeah, two songs for Neil. Okay. You're talking to them.

[01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:17.470]
Hi, Neil. Hi. How are you? Great. The electric slide and

[01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:24.950]
the busher point that's the feeling hot. All right. Hey, that's all. Feeling hot? Yes. That's

[01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:31.350]
time. Oh, you're right. That could be the worst song in history. Right. That's a lot of

[01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:36.370]
family. Good one. Oh, hot, hot, hot. Oh, and that's another one they were used on

[01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:43.090]
channel four, one of those. Channel four is evil, man. They are evil. Let me take a look at it.

[01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:49.550]
Oh, it's not so hot now. I just took a look at it. Hot. Where is it? It's not on here. Are you sure

[01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:53.910]
that's the name of the song? Pretty sure. Well, maybe it wasn't the top 40 here. We can only pray.

[01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:58.430]
Although I want to put that on there anyway. I'll make an exception. That's how much I hate that song.

[01:27:59.550 --> 01:28:04.890]
Unknowing. They love to take annoying songs and just drive you crazy with it. Let's see.

[01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:09.090]
The extra point, extra here was, uh, no, but a little poke on there anyway. Hot, hot, hot. What was the

[01:28:09.210 --> 01:28:19.010]
first one he said? Electric slide. Electric slide? Yes. What is that? Never. It looks kind of like

[01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:23.770]
this and you plug it in. Yeah. And you get like, you get asked for another. Never

[01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:27.870]
rich. You have it on the parties. It's another mass dancing song. Not unlike the macarena.

[01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:34.390]
Electric slide? Where have I been? You know how to go parties? The election day.

[01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:39.470]
Electric slide? It's not on here. Not a top 10 hits. So we'll put hot hot hot.

[01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:43.930]
We'll want to win. We'll make it. We'll make it not a top 40. 5, 6, 7, if you're wondering what

[01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:47.270]
else going on here? We're just starting. This is going to be quite an adventure all through the

[01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:52.670]
whole four hours tomorrow. By the end of the day, we should have 50, 60, at least 30,000

[01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:56.530]
songs on there that we hate and despise just to give you a chance to get it out of your system.

[01:28:56.970 --> 01:29:02.130]
We hate it. This is great. I just found this by accident. I looked at this thing and I have

[01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:06.710]
about Maxim Blender. Isn't that what it is? Yes. I actually said it's the right game in the

[01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:11.750]
magazine. Maxi Pat Blender. And I thought this is making a great poll. This would be really a

[01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:16.890]
sum of the hop on. So to speak. You didn't hear me say that. I, yeah. Songs so bad they're on a list

[01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:19.990]
all their own is what the headline is from the Houston Chronicle. Let me just give you a couple

[01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:25.870]
more from the their list of the well, this is the Maxim Blender top 50 list. Barbie Girl is on there.

[01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:33.710]
Oh, will 2k by Will Smith. Ooh. If he did it, I hate it. I just despise him. The end by the doors.

[01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:38.330]
Why is it that Airme listed bad songs always has the end by the doors? Well, what's so bad about

[01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:43.730]
that? In fact, that's number like 26. Huh? It's depressing.

[01:29:45.170 --> 01:29:51.070]
Mesmerized job rule featuring Ashanti. Hang in touch by the new kids on the block. Oh,

[01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:56.430]
Brian. Brian Adams. And I'm not even sure if we can say the title of this song. The only thing

[01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:59.990]
that looks good on me is you. That sounds like one of them. Louis Lou Jack Cowboy titles.

[01:30:00.710 --> 01:30:05.050]
The only thing that looks good on me is you. That sounds pretty provocative to me by Brian Adams.

[01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:10.690]
Canadian boy. He did by all including here. Oh, bloody. Oh, blood. Ah, by the Beatles. Now,

[01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:15.110]
they always stick that on all of these lists. Huh? I don't know. The Beatles had so many throwaway

[01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:18.930]
songs, you know, and that was one of the least of all. I'm not sure if we can say the title of this song.

[01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:22.110]
Are we putting that on there? Sure. Well, you'll blood. And I'll tell you what it needs to be on

[01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:26.790]
there. Talk about Canadian, eh? And believe me, there's plenty of Canadians made plenty of bad

[01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:32.390]
records. And this is one of the all time where Selen Dion and my heart will go on. Oh my god.

[01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:38.550]
Even Leo can't handle that. No, Mo. I thought you were going to talk about Andrew.

[01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:43.610]
Let's just say for for tomorrow. Good evening, Q.A. And hello. I was four talkers.

[01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:52.850]
Somebody Q.A. And hello. Q.A. And yes, how about question, Mark and the Mysterians 96 years?

[01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:56.870]
You don't know. I think that's a great size one of my favorite songs. Oh, it was awful.

[01:30:57.710 --> 01:31:03.190]
They're from Sagittall, Michigan. Oh, well, the one you were talking about before, yummy, yummy,

[01:31:03.330 --> 01:31:08.230]
yummy. I grew up with the guy who wrote it. The song or the group, one of the group's

[01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:14.690]
sisters. So, it really made me laugh. Okay, have a great day, sweetheart. 96 years, both of

[01:31:14.690 --> 01:31:18.170]
that honor, even though I'd take great umberage with that. But she was very nice. I just think

[01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:23.510]
she happens to be on that full of crap. That's all. You know, you like that. So I was 96 years,

[01:31:23.650 --> 01:31:29.130]
but question just by question, Mark and the Mysterians, he was from Sagittall. He just couldn't say it.

[01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:29.650]
Sagittall?

[01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:32.390]
Somebody Q.A. And hello.

[01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:34.230]
We're talking about that. That's you. We're talking about that. Hello.

[01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:39.190]
Yes, sir. How about Muscrat Love by Captain Antonio?

[01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:44.190]
A fabulous selection. Okay. Thanks a lot. Muscrat Love. Although we do like clubs,

[01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:48.590]
we'll keep us together though written by Neil Sedanca. That's the doctor. Right. But Muscrat Love

[01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:51.530]
was a, hey, it's a matter of fact, you know, whose favorite song that is? How can you clue?

[01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:52.050]
Absolutely.

[01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:55.270]
Oh, he just loves that Muscrat Love.

[01:31:57.850 --> 01:32:01.890]
Back in the day, I had a fabulous line for that. Can't take no mold out. Can't take no mold.

[01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:06.810]
Exactly. Four minutes to noon. We got the big commercial half hour come up. Now this thing is,

[01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:11.390]
we can do this every day. You know what? Let's play a Marlin game at 1230 every day. I am

[01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:16.290]
a sight. This is great. Love the Marlin. Nobody wants to talk about diseases, man, especially in

[01:32:16.290 --> 01:32:19.930]
your own body. But you know, as you get older, well, first of all, you've got like a history in

[01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:23.130]
your family of certain things. Maybe you're a heavy smoker. You're worried about your lungs.

[01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:27.030]
Maybe you've got history of your family of heart disease. Maybe you're fat as a cow. And you're

[01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:30.150]
worried that maybe the inside of your body, your rotting and falling apart. You got all sorts of

[01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:34.410]
things in there. Here's a great way. I just did it last week. And this is fantastic. Hollywood

[01:32:34.410 --> 01:32:39.370]
Diagnostic Center is proud to announce their virtual colonoscopy, much less intrusive and invasive.

[01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:44.830]
And the not as big of a song of it as to be afraid of as the usual process. The coronary

[01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:49.190]
heart scoring and full body screening exams that can detect cancer. All sorts of other life-threatening

[01:32:49.190 --> 01:32:53.490]
diseases in their early stages. The doctor's referral is not needed. It's like a virtual trip right

[01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:57.290]
through your body. They actually look right into your lungs and down three years, you can see your

[01:32:57.290 --> 01:33:02.810]
pancreas in your liver, and your colon, all of these things. What else is in your bladder? Kidneys.

[01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:06.790]
And if there's anything there, catch it while there's still time to do something about it.

[01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:10.750]
So it really can be a life-saving thing. It takes a very short period of time. And it's totally

[01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:09.130]
I'm from Indiana, Ross, Nathan. And I like rubbing my stomach really as with soap made from

[01:34:09.130 --> 01:34:13.710]
jewels. I'm listening to the new Rho-Hate, at least an hour.

[01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:20.330]
Another thing, with the rules of the movie, would have been a big star by now.

[01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:24.430]
With that little thing, sweet voice, I didn't expect to get anywhere in those cuties,

[01:34:24.570 --> 01:34:26.290]
you. We saved you.

[01:34:32.290 --> 01:34:35.870]
The whole wide sea of New York. Yeah, what a butt.

[01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:38.450]
The whole wide-head view.

[01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:39.890]
What do I do?

[01:34:40.190 --> 01:34:41.630]
I play not me.

[01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.950]
I want to die.

[01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:49.730]
You're taking away.

[01:34:50.710 --> 01:34:53.530]
Don't show me the role.

[01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:57.110]
Don't be in the home.

[01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:00.830]
Can't point to anything.

[01:35:02.370 --> 01:35:05.090]
Why you I ought to smack you.

[01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:06.470]
That's it.

[01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:09.130]
I know my smell attract you.

[01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:10.670]
Thank you.

[01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:16.110]
But unlike that, you still got such a...

[01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:23.890]
I feel just like that you are my brother.

[01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:27.610]
And when you need to another.

[01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:31.590]
That's why you are so not fighting.

[01:35:32.410 --> 01:35:35.210]
It's just a bit of a difference.

[01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:41.670]
I'm going to go to the door.

[01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:46.610]
I'm going to go to the door.

[01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:48.970]
I'm going to go to the door.

[01:35:50.890 --> 01:35:52.730]
I'm on the show.

[01:35:53.110 --> 01:35:54.490]
Hey, what's up?

[01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:57.890]
In the cold sky.

[01:35:58.690 --> 01:36:00.590]
In the cold sky.

[01:36:02.410 --> 01:36:03.610]
I got some up.

[01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:06.510]
From all three at five sixty speaking of a gauldie,

[01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:08.270]
this is a good word that helps that fact.

[01:36:08.410 --> 01:36:09.270]
You sent me so many facts.

[01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:09.630]
You did.

[01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:11.150]
What I just do with that.

[01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:12.530]
Oh, here it is.

[01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:14.270]
It says, no, I can't find it.

[01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.890]
That's not the one.

[01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:16.430]
There's something about the...

[01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:17.570]
Carding up all those...

[01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.930]
Here it is.

[01:36:18.670 --> 01:36:19.890]
Ha ha ha ha.

[01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:21.590]
The other sounds...

[01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:23.090]
Next week on the disc book of Brown,

[01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:24.030]
we need those...

[01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:25.570]
Ah, and ooh, it was a little sounds

[01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:26.570]
beside the...

[01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:27.030]
Fuck, dude!

[01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.870]
That one.

[01:36:29.170 --> 01:36:30.570]
Yeah, you know the ones we're talking about.

[01:36:30.670 --> 01:36:32.250]
Just by themselves separate.

[01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:33.170]
We could have a great time with that.

[01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:33.610]
Thanks, yeah.

[01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:35.730]
Also, now this, I don't know.

[01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:37.050]
It says, don't know the name of the song

[01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:37.670]
because it sucks.

[01:36:37.930 --> 01:36:38.570]
Yay, yay, yay.

[01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:39.230]
God is good.

[01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:40.310]
What if God was one of us?

[01:36:40.450 --> 01:36:40.830]
What is that?

[01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:42.990]
Oh, that's what if God is...

[01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.690]
Or a small cannabis?

[01:36:44.190 --> 01:36:44.670]
The song is called,

[01:36:44.710 --> 01:36:45.910]
one of us by Joe Nilesport.

[01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:47.130]
One of us.

[01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:48.870]
What if God...

[01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:49.790]
Yeah, it's Google Gobble.

[01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.410]
If we didn't have such a shortage of time here,

[01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:53.250]
I would actually play that

[01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:55.030]
because that's one of my...

[01:36:56.290 --> 01:36:57.390]
But we don't have time.

[01:36:58.150 --> 01:36:59.710]
So anyway, we'll put that on there.

[01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:00.430]
Here's the winner.

[01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:00.790]
It says,

[01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:02.750]
Disco Duck by Rick D's.

[01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:04.590]
It says, put it on there, fat ass.

[01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:06.310]
Okay, fat ass is putting right on there.

[01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:07.270]
Disco Duck.

[01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:09.070]
HR says,

[01:37:09.330 --> 01:37:10.350]
they're coming to take me away

[01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:11.590]
by Napoleon XIV.

[01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:12.910]
Ha ha ha ha.

[01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:14.030]
Kind of like your buddy.

[01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:14.310]
Uh-huh.

[01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:17.090]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:17.930]
And that says,

[01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:19.030]
on the reverse side of the 45,

[01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:20.470]
it was the same song in reverse,

[01:37:20.730 --> 01:37:22.170]
and the label was also printed backward.

[01:37:22.710 --> 01:37:23.590]
Just to drag you crazy,

[01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:24.490]
so it could relate to it.

[01:37:24.690 --> 01:37:25.250]
You won't believe it,

[01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:26.310]
but our first break of the half-hour

[01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:27.190]
has come up momentarily.

[01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:29.010]
My scrap line was good.

[01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:29.410]
What?

[01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.310]
I don't know what you're laughing about.

[01:37:31.770 --> 01:37:33.010]
How else can you do it?

[01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:34.130]
Just play them all back to back?

[01:37:35.230 --> 01:37:37.450]
Reunited by Andrew Pittsburgh says,

[01:37:37.710 --> 01:37:39.350]
Reunited by Peaches and Sturve.

[01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:41.510]
A herb with a big thumbs down.

[01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:42.170]
Good choice.

[01:37:43.050 --> 01:37:43.450]
Reunited.

[01:37:43.690 --> 01:37:45.810]
They don't like the syrupy songs, man.

[01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:46.850]
They hate those...

[01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:48.250]
syrupy songs.

[01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:49.890]
We'll take...

[01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:51.430]
We'll get some more calls in here before 1230.

[01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:52.730]
We got the Marlon Pre-Gaming 1230.

[01:37:52.810 --> 01:37:55.010]
Marlon's the 105 as they try to sweep the series

[01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.710]
against Philadelphia.

[01:37:56.710 --> 01:37:58.150]
Well, they sure own the Phillies, man.

[01:37:58.250 --> 01:37:58.490]
Don't they?

[01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:59.890]
What do they want about the...

[01:37:59.890 --> 01:38:00.690]
Fuck three, man.

[01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:01.950]
A bunch of the row against them.

[01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:02.650]
Phillies suck.

[01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:04.750]
The worst hit song,

[01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:05.910]
How Forty and History,

[01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:07.510]
Aiki Breaky Heart 39.

[01:38:08.210 --> 01:38:09.710]
You might have my life 27,

[01:38:10.190 --> 01:38:11.170]
Macarena 22.

[01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:12.750]
Feelings by it.

[01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:14.930]
The Aumche's Morris Albert the Cat 22.

[01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:16.630]
Having my baby 17.

[01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:18.450]
Don't worry, be happy 17.

[01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:20.170]
And every time that used to come on,

[01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:21.930]
I think I was happy till the song started.

[01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:23.990]
We built the city 15,

[01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:25.470]
Seedons in the Sun 13,

[01:38:25.730 --> 01:38:27.230]
Icy's baby, maybe 12,

[01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:28.570]
Ebony and Ivey 12,

[01:38:29.110 --> 01:38:29.950]
party all the time, 11,

[01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:30.970]
everybody else in religious.

[01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:33.250]
Now, you've prepared the jargrapers.

[01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:34.770]
This is going to be a hectic half hour now.

[01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:36.530]
I don't want to put too much pressure on you.

[01:38:37.330 --> 01:38:37.690]
But...

[01:38:38.690 --> 01:38:40.170]
I don't want to know.

[01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:42.710]
Because this is more 20 or more life situation.

[01:38:43.210 --> 01:38:44.010]
You way, yeah.

[01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:48.210]
Band for you, but change real good.

[01:38:48.670 --> 01:38:48.910]
Yeah!

[01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:53.810]
You want to give the excess energy to drive Mon Cravery.

[01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:54.290]
Yeah!

[01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:58.670]
So, what great the cereal will you tell Mon to buy?

[01:38:59.090 --> 01:39:00.750]
Next time she goes shopping.

[01:39:01.130 --> 01:39:02.090]
Yeah, there's happiness.

[01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:02.710]

[01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:03.870]
So, you want to give it to the teacher?

[01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:04.490]
She does something.

[01:39:05.210 --> 01:39:09.150]
New super sugar-coated sugar-shockers are little bits of

[01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:12.830]
raw-camed, drenched in honey and coated with powdered sugar.

[01:39:13.170 --> 01:39:14.970]
Bluecoes, fructose, corn syrup,

[01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:17.250]
and other natural sweeteners.

[01:39:17.290 --> 01:39:19.790]
And they taste just like sugar-coated sugar.

[01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.490]
Right.

[01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:23.370]
Because there's no yetky vitamins or minerals

[01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:24.850]
to spoil your fun.

[01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.350]
Yeah!

[01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:27.710]
And how did it make you feel?

[01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:29.590]
Like, time's by,

[01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:31.090]
I pray to you.

[01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:32.370]
I love that chocolate.

[01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:33.450]
I love that.

[01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:34.270]
I love that.

[01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:35.190]
I love that.

[01:39:35.890 --> 01:39:35.890]

[01:39:35.890 --> 01:39:37.790]
I love that.

[01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:41.510]
And mom, the love sugar-joggy stew,

[01:39:41.890 --> 01:39:43.190]
costs inside everybody.

[01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:46.110]
There's a free bottle of new flintstone's

[01:39:46.110 --> 01:39:47.190]
jewelable valium.

[01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:51.270]
So try new super sugar-coated sugar-coated

[01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:54.710]
sugar-coated from your friends at Irresponsible Foods.

[01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:56.990]
Or just what I just found,

[01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:58.310]
speaking of the worst song of all time.

[01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.710]
What?

[01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:01.550]
Oh.

[01:40:05.210 --> 01:40:06.990]
I didn't like that.

[01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:10.590]
I just thought you were about cannibalism

[01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:11.270]
as a good song.

[01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:12.690]
Timothy, get it on here.

[01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:13.570]
Here's another one,

[01:40:13.690 --> 01:40:14.390]
bothered for a long day.

[01:40:14.450 --> 01:40:15.090]
Well, I disagree.

[01:40:15.490 --> 01:40:16.470]
It was annoying.

[01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:18.850]
Hang on, Sloopy, by the McCoy's.

[01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:20.550]
Hang on, Sloopy, right?

[01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.490]
Right.

[01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.890]
It was okay.

[01:40:22.630 --> 01:40:23.590]
But he didn't like it.

[01:40:23.690 --> 01:40:24.330]
So put it on there.

[01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:26.850]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 5, 6,

[01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:27.770]
you won't take a couple of calls,

[01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:29.370]
but I just worse than more with spots.

[01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:31.150]
Believe me, mostly spots.

[01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:32.130]
Nobody can you win, hello?

[01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.850]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:34.490]
Pretty good.

[01:40:34.930 --> 01:40:36.850]
Hey, I don't know if this one's done or not.

[01:40:36.970 --> 01:40:38.870]
Is Gary Glitter's Rock-A-Wall Part II on there?

[01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:39.670]
It is now.

[01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:43.270]
Okay, that's gotta be the worst song ever, right?

[01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:45.290]
I always want to puke when I go to games when I hear this.

[01:40:48.190 --> 01:40:48.510]
Sorry.

[01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:52.690]
Get it on there.

[01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:53.650]
I agree with him, man.

[01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:57.350]
This heater file here is the Gary's and Glitter's.

[01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:59.610]
Rock and roll part two.

[01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:05.850]
And the shower part in the car is just nauseous.

[01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:07.810]
It's coming.

[01:41:10.450 --> 01:41:14.630]
Wow, that is just the, he's right.

[01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:16.550]
That's one reason to watch the games on TV.

[01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:18.330]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:20.270]
pound, 5, 60 on the 18th headline.

[01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:21.070]
Nobody can you win, hello?

[01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:22.390]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:41:22.710 --> 01:41:23.010]
Pretty good.

[01:41:23.730 --> 01:41:25.470]
How about the heater Kalata song?

[01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:27.230]
He's a Kalata.

[01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.970]
Right?

[01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:28.790]
Who did that?

[01:41:29.530 --> 01:41:31.310]
Rupert Holmes, he's an author of you.

[01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:33.850]
Oh yeah, remember, he was kind to Sherlock, one and John.

[01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:35.450]
Thanks a lot, Charlie.

[01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:36.350]
Good to see you.

[01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:37.110]
Yeah, that's a good one.

[01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:38.710]
Peanut Kalata, be careful how you spell that.

[01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:40.030]
12, 13, QAM.

[01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:41.970]
I'm a high-end local.

[01:41:42.570 --> 01:41:46.030]
We're support radio 5, 60, QAM, QAM.

[01:41:48.130 --> 01:41:49.890]
Oh, we're all wet.

[01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:51.990]
And they're at Sean's defeat.

[01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:56.110]
The lock is out on a haunted screen.

[01:41:56.610 --> 01:42:00.530]
If she's gone too hell, then she'd left when she should.

[01:42:01.050 --> 01:42:06.210]
The night that Gary Condon gave it to her, but good.

[01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:13.530]
They were out on a date, parking, there we start.

[01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:17.590]
Maybe Gary had gone just a little too far.

[01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:21.950]
Happy short of the motor, turn your head set.

[01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:23.350]
How about it?

[01:42:23.630 --> 01:42:25.590]
Maybe I could use me some...

[01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:30.410]
Maybe that young intern said that wasn't right.

[01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:34.690]
But the cock-kills in their system had them feel so light.

[01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:39.050]
John got thoughtful a moment and said, you're no place.

[01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:45.090]
That maybe true, said Gary, but I still want the rails.

[01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:46.150]
Let them.

[01:42:47.190 --> 01:42:47.430]
Ah!

[01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:51.970]
Where can that Sean's a breed?

[01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:56.450]
She ain't been heard or seen for so many weeks.

[01:42:57.030 --> 01:43:00.450]
If she's gone too hell, then she'd left when she should.

[01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:05.870]
The night that Gary Condon gave it to her, but good.

[01:43:08.170 --> 01:43:08.170]

[01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:13.090]
When he woke up the next morning, Sean drove us not around.

[01:43:13.090 --> 01:43:17.570]
Though Gary had no tourists, his pants were still down.

[01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:22.130]
He remembered her points into her party supplies.

[01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:25.930]
Yes, Gary finally got caught. He wanted last night.

[01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:30.590]
She had opened the door when the experiment said,

[01:43:31.350 --> 01:43:34.510]
I'll be back in just a minute to work.

[01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:38.990]
Then she took off after he blew her up gifts.

[01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:43.170]
And no one including Gary has seen her since.

[01:43:43.410 --> 01:43:46.130]
Though the practice she's gone, please track away.

[01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:47.270]
Not be right.

[01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:52.730]
If somebody knows the truth, well then the truth will be night.

[01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:58.570]
Well, what a nice editing job by me there with a foot of the finger just in time too, is my job.

[01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.530]
Ah!

[01:44:00.610 --> 01:44:03.050]
I had the reason I played that last kiss, Jay Frank Wilson.

[01:44:03.250 --> 01:44:04.750]
And it was later on redone by whom?

[01:44:05.890 --> 01:44:07.210]
Some of them. That guy.

[01:44:07.930 --> 01:44:15.970]
Well, somebody, but last kiss horrible song, depressing, terminal, wildfire makes me throw up bloods as the time in Zim and Kee-R-Go.

[01:44:16.290 --> 01:44:18.750]
Michael Murphy, wildfire and...

[01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:20.130]
Oh no!

[01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:23.130]
For a render song, and it comes.

[01:44:24.450 --> 01:44:25.250]
Born enough.

[01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:26.830]
Ah! What is it?

[01:44:27.690 --> 01:44:30.710]
I'm a good partner.

[01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:31.670]
What is that?

[01:44:32.230 --> 01:44:34.350]
Saturday morning confusion by Bobby Russell.

[01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:36.510]
Oh! Where is he?

[01:44:37.150 --> 01:44:37.930]
It's my fourth birthday.

[01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:38.730]
Where is the TV?

[01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:40.190]
Ah! I tell you this.

[01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:43.210]
Now it's my bad, brutal, bad man and bozo.

[01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:46.570]
Don't spill the porn, break the blood, break the porn from the office.

[01:44:46.930 --> 01:44:48.830]
Who wanted us to have a beer with the boys?

[01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:51.870]
Now I can't buy the five-bit Saturday morning confusion.

[01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:53.910]
You know that sounds grotesque.

[01:44:54.130 --> 01:44:54.890]
How many people I have?

[01:44:54.970 --> 01:44:55.470]
How long do I remember that?

[01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.770]
Q-A-M.

[01:44:57.010 --> 01:44:58.030]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:44:58.230 --> 01:44:58.570]
Pretty good.

[01:44:58.930 --> 01:45:00.950]
Well, I'm going to be pretty messed up because a lot of them

[01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:02.690]
might think the song is throwing out there.

[01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:05.390]
Well, sometimes you outgrow stuff, you know?

[01:45:05.890 --> 01:45:09.070]
He's been in the sub by Terry Jackson's song by worship, and I'll be kidding.

[01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:10.870]
Well, hopefully I'll be a good friend.

[01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:14.110]
Well, I went up through in there, Tony Orlando went down.

[01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:15.470]
Hi, Yellow Ribbon around here.

[01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:17.250]
I already got a thanks a lot, pal.

[01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:17.730]
A good one though.

[01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:18.190]
Good choice.

[01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:20.950]
Hi, Yellow Ribbon around Tony's neck is what I'm thinking.

[01:45:21.330 --> 01:45:22.930]
Now he's a born again Christian Tony Orlando,

[01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:25.290]
which makes us despise me even more than we did before.

[01:45:25.770 --> 01:45:26.570]
Well, he's a...

[01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:28.770]
former substance abusers turned to Jesus.

[01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:30.370]
And Diet Coke.

[01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:33.990]
And probably true a lot of gum like I'm a...

[01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:35.210]
All like I'm a...

[01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:35.270]
I'm a...

[01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:36.030]
I got to play that.

[01:45:36.170 --> 01:45:36.630]
I don't have time.

[01:45:36.810 --> 01:45:38.730]
Anyway, it's time for Neil and I were up there.

[01:45:39.090 --> 01:45:39.490]
No matter.

[01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:41.890]
Although that was close.

[01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:43.850]
Hi, I'm Luke.

[01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:46.290]
And you're a radio fight system.

[01:45:47.610 --> 01:45:48.050]
You're a genius.

[01:45:50.190 --> 01:45:51.250]
Thank you, baby.

[01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:55.270]
Are you sick of tossing and turning because you can't sleep at night?

[01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.610]
Yeah.

[01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:57.190]
You gotta be up for work in a few hours.

[01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:58.370]
All I want is a little sigh.

[01:45:59.350 --> 01:46:04.710]
Then why not kick back and relax with crime life records new double-feedy set?

[01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:06.970]
The sounds of silence.

[01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.910]
That's right.

[01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:15.430]
Let your cares melt away with the soothing, relaxing, peaceful tranquility of complete and utter

[01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:20.310]
nothingness on this ridiculous, digitally remastered timeless CD of pure,

[01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:21.590]
noiseless serenity.

[01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:23.370]
You'll hear songs like this.

[01:46:25.230 --> 01:46:26.270]
And this...

[01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:30.990]
Plus, if you act now, for those of you who vacation in the country and can't get to sleep,

[01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:34.190]
without the ambient noise of a bustling, thriving metropolis,

[01:46:34.630 --> 01:46:38.590]
will also throw in, at no additional charge, sounds of the city.

[01:46:39.250 --> 01:46:39.750]
Wow.

[01:46:40.410 --> 01:46:44.630]
Just like a real red and festive, intense, populated urban locale.

[01:46:44.970 --> 01:46:47.390]
So now I can find the things that spread on it.

[01:46:47.610 --> 01:46:50.270]
Toward of the sounds of silence and the free crappy bonus CD,

[01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:53.910]
sounds of the city called 1-800-I'm a total gobble idiot and all buy anything,

[01:46:54.110 --> 01:46:54.850]
starting with COD.

[01:46:55.210 --> 01:46:55.950]
I have no life.

[01:46:56.150 --> 01:46:58.810]
Okay, 26 after you know we got the pregame, come out for the marlins,

[01:46:58.810 --> 01:47:00.250]
they're going for the sweeping fillet out here.

[01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:02.870]
Come out for about three and a half minutes, something like that.

[01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:08.110]
Like I said, coming up in about three minutes, something like that.

[01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:12.590]
I think I'm so proud of myself, I'm going to pat myself right in the end.

[01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:16.610]
So I do like, all the spots in there, and one and a half hour, huh?

[01:47:17.230 --> 01:47:17.330]
Right?

[01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:20.330]
I don't know about me, if they're going to say to me, well, you know,

[01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:21.510]
you're thinking you can get these out?

[01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:23.490]
Sure, I understand, it'll pay me a few bucks.

[01:47:23.490 --> 01:47:25.510]
No problem, I don't know all spots you'd be like.

[01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:28.690]
In fact, let's just have all spots radio, I've told them that a long time.

[01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:32.330]
Okay, here's the deal, are we going to carry all of these over for tomorrow?

[01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:32.830]
What do you think?

[01:47:33.190 --> 01:47:35.690]
Or should we just take like the top 20 minutes start and moron?

[01:47:36.130 --> 01:47:37.570]
Whatever we got on the same moron.

[01:47:37.770 --> 01:47:38.090]
Moron.

[01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:43.850]
Anyway, right now, achy bricky heart 44, the worst hits on them all the time.

[01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:48.610]
You light up my life 29, macaroni 25, feelings 22, having my baby 19.

[01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:50.410]
Don't worry, be happy 18.

[01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.890]
We built this city 17, everything 9,15.

[01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:54.050]
George Haysett.

[01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:58.690]
Seasons of the sun 14, ice ice baby 12, party all the time it doesn't.

[01:47:58.990 --> 01:48:01.950]
Now, how come nobody has mentioned this would be a real good one to go to the ballgame with?

[01:48:02.230 --> 01:48:04.950]
How come, and this is especially for your close personal friend

[01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:07.850]
that loves to shake hands and concert with you with the appearances?

[01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:09.290]
The guy with the eyes.

[01:48:11.190 --> 01:48:11.810]
Oh, yes.

[01:48:12.370 --> 01:48:13.890]
I like to have a rock.

[01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:17.790]
By the way, I didn't feel that for different reasons though.

[01:48:18.190 --> 01:48:18.930]
Yeah, I like that.

[01:48:18.930 --> 01:48:18.930]

[01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:22.230]
I'm singing and right in the middle of a good reason.

[01:48:22.650 --> 01:48:27.770]
I call that once I wake up from something that keeps not coming at my brain.

[01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:31.350]
I'm singing for I grow and sing I hold my pillow.

[01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:33.230]
That's our full question, I better hear it.

[01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:35.030]
David Cassidy or Susan Bates.

[01:48:35.290 --> 01:48:37.210]
She made me out the words I've read.

[01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:38.430]
I think I love her.

[01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:39.530]
Hey David, you're Dade.

[01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:45.810]
This morning I woke up with this feeling.

[01:48:46.370 --> 01:48:48.670]
You're getting old how to feel with that.

[01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:51.430]
So I just decided to myself.

[01:48:52.230 --> 01:48:53.910]
I'd hide it to myself.

[01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:58.710]
And they'll talk about it and did not go and show up.

[01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:00.030]
I better have the song there Josh.

[01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:01.270]
I think I love you.

[01:49:01.290 --> 01:49:02.310]
I'm gonna have to have the song.

[01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:07.550]
Oh, I think I love you.

[01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:14.550]
I have no life.

[01:49:16.330 --> 01:49:16.550]
No.

[01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:21.870]
No.

[01:49:27.490 --> 01:49:30.730]
I'm a homo.

[01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:33.950]
Yes, all of these things.

[01:49:34.630 --> 01:49:36.130]
That's fine.

[01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:39.830]
More on.

[01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:43.110]
But third man.

[01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:50.990]
I do what it's all about.

[01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:54.030]
I must think about it.

[01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.530]
Hey.

[01:49:58.090 --> 01:49:59.510]
Hey, David.
