[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260]
Mars of A.G.O.

[00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.260]
We're counting on you, baby.

[00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.740]
H.D.

[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.740]
Radio Digital

[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.620]
Digital signal.

[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.560]
We're counting on you.

[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.460]
We're counting on you.

[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.600]
We're counting on you.

[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.440]
So we're counting on you.

[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.500]
My heavy forward data.

[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.180]
Why not?

[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.660]
If I can't allow it, I will be about to...

[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.220]
Coming soon to an Iraqi state of near-U.

[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.720]
It's the consul festival you've been dying to see.

[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.360]
Malabu Lusha.

[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.260]
All of your favorite cutting-edge alternative terrorists on one stage for one

[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.600]
explosive performance.

[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.580]
Malabu Lusha.

[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.020]
Seats such gem-sized artists as Mokata Al-Sar.

[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.360]
His deputy Mustafa Al-Yatubi.

[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.240]
And 963 other names we carry them from now.

[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.440]
If you want to see a consul tour that's completed, follow G.I.T.

[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.280]
You won't want to miss Malabu Lusha.

[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.040]
And coming later this summer, it's Gaza fast, starring Osama Osborn.

[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.000]
I am Iron Man.

[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.920]
Good luck, you...

[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.380]
101560 WQM.

[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.740]
Happy Wednesday to a man the pressure is building toward 11.30 tomorrow morning.

[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.480]
Can't you smell it?

[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.900]
I smell something.

[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320]
Well, that's because death left the room not too long ago.

[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.840]
He left a lingering aroma because of the pressure that's building toward the big

[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.640]
book coming out tomorrow.

[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.140]
I think that this rating book may be the most cataclysmic in the history of the

[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.860]
Sanfoyle market.

[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.780]
Don't I always say that?

[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.260]
No.

[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.380]
I mean, once in a while I'll say, I think this, you know, portends our future or something like that.

[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.480]
But I think tomorrow is the dividing line.

[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.360]
And it's a question of who's going to be crossing that line and who's going to

[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.840]
just kind of collapse.

[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.840]
Yeah.

[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.960]
Anyway, we'll get into that.

[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.620]
Because let's see, we got, let's see, 1024, 25 and a half hours, less two minutes,

[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.900]
25 hours, 28 minutes.

[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.900]
But who's counting?

[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.820]
Till those numbers start coming out tomorrow.

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.540]
And I think WBGG could be the most unbelievable collapse in the history of San

[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.100]
Florida radio.

[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.040]
They're just going to vanish.

[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.780]
Just like that station in San Diego.

[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.860]
Team Tannels going to get theirs, baby.

[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.480]
I'm telling you that.

[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.140]

[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.220]
They're going to take a dump.

[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.640]
Now, the good news about Fallujah is that the ceasefire is still in effect.

[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.280]
That's what they're telling us.

[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.200]
The bad news is we're watching the battle going on with the Marines and the insurgents as we speak.

[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.460]
It's been on for like an hour and a half.

[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.820]
So the idiots at CNN who consider that you're all got the mentality of a three-year-old are telling us,

[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.900]
breathlessly, that, oh, the good news is the ceasefire is still in effect.

[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.280]
The bad news is, of course, they're like having a few countertops.

[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.320]
Just isolated incidents.

[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.660]
That's why that smoke has been billowing up in the air for like the last several hours.

[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.280]
At any rate.

[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.920]
What are we doing there?

[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.740]
Who's waiting?

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.880]
What are they doing there?

[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.200]
Look for the keyword.

[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.980]
They're going to be banded a five to seven and anchors away at Beach Place in Fort Lauderdale,

[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.740]
stopped by to spin the wheel for prizes.

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.600]
And, ah, ah!

[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.280]
We'll settle a little while ago.

[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.340]
You're starting to move into those territories and those gray areas.

[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.040]
And registered to win 300 scratch-off tickets from the Florida lottery.

[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.080]
That would bring me out there.

[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.720]
What's the lottery up to 15 million?

[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.760]
It's the anchors away party for the air and sea show today at Beach Place

[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.440]
and we'll be there QM five to seven in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.220]
Now, here's the results of yesterday's pool.

[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.960]
And we're going to wrap this thing up with two more today.

[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.400]
I don't want to drag this out all week.

[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.680]
We could put other categories in everybody against kind of ponderous.

[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.200]
Which of these people best fits the description of two gay?

[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.520]
Now, some of you got it and many of you didn't get it.

[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.220]
Many of you just as usual thought, oh, just name a bunch of people you think are gay.

[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.260]
Just name some people you suspect are being a fag.

[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.040]
Yeah, that's where that Louis Anderson.

[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.840]
And I want to retract my apology to that guy yesterday.

[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.340]
I can't just feel bad because I thought he was full of crap.

[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.000]
Well, Louis Anderson to me is not like a screaming little queen.

[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.720]
He's just a never.

[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.780]
You hit a red and a red.

[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.220]
He's a never.

[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.160]
Yeah.

[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.360]
Just a round little goofy guy.

[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.520]
Two gay Richard Simmons.

[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.880]
Well, at least the audience got it right.

[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.020]
367.

[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.400]
I mean, come on.

[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.800]
I get your hands away from my neck.

[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.880]
You screaming fairy you Christopher Lowell 179 came in a nice second.

[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.800]
Liberace 130 with or without that candle.

[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.200]
Abra.

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.940]
Maybe he was just Jewish.

[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.540]
He was celebrating the Hanukkah all the time.

[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.220]
Maybe it was a menorah.

[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.360]
Jim J Bullock and after the top three was a real cat fight.

[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.060]
Jim J Bullock and that drug were tied 65 a piece ever seen together.

[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.280]
No.

[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.180]
Same person just a hat for the disguise.

[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.400]
Queer eye guys all five of them 64 Harvey Firestein ages me out.

[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.160]
Harvey had 63.

[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.040]
I had 60.

[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.040]
It was kind of like a real battle in there for the minor spoils.

[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.120]
Boy George 47 Rosio Donald and Truman Capote 43 a piece.

[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.600]

[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.240]

Place Akin 32.

[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.220]
Do we have that big place Akin ainess?

[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.440]
Yeah, actually Paul and no we don't.

[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.280]
Paul and 31.

[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.600]
Secret and Roy 24.

[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.520]
Ricky Williams 24.

[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.840]
He's straight as an arrow man.

[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.940]
We got a fact from a guy who knows him who hangs with him in the hood and Ricky Williams

[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.320]
is not always rumors about him or crap.

[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.860]
Little Richard 22 every flash or 17 missed Kamala the weather fairy has taken over.

[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.820]
Isn't that something?

[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.560]
He got 15 and the other weather fairy Brian or cross only nine.

[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.400]
So I guess Bill Kamala has the official title now for South Florida of the official weather

[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.320]
furry numero uno.

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.640]
Brian or crosses has been relegated now to weather furry junior.

[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.260]

Ellen degenerate 11.

[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.140]

He denies that vehemently.

[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.300]
Johnny MacRis 2 drew Michael's head a pair drew.

[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.500]
Oh, one for Louis Anderson one for David Hyde Pearson.

[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.140]
I have no idea who that is one and no.

[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.960]
This is amazing out of over 1500 vote.

[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.820]
Do you see this?

[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.780]
Do I see what?

[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.720]
What do you hold on the Jim neighbors had the big oh.

[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.140]
Salmoneo Oh Tony Geary.

[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.240]
How will we spell the wrong?

[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.840]
Oh, oh James Brown.

[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.240]
Oh Johnny Versace.

[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.720]
Oh and Dira Hall.

Oh, none.

[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.520]
There was last six categories there.

[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.000]
Jim neighbors wasn't 2k.

[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.160]
Rocks that he was just right.

[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.420]
And what about Salmoneo?

[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.460]
They don't remember who that is.

[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.920]
He's been dead a very long time.

[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.280]
Oh Tony Geary.

[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.180]
We don't have any people watching general hospital.

[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.700]
Thank goodness.

[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.840]
And I don't know.

[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.000]
So that killed a couple of hours with that and they naturally

[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.380]
that we're going to milk it for all weekend.

[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.860]
Because we're just I'm not going to make any pretense to you.

[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.640]
We're just in fact I'm going to go along with that critical

[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.440]
cost of facts.

[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.380]
We got a couple of days ago from JJ BB whatever was in the Pember

[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.720]
Fines.

[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.360]
Today we're just Biden time.

[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.420]
We're just running off the clock.

[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.000]
Right.

[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.520]
Push back because tomorrow when those number of push

[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.080]
fashion and coasting.

[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.080]
Welcome to the coast.

[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.260]
When the numbers come at level 30 tomorrow it's going to be just a wild

[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.600]
time.

[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.260]
You will see.

[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.840]
I think we'll do fine.

[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.800]
We'll be okay.

[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.960]
Oh we're fine.

[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.340]
But the cheap channel stations they must be getting real

[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.620]
nervous about the reaction of the audience to their crap.

[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.600]
And you might be interested in knowing which company bought out more acquired

[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.660]
more stations in 2003 than any other.

[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.300]
Here you got to write cheap channel.

[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.620]
Oh!

[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.920]
Yeah is if they don't have enough already.

[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.460]
Okay the first two hours today which of these people best fits the description

[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.960]
of?

[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.780]
Two Cuban.

[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.620]
We did two Jewish in the first two hours yesterday.

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.960]
Two gay in the second two hours.

[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.940]
And which of these people best fits the description of two Cuban.

[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.240]
I only started with two.

[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.340]
Ilya N. Ross-Latin and Alex Penelas although you may see that written out

[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.220]
a little differently on the pool.

[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.440]
We just can't say that no more.

[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.980]
Alex.

[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:48.920]
Perkina.

[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.660]
I got one to add.

[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.560]
Who's that?

[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.100]
What are yours?

[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.440]
Ramon Saur Sanchez.

[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.200]
Oh yeah Ramon Saur Sanchez.

[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.760]
Yeah.

[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.420]
What a piece of crap.

[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.420]
Is he still going up and down the intercostal and is yacht with his pet bandage?

[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:03.660]
Yeah.

[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.260]
Yeah.

[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.280]
Now on our behind-to-beating curtain thing today we would like to give you a little heads

[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.900]
up on that to start the show or be there who can take a peek at it if you're over the age of 55 and have many

[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.820]
poignant pieces of ID.

[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.740]
It's Eman again.

[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.920]
No, it's not.

[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.600]
No, it's not.

[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:16.960]
It isn't?

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.400]
No.

[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.640]
Of course not.

[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.640]
Who is it?

[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.260]
It's Kerry Werr.

[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.080]
Oh, he changed a picture on me.

[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.560]
Right on you.

[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.280]
I don't understand.

[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.140]
Why do you do that?

[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.480]
That wasn't the picture we had of Eman yesterday.

[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.760]
It wasn't the practice picture.

[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.020]
Oh, and so I don't have any, uh, that's bad.

[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.260]

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.100]
I don't have any bio.

[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.060]
I don't have any info.

[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.100]
I don't even know who she is.

[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:38.900]
Kerry Werr.

[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.360]
Sure.

[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.420]
She's been in a lot of movies.

[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.140]
Uh, she's shown her breasts a lot.

[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.740]
Then she started feeling self-conscious about it and took her in, plants out.

[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.760]
No, you never see him again.

[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.540]
She was also a little...

[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.280]
Kerry Werr.

[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.340]
Well, I guess during the break, I'm going to be in a assignment.

[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.140]
I'll have something to do there.

[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.520]
Two of that TV show, Sliders.

[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.140]
Have any of your partners?

[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.820]
Sliders around.

[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.280]
Sliders.

[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.760]
I thought you got those away, Arnold's.

[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400]
This is what I thought you got.

[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.780]
Yeah, that's what that lot of people called him, little greasy hamburgers.

[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.620]
They call him Sliders.

[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.100]
How is Wayne doing, by the way?

[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.760]
We haven't heard about Wayne and, uh,

[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.840]
all our good friend, Hudson Yash.

[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.300]
And that crowd?

[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.540]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.140]
You guys can get some of that chow next week.

[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.680]
Well, feast.

[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:17.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.560]
With the beast.

[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.060]
So, wait, wait, that's our new pool.

[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.240]
And I got some stuff.

[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.180]
First of all, before I see there, they're going to go nuts with this Cuban thing.

[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.080]
You'll see.

[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:27.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.920]
It was Cubans!

[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:29.700]
Cubans!

[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.660]
And rightfully so.

[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.280]
Suspicious white powder found in mail at Bill Clinton's office.

[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.760]
This former president Bill Clinton's office was briefly evacuated yesterday.

[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.760]
After a worker opened a package containing a suspicious powder police set.

[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.420]
A secret service agent assigned the Manhattan office opened the package yesterday morning.

[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.540]
A letter and a file of powder were inside preliminary tests were negative for anthrax.

[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.460]
The city and department of health would conduct further tests.

[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.060]
They said Clinton was not in the office when the package was opened.

[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.920]
The building was evacuated for two hours while police investigated.

[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.400]
The agent was not heard but was examined in a hospital as a precaution just to be on the safe side.

[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.760]
And it said it went so on.

[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.560]
So, a little powder in Bubba's office yesterday.

[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.760]
Maybe it was kind of like a peace offering from his success.

[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.220]
He was some of those leftovers from several years ago.

[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.580]
Could be.

[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.600]
Although we don't want to hear about that because what he did 30 years ago was not important.

[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.500]
Whether carried through those metals over the fence or not.

[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.540]
Well, that's very, very important indicates he's just unfit to serve.

[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.660]
I got a very, very scary column here from the village voice.

[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.060]
Which I'm going to read.

[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.200]
John Kerry must go.

[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.080]
I'll get to it.

[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.660]
First, Aero America loses two top executives.

[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.840]
Oh my God.

[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.600]
Things are not looking too awfully good.

[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.560]
Let's take up a collection in case the goddess has to come back to town.

[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.300]
And take Hayderman, head and department.

[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.260]
Aero America loses two top executives.

[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.740]
Mark Walsh, former AOL executive and Democratic National Committee operative,

[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.220]
who announced the launch of the network.

[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.200]
An aunt this week, he has stepped down as the network CEO.

[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.680]
The network also confirmed that Dave Logan, Aero America's vice president for operations and programming has been replaced.

[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.800]
According to Chicago Trib, Liz Winstead, co-host of the Mid-Morning Show,

[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.340]
unfiltered, has taken over as the head of programming.

[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:17.240]
A American chief counsel, David Goodfriend, is acting as the chief operating officer.

[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:17.840]
The CEO.

[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.080]
Oh, oh.

[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.660]
Chairman Evan Cohen said the departures were just part of the normal growing pains of a startup.

[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.360]
Businesses have an evolutionary process he told the trip.

[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.720]
If you're looking for a shake-up at Aero America radio, that's a creation in your own mind.

[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.080]
Right.

[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.720]
Are they on in LA?

[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.180]
No.

[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.040]
Are they on, I don't know, did they ever get up back on in Chicago?

[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.860]
I guess they did.

[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.720]
And they got to find a new station by April 30th, which is Friday.

[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.520]
So starting next week, they got to be on a new station both in LA and in Chicago.

[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.680]
They got Sirusman and we can call him just growing pains.

[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.320]
Do you believe that?

[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:47.660]
No.

[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.500]
They got problems.

[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.200]
Line 9 is going to give us an email.

[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.120]
Bet QA and hello.

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.400]
Ricky Ricardo is Cuban.

[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.760]
Ricky Ricardo was too Cuban.

[00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.400]
We want to put Desianna's on her.

[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.300]
He was...

[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.000]
We could put him on her.

[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.300]
Lucy.

[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.380]
Yeah.

[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.860]
Like an intentional stereotype.

[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.320]
How do you know that?

[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.180]
What?

[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.700]
They played that up on Lucy.

[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:08.960]

[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:09.440]
Lucy.

[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:09.960]
Not a lot.

[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.680]
He was no build attack.

[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.280]
Although he did yell a lot.

[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.380]
He did talk out loud.

[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.340]
10, 12, at 5, 60, QA.

[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.340]
5 and a local, the 65 cities.

[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.300]
There are years old yours.

[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.820]
Oh!

[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.740]
QA and...

[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.340]
Were you Drudge Packin'?

[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.200]
What do you really rather have a Cuban?

[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.100]
A Cuban?

[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.960]
59, Cuban.

[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.740]
Hey, great.

[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.700]
But the African, the 59, Cuban.

[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.140]
A private couple's as a far.

[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.320]
Now as I really would rather have a Cuban, Cuban.

[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.000]
With all new Cuban engineering that converts a boat of a car into a boat.

[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.320]
Arrived on shore, luxuriously in a real juvenile canoe.

[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.400]
With tail fins high enough to sell you across the lanes and into the sea as if it floats.

[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.880]
What do you really rather have a Cuban?

[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.820]
A Cuban?

[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.640]
59, Cuban.

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.360]
Now the age of 59, Cuban.

[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.840]
A car that always bars a far.

[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.500]
10, 17, at 5, 60, WQM.

[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.540]
Happy Wednesday to you.

[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.340]
Look at the way that Joshua spelled Desi Arnez.

[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.840]
It's enough to make a grown man even a small child cry.

[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.580]
I was talking about that.

[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.900]
I knew that that's how it came up.

[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.600]
D-E-Z-I.

[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.080]
D-E-Z-I.

[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.540]
Oh my God.

[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.360]
It's an A-R-N-E-Z.

[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.220]
Well, at least you spelled them both wrong, anyway.

[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.560]
At least change the first one, D-E-S-I.

[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.340]
See, remember it was like, I'm sure you've seen I love Lucy, the reruns.

[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.260]
You must have seen it.

[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:50.860]
Yeah.

[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.540]
And at the end, this is a Desi loop production.

[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.520]
How do they spell that?

[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.100]
How many Z's are in Desi loop?

[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.080]
Oh, there was five Z's when he was five years old.

[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:02.980]
I see.

[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.140]
Kerry Werr has found success as a singer, model in actress.

[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.980]
A Ford model at the age of 13.

[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.780]
She was cast in her first feature film, Fire With Fire, when she was 17.

[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.080]
In 1988, she appeared on MTV as a VJ host of the popular Mott Quicheo Remote Control.

[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.640]
In between her many TV and film roles, she attended N-Y-U's drama department study

[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.520]
with the famed actress teacher Uda Hagen.

[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.060]
Who'da thought it?

[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.000]
Who the hell is Uda Hagen?

[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.560]
After moving to L.A., she landed principal roles on the Fox Network's Class of 96.

[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.980]
The ever-popular Beverly Hills 90210 and Sliders.

[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.720]
The science fiction adventure series on which she played Maggie Beckett opposite Gerry O'Connell.

[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.320]
She was seen in the thriller Anna Konda opposite John Boyd, Eric Stoltz, Jennifer Lopez,

[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.820]
Ice Cube, and in Phoenix, starring with Ray Lyod and Angelica Houston.

[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.800]
Among her numerous feature film credits are No Global Roles and Stephen King's Thinner.

[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.260]
And the crossing guard starring Jack Nicholson and Angelica Houston.

[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.220]
She recently completed production and independent films The Medicine Show

[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.640]
and do it with Bronco Mani and we'd like to watch.

[00:14:59.020 --> 00:14:59.420]
Well, there you go.

[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.260]
So there she is, Kerry Werr is behind the beat of Curtin Today.

[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.720]
Really great news is that I got my full test results here from Hollywood Diagnostic Center.

[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:07.460]
Yeah.

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.620]
And it said you're still alive.

[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.500]
It says, in fact, if you look as good on the outside as Uda on the inside, you'd be in good shape.

[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.260]
Hey, we can't all look good on the outside.

[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.180]
As a matter of fact, when you get to be this age, because it really doesn't make them as different

[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.200]
anymore anyway, you're just real happy to look good on the inside.

[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.540]
I should probably read this whole thing about the total body scanning proceeds

[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.000]
from the skull based through the level of the pubic synthesis.

[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.580]
Can we say pubic synthesis?

[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.360]
Uh-oh.

[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.500]
I'm not going to read it.

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.700]
Let me know when you're going to read that whole thing.

[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.440]
Oh, okay.

[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T of Horizon Wireless Line.

[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.220]
Iliana Ross-Lateman and Alex Penelosite.

[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.340]
Looks like I got a couple of good pair on there to start with.

[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.260]
You know who else we need to put on there?

[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.140]
Meanie Leap not sooner.

[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.460]
Rick Sanchez.

[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:54.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.420]
He's a possible winner of two pulls in just a few days on the show.

[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.240]
Few others can make that claim, except only one that I can think of.

[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.600]
Absolutely.

[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.180]
A moment.

[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.080]
WQA and hello.

[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.200]
Yeah, it's near good morning for you.

[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:07.820]
You serve our host.

[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:08.620]
My latest.

[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.320]
Mars Reseas.

[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:10.840]
That's it up.

[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.040]
I hope you don't have it yet.

[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.600]
Okay, thank you.

[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.580]
Oscar came over to us.

[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.000]
Well, no, he's going to say another.

[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.280]
Yeah, he was.

[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.560]
Well, one.

[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.900]
See, which of these people best fits the description to Cuban,

[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.000]
which we allow you one a piece, whichever one you think is the most to Cuban,

[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.780]
there are many, many people I'm sure who we think are to Cuban,

[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.160]
just like the one to Jewish and to gay and to black, which we'll do later on and to whatever.

[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.800]
I think these four cover pretty well, don't you?

[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:40.440]
Yeah.

[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.440]
Now, if we were going to.

[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.100]
If we were going to do a pull on who do you spies the most,

[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.320]
what soft floor to well-known person do you hate the most?

[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.540]
Mo and Rick Sanchez.

[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.400]
I think we've done that many times in the past because they like to unleash their hatred, you know?

[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.680]
No, it's always OJ and Mo.

[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.000]
OJ and Mo and not Rick Sanchez?

[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:57.700]
No.

[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.660]
Oh, I think you're making a mistake.

[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.380]
We might have to do that later on this week.

[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:01.960]
I'll explain.

[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:02.640]
Maybe tomorrow.

[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.260]
Good evening, QAM.

[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:05.460]
Hello.

[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:06.980]
Hello.

[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.080]

[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:07.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.120]
Does it feel?

[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.160]
Sounds like me.

[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.560]
Hey, how are you today?

[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.080]
Pretty good.

[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:12.960]
I'm standing.

[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.940]
I've just calling about that awesome lighting game last night.

[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:16.640]
Did you watch it?

[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.440]
That was a great game over time, man.

[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.240]
They tied it up with 16 seconds left in the Le Cabo de A.

[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.600]
And then Freddie O.D. in the X-Leaf factor scores the winning goal a minute and someone knew over time.

[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.480]
You know what?

[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.520]
I think they're for real.

[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.040]
They are for real.

[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.520]
And even better news is Calgary beat Detroit in the late game three to two last night.

[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.240]
So, somebody...

[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:34.220]

[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.400]
Let me tell you, Detroit's got a lot of old players in Calgary.

[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:37.800]
That's right.

[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.300]
The very physical team.

[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.800]
They're going to knock the crap out of them.

[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.880]
The old teams are going to fall by the wayside, including my beloved Toronto make believes, I think, or they've had it.

[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.700]
So the old guys, you know, they're done.

[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.740]
How about Tampa Bay in Calgary in the Cop Flannel?

[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.260]
Can you imagine a ratings for that?

[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:54.600]
Wow.

[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.320]
That looks good.

[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:56.600]
Great.

[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.660]
Thanks a lot, Caly.

[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.960]
5-6705-60, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.300]
I'm sure we had how many people this audience watched Tampa Bay Montreal last night.

[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.160]
But third, man.

[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.220]
Get hockey fans, baby.

[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.400]
They're into a deeply-make no mistake about it.

[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.060]
Wouldn't you think?

[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:12.660]
Huh?

[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.260]
You might have to play some Leafs TV.

[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.600]
There's Jim, what's his name?

[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.120]
Papand.

[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.140]
All the same.

[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.600]
All the same.

[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.300]
Jim happens.

[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.160]
Actually, don't be tapped now because Duffel come right out.

[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:23.920]
What's that sound?

[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.120]
Oh, it sounds like...

[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:25.660]

[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.420]
It's great.

[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:26.940]
It's great.

[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.500]
Thank you, ma'am.

[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:27.720]
Hello.

[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.280]
How about Gloria's stuff on her...

[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.160]
Gloria is excellent.

[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.060]
I forget about him.

[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.700]
He's small potatoes.

[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.800]
Gloria's perfect choice.

[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.720]
Thank you.

[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.860]
Thank you so much.

[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.100]
And...

[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.460]
Is that...

[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:41.780]
Volani.

[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:42.980]
Volani.

[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800]
Gloria's step on.

[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.400]
She can't sing.

[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:46.920]
She's annoying.

[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.520]
And she just won't go away.

[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.320]
It's one of those kind of people.

[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.320]
She just refuses to leave the scene.

[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.300]
Kind of like Ellis Rubin.

[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.140]
No, seriously.

[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.200]
Just keep hanging around, hanging around, hanging around.

[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.200]
Hey, Ellis, we know you've got a lot of publicity and go have a good life.

[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.140]
Get out of our face.

[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.540]
Somebody cue a, and hello.

[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.540]
Hey, how about many Diaz?

[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.880]
Many Diaz is perfect, though.

[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.580]
Du Cubano, man.

[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.100]
Mochis Gracia, is that me?

[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.180]
Oh, you got it, boy.

[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.040]
Are we bit-ergy?

[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:16.540]
Oh, sorry.

[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.540]
This article here, I don't know.

[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.000]
And there's another one by Max Castro.

[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.720]
I don't want to sit here and read a lot of bedtimes, especially another Josh's back misspelling a lot of names.

[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.320]
But the one by Max Castro from back March 15 in Progressor Weekly.

[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.180]
And I thank the person who sent this to me from I have had it sit in there, and I never got around to reading it.

[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.960]
I think today would be a propitious time.

[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.560]
Not the whole thing.

[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.420]
It's two-dang long.

[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.120]
But just enough of it.

[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.220]
I mean, it's pretty long.

[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.100]
You know?

[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.240]
No, I don't know.

[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.140]
It's called Israel in the state of democracy in Miami.

[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.720]
Another tremendous shot at the Harold.

[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.800]
By Max Castro's columnism carried by the Harold anymore, you'll notice.

[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.300]
Who exposes them for the pandewars and the fakers they are.

[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.100]
Boy, do we hate the Harold on this show?

[00:19:59.220 --> 00:19:59.900]
Or what?

[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.040]
The spy.

[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.080]
And the Sun Sentles is just a piece of crap.

[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:03.460]
You know?

[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.700]
They are what they are.

[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.300]
But the Harold goes the extra nine yards to be a real pandering piece of turd.

[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.280]
How do I Glenn Garvin?

[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.820]
Nice job on a radio censorship and EFCC.

[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.340]
Nice job lately, man.

[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.020]
You're really on top of it.

[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.700]
He's got some crap puff piece about some piece on a PBS tonight about, who knows what?

[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.560]
That's his article today.

[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.520]
Glenn Garvin.

[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.900]
Man, you are so out of touch.

[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.180]
You fit in perfect with that newspaper.

[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.800]
God forbid that anybody who's supposed to be like the radio TV person for either newspaper really writes regularly about radio.

[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.660]
At least, Jik has written a few columns.

[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.700]
I'm not turnin' man.

[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.080]
I bought all the censorship stuff.

[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.540]
Although I noticed he's back, you know, he's reverted to form.

[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.220]
WQA, and hello.

[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.180]
Hello.

[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:44.580]
On the bowl?

[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:45.340]
Yes.

[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.200]
Elliott Rodriguez.

Elliott Rodriguez.

[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.560]
From Channel 4 News, which I despised like poison.

[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.240]
Very good choice.

[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:52.600]
Thank you.

[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.820]
Yeah, when he gives the news, it's always through John this eye.

[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.420]
You know what I mean?

[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:55.860]
Yellow.

[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.960]
All Elliott Rodriguez.

[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.380]
That's one of the reasons that a lot of people despised Channel 4 News is because they know there's no objectivity.

[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.060]
Like, hello.

[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:11.520]
You know, in fact, back during the alienito days when Rick Sanchez was actually on the year making phone calls to the cell phone in that car, do you realize?

[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.480]
No, no, no.

[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.460]
Seriously, you talk about number one being interfering, number two having no credibility whatsoever.

[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.960]
I mean, being so emotionally wrapped up in the whole thing that he's making editorial comments on the earth, he's going along and trying to call him.

[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.020]
Oh, turn around and go back to me.

[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.940]
He's been canceled, which turned out to be bogus.

[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.820]
Bed information.

[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:35.380]
And luckily they either wouldn't answer the cell phone or they were busy ordering happy meals for alienito for when he got to sister Jean the dancing machines palace.

[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.000]
Wow.

[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.340]
What a what a sad state of affairs, you know, South Florida's got so much potential.

[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.700]
Beautiful beaches, beautiful palm trees, the ocean, all of these things, you know.

[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.500]
All of these things.

[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:46.760]
Right.

[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.620]
Man, if we could just arrange a people transplant, it would be dang pleasant.

[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.040]
And you know, I mean, there are certain months like July and August when we could live without it.

[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.320]
A little bit too hot and humid, mosquitoes, the size of bowling balls, but other than that, it could be fabulous.

[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.960]
It could be part of that rather fake expression paradise.

[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.600]
It could be paradise.

[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.360]
Absolutely.

[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.940]
Without him, which of these people best fits the description of two Cuban?

[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.040]
Ilya Narosletan Scott.

[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.240]
But third man Alex Pinellas 15, Desi Arnez, oh, that's going as closer.

[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:25.560]
Six, six, Maris Grisias for Ramon, South Los Angeles three, Rick Sanchez three, Gloria Stefan one.

[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.800]
And many dears is going to move up later soon.

[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.480]
Hi, ladies.

[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.920]
This is Victor here for more videos.

[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:32.680]
I'm Alex E.

[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:55.620]
Practice man.

[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.360]
Reaction that it can this time.

[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.640]
The question was around."

[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:17.860]
Get out of here.

[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.200]
1031

[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.560]
How could we have gone this long and not had him on their...

[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.120]
I thought of it. How about you sign it right now though?

[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.540]
So, Kathojo, I can't wait to see how Josh spells that.

[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.760]
And now Eric emails me with kind of a caustic note here about how he changes the

[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.580]
picture in the behind-to-beated curtain 930 every morning.

[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.600]
Okay. Okay. A little shot there. I'm I'm almost positive that was not the same picture of

[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.000]
Iman that we had on the rest today. I don't know. There's a different one. I can be wrong about that.

[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.080]
I'm pretty sure. By the way, Desi Arneza spelled correctly in the poll so I don't know what it is now.

[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.880]
So, you don't know what? What you were talking about is what I was going to say.

[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.120]
When you said that he almost has it spelled right before the break?

[00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:01.600]
Oh, well, I don't I don't know. Okay. All I know is that there is no Z in Desi Lou.

[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.540]
And anyway, now Z in the right way. You're assuming off course there. And by the way,

[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.880]
it's not 930 every morning or it's more like 945. Not that it makes any difference.

[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.900]
But let's get it right. Okay. If you want to nitpick and start a big saw in the dance about the

[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.020]
pictures behind it, you're doing a wonderful job. Eric just calmed down a little bit.

[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.460]
Some of those really good breakfast burgring would cheese are very, very good for you.

[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:23.700]
Hmm. That doesn't get stabilized as blood sugar. The ones from Burger King. What do they call those?

[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.140]
From Burger King? So yeah. I thought we had each other. No, no, they're breakfast.

[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.500]
I'll take a little more. That's the only good thing they have. What the hell do they call those? Those are

[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:39.080]
all the cross sandwiches. I thought that was Dunkin' Donuts. No, it's a cross sandwich. It has bacon,

[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:46.940]
and of course they want the egg. Ooh. Bacon and cheese. That's the only thing in the world

[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.420]
that we wanted Burger King is a cross sandwich with the bacon, cheese, ton, uh, hold the egg.

[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.220]
Because that thing don't even, it's never even knew an egg. Much less resembled one.

[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.340]
Move find out or give it a check this out. May 8th, hundreds of grassroots groups and tens of

[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.800]
thousands of us will join forces in the biggest one-day voter mobilization effort in American

[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.340]
history says my email. Together we'll contact over a million voters and register over 250,000 folks to

[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.140]
vote. We'll also prove to Republicans in the media that while President Bush may have more money,

[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.520]
we have the power, the people power to win. This effort builds on the more than seven

[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.380]
million hours move on members pledged in 50 for the future fundraising campaign,

[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.700]
and it goes on to tell what you can do and what it's all about, and uh, it's said or and so on.

[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:33.400]
Move on.org, win and doubt. Check it out. Please. John Kerry must go. No

[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.120]
to Democrats. It's not too late to, uh, draft someone anyone else's James Ridgeway.

[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:44.440]
It's on our website. It was in a village voice. With the air gushing out of John Kerry's balloon,

[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.180]
it may only be a matter of time until political, political insiders in Washington face the

[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.460]
dread reality that the junior senator from Massachusetts doesn't have what it takes to win and

[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.740]
has got to go. As arrogant and out of it as the Democratic political establishment is,

[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.240]
even these polls know the party's got to have someone to run against George Bush. They can't

[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.080]
exactly expect the president to self-destruct into thin air. With growing issues over his wealth,

[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.620]
which makes fellow plutonquat busy maturity case by comparison, the miasma over his medals

[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.400]
and ribbons or ribbons and medals, his uninspiring record in the Senate, yes, war nowhere,

[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.100]
and wish he watched the efforts to mimic Bill Clinton's triangulation gimmick, really protractor

[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:25.120]
factor, Kerry sinks day by day. The pros all know that the candidate who starts each morning by

[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.080]
having to explain himself as a goner. What to do? Look for the them biggies, whoever these are,

[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.460]
whoever they are these days, to sit down with the rich and arrogant presumptive nominee and try to

[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.840]
persuade him to take a hike. They can then return to businesses, usual resurrecting John Edwards,

[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:44.040]
who's still hanging around, or staging an open convention in Boston or both. If things proceed as

[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.900]
they are, the Dimbal Democratic leaders are going to be very sorry they screwed how are Dean,

[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:53.740]
is what it said. On the one hand, you really don't want to read that. On the other hand,

[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.300]
you're saying, well, haven't I been saying that the last few days? Yeah. That he's leaving me really

[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.800]
limp. But in any rate, just pass that along for your information. 56670560,

[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:10.520]
pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line, which of these people best fits the description

[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:17.440]
to Cuban. WQA and Hello. Not there. WQM Hello. Yes, I want to have somebody to your poll, Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.940]
Lincoln Diaz Balai. Beautiful choice. Anybody with that last name? Yes, definitely. And also,

[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.900]
remember, we have to ban the Bush brothers. Okay, bye. See you. We like the Blues brothers. We just

[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:34.500]
don't like the Bush brothers, right? Right. Or Brooks brothers. We like the Brooks brothers too.

[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:41.900]
And Greg likes their suits. In fact, that's about the only kind of sooty likes. Lincoln Diaz Balai.

[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.820]
That's what the hyphen, by the way. I'm sure you're aware that, Josh. There's a hyphen in there.

[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.980]
And it's not between the Lincoln and the Diaz. Hey, listen, I'm just trying to like help him along.

[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:56.440]
He's not, he's not too familiar with this big stuff. Valor the art. Let's see. Ilyana Ross

[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:03.340]
Layton's got 40 Alex Penelope's 22 Maris Grisias Gonzalez 13. Desi Arnez. We have it spelled

[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:11.460]
right down nine Rick Sanchez 7 Gloria Stefan 6 Ramones. How will Sanchez 5? Elliott Rodriguez from

[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:18.180]
channel four. We lose in news one. Many Diaz and Joe Carrillo out of 103 votes have none. They got

[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:24.020]
the big so far. That's amazing. All of Joe Carrillo just went on there. And Lincoln Diaz,

[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.740]
Valor will be on there momentarily. I'm sure once once Josh figures out where the hyphen goes,

[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.400]
where to stick it. They're going to put several all through just just to be on the safe side.

[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.280]
Not a bad idea. In fact, it's like us. We put a lot of like deep. Not necessarily. They belong here

[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:43.420]
just to keep Duff calm down. Somebody QA and hello. Oh, no. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing?

[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.360]
Pretty good. My vote was going to be for Ilyana Ross Layton. But, uh, that's your already

[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:54.260]
I got one that will make your poll. She's no celebrity. It's my brother's girlfriend. She's

[00:28:54.260 --> 00:29:00.520]
Cuban state. She wouldn't have sex with him for like three weeks. You know why? Because the

[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.880]
tarot guy told her not to. Right. These feelings you can't believe how superstitious they are.

[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.020]
They visit their brick or ears and their witch doctors. You get your pastries. Oh, man. You better

[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.320]
let them near your any of your personal items. They'll put a curse on you. Exactly. I think they'll

[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.840]
already have. Okay. Thanks for those pal. I see how do you like that? Now what was the guy that

[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.060]
somebody mentioned me yesterday? The uh, I don't remember the psychic. Oh, come on. You go

[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:30.900]
Chavez. He was on the lymph, the wrist. Yeah, we took the second one. He was on some poll. I don't

[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:36.980]
know. Spicoracci. Yeah, that was what was Spicoracci, man, with his uh, tarot cards and magnetic bracelets.

[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.100]
He's kind of misplaced. Oh, I bet. Five six and now I'm curious about one thing. When we do the one

[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:48.060]
later on about people are too black. Yeah. I guess that includes anybody of black skin, dark skin.

[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.200]
I don't know what you mean. Well, I make a difference between the so-called African Americans and

[00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:00.300]
like Jamaicans and Haitian, yeah, man, etc. All of these things. I thought the idea was to go for the

[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:05.800]
most professionally ethnic of whatever it is. Right. So if you're a professionally ethnic Jamaican,

[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.100]
then you must qualify. I see. Although I already like that. Thanks for clarifying that. Now we don't

[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.140]
know anything, but we'll probably hear from one five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the

[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:21.840]
AT&T line WQA. Hello. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Uh, what's put on the poll two thirds of the city of Miami?

[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:35.380]
How do you spell that? Uh, uh, with an M or just with as a, a, a, a, you as in US. Yeah, we put the, uh, you in

[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:41.020]
US, not USA, just US us Cubans is us. That's our new West store. We're going to be opening right at the

[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.740]
date, Broward line. Hey, listen, you can't keep running away, man. You can't keep running away. You

[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:51.900]
got to stay right there in South Florida where you people are. Like that guy at the airport. Oh,

[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.640]
you like it up there in Toronto. No Cubans. I should have said, yeah, you're right. Good point.

[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.240]
Let's see the look on his push then WQA. Hello.

[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.660]
Neil. Yes, sir. Somebody that definitely needs to be on your poll. I mean, this guy has a professional victim

[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.720]
and for a millionaire that can come off quite right. Jose Canseco. Jose Canseco. Good. And thank God, we got him out of town.

[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.540]
Damn. Thanks. Got him. Jose Canseco. Now, I just want to know that because it's a sports thing.

[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.720]
Is he Cuban? I didn't have any idea. You didn't know that. We got a street named after him in

[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.760]
Dave County. You think anybody who's not Cuban who's like, I mean, do we have like, uh, Jose Marti Boulevard?

[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.020]
Maybe we do Ronald Reagan Street Avenue. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about his

[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:37.500]
spanish. What his spanish have we named streets, boulevard's avenues, all of these things after

[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:44.580]
other than Cubans, right? Look at that Calgary 3 Detroit 2 Final Score.

[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:49.080]
Who winner the Flames lead that? All right. Go down Wingsman fast. All those Fone

[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.860]
Detroit fans and stuff. Oh, you're wrong. Neil, you're wrong. Yeah. Sure. It would no Steve

[00:31:53.860 --> 00:32:02.200]
I'm from, uh, why? The Y-Man of the I-Man. How's the Y-Man doing by the way? Is he still dead?

[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:07.640]
20 before 11 at 5.60 WQM. Like I said, we're just waiting till 11.30 tomorrow morning if you're

[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.940]
expecting great aim material today, forget about it.

[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.420]
I'm in law. This is sports radio 5.60 Q-A-M.

[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:23.060]
Crossed late-minute and I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels

[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.280]
and listening to the new Roque Amunista Hour.

[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.020]
Sick iron!

[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.020]

[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.260]
We are the hourgain Cubans of Miami.

[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.700]
Basically, but when we don't get our way, we stand far feet.

[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.440]
You would rent us out of mansors, we'll get angry.

[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.700]
And resort to black pink traffic in the street.

[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.900]
We know that kids are giving from a finger island,

[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.080]
but we're the most important people in our minds.

[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.400]
L-L-R.

[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.900]
The baby Jesus.

[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.880]
L-L-L-L-L-L-L.

[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.060]
We unite that fight for human causes.

[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.380]
Undue with the news cameras red, flashing light.

[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:36.540]
Action!

[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.240]
That was the honor!

[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.180]
That was the honor!

[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:43.100]
We are the most important people in the universe.

[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.900]
At least that's part of North-Tasda, my everyday county line.

[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.060]
You turn 10.46 at 5.60 W-D-Q-A-M,

[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.680]
which of these people best fits the description to Cuban,

[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.820]
which would be a great lead in that Max Castro thing.

[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.480]
I'll do it next time.

[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.120]
It's long Israel and the state of democracy in Miami.

[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.160]
Max Castro is the best writer that they ever had.

[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.820]
You know they got Carl Heiss and they've had some good people over the years,

[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.420]
but Max Castro was the greatest because he actually had the balls to tell the truth.

[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.940]
But the Harold ever had fired?

[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.260]
You're right.

[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:18.780]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.040]
Hey, Neil.

[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:20.780]
Yes sir.

[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:21.600]
Pretty good.

[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.260]
I can't believe it.

[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.400]
Nobody said this yet.

[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.020]
Christina?

[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.340]
The torture holds?

[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:26.740]
Christina.

[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:27.580]
Yeah.

[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.980]
She's pretty Cuban man.

[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.780]
And I got a no for you.

[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.760]
Pretty ugly, yes.

[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.420]
And I know we want to leave on her nether.

[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.380]
Leave on.

[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:36.860]
Leave on her nether.

[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:37.160]
Yeah.

[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:37.820]
I love you Miami.

[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.820]
Yeah, that was disgusting.

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.280]
Of course now he's out of time.

[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.320]
Leave on her nether.

[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.600]
Too Cuban.

[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.560]
Got it.

[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:46.680]
Got it.

[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:47.880]
Okay.

[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.420]
So far, Iliana, nobody can touch her.

[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.440]
I like the spelling on that one.

[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.720]
Iliana Ross-Latin.

[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.340]
We got like seven or eight Rs.

[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.200]
69 votes for old Iliana.

[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.620]
I wonder how Dexter's face is here when up.

[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.220]
You don't even know Dexter Latin do you?

[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.140]
Not personally though.

[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.440]
Iliana 71, Maris Grisias 29, Alex Pinellas 28,

[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.700]
Ricky Tiki Sanchez 16.

[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.240]
I'm a little disappointed in him.

[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.480]
I thought he'd be zooming up that list.

[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.800]
Desiarnes 14, Gloria Stefan 9, Ramones Howell Sanchez 8,

[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.460]
Joe Carrroyo 4.

[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.140]
Just went on there.

[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.420]
He'll start making a big move.

[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.560]
You'll see a big movement coming from Joe.

[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.640]
Don't be near it when it happens.

[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.280]
Lincoln Diaz-Balard spelled correctly three.

[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:32.840]
All right.

[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.720]
Elliott Rodriguez won.

[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:35.880]
Mani Diaz won.

[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.160]
And Jose Conzaco, he don't have any out of 184.

[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.120]
He's small potatoes now.

[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.260]
Out of sight, out of mind.

[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.500]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.520]
WQA and hello.

[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.320]
Emil.

[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.260]
Yes sir.

[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.920]
I don't know in station Hezan,

[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.220]
but the best Cuban tacos is Francisco Arruca.

[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.180]
Oh yeah, Francisco Arruca.

[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.080]
He's too Cuban for me.

[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:01.440]
You're right.

[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.500]
Thank you.

[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.300]
Francisco, now do we get Christine on air?

[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.760]
Do I get our skip over that too fast?

[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.260]
Francisco Arruca is the best radio show I am.

[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.900]
I want what time is he on?

[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.080]
I don't know.

[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.220]
Oh, remember.

[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.840]
He's a Cuban establishment Bashar, which is why I know that.

[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.840]
I know that.

[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.660]
He's a good guy.

[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.200]
Right.

[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.460]
He's somebody we like.

[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.580]
So let's not put him on air.

[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.720]
Maybe we won't we do who's not Cuban enough?

[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.060]
Right.

[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.640]
Who's not Jewish enough?

[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.860]
Who's not gay enough?

[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.180]
For the likes of a dead man.

[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.180]
Right.

[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.120]
Like Rock Hudson wouldn't have been gay enough.

[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.240]
Although the fact he looked pretty good,

[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.020]
they would like them anyway.

[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.060]
The professional queens.

[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.920]
5670560, pound 560.

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.520]
I was speaking to that kind of thing.

[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.220]
Elton John says American Idol vote is racist.

[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.020]
That's what he's saying.

[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.640]
British Rockstar Elton John,

[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.160]
a guest judge this month on US talent hunts TV series American Idol,

[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.900]
said yesterday that he found the voting

[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.260]
by the national viewing audience incredibly racist.

[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.040]
John, who heard the wannabe pop stars performance songs

[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.020]
during an appearance on the Fox TV show,

[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.880]
added his voice to a chorus of descent that followed last week's

[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.140]
shock exit of Black vocalist,

[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.720]
Jennifer Hudson, considered one of the top talents among

[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.040]
who was buying for a recording contract.

[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.940]
The three people I was really impressed with

[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.760]
and they just happened to be Black young female singers.

[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.000]
They all seem to be landing in the bottom three said,

[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.400]
John, commenting on the telly in which the lowest vote

[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.100]
geter is eliminated.

[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.380]
They have great voices, she said.

[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.780]
The fact that they're constantly in the bottom three

[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.040]
and I don't want to set myself up here,

[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.280]
but I find it incredibly racist.

[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.900]
Ms. John said at news conference

[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.080]
promoting per radio city musical concert

[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.340]
backed by an orchestra of students from London's Royal Academy of Music

[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.180]
and the Juilliard School of New York.

[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.440]
The show often gets more than 20 million people voting.

[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.340]
The other two singers grouped in the bottom

[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.680]
three of the seven remaining American Idol finalists last week

[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.380]
were Black Divas, Latoya London and Fantasia Barino.

[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.740]
The results moved the show host Ryan Sequest

[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.760]
to remind viewers that the series was a talent hub

[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.280]
and not a popularity contest.

[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.540]
America don't forget you have to vote for the talent

[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.040]
Sequest 74 closing the show.

[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.400]
You can't let talent like this slip through the cracks

[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.100]
through the, sorry, Fox TV Declan to comment.

[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.260]
Black Kuhner Rubens stuttered when the top prize last year,

[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.920]
but things are changing now a little bit.

[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:14.700]
Looks like.

[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.860]
So Ms. John has all been out of shape.

[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.880]
Good thing though, he's an acrobat.

[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.200]
That's what he tells us.

[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.480]
Is five six seven oh five sixty.

[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.720]
Pound five sixty on a 18 T and T in Verizon wireless line.

[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.760]
See, I just, I just say the lines to myself.

[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:30.800]
The ones I can't say anymore.

[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.720]
I get kind of like a silent.

[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.560]
Yeah, I get kind of like a silent chocolate.

[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.860]
I can't say the money here anymore.

[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.260]
No, say what the inside.

[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.480]
No, WQA.

[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:38.760]
Hello.

[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.400]
How about Sandra Cruz McRame?

[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.920]
Sandra Cruz is excellent.

[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.080]
Which is gracious.

[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.460]
There he goes.

[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:46.980]
Wow.

[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:47.980]
Sandra Cruz.

[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.080]
Out of sight.

[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:49.700]
Out of mind.

[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.560]
She is going to you'll say, well, although I don't know.

[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.360]
Is she going to move up?

[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.480]
I am she liacruz and I am dead now.

[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.100]
Well, that's good.

[00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.600]
That's one more thing and one less thing to worry about.

[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.040]
You know what?

[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.000]
When we're going to find a get rid of that thing.

[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:04.720]
Operation.

[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.380]
Look for the QM van today.

[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.400]
Five is seven anchors away at Beach Place in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.040]
Stop by to win a wheel for prizes and register to win 300 scratch off tickets from the Florida lottery.

[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.220]
Which is a major rip off by the way.

[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.500]
It's at the anchors away party for Air and Sea Show today at Beach Place.

[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.000]
And a lot of reason with that newity crap, you know.

[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.860]
Just give us a lump sum if we win 15 million.

[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.120]
Give us the 15 million.

[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.820]
No taxes like they do here in Canada.

[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.200]
And just give us the lump sum and up this annuity crap.

[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.240]
What a rip off that is.

[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.540]
It's like saying we're going to hang out of your money that you supposedly think you're getting.

[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.320]
We'll give you like a little lump in the beginning.

[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.080]
Somebody ought to give them a lump.

[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.220]
Oh, just in.

[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.840]
Godfair explosions are up thing and fallujah.

[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.840]
How many hours about three hours they had on it?

[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.540]
Just in it.

[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.140]
I'm seeing it.

[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.400]
They're just relentless.

[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.740]
Like it's breaking news.

[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.880]
WQA and hello.

[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.200]
Hey Neil.

[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:53.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.520]
How about that jailbird mayor of Halea, Rahul Martinez, huh?

[00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.340]
Rahul Martinez.

[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.280]
Good one.

[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.320]
Yeah, okay.

[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.340]
Have a good one.

[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:03.880]
How much you two?

[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.180]
You two, amigo.

[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.640]
Rahul Martinez.

[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.940]
See, I have to pause there because you got Rahul Sanchez and Rahul Martinez and

[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.680]
Elliott Gonzalez and

[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.000]
Elliott Gonzalez and

[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.860]
my name is

[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.300]
and we're as greasy as Gonzalez.

[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.640]
Lazarus Gonzalez.

[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.580]
Wow, I thought Gonzalez was like more of a Mexican name than Cuban.

[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.060]
Am I wrong?

[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:31.620]
Yes, I'm wrong.

[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.260]
It is.

[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.320]
You're correct.

[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.020]
Like Martinez.

[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:35.960]
It's still big.

[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:36.880]
Martinez.

[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:37.840]
Right.

[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.700]
I mean, we're all Martinez happens to be Cuban, but Martinez 90.

[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.800]
I would say 95% of the time would be Mexican.

[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.400]
I think you might be right.

[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.020]
And what would be like a recon name?

[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:46.780]
What are Puerto Ricans?

[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.600]
I don't want no smart ass comment from you.

[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.140]
You're Puerto Rican bashing soul.

[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.120]
Sanchez is a recon.

[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.440]
I'm a little overreconcredible.

[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.460]
Don't tell me Ricky Tiki Sanchez is Puerto Rican.

[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.300]
We know better than that.

[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.060]
I wish.

[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:57.860]
Cause he.

[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.160]
Like I wish Bob Kunst were straight.

[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:02.360]
Yeah.

[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.180]
I mean, can we get rid of some of these people that we have enough baggage to carry already?

[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.680]
We don't want some of these people in our flock.

[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.940]
Let's recategorize them.

[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:10.400]
Right.

[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.880]
56670560, like a freaking Carlos out there at the front desk.

[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.340]
Oh, what's the category for that?

[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.480]
We can't say it.

[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.240]
WQAM.

[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:20.480]
Hello.

[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.180]
Hello.

[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:22.720]
Hello.

[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:22.860]
Hello.

[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.120]
I am.

[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:23.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.020]
Well, this is Anthony.

[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.480]
I want to have a name for your poll.

[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:28.720]
Lay it on us, Anthony.

[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:29.500]
OK.

[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:33.500]
It's my wife put a little hilly on the boy that can float it over.

[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.900]
And also El Gato from my wife's series.

[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:37.800]
OK.

[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.120]
Thanks, Pally.

[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:39.760]
All right.

[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:40.820]
Now, what do you,

[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.520]
I'm Gonzalez is too Cuban.

[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.320]
Now, what are you are groaning about the other members?

[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.540]
Some character from some TV show.

[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.600]
Well, don't worry about that.

[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.580]
We're not going to put that on it.

[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.520]
Just remind me why do you take these things so to hard?

[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:52.660]
I am.

[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:53.400]
Yes.

[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.080]
Sounds like it.

[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.200]
I mean, you sound like you were a droid.

[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:55.920]
Bro, you were right.

[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:56.480]
Stupid comment.

[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.380]
I don't want to.

[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.780]
Oh, and a guy was a good guy.

[00:41:58.780 --> 00:41:59.220]
He would.

[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.720]
Well, he meant well, now he feels bad.

[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:02.140]
Cause you were.

[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.880]
Yes, he sounded OK to me.

[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.020]
He sounded like he never stole a freight train.

[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.920]
And you know, you're starting to sound like Eric now, man.

[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.880]
Oh, you've been hanging around with him too long.

[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.620]
Whoa, gee, I put change the picture at 9.30 in the morning

[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.160]
every day.

[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.280]
Like, how do every day deal?

[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.500]
Whoa, where's my cross sandwich with cheese?

[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.660]
Man, this too emotional.

[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.340]
That just be more calm like me.

[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:24.980]
OK.

[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.500]
Yeah, just calm down.

[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.960]
Be a little more level headed like me.

[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.000]
Not in an emotional basket case.

[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.020]
I thought you people anything over all of these years,

[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.680]
these 500 years, I've been sweating over this smelly microphone.

[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.280]
I'm going to get the live salt spray out.

[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.840]
That's a one good thing about having this studio

[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.360]
is nobody else is sitting here with their germs all over this mic.

[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.560]
You can get that extra toothbrush and brush the microphone.

[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:50.280]
Thanks to George and to a Josh who teamed up to get me

[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:53.020]
by Hooker by Crook My Two Radius toothbrushes up here.

[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.880]
They're four different people to get you.

[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:55.340]
Right.

[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.620]
That's because QAM is too much of a bunch of cheap bastards

[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.440]
to pay for the FedEx to send it up here.

[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.940]
Man, oh, man, you people.

[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.900]
Wow, wait till you start seeing his expense tickets coming in.

[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.800]
I could have moved.

[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.380]
I just got to change the drum.

[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.980]
It's coming today from office depot.

[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.000]
Wait till you see that's going to be 300 bucks Canadian.

[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.940]
That's about 210 to 120 plus of GST and PST

[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.520]
and all this other crap.

[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.220]
Flight of the radius to the right.

[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.360]
So flight of the radius and I got up here.

[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.080]
How do you like that?

[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.260]
So stick that in your pipe and eat it

[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.360]
in accounting there at the Beasley Broadcasting.

[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.000]
You cheap bastards you.

[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.820]
Only in the banana republic baby.

[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:37.920]
Only in Miami.

[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.180]
You that day unpredictable.

[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:08.940]
Breath taking.

[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:10.700]
Life threatening.

[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.160]
Cuban rafting unbeaten.

[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.180]
Will your way to something better?

[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.140]
Will faster.

[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:19.920]
No faster.

[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.100]
Become the shark.

[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.440]
You got it well much faster than that.

[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.880]
Well, damn it.

[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:24.900]
Pain for him brother.

[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.400]
You West Navy.

[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.360]
OK, I forgot to do the spoppin' food and break

[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.880]
because you got me so whipped up into a frenzy

[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.120]
about something which I forgot already.

[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.240]
Yeah, all good.

[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.140]

Got it.

[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.800]
Okay, so far, which of these people best fit the description

[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.700]
of two Cuban.

[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.640]
We did yesterday two Jewish, two gay,

[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.380]
and now we're doing two Cuban and the last two hours, two black,

[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.480]
as in professionally killing the blank.

[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.140]
Right.

Ricky Tiki Sanchez 20.

[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.420]
He's moving up slowly.

[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:50.860]
He's creeping up.

[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:52.780]
Just kind of like he did an act on from the stadium.

[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.740]
Creeping up very slowly and about a bing.

[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.380]
Desi Arne has 15.

[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.740]

Joe Carrillo only 6.

[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.300]
Aren't you surprised by that?

[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:06.720]
No.

[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:07.860]
Why not?

[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:08.780]
He's out of his...

[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.400]
He's a...

[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.640]
What's with all that stiff competition?

[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.280]
Jose Conzaco 4.

[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.420]

Mani Diaz's got one.

[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.480]
His son printed it up.

[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.640]
It's a $53 bill.

[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.140]
Rahul Martinez won.

[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.020]
And little alien 8 to 146 has got only one.

[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.720]
Yeah, why do we want to pick on poor little alien?

[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.240]
As if he's got a choice.

[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.100]
Right, poor little alien 8, though.

[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.100]
Man, we don't want to pick on him.

[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.040]
He was just a pawn.

[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.400]
He was just a pawn in an ugly chess game.

[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:39.780]
Oh my goodness.

[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.420]
This is the worst thing ever happened in Miami.

[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.260]
Yeah, right.

[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:45.940]
WQAM.

[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:46.200]
Hello.

[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.380]
Good morning, sir.

[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:47.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.580]
When is Diaz?

[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.360]
All right.

[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.380]
How about from from radio,

[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.080]
man, be the ampole Armando Perez Roda?

[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.480]
Is he an antel?

[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.740]
Oh, his name.

[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.060]
Armando Perez Roda.

[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.180]
He's their director.

[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:03.220]
Rodea.

[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.800]
I would assume so.

[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.240]
Probably like the TV show, Roda.

[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.220]
He was probably on that too.

[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.200]
Okay, thanks a lot, amigo.

[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.040]
All right.

[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.040]
Watch your ass.

[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.560]
Okay, Armando, what is it?

[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:14.140]
Roda?

[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:14.520]
I don't know.

[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.060]
I forgot it all.

[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.360]
Roda.

[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.060]
I remember there was a bad TV show too.

[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:17.900]
Never heard of it.

[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.240]
That could have made the podium today.

[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.340]
The worst TV show of all time.

[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.040]
Roda.

[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.460]
This max cancer thing.

[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.240]
I'm like squeezing it.

[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.460]
I'm so anxious to read it.

[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.480]
But it looks like it started.

[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.740]
Well, no, once I get started,

[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.760]
it'll blow off the whole audience

[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.000]
because it's long and ponderous.

[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.220]
And I don't want to like do all this reading

[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.480]
because it's like terminal and ponderous.

[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:34.600]
Good.

[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.560]
Then the girl come in,

[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.260]
bitching and moaning.

[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:36.460]
What?

[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.820]
No, we don't want no sound effects.

[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:39.380]
WQAM.

[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:39.640]
Hello.

[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:40.680]
All right.

[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:41.960]
Pretty good.

[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.500]
Well, it's called a fucking meal.

[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:44.840]
Speaking to him.

[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:45.800]
Okay.

[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.040]
What we're going to call him.

[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.120]
Diaz, you were trying to think

[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.880]
of with Walter Mercado, the guy on TV.

[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.480]
Walter Mercado, that's the lady.

[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.180]
I mean, the guy.

[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:53.820]
The lady.

[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:54.800]
Yeah.

[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.220]
Thanks a million.

[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.220]
All right.

[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:57.380]
Cool.

[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.600]
See, Walter Mercado,

[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.320]
that's the the HBGB

[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.640]
thorough card reading.

[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:03.100]
Yeah.

[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:03.880]
Chris Schroeder.

[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:04.660]
He's got a crystal ball.

[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.020]
He's got crystal balls.

[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.160]
pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T

[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.420]
and Verizon wireless line.

[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.960]
So many Cubans in so little time.

[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.000]
Only two hours for this.

[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.600]
But then we're spreading it around.

[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.080]
At least nobody can blame off us

[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.360]
of picking on anybody specific.

[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.400]
I've always said, we'll pick on all of them.

[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.420]
We're going to do a religious one too, you know.

[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.260]
Well, there's so many.

[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.120]
Yeah, but for the weekend for Friday.

[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.300]
Yeah.

[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.320]
But how would you, how would you,

[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.240]
what would it be?

[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.760]
The biggest religious fanatic.

[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:34.860]
I see.

[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.340]
Marvel, put that on the table at our next programming meeting.

[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.640]
A nice thing done school.

[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.680]
When I have my next programming meeting with myself.

[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:42.960]
WQM, hello.

[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.100]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:44.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.300]
How about a set of Romero?

[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.040]
Gotta pay the Joker environment.

[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.220]
Just out of the matter.

[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.380]
That's not a bad choice.

[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.560]
Um, the guy they just call, uh,

[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.320]
what's the mega powder recon our Cuban?

[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:55.520]
Is he really?

[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.740]
Uh, what's the mega powder recon our Cuban?

[00:48:59.180 --> 00:48:59.620]
Are you sure?

[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.260]
Yeah.

[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.300]
Okay, thanks.

[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:01.600]
All right.

[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.140]
Thanks for many more in Burst.

[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.740]
And we don't want to put no weekends on this list.

[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.740]
Georgia get really high preventating about that.

[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.840]
A lot of the discussions about the media people on TV.

[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:09.360]
A lot of them.

[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.460]
We already put him on there.

[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.260]
Walter Mercado.

[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.300]
Yeah, we did not.

[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:12.760]
We did?

[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.240]
Yes.

[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.460]
Well, Eric said I have to take your talk

[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.560]
at three a teeth again, Mr.

[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.820]
I'm telling you that right now.

[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.840]
He's talking to the people here.

[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.080]
He wants to say yes.

[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:20.720]
Do you hear it?

[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:20.900]
Yes.

[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.340]
Yes, that's a style.

[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:23.960]
Man, it's his style.

[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:24.800]
What?

[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.680]
That's a stick.

[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.240]
Anyway, well, they didn't show up on mine yet,

[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.820]
but they will have a haircut or movement.

[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.720]
As soon as he finishes his third, uh,

[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.060]
breakfast goes Sam, whatever he's got.

[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.480]
And before anybody calls up Don Francisco,

[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.540]
remember, he's like a Chilean Jew.

[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.020]
You see, he's not he's not Cuban at all.

[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:42.720]
Didn't he die?

[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.060]
Don Francisco?

[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.200]
From San Marojigan.

[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:46.940]
I don't think so.

[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:47.900]
I'll be damned.

[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.680]
Five, I would have sworn something happened with him.

[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.520]
He's he was talking about him not that long ago.

[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.660]
Don Francisco, I thought he was given protection for

[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:57.200]
Frater while they were in the West Coast in Vegas.

[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.540]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T

[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.180]
and Verizon wireless line.

[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.020]
In fact, I think what we're going to do is just play the whole

[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.460]
uh, 1130 tomorrow morning on a whole station.

[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.460]
Just play the audio from the Godfather.

[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.500]
Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again.

[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:14.760]
Double click.

[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:16.300]
Ever.

[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:17.180]
Back.

[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:18.760]
WQA.

[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.040]
Hello.

[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.200]
QA.

[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:20.480]
Hello.

[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.540]
I think you're getting all.

[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:21.980]
Hola.

[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.060]
Hello.

[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:23.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:25.760]
Gloria,

[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.460]
Estefan.

[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.000]
I think she might be on there.

[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:28.360]
Thank you.

[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.460]
And by the way, uh, we could put her husband

[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.740]
under the bottom, but we won't.

[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.720]
Don't say boat when you're talking about Gloria.

[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.600]
Hit a little problem there.

[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.000]
Yeah.

[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.600]
How that all work out.

[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.660]
I don't want to know.

[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:38.540]
It's a rhetorical question.

[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.440]
Right WQA.

[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:39.680]
Hello.

[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:40.880]
Bill Neal.

[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:41.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.500]
Hey, welcome.

[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:46.040]
But anyway, I got one for you.

[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:46.440]
Okay.

[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:46.900]
Andy Garcia.

[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.480]
Andy Garcia, who's busy.

[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:50.400]
If you're waiting out there and put on a dog and pony show

[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.800]
in front of the emergency, I saw.

[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.160]
Glad to have you.

[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:53.800]
Thanks so much.

[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.160]
I have to have you got anywhere.

[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:58.220]
Vincent.

[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.820]
Vincent from Godfather 3 Andy Garcia.

[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.180]
He's uh, he ain't no thing.

[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:03.700]
You know what I mean?

[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.160]
He's just uh, he's okay.

[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:05.940]
I'd quit.

[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:07.260]
Overrated actor.

[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.700]
Name me a movie in which he was great.

[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.240]
Which it was great.

[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.800]
Then which he was outstanding.

[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:13.580]
Yeah, touchables.

[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.380]
Was he going to say outstanding?

[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.420]
I saw it on touchables.

[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.500]
I didn't think it was outstanding.

[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.800]
I was outstanding outside the door there for a while and standing in the train station.

[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:22.920]
He was fine.

[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:23.660]
He ain't great.

[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.360]
Now he's not you know, I'm not knocking him just because he was there.

[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:26.900]
Yes, I am.

[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.160]
I know he lost all credibility with me when it came in there.

[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.580]
I mean, talk about grandstanding.

[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.540]
When did we ever see Andy Garcia doing anything in soft photo with other Cubans

[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.300]
or with Anglos or anybody?

[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:38.340]
Maybe they made him an offering.

[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:38.880]
Couldn't refuse.

[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.620]
I see.

[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.280]
There you go.

[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.080]
He had to be supposed to stay close to Michael.

[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.240]
Love somebody else.

[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.780]
I mean, that was of course with the Shnons like that.

[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.460]
The fact that they actually resurrected her and she did this.

[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.540]
What did she get the awards for?

[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.200]
She wrote directing writing.

[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:55.520]

[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.640]
I mean, she just leaves me limp.

[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.600]
Come on.

[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.780]
Sophia Coppola.

[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:01.500]
My guess.

[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.020]
Directing.

[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:02.720]
Was it directing?

[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.340]
Yeah, I got the direct part right.

[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.500]
Somebody cue him.

[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:06.740]
Hello.

[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.400]
Yeah, is Ricardo Montabon Cuban?

[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.120]
No, that's a good question.

[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.280]
No, I think he's a standard.

[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:13.120]
All right.

[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.520]
And then what you're about to watch your tongue too, you said stiff competition.

[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:18.600]
No, that's right.

[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.060]
Good point.

[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:19.880]
All right.

[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:23.640]
And you also said that John Kerry is limp.

[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:24.780]
Uh-oh.

[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.080]
Okay.

[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.980]
We'll mark those down for duct to get off the tape.

[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.800]
I'll guess step something to do anyway.

[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.500]
Get off the tape.

[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:31.140]
Okay, duct.

[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.340]
Start marking those down.

[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:32.560]
Duh.

[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:33.900]
Get off this instantly.

[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:34.200]
Right.

[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.740]
Well, he gave us a little gentle prodding this morning.

[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.460]
You know, he's getting a little nervous, which is so unusual for him.

[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.720]
A little bit nervous now that he's hearing things on a station.

[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.400]
They're like tiptoeing around the tulips.

[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.260]
In fact, we even had that on the pool the other day.

[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.380]
Tiptoeing through the tulips.

[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.040]
Maybe it was a little, a little thing that happened to us.

[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.020]
Wasn't our fault.

[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.160]
There's when somebody called in the name of that song.

[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.820]
We just decided, well, maybe we'll start tiptoeing a little bit too.

[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.580]
Start dancing right along the edge.

[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:00.700]
Better back off, man.

[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.260]
Back away from that edge.

[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.360]
Where they're going to send you right to the ledge.

[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.180]
Oh, guess what?

[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.540]
The fight for a rack is going on.

[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.120]
Really?

[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:08.760]
Did you know that?

[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.060]
No, I thought this should have accomplished.

[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.540]
Now we're looking at in a job, the Holy City.

[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.020]
I mean, you got a bunch of crazy religious people over there

[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.780]
who have no idea what democracy is all about.

[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.540]
Many of them don't want it anyway.

[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.580]
But we're going to force it on your ass

[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.400]
whether you wondered not.

[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.060]
How do you like that?

[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.420]
Talk about an offer you can't refuse.

[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.660]
We got to make it look good somehow while we're there.

[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.620]
And of course, keeping in mind that none of this had anything to do

[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:33.020]
I was supposed to be there in the first place.

[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.860]
But they don't confuse us with the facts.

[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.800]
Because even at the Woodward's, says,

[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.760]
oh, well, he's so concerned about freedom for people.

[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.380]
Well, when we go get freedom back in the US,

[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.800]
that's what a lot of us are waiting to see, huh?

[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:45.500]
Freedom back in the USA.

[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:46.660]
Yeah.

[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.180]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:50.600]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.920]
Yesterday you had a poll out, and I wanted to make a correction real quick.

[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.620]
And then add them to this poll.

[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.700]
We made a mistake.

[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.720]
There was a mistake yesterday.

[00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.540]
Oh, no.

[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.820]
Oh, my God.

[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:06.880]
Yesterday some full call in your show and put Wayne I think on as a Jew.

[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.420]
He's a Cuban.

[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.860]
We didn't put it on there.

[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.820]
He never made the list.

[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.800]
We didn't put him on.

[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.120]
He's a Cuban Catholic.

[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.660]
Everybody needs to get that straight.

[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.300]
Wayne I think is not Cuban.

[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.340]
Okay.

[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:19.940]
That was funny.

[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.560]
It was funny.

[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.560]
Oh, he thought so.

[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.120]
Oh, my God.

[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.080]
I'm on the inside like that.

[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:25.560]
I see.

[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.280]
Well, we're just the pukin on the outside.

[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:27.920]
I like that.

[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.100]
That was pathetic.

[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.700]
And he's screaming screaming.

[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:33.300]
He's a Cuban Catholic.

[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.400]
We're going to let him deliver his line.

[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.820]
And the Cubans don't want him either.

[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.100]
Okay, pal, so forget about that.

[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.160]
Catholic part is right.

[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.580]
He's a cubald not a cubald.

[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.520]
And I'll tell you what else Joe Robbie.

[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.920]
There was a professional Catholic for you.

[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.900]
Although at least he has sprung the money for the stadium.

[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:45.780]
He built it.

[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.480]
The stadium at Wayne's stool.

[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.780]
I mean, bought WDQAM.

[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:50.040]
Hello.

[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:51.400]
Hello.

[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.040]
Yeah, I got a couple of Cubans to put on the list.

[00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.060]
Yes, couple.

[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.680]
Well, I mean, I love to do more than one.

[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.560]
Well, we'll see what the first one is.

[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.520]
Bonn and his.

[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:04.980]
Bob.

[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:04.980]

[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.560]
He is the whole.

[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:07.840]
The Sears guy.

[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.320]
Bob Vila is Cuban.

[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.300]
Yeah, I'm having the wrong question.

[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.020]
The way we end up on Huggie Bear.

[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.500]
Bob Vila is Cuban.

[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.200]
Do you believe that?

[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.560]
Well, he is, but they're not answering the question.

[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.040]
Which of these people?

[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.780]
Well, maybe he thinks he's too Cuban.

[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.420]
I don't know.

[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.040]
He's just the making a list of people who are Cuban.

[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.340]
That's all he's open up the phone book and see anybody

[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.040]
whose name ends in Z is probably Cuban.

[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:29.740]
We'll be busy.

[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:30.540]
Yeah.

[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.000]
Oh, yeah, just get the day-cowdy book.

[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.540]
30 pages of Rodriguez's alone.

[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:35.180]
Right.

[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:35.900]
How many?

[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.080]
About 30, man.

[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:38.680]
Let me read your rights.

[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.380]
My bad, because I'm not reading that question.

[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:41.980]
Which of these people best things?

[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:43.760]
You're right.

[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.200]
All they want to do is make a list.

[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:45.500]
Whatever.

[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.800]
Here's a list of gay people.

[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:47.580]
Here's a list of Jews.

[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.840]
Here's a list of Catholics.

[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.240]
Here's a list of Cubans.

[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:51.420]
And then we get to the black thing.

[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.800]
They're going to be like, everybody named Johnson.

[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:53.360]
Okay.

[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.920]
Anyone with a nice tan, no name?

[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.320]
Oh my god.

[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.340]
Oh, Halle Berry.

[00:55:58.560 --> 00:55:59.200]
She's too black.

[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:00.540]
Right.

[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.280]
Not really.

[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:02.580]
Not really.

[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.340]
Which of these people best fits the description?

[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:06.380]
Too Cuban.

[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.340]
Bob Vila ain't too Cuban.

[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:09.640]
In fact, if you wouldn't have told us,

[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.120]
just like that, the little Anderson thing.

[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.440]
The little Anderson is too gay based on what?

[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.200]
So I think to make things easier and a lot simpler,

[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.660]
because we have a lot of simple minded people.

[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.560]
So, Freda, especially in this audience,

[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.420]
what we're going to just do is do what you say.

[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.300]
Just name a bunch of Cubans, you know?

[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:25.720]
Right.

[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:26.840]
How many Cubans can you name?

[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:27.340]
Right.

[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.760]
How many dead people can you name?

[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.560]
How many great actors can you name?

[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.480]
How many yet?

[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.600]
I got a few for you.

[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:34.500]
Let's see.

[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:36.100]
It's almost, it's coming up on 1130.

[00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.580]
You realize it's almost the 24 hour demarcation point

[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:39.460]
before the...

[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.460]
A big moment coming tomorrow.

[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.720]
My name is Len Lohl.

[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:46.780]
This is the O.F.I. City.

[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.600]
You're the only two way.

[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.900]
You're the only two way.

[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.380]
Where the youth may continue.

[00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:59.300]
All right.

[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:01.860]
56.

[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:03.920]
156.

[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.660]
156.

[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:09.180]
One McGilgan Zone's father of William

[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:14.640]
meets with his attorney in preparation to take his son back to Cuba.

[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.740]
Well, Mr. Gonzalez, how was your trip?

[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.460]
Very good.

[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:18.940]
Gracias.

[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.100]
Well, do you have any questions before we go any further?

[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.200]
CCC, this box with the pictures.

[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:26.380]
It's in kind of a...

[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:26.920]
What is this?

[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.060]
Oh, that's a television.

[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.580]
Oh, Terry.

[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.300]
Mr. Lohl, what does...

[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.360]
What does mean?

[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:35.660]
Pardon me?

[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.560]
What does...

[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:41.600]
Well, it means what's up like what's going on?

[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.820]
What does...

[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.740]
Uh, right.

[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.460]
It's a greeting.

[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.140]
What does...

[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.660]
Now, I know that you're uncomfortable being here.

[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.300]
This is a very difficult time for you, too.

[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:52.520]
Mmm.

[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:53.240]
Mmm.

[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.300]
What is it, sir?

[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.980]
Oh, this pizza hut.

[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.800]
Stuffed crust pizza is incredible.

[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.860]
How did they get the mozzarella cheese into the crust?

[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.140]
Uh, I'm not sure.

[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.900]
So, as I was saying...

[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:08.060]
What?

[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.340]
Yeah.

[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.440]
As I was saying, we will try to make your stay here as comfortable as possible

[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.680]
and get your home as quickly as possible.

[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.620]
Bye, bye, bye!

[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.040]
Are you going somewhere, sir?

[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.800]
No, I'm listening to the new CD by the boy band InSync

[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.600]
with my new Sony Discman.

[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.800]
It's incredible.

[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.220]
Yeah, uh, yes, Mr. Gonzalez.

[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:31.640]
They are quite incredible, but we'll be meeting with the...

[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.280]
Just another play and you're getting the two.

[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.880]
You must take me, but it ain't no lie.

[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.000]
Bye, bye, bye!

[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.460]
Oh, God, sir, don't you want to get this over and get back to Cuba?

[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.760]
What do you loco?

[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.400]
I love it here.

[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.460]
There's like 300 channels on cable

[00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.720]
and I can watch all the yanking games.

[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:48.680]
What, sir?

[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:49.940]
Mr. Lawyer?

[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.260]
What is it, Mr. Gonzalez?

[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:52.400]
Baza!

[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.760]
You know, one thing I'm wondering, at what age, since this is kind of like a

[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.040]
ethnic custom, I guess,

[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.880]
and why is the oboeil is prohibited from checking out

[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:02.920]
aliens packing?

[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:03.840]
Bats, third man!

[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:04.180]
Oh!

[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:07.960]
Which of these people best fits the description of?

[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:08.660]
Too Cuban.

[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.640]
How much you didn't know that, didn't you?

[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.700]
No, I didn't.

[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:14.440]
If you remember...

[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:14.940]
My grandma's dead, then.

[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.360]

Joe Carrroyo 9.

[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.520]
Very surprising to me.

[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.500]
Cedar Cruz 7.

[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.280]

[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:41.560]
3.

[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:41.800]

[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:43.360]

15.

[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:58.500]
And Walter Mercado is a Puerto Rico.

[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:58.980]
I know that.

[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:00.340]
No, who?

[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.100]
We just found that out.

[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.640]
So we discovered something all day who says this is in a highly educational show.

[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.300]
Walter Mercado, she's a rican.

[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.700]
We'll do a few more of these, but I want to read that Max Castro thing.

[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.260]
He's Cuban.

[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.160]
WQM line 9.

[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:14.440]
Hello.

[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.580]
What's up, Neil?

[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.460]
How you doing, sir?

[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.300]
I got something for your poll this guy.

[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.460]
The most milking Cuban that has ever lived.

[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.080]
He's okay.

[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.180]
He makes George look like a piker.

[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.220]
Jorge Mascarnosa.

[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.540]
Jorge Mascarnosa.

[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:28.900]
All right.

[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:29.480]
That man.

[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.780]
Okay, he was going to go on to a rant there.

[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.180]
But I don't want to.

[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:35.580]
Well, that man, he's a little pissed off and fired up this guy.

[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.460]
Who can blame Jorge Mascarnosa?

[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.340]
Maseo Manos is my question.

[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.380]
Got him.

[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:42.780]
Meadows.

[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.400]
Have a good one.

[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.220]
What did I say?

[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:45.980]
Mase.

[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:49.840]
WQM.

[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.080]
Hello.

[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.180]
I got one for you, Neil.

[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:52.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.180]
Maria Conchita Alonso.

[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.260]
She's a Maria.

[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.000]
I was in that move.

[01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.160]
She's a Lanso.

[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.380]
How about Miriam Alonso?

[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.160]
She's done everybody movie ever made.

[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.380]
Okay, thanks.

[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.660]
What do you know?

[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.240]
Yeah, what?

[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.240]
She's an inside of the thing.

[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.120]
It was between the brothers.

[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:12.120]
I don't know what she he's talking about.

[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.080]
Maria Conchita Alonso.

[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.340]
She's a marginal I could say.

[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.820]
I had no idea she was Cuban though, but whatever.

[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:16.860]
Well, now you know,

[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.780]
and he's too Cuban for this guy.

[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:23.000]
Maybe she's just too Dan Cuban for this guy.

[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.300]
Okay, so I like one of your people.

[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:24.880]
Okay.

[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:25.680]
One of those Jewish.

[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:30.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T.

[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.820]
Everybody's got the labels, man.

[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.640]
We're in proudly.

[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.340]
I'm Italian.

[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.000]
I'm Jewish.

[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:34.920]
I'm a shuffling bag.

[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.140]
I'm a, you know, everybody's got the label.

[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.720]
She I, I'm a Sunni.

[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.020]
Yeah, don't label me.

[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.220]
Oh, brother.

[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.760]
I am so sick of that.

[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.780]
That's a one thing in the world.

[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.300]
If I could change one thing

[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.720]
that would make the world like paradise,

[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.620]
that would be it.

[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.980]
Eliminate air be label.

[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.140]
We wake up tomorrow morning

[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.060]
and everybody is just a person.

[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.540]
Just a guy, a galley,

[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:54.600]
whatever they are.

[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.500]
That's that's it.

[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.980]
Not a Christian, not a Jew,

[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.660]
not a Muslim, not a Buddhist.

[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:02.680]
By the way,

[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.440]
a ha, a cello to the Dalai Lama.

[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.260]
Hello, Dalai.

[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.100]
There's another one.

[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:08.760]
Well, what's that?

[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.100]
What can you tell me what that's all about?

[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.400]
Seriously, what is that?

[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.240]
It's like the Pope thing.

[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.120]
It's another state of mind.

[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.820]
We're supposed to care and revere him

[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.400]
and whatever.

[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.500]
Based on what?

[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:16.980]

[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:17.800]
We'll say this.

[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.720]
I like him better than the Pope.

[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:19.380]
Yeah.

[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.060]
Well, that's for a while.

[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.240]
You can name just about anybody.

[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.240]
I like him better than the Pope.

[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.720]
I like Hanrik Himmler better than the Pope

[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.560]
because he's dead.

[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:26.520]
I don't like you.

[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.400]
Don't be better than the Pope.

[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:27.900]
No.

[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:28.580]
No.

[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.520]
In fact, that you're right.

[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.360]
The Pope is down to Richter scale a little bit.

[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.000]
A couple of notches.

[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:33.580]
Number two.

[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:34.660]
We're coming out.

[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.800]
I don't, I don't think.

[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.640]
That would be a good pull.

[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.420]
Who's number one?

[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.300]
Unless, well, we know it.

[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:40.780]
It's automatic.

[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.900]
W in this crowd.

[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:42.240]
Yeah.

[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:44.060]
WQA and hello.

[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.280]
Good afternoon or good morning, Neil.

[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.260]
Good evening, Kiosar.

[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:47.660]
How you doing?

[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.120]
Good evening.

[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.540]
I'm just actually driving to Halea

[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.340]
so I can get name about a hundred people in here.

[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.800]
How about Jackie Ness Brawl?

[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.480]
Jackie Ness Brawl is disgusting on channel six

[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.780]
on NBC6 where they screw it over by Weaver Real Bad.

[01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:58.700]
Yeah.

[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.460]
She needs to go back to LeVanna.

[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.240]
Have a great day.

[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.580]
I'll be delighted to pack away.

[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.140]
Media No 2.

[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:04.700]
Thank you.

[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.940]
And Iguaya Beta or Yogi Beta.

[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.380]
Jackie Ness Brawl in ESPRAL.

[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.800]
She is nauseating.

[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.100]
She's another one that like was was a network anchor

[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.360]
not network something for a while.

[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:16.620]
Right?

[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:17.100]
NBC.

[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.680]
I don't know.

[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.160]
And what happens is after they prove beyond a shadow of a doubt

[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:21.920]
that they can't cut it,

[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.340]
then they ship them back to Miami.

[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.460]
Ricky Tiki Sanchez.

[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.600]
They saw through him.

[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.320]
It has to be seen about the first five minutes.

[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.180]
He was hyper-fed lady.

[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:30.340]
Sweating up a storm sawed all their chairs.

[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.840]
And he got shipped back.

[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.900]
And Michelle Gillan don't forget about that bitch.

[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.360]
Oh no.

[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:36.160]
I didn't.

[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:36.840]
Got sent back.

[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:37.400]
Michelle.

[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:37.980]
Man.

[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:38.600]
Michelle.

[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.320]
We just despise you honey.

[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.460]
Don't take it personal.

[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.820]
How about her Chevy trucks?

[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:44.140]
What is it?

[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.780]
She's uncovering the South Florida white slave

[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.180]
or whatever slave slavery ring.

[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.340]
Oh brother.

[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.540]
Spick slavery ring.

[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.060]
Whatever it is.

[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.880]
Why couldn't she have been in like midnight express?

[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.020]
In a Turkish prison?

[01:03:59.360 --> 01:03:59.580]
Yeah.

[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, eating Turkish Taffy.

[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.020]
McCallum.

[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.240]
WQM. Hello.

[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:07.520]
Neil.

[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.300]
Yes sir.

[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.500]
I think I might have the definitive one.

[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:11.160]
Okay.

[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.660]
This could be the one we've been looking for.

[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.100]
And here is the title of true Cuban,

[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.080]
which means can you be any more nauseating?

[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.660]
How about Jose Basuto?

[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.700]
Jose Basuto.

[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:22.620]
Yeah.

[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.040]
He's pretty disgusting.

[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.460]
Real pain in the...

[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:26.760]
Well, we're sorry.

[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.460]
Okay, thank you.

[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:29.300]
Asked.

[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.120]
Jose Basuto.

[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.320]
You got a BASU LTO Basuto?

[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:32.780]
See.

[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.160]
All this old crap that goes on and never just changes.

[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.040]
We've got the Latin Grammys.

[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:39.640]
They're y'all.

[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.620]
And we're going to do this.

[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.720]
We're going to be riding in the streets again.

[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.020]
We're going to be, uh, brother.

[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.900]
How many times does Miami have to show it's collective?

[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:47.360]
Reckon.

[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.320]
Asked to the world before finally somebody says

[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.940]
enough of this crap already, huh?

[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.520]
How many times does that have to happen?

[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.460]
About 30, man.

[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:53.740]
Yeah.

[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.260]
A year.

[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.200]
Oh, no.

[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.040]
They can't come here.

[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.840]
And the thing I keep thinking about every time I see a picture

[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.260]
that, because they keep showing on these clips

[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.100]
in the Latin MSNBC from the past,

[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.120]
because they're living in a past,

[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.160]
uh, the Pope and Fidel.

[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.160]
That's one of their favorites.

[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:08.040]
Oh, yeah.

[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.440]
How come it isn't anybody else

[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.900]
who ever even shared a cigar or a Stogi,

[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:14.200]
sent him a, uh, plastic Stogi or something,

[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.080]
or a chalk with the cigarette, whatever.

[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.760]
They're communist, they're communist,

[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.100]
but El Papas.

[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.360]
See, I told you when he was down there,

[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.740]
what a dilemma it created and it did.

[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.180]
And they got no answer for that.

[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.860]
And since the Pope went there,

[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.440]
their wonderful glorious trip to quote,

[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.360]
the Christian Amman Pura from CNN,

[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.320]
another phony baloney,

[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.860]
another state of mind bitch to quote her,

[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.060]
oh, the Holy Father,

[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.300]
this is going to change things.

[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.440]
Did anything change?

[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:37.680]
No.

[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.640]
Is there freedom in Cuba?

[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:38.880]
No.

[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.060]
Is Castro still in power?

[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:40.360]
Yes.

[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.300]
Is he stronger than ever?

[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:41.520]
Yes.

[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:41.760]
Yeah.

[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.260]
We can just pray that he croaks before the weekend.

[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.080]
In fact, me and those guys on that,

[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.300]
El Sol will make up another story about him again.

[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.760]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:51.160]
Oh.

[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.240]
Hey, man, for a grand,

[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:53.920]
that's not much.

[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.160]
How the prank call they made to him?

[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:56.680]
Did you see on the crawl?

[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.420]
I think it was on CNN and one of those.

[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.720]
That they're, yeah,

[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.080]
they're turning it into a thing, no.

[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.700]
Oh, no, I didn't see that.

[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.800]
They're asking their listeners to send pennies in

[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.640]
so that they can pay their fine in pennies.

[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.760]
Oh, no.

[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.260]
That's disgusting.

[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.140]
Keep that in mind, though,

[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.080]
for a later on this year.

[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:15.680]
I'll write it down.

[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.560]

[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:21.760]
beautiful

[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:36.660]
THEREР

[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:40.940]
It's 1131 at 560 W.Q.M., so anyway max casker writes he writes for

[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:42.860]
progression weekly, which I thought that was this beginning

[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:43.580]
caused innu

[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:44.400]
well

[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:46.040]
well

[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:47.500]
well

[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:47.500]

[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.280]
March 15, and I apologize for, but it's just long.

[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.480]
I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's very, very long, but what I'm going

[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.800]
to read is long, but I don't apologize because it's worthwhile.

[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.440]
The pattern of pandering at the Mime Hero does even deeper and broader than most of the

[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.440]
paper's critics realize.

[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.880]
When it comes to pandering to the most conservative sectors of key constituencies, marginalizing

[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:10.440]
dissonant voices and stifling debate with an editorial pages, the Mime Hero and El Nuevo

[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.620]
hero don't stop with Cuba or even would Latin America.

[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.400]
Increasingly, the same narrowing of the spectrum of opinion applies not only to Cuba, but also

[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.100]
to commentary about other countries of Latin America, especially Venezuela.

[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:27.040]
If the balance of political forces in Venezuela reflected the ratio of pro-government to anti-government

[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.180]
articles in the opinion pages of El Nuevo hero, Cuba's chavis would lose any election

[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.520]
by nearly 100% of the vote.

[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.500]
Mime Hero did tutorials, columns, and commentaries in Venezuela nearly as one-sided as those

[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.220]
in El Nuevo hero that almost as stride as those on Cuba.

[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.620]
Indeed, on Cuba, Venezuela and Latin America in general, the editorial pages of Mime Hero

[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.780]
have been converging toward the monolithic El Nuevo hero model.

[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.700]
It's no wonder, before he assumed the hero post, Alberto Aigueno was the publisher of

[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.420]
El Nuevo Hero.

[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:58.540]
In his stinted El Nuevo hero, he established new standards for pandering to the Cuban

[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:02.640]
right, and disloyally when he published a special section on the occasion of the death

[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:07.040]
of Cuban American National Foundation chairman Jorge Mascanosa, who would wage the merciless

[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.800]
campaign against the hero and Ibergrin the Gwen's boss, Harold Publisher David Lawrence.

[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.820]
Under Ibergrin's watch El Nuevo Hero also reached new heights of incompetence and lack of

[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:19.480]
accountability when it published a Sunday front page feature story about a doctor that

[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.240]
purportedly attended to El Castro as he lay in a coma in a Havana hospital every assertion

[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.880]
in the detailed account turned out to be false, but the paper never investigated the hoax

[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.940]
nor apologized to readers.

[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.520]
But no misdeed goes unremorted in the age of total corporate greed.

[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.280]
Nightrider, the hero's parent company, which had just moved its headquarters from Miami

[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.560]
to San Jose, California to get away from the madding Cuban crowd, soon promoted Ibergrin.

[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:47.180]
Not for his non-existent journalistic accomplishments, but because Ibergrin promised he could deliver

[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.520]
a 22% profit annually, even if he had the tear that gots out of the hero's journalistic

[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:55.400]
tradition or make a pact with the city's right-wing devils from the Cuban American National

[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.980]
Foundation to the Alfred Whitewing radio personalities.

[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.520]
By the time the federal raid to remove Ilyon took place, Ibergrin had become the Miami

[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.260]
Herald publisher that was in control of both the Herald and the El Nuevo Herald.

[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.640]
He took advantage of the fact to issue a special edition of El Nuevo Herald with a huge headline,

[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.740]
Shame, Explanation Point.

[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:18.400]
But the Herald's bias in parochial pandering doesn't stop with Latin America when it comes

[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.080]
to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.440]
It's not just that the Herald publishes a plethora of pro-Israeli views to the virtual

[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.200]
exclusion of pro-Palestinian perspectives.

[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:30.540]
It's not even just the fact that the paper's regular op-ed contributors include Israeli

[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.080]
columnists while Palestinian columnists don't appear in the paper even as occasional

[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:34.840]
guest columnists.

[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.060]
It's also an especially the fact that the paper's opinion columns lead heavily toward the

[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:43.240]
heart of the positions while almost invariably excluding critical voices, the harder line

[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.240]
positions that is, critical voices in Israel and the American Jewish community.

[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.840]
On all the points above, the Herald's editorial reaction to the assassination of Sheikh Ab-Oshmadi

[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.040]
Aasin, the spiritual leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas by the Israeli military,

[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.140]
is instructive.

[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.140]
Or rather, the Herald's lack of reaction.

[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.300]
The newspaper that probably publishes more commentary about Israel than any other daily

[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.380]
in the U.S. failed to take editorial notice of a very major event.

[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.680]
Silence can be more significant than words.

[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.020]
Would the Herald have been silent?

[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.320]
Had this kind of extradition and judicial execution been carried out by any other state?

[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.960]
The paper's editorial past reflects the maximum.

[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.900]
If you can't see anything good, don't say anything.

[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.480]
And how could they say anything good?

[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.120]
The elimination of Aasin was condemned by nearly everyone in the world, including our

[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.440]
best friends and allies such as the UK's Foreign Minister Jack Straugh.

[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.200]
Even the Bush administration, which in the person of national security advisor,

[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:35.580]
Kondaleez, Erise initially attempted to rationalize the killing, was forced to backtrack

[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.120]
after realizing death and breadth of the world's revulsion.

[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:43.400]
The U.S. government, through a spokesman, eventually pronounced itself deeply disturbed

[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.680]
a far milder reaction than that of other governments.

[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.840]
A U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the killing obtained broad support, but failed

[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.900]
because of a U.S. veto.

[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:55.520]
President Bush failed to offer even a token protest, indeed, instead he went ahead with

[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.680]
a plan to meet with Sirona and Washington April 14.

[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:01.720]
In the UK, meanwhile, a Jewish member of parliament, Mr. Kaufman, denounced the visit

[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:05.500]
as giving a seal of approval to Sirona's policy of indiscriminate killings of Palestinians.

[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.640]
The Harold Silence on the Aasin killing topic is par for the course, but it's also an

[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.700]
abdication responsibility.

[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.160]
In significant ways, the U.S. is implicated in the rubbing out of the Hemos leader.

[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:20.120]
The helicopter used to kill the Ocenas in American Apache helicopter, through military

[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.640]
assistance, massive economic support, and the diplomatic shield of the U.S. veto with

[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.640]
the U.N. United States enables the Shiroun government to carry out its iron fist policy

[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.760]
with total impunity.

[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:34.200]
As Terec Ali has written a new book Bush and Babylon, the Recolonization of Iraq.

[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:39.340]
By making Ariel Shiroun a co-leader in the war on terrorism, the regime in Washington consciously

[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:42.220]
blurred the distinction between national liberation and terror.

[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.920]
The result has been catastrophic.

[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.840]
Now the day passes without an email from Israel and Palestine informing me of the latest atrocity

[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.160]
he writes.

[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.800]
Every Arab and Muslim in the world understands his connection and it's clear that Rezemino

[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.260]
for American compliance with Shiroun's brutal policies could well cause enormous damage

[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.640]
to the American people and U.S. interest in the world.

[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.340]
Let's make one thing clear.

[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.860]
Now withstanding the fact that Palestinians live under a humiliating occupation that

[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.960]
makes every day of their lives miserable, the numerous indiscriminate acts of terror

[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.840]
and murder against Israeli civilians carried out by Palestinian extremists are abominable

[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.860]
morally and counterproductive politically, as is the violentism extremism expressed by far

[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:17.860]
too many in the Arab world.

[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.360]
On the other hand, even in the wake of the ASEAN killing, an open letter signed by 60 leading

[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.840]
Palestinian intellectuals rejected violence and called for non-violence resistance to occupation.

[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.100]
The point is not to hold a contest of evil versus virtue, pinning Israelis against Palestinians.

[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:37.620]
The point is that however repugnant the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas or the Islamic Jihad, American

[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:41.120]
taxpayers are not paying for them and our government is not rationalizing or providing

[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.840]
political cover for these horrific actions.

[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:46.440]
Can the same be said with respect to the morally repugnant actions of the Shiroun government

[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:46.920]
in Israel?

[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.520]
To do its pattern of petty pandering, the Mimeherald is mum on all of these issues.

[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.940]
What the paper did publish is a large number of letters, all but one is in support of the

[01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:00.900]
assassination and a pathetic column by its regular contributor, Erid Drowme, director of

[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:05.220]
the International Outreach at the Israeli Democracy Institute in which the author justifies

[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.580]
the killing by enumerating the reasons I didn't like Yasin.

[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.320]
Undoubtedly, most people in the Arab and Muslim world could list myriad reasons why they

[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.200]
didn't like Shiroun.

[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.780]
Would this justify the Syrian or Iranian governments killing the Israeli Prime Minister,

[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:21.380]
with the fact that the killing took place as the Israeli leader left a synagogue, mirrored

[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.420]
special condemnation?

[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:27.620]
The Drowme piece doesn't spare clichés, not even the 72 virgins are left out and leaves

[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.860]
no room for doubt or nuance.

[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.760]
Drowme reduces the worldwide outcry against the Asin killing to the notion that some people

[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.460]
are just bashing Israel for killing him.

[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.600]
Drowme's column reads like straight propaganda, but then again what exactly is an international

[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.440]
outreach coordinator?

[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.040]
The Herald's pandering here retains a brazen level, the paper's main commentator on Israeli

[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.300]
Palestinian issues is an Israeli propagandist, that's balance.

[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:54.140]
The contrast could not be sharper between the narrow hacked view of the Asin killing expressed

[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.880]
in the Herald's single column on the topic, and the wide range of views expressed in Israel,

[01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.740]
including sharp criticism and the press.

[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:03.920]
Indeed, even inside Shiroun's cabinet there was a dissent in a row post the assassination.

[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.760]
Israeli commentators have questioned the wisdom of the hit, its political and economic

[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.340]
repercussion that its potential for escalating the violence to a higher level.

[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.660]
Israeli analysts didn't shy away from posing the toughest questions, and with a harshness

[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:19.660]
seldom encountered in the US press, easily intimidated by spurious charges of anti-Semitism

[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.600]
leveled by hard-lied pro-locute sectors in the US.

[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.640]
And it goes on at length Max Castro, he's great.

[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.340]
You go Max?

[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.000]
Yeah, you go rip the Herald and ask, well deserved, man.

[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.120]
The Panders, man are they nauseating.

[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.040]
I think I'm going to cancel my subscription to the Herald.

[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.500]
The reason I buy it is because I'm down there a few weeks a year.

[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:38.040]
Yeah.

[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.800]
I'm going to get a subscription just like in canceling.

[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.500]
There you go.

[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.440]
Everybody call up there, get a subscription, cancel it tomorrow.

[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.380]
I stopped throwing the L Herald on my front lawn, you at.

[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.440]
You at Anthels?

[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:50.980]
Yeah.

[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.540]
I'm sure that's what you were going to say.

[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:55.860]
I'm sure I was thinking though.

[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.120]
I'm sure it wasn't.

[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.620]
You're probably thinking of like Class Holes, something like that.

[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:00.340]
Class Holes.

[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:01.060]
Right.

[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:02.620]
Spaz Holes.

[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.400]
Watch the Spaz Holes at the Herald, make no mistake about it.

[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.220]
Twenty-till noon at 560 W.D.Q.

[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:11.760]
I'm not forget to look for the QM fan, 5 to 7 at Anchor's away at Beach Place in Fort

[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.700]
Lauderdale this afternoon.

[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.520]
Stop by to spin that Ville for prizes and register to win the 300 scratch.

[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:16.880]
Huh?

[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:17.940]
That's the wheel.

[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.540]
Register to win now.

[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.500]
It says to win 300.

[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.980]
You get all 300 or like one.

[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:22.440]
I don't know.

[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.060]
Register to win 300 scratch off tickets from the Florida lottery.

[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:25.840]
Get one off.

[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:26.380]
I don't know.

[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.540]
You just fight it out with them.

[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.640]
It's the Anchor's away party for the AERAN C show today at Beach Place.

[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.320]
5 to 7 will be there this afternoon.

[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.060]
I'm thinking where I was a couple of weeks ago today.

[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.060]
In fact, it was on a Wednesday.

[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:36.860]
One it, yes it was.

[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.220]
And that was at Hollywood Diagnostics in Hollywood.

[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:43.860]
Got my report in the mail all the way up here in Toronto.

[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:47.080]
They served a senate certified mail and it's a pretty good news.

[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.940]
They said, I'll say it again.

[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.660]
They said if you look as good on the outside as you do on the inside, you'd be beautiful.

[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.540]
Unfortunately though, but anyway, this is the good news.

[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:55.960]
I had the total body scan.

[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.100]
I had the heart scan.

[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.980]
In fact, they were shocked to find a heart inside this age-old body.

[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.120]
A lot of people in the audience would say, he ain't got one.

[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:05.140]
I had one and not only that, Yamama, because it's in pretty good shape.

[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.720]
Nobody wants to think about having cancer, heart disease, any of the myriad of diseases

[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.780]
that the Lord inflicts upon us as we continue suffering through life.

[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.960]
But nevertheless, it's a proven fact that disease responds extremely well to treatment

[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.180]
if you find it early.

[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:19.920]
And that's the most important thing.

[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:23.560]
If you have a history of heart disease or cancer in your family, if you're like

[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:27.160]
into that age, like maybe 50, 60, whatever, and you haven't had the colonoscopy, all

[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.020]
these other very important tests, get with it.

[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:33.380]
Because here's a way to do it non-invasively painlessly at the Hollywood Diagnostic Center.

[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.720]
They're proud to announce their virtual colonoscopy, which is so much less invasive

[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.700]
than the traditional way.

[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:41.680]
Coronary heart scoring and full body screening exams that can detect cancer, other

[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.600]
life-threatening diseases in their early stages.

[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.920]
You don't even need a doctor's referral.

[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.720]
All you need to do is call Hollywood Diagnostic Center, make an appointment for the test.

[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.760]
They really could save your life.

[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:51.440]
And if not, if there's nothing wrong, go down.

[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.700]
You get tremendous peace of mind.

[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:56.100]
Call 9-5-4-966-3600.

[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.560]
9-5-4-966-3600.

[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:03.880]
And Hollywood Diagnostic Center, they offer state of the art imaging equipment, open MRI, high-speed,

[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:06.360]
CAT scan, nuclear medicine, and much, much more.

[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.200]
They really know their stuff.

[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:11.380]
Hollywood Diagnostic Center has been serving South Florida for over 20 years, and their facility

[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:15.340]
even provides a complete mobile diagnostic service that can come right to you if you need

[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:15.500]
them.

fighter manure is spread you can smell it all the way up here you know we both

[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.980]
should apologize to ourselves because we well least I sorry because I promise

[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.400]
myself I'm never going to get any of those discussions again about the

[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.920]
Middle East because it's a hopeless case we shouldn't be there in the first

[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:48.460]
place we should just say we're cutting off the spigot and the freeway and no more money

[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:51.420]
if you want to kill each other have a good time that's that's it that's my attitude

[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:55.120]
but I read the article not because I wanted to argue the the

[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.700]
Israeli a Palestinian thing because of what is called journalism

[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:02.800]
that term loosely in regard of the Harold regardless of what your

[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.800]
position or feelings are on that issue if you have any the point being that a

[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.140]
responsible newspaper should have all viewpoints just like for example a Toronto

[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:13.920]
star now of course there are a lot of Middle Eastern people have here in Toronto

[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.820]
and so naturally they get you know they would get really holy hell if they

[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:20.080]
didn't I don't think they need to be forced to globe and mail the Toronto star

[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.320]
you'll find articles on all sides of these issues every day every single day

[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:27.720]
balanced is that what you're saying how do you like that well you won't find fair

[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:33.100]
imbalance than the us in the Toronto Sun or the what's the other one national post

[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:38.080]
to right wing ranks although nevertheless you'll they have both columnists that have the opposite

[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.300]
point of view they have to people wouldn't buy them but of course in South Florida I mean

[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:46.980]
we've got four daily newspapers here they have a choice in South Florida if you live in day

[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:50.240]
you got the Harold if you live in Browdy got the Sun sentinel if you live in Palm Beach

[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:54.080]
maybe you get the Sun sentinel if you're really desperate or the Palm Beach post which you know

[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:58.980]
forget about that even the fish won't get wrapped in that they jump right out

[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:04.700]
it's very that that was my point and we both got led down to Garden Path by this professional

[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:08.560]
Zionist apologist whatever his real does is right you don't even know what he's talking about

[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.740]
but but aside from that there can be no debating that the Harold doesn't give any

[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:17.660]
fair imbalance coverage whatever the issue is that's what they're at least inconsistent through

[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:21.300]
all the different changes that publishers they've come and gone and it doesn't make any difference

[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:26.000]
they've just become more strident and more right wing and more apologetic that's all just more extreme

[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.780]
anyway here's the huh how you doing I'm doing great I'm just waiting till uh

[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:36.660]

[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:51.820]

they uh they were strong in their positions they didn't waffle they didn't equivocate and they

[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:51.900]
had got squat and nobody voted for either one of them because they had bad hair is that what it was

[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.260]

yeah when a palestrian's get a responsible leader right I want to use Israelis get one and then

[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:14.000]

[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.440]
not going to hold our breath for that because guess who's waiting in wings in Israel if Sherone goes

[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.380]

The last caller just took my thunder about spikyly.

[01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.140]
I wanted to say the same thing.

[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:30.980]
But I would like to say thank you for shining the light on these Republican cockroaches out there.

[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:33.740]
And this is coming to you from a Republican voter by the way.

[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:34.320]
Right.

[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:37.540]
I am so sick and tired of what they're doing out there.

Now what are you just going to say?

[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:48.220]
The new Chris Rock HBO special is good and quite watchable.

[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:48.960]
You'll like it.

[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.900]
Oh, we're not putting Chris Rock on here.

[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:51.560]
No, we're not.

[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.680]
He's a good guy.

[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:54.500]
I got one for you.

[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:55.000]

[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:57.120]
Okay.

[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.020]
Will Smith.

[01:49:58.740 --> 01:49:59.460]
Yes, he will.

[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:00.300]
Oh, boy.

[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.080]
Will Smith.

[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:01.980]
You got it there, Josh.

[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:03.060]
Will Smith.

[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.280]
He just makes me and there's just something about him.

[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:07.760]
And he's not really like real dark complex.

[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:08.900]
And we're not talking about complex.

[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:09.920]
You have to work at it.

[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:10.240]
And he does.

[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:13.120]
If we were talking about complexion, you could just put like that king Cole on there.

[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.100]
And go put him on there.

[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:16.540]
No, it's seriously.

[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:17.920]
He was he was very, very.

[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:19.260]
I mean, you know how it goes.

[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:25.400]
Some people are like a Halle Berry and some people are like a old king Cole and that king

[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:27.720]
Cole Natalie Cole.

[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:29.760]
And I don't haven't seen Natalie Cole in a long time.

[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:30.200]
I forget.

[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.480]
Is she like real dark complex?

[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:31.860]
No.

[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:32.480]
Does she video?

[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:34.380]

[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:42.740]
Mike Tyson.

[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:44.300]
Mike Tyson is good.

[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:46.660]
He's too black and too obnoxious and too a lot.

[01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:51.020]
In fact, see, there's an example of a guy that most of the black folks would probably like to give back.

[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:55.340]
Just like me would, no, me would Bob Kuntz and who you were doing with the acuban thing?

[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:58.180]
Oh, I have a long list with him.

[01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:58.640]
Oh, see.

[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.520]
A lot of people that you would just like give them.

[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:01.740]
We don't want to take credit for them.

[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:04.080]
Okay, they must be, must be, must be, check the birth certificate.

[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:05.480]
Must be something else.

[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:07.780]
WQAM.

[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:13.080]

[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:13.440]
That's one.

[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:14.840]
Hey, Mill.

[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:15.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.540]
How about Buddy Mac and Steve Harvey?

[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.200]
I like Marty Cole and veteran.

[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:27.760]
Didn't you?

[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:28.300]
Yeah.

[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:29.820]
Good friend of mine, Marty.

[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:31.040]
I didn't know Marty Cole was black.

[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:33.820]
I thought he was white, but then a guy didn't know him all I will, you know.

[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:35.000]
So, what's your name?

[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:35.080]
What's your name?

[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:36.380]
How many black comedians can you name?

[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:36.920]
Right.

[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.200]
Now, we're not, we're not, we're not playing that game, okay?

[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.180]
How many black guys can you name?

[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:43.500]
All right, and women don't leave them out.

[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:43.980]
Right.

[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:45.980]
And Chillin.

[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:49.480]
Are you Chillin?

[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:50.040]
Yes.

[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:51.560]

[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:52.380]
I told you that.

[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:52.920]
I'm not lying.

[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:53.100]
Right.

[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:53.520]
I'm lying.

[01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:54.740]
If I'm lying, you're dying.

[01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:56.860]
WQAM.

[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:57.120]
Hello.

[01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:58.380]
Hey, Mill.

[01:51:58.500 --> 01:51:58.860]
How you doing?

[01:51:58.860 --> 01:51:59.720]
Pretty good.

[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:00.340]
Good.

[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:02.680]
Hey, uh, you're really this rapper, Chuck D?

[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:05.160]
Chuck D, yeah, I heard him.

[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:05.520]
Yeah.

[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:07.980]
I want to nominate him from being too black.

[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:08.840]
All right, thanks.

[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:10.500]
And what about, let's put him on it.

[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:11.340]
What about 50 cent?

[01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:12.140]
Okay.

[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:15.300]
See, and again, there's another one, a lot of black folks.

[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:16.700]
Oh, no, we don't, he's white.

[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:18.540]
He's just, there's the Al Jolson thing, you know.

[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.440]
I put some black face.

[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:21.600]
Let's put him at M on here, even though he's white.

[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:22.400]
No.

[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:23.000]
He's too black.

[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:23.940]
No, he's not.

[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:27.860]
We're not talking about that.

[01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:29.580]
We're just making a joke.

[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:30.340]
No, you weren't.

[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:30.920]
No, you weren't.

[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:31.920]
You were trying to sneak it on there.

[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:32.960]
Probably winking a Josh.

[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:33.660]
Get it in there.

[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:34.240]
Slip it in there.

[01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:35.040]
I don't wink it, Josh.

[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:35.480]
That's you.

[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:36.120]
Good.

No, I don't either.

[01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:38.360]
You're winking now.

[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:41.500]
First of all, when I'm there, he ain't there, okay?

[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:42.640]
He's nowhere near that point.

[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.100]
He walks through.

[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:44.580]
Real fast.

[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:45.740]
I don't blame him.

[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.400]
5, 6, 7, I don't know why you say that.

[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:50.340]
You just want to instill fear and paranoia.

[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.800]
Man, when I'm not there, I might hear something burning

[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.180]
from the kind of crap that's going on.

[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:54.680]
Trust me.

been writing and calling ABC, voicing their displeasure over the program's

[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:21.860]
game show like nature and asking, please don't error it. The programs

[02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:26.400]
website's been flooded in recent days with angry chat room postings. Probably

[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:30.440]
caused a chat shows too. From adoptive parents, birth mothers and others, among

[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:33.800]
the messages, you will win the award for the best trash on TV if you're the

[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:38.280]
show and I'm really surprised at Vaba. Thought you was a journalist, little

[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:41.760]
did we know. The total sellout, right? Are they going to be competing the

[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:45.680]
parents? We need just let me finish the right. Some writers are urging

[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.620]
viewers to complain to the FCC. We're calling for boycotts of Disney, the

[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:55.400]
parent company of ABC and Comcast is no we don't want to buy anymore by the

[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:00.400]
way. Disney. In response to the outcry ABC pulled its promotional ad and

[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.780]
replaced it with a version that does not portray the process as a competition or

[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:07.760]
reality show. ABC News Vice President Jeffrey Schneider would not discuss the

[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:10.580]
contents of the show which will air during the start of a rating sweep

[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:14.020]
period just by coincident some sure but said we'd view copies that included

[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:17.240]
references to the adoption of the competition do not reflect final editing

[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:21.620]
changes. It is a very responsible interesting thoughtful hour in a process

[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:25.520]
most Americans might not know anything about it said. The app was over B. My

[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:28.900]
baby, the Friday episode that had been built as a unique look inside the

[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:34.240]
intense competition of the open adoption process. The hour long show focuses on

[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:38.420]
Jessica, 16-year-old pregnant Ohio girl and her struggle to select one of five

[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:41.580]
couples to adopt her unborn son. The mother to be what's a couple who'll

[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:44.900]
permit her and her extended family to continue to play a prominent role in

[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:48.640]
the boy's life. Seeking to adopt the child who had yet to be born at the time

[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.800]
of taping, Karen and tab brown, more he's broker and sales exec, Steven

[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.560]
Kathy Follinger, police officer and administrative assistant, teachers Tina

[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:01.060]
and Daniel McKean, financial administrator Steve enjoys stressor, and Beth

[02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:04.940]
and Matt Trinca, warehouse supervisor and physical therapist. The show's news

[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:08.480]
releases referred to the couple's finalist, shadowing them as they each go through

[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:11.520]
a 30-minute interview to convince the pregnant girl that they be the best

[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:15.540]
parents for her soon to be born baby. At one point, tab brown says he feels as

[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:18.620]
though he's on the dating show, the bachelor, your inner you're out tonight.

[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:22.880]
Adoption professionals through the show will perhaps well intention, will leave

[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.540]
viewers with an accurate idea about the process. Also, birth mothers today do

[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:29.420]
review family profiles and select individuals and couples to raise their

[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:32.820]
children. They do so only after adoption agencies have to careful scrutiny of

[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:37.660]
all parties, narrow the choice to far fewer than five experts say. Maybe we can

[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:44.020]
just bring Donald Trump on say you got the kid. Huh? Oh man. Rarely do birth

[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:47.560]
mothers interview five families in the process does not take 30 minutes they say

[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:50.760]
it involves months of obtaining information, asking for more information and

[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:54.100]
behind the scenes discussions with mothers and adopted families before any

[02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:57.820]
meeting occurs, families who are not chosen sometimes never even know they

[02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:01.980]
were under consideration. The process that it shows is unlike anything I've

[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:05.500]
ever seen in real life said Adam Perpman, but that ought to be a TV reality show.

[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:09.080]
Right unreal. He's executive director of the New York based Evan B. Donaldson

[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.460]
adoption students much more private normally. Indeed, the cameras presence

[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:16.980]
not to mention Walters cannot be downplayed. Adoption workers wonder did the

[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:20.080]
adopted parents agree to participate thinking they'd somehow have a better

[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:23.320]
chance of getting a baby. Did Jessica feel pressure to relinquish her rights to

[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:27.240]
her child because she was appearing on 2020? What effect years later will the show

[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:31.020]
have on the boy and his self image? All of these things. There's a lot of anxiety,

[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:34.820]
a lot of concern that this really degrades the process. Oh perfect for TV if

[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:38.340]
it's degrading. Said Doug Renninger, president of American Academy of Adoption

[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:43.320]
Turnies, the focus is all on winning the prize. It might as well be a basket of

[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:48.460]
fruit. See, they're doing it like that. If they had some obstacle courses, maybe

[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:51.380]
eating bugs, getting naked, then they'd have to. Oh, that's next Friday.

[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:08.380]
It's day. Oh,

[02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:16.400]
David Milch's version of the Old West. When Cowboys were smelly and used 500

[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:21.860]
curse words for sentence, there's a new gunslinger in town to avenge the death of his

[02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:25.080]
friend. Why a bill is what you do?

[02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:31.320]
You bump these parts stranger. Yeah, who are you? I'm Buffalo Bear. Mommy.

[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:33.340]
He said it.

[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.000]
Ed Liffey is a fellow bill. You sure are fast on a

[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.940]
day. I wouldn't be fast if I didn't put the lotion in a

[02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:42.760]
holster.

[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:53.760]
That's about as close as we can get to promoting the dialogue of deadwood only on 8

[02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:55.060]
below.

[02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:01.940]
245 and 560 WDQAM. Which of these people best bits of description to black?

[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:07.480]
The on Sanders 27 Louis Ferrican 26 got the spell right. Nice go in Eric.

[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:11.940]
Jesse's Jackson 23 L. Sharpton 23 got a good for a battle going there.

[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:13.600]
Spike Lee got 16.

[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:21.020]
Johnny Cochran 9 50 sent 8 OJ Simpson 4 Mike Tyson 4 or Cine O 3.

[02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:24.220]
Brian Cox 1 Alan Keys 1 Will Smith none.

[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:27.820]
Sammy Davis Jr. got the big O and took these got none and for a

[02:06:27.820 --> 02:06:33.880]
extra effort don't have any. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 T.

[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:35.660]
I feel like say Troy's just big brother.

[02:06:35.700 --> 02:06:39.260]
Barely even like light chocolate. You know, yeah. Light mocha.

[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:41.480]
WDQAM. Hello.

[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:45.040]
Yes, I had a suggestion for the poll. I don't know.

[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.680]
Yes, sir. Bobby Brown.

[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:49.780]
Bobby Brown downtown Bobby Brown.

[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:52.580]
Yeah, without a doubt. I like to lock Whitney down a lot.

[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:53.960]
Yeah. Yeah.

[02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:55.900]
Okay, thanks a lot pal.

[02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:57.440]
Sure. I have a great day.

[02:06:57.620 --> 02:06:59.920]
Good old Bobby Brown. He's just another one.

[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:02.020]
I'm sure they'd like to say, oh, you guys can have him.

[02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:03.640]
Maybe tomorrow he'll wake up like yellow.

[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:05.580]
It can be like turn Chinese.

[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:08.180]
Okay, what no, I would have said turning Japanese,

[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:11.220]
but I can't say that. No more.

[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:13.520]
No back in the day though.

[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:14.940]
Dominic Q. A.m. Hello.

[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:18.480]
Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing?

[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:19.600]
I'm doing great.

[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:23.900]
I got a request for your poll.

[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:25.980]
A request. Okay. What would that be?

[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:27.940]
M and M. M and M.

[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:28.480]
That's a request.

[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:29.820]
Or it said that before. I don't know.

[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:31.820]
What do you think Josh? Well, let you break the tie.

[02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:34.980]
No, no. He's not black.

[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:38.080]
I was making a joke. Yeah, George was doing a joke.

[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:40.900]
I would be like saying that Elvis because he did our

[02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:43.220]
and B music was black. You know, always out with that was.

[02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:46.440]
Yeah, well, and Pat Boone, you know, 2D fruity.

[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.760]
By the way, Brett under and I don't think we're getting

[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:52.680]
to really respect for what's your name?

[02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:53.980]
What is your name? That's on there.

[02:07:55.580 --> 02:07:58.680]
The first the behind the what is her name? Heidi, uh,

[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:00.400]
fly. Heidi. That's her.

[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:01.760]
No, seriously, who we got?

[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:04.880]
Carrie Werr. Oh, yeah, a canary event.

[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:07.240]
No, Carrie Werr. How are you?

[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:09.560]
Say her name just don't tell her short.

[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:11.820]
If you can't write that. That's a good picture.

[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:13.760]
Catcher. Well, I just don't think a lot of people know

[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:14.980]
who she is. Am I wrong about that?

[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.940]
A bit of the million things, but no, she never quite broke

[02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:19.040]
through you know, she never made the big breakthrough.

[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:20.880]
Well, looks like she's got the material to break through.

[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:23.040]
She released a window. She used to high speed.

[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:26.660]
She hadn't taken out so still something looked there.

[02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:29.400]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60.

[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:31.840]
We can't say what though. Can we just take a picture?

[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:32.600]
Just check in.

[02:08:32.660 --> 02:08:33.800]
Of course, he ended up that anyway.

[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:36.760]
WQ a.m. Hello, Uncle Neil.

[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:38.700]
You're sure Bill Cosby.

[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:40.640]
Bill Cosby's pretty black.

[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:41.740]
That's right. Good choice.

[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:43.760]
He's the one and I was on.

[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:46.400]
He only eats the chocolate the yellow pudding.

[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:48.200]
Yes, another thing is you get a chance.

[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:49.660]
Definitely check out deadwood.

[02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:51.240]
It's well worth it. Joy's also.

[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:52.240]
OK, thanks.

[02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:53.020]
Bye.

[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:53.640]
All right.

[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:54.640]
It's on HBO though, right?

[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:55.720]
What nights? I wish I knew.

[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:57.260]
Yeah, check your local listings.

[02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:58.680]
I don't get HBO, but we have.

[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:01.500]
We have some other funky channels here that carry like

[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.160]
sopranos and shows that are on HBO.

[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:05.380]
You don't get them. You can't get it or just don't have it.

[02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:07.640]
It ain't it's not on my digital cable.

[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:09.460]
It's not available. It doesn't exist here.

[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:10.980]
It's an American thing.

[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:13.420]
And which don't mean we don't have a lot of American things

[02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:13.940]
like CNN.

[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:16.560]
That's wrong. There's that self-hating David from there

[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.080]
who ought to be a tart and feathered.

[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:19.300]
Are you going to see Chris Rock?

[02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:22.300]
And why don't I just get to Sandy?

[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:24.240]
There isn't one of those shows that doesn't wind up

[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:27.480]
either on global or CTV or one of these many

[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:29.620]
goofball off brand networks we got here.

[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:30.220]
OK, OK, OK.

[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:31.300]
You just have to know where to find it.

[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:32.180]
And the show too.

[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:36.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T

[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:38.300]
and Verizon wireless line.

[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:40.380]
You know this is on a whole different level.

[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:42.840]
These names here, even though there are a lot of people

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:44.220]
who aren't exactly what you call popular,

[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:46.340]
then the first two hours with the Cuban thing.

[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:46.760]
Right.

[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:48.820]
Now I didn't invent it.

[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:49.860]
And there are people, oh no, you're

[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:52.040]
you've been doing this Cuban version for 20 years, right?

[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:53.080]
Like I invented this.

[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.140]
There was a, I'm not even there.

[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:58.040]
There was a hostility that exists in that town.

[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:01.300]
It is just so always like simmering right

[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:01.940]
under the surface.

[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:03.700]
Why are we now in a boil over when there's something

[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:06.840]
really important like alien or the Aladdin Grammy

[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:07.600]
or whatever.

[02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:10.200]
But it's just always at the simmering point.

[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:11.660]
All you got to do is like somebody just

[02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:13.540]
give you the wrong look or somebody

[02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:15.500]
go to the airport and have some cost

[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:19.300]
to comment maybe a small Cuban guy that did it for me.

[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:20.920]
WQA and hello.

[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:21.920]
Hello.

[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:22.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:24.260]
James Brown.

[02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:25.680]
James Brown.

[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:26.360]
He's pretty black.

[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:26.840]
Good choice.

[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:28.460]
And always in trouble, man.

[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.340]
See one thing in common, people on this list,

[02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:32.300]
not all of them like Will Smith, he ain't no trouble

[02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:34.080]
just annoying, really annoying.

[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:37.840]
See, most of the people I would see either are in trouble

[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:40.120]
or they are trouble, right?

[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:40.420]

[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:43.080]
Deon Sanders, he said his brush or two with a law.

[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:46.000]
Louis Ferrican, he's trouble.

[02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:47.280]
Al Sharpton.

[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:49.940]
Deon's got 32 Louis Ferrican 29.

[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:51.860]
Al Sharpton 26, Jesse Jackson 24.

[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:52.780]
That is a battle.

[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:54.220]
That's what you call a house raise.

[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:56.220]
Spike Lee 19.

[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:57.560]
Johnny Cochland 10.

[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:00.580]
We're going to play the race card.

[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:01.340]
Do you understand what?

[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:03.900]
Sure, I'm glad you're pronouncing that really good these days.

[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.820]
Johnny Cochland 50 cent has got nine.

[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.640]
Looks like he needs about 41 more cent.

[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:15.140]
Mike Tyson 5, OJ Simpson 4, our city of Hall 4.

[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:16.700]
Ryan Cox got a pair.

[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:19.320]
Are you sure?

[02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:23.560]
Alan Keys won Bobby Brown 1 and no votes yet.

[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:25.420]
This is amazing for Sammy Davis, Jr.

[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:29.180]
Chuck D. Will Smith or Bill Cosby just won on our order 166.

[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:34.620]
But it's not the same kind of zeal for this particular poll as the first one.

[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:37.260]
WDQA, I'm Hello.

[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:38.900]
Hi, I'm Colin from Neil.

[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.260]
Yes, man, speaking to him.

[02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:40.840]
Hi, Neil.

[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.280]
I just wanted to give a local figure for you.

[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:43.760]
OK.

[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:45.400]
The Rebendicter Curry.

[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:46.760]
Oh, that's a good one.

[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:47.980]
Bishop Victor Curry, right?

[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:48.320]

[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.480]
Thanks, Neil.

[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:49.560]
Thanks.

[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:50.260]
See ya.

[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:54.120]
What is his exact title besides...

[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:56.980]
Bishop Victor Curry.

[02:11:57.180 --> 02:11:58.100]
Besides Schmendrick Cole.

[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:02.960]
Bishop Victor Curry, there's one of your local locals in Ojrampur, Valkontur, there ever was one.

[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:07.640]
He's one of the one that's always complaining about this show and all of these things and he's racist.

[02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:10.180]
And he's probably not happy with this thing, but with these two hours.

[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:13.360]
Even though we spread it around for just about every kind of group out of the sun,

[02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:16.420]
of which two that I fit into myself and one that George Vincent do,

[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:19.060]
Josh, we don't want to fit him in.

[02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:19.640]
Redneck.

[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:21.560]
Yeah, that really.

[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:22.720]
Not, I don't think so.

[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:23.800]
He's a generic redneck.

[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.800]
Not too many redneck's living in Western, you think?

[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:27.640]
Well, living in Cole Springs.

[02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:29.380]
I think you're living in Western.

[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:30.580]
Nah.

[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:34.680]
Yeah, George, for me, is that you're living in one of your most...

[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.560]
Is that somewhere out there?

[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.340]
Yeah, someone to you, it's all the same.

[02:12:37.580 --> 02:12:40.260]
OK, we can't all live in a real prestigious area like Hollywood.

[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:40.660]

[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.700]
Well, that's your mark.

[02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:42.940]
Wow.

[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:45.380]
Yeah, ask mom, maybe she can have you over for lunch every now and then.

[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.180]
Now that you're almost neighbors, right?

[02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:48.500]
I'll do it.

[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:49.320]
WQM, hello.

[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:50.720]
Yeah.

[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:51.800]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:53.420]
I got a gift for your ball.

[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.640]
Who is it?

[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:56.620]
Tim Brown.

[02:12:57.140 --> 02:12:57.580]
Tim Brown?

[02:12:58.720 --> 02:12:59.580]
Oh, Jim Brown.

[02:12:59.720 --> 02:12:59.980]
Jim Brown.

[02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:01.080]
Yeah, he's a pretty dark guy.

[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:03.480]
He's darken, literally, you know what I mean?

[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:05.460]
He's a dark character.

[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:08.640]
Great football player, but he's like a whole kinds of problems, man.

[02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:11.660]
She could make us some really bad mots of ball soup,

[02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:13.260]
but she made me last time I was on her.

[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:14.160]
Don't ever make that again.

[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:15.960]
My was the worst crap I ever had in my life.

[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:17.760]
It was just gruesome.

[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:20.880]
Those were two of the worst.

[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:24.620]
Well, it was just bad soup, you know what I mean?

[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:25.580]
It was just bad stuff.

[02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:26.420]
Just walk away.

[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:30.240]
No, I was thinking more like when I saw it.

[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:30.640]
Be afraid.

[02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:32.120]
Be very afraid.

[02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:32.660]
And I was.

[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:34.400]
And I made the mistake I ate it.

[02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:36.160]
It was pretty nasty, see?

[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:38.200]
You don't like mots of ball soup out of a can.

[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:39.520]
So just forget about the soup, huh?

[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:44.240]
Just stick with really a good stuff like those millie burgers that will really, well, yeah.

[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:48.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT.

[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:49.540]
She makes great potato pancakes.

[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:50.160]
I'll say that.

[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:50.740]
Can I eat those?

[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:51.700]
I'll eat them anyway.

[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:54.680]
Go to the QA and hello.

[02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:57.200]
Hey, got one for the black ball.

[02:13:57.620 --> 02:13:58.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:00.180]
Stokey Carmichael.

[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:05.460]
Also, you know, got a suggestion to,

[02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:07.160]
how about, how about Hogi Carmichael?

[02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:08.400]
How about it?

[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:09.460]
I would do say it.

[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:12.460]
A suggestion to, for another ball with the black,

[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:13.860]
black that are too white.

[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:15.660]
That's bad, man.

[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:16.160]
I like that.

[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:19.960]
And also, I've written, I've written Metro Fail four times.

[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:22.620]
He's what?

[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:24.860]
He wrote the Metro Fail four times.

[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:26.520]
Oh, he wrote Metro Fail four times.

[02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:27.820]
I can understand what he, I'll be saying.

[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:29.640]
He wrote the Metro Fail four times.

[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:29.980]
That's good.

[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:30.760]
Everybody calls him.

[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:32.980]
We want to find out if you ever read the, uh, wrote the Metro Fail.

[02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:34.600]
And how you like the ribs and shorties.

[02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:37.840]
Really stop and think about that.

[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:41.840]
I remember people like Richard Friedman having an arrest, having a cow back in the day.

[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:44.260]
And the herald was just pontificating.

[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:45.900]
Oh, this is going to be so great for the community.

[02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:47.040]
And it's going to do this.

[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:49.720]
And of course, the only reason the herald cared about is because it went downtown.

[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:54.060]
Anything that went downtown, let's try to beef up that crappy neighborhood that the herald is in.

[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:57.520]
And let me ask you this, since I never go downtown, I mean, and now they were near it.

[02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:01.700]
Uh, all that big renovation they were going to do there, you know, right around where the herald is.

[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:03.400]
And, uh, has that taken place yet?

[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:06.680]
Wow, you got your base side.

[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:08.480]
Now, I'm not talking about base side.

[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:14.180]
Now, this was, this was a little bit closer into where one herald plans is there, you know, uh, uh, and we're going to like renovate.

[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:18.600]
And we're going to be a shopping malls and all this really fancy, fancy and really, uh, goose it up.

[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:23.560]
And everybody's going to be schlepping running down to be in downtown Miami and increase the value of the herald of the property, of course.

[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:26.980]
I think there's a new fake Rolex watch stand that wasn't.

[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.680]
See, that's just an ancillary benefit.

[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:30.820]
The fact that it would benefit the herald and goose up their property.

[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:33.980]
They would never allow that to interfere with their, with their editorial judge.

[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:36.340]
Come into QAM. Hello.

[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:38.820]
QAM.

[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:40.640]
I've got your winner here.

[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:42.680]
Yes, sir. Michael Irving.

[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:44.500]
Michael Irving.

[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:46.920]
Okay, thank you. Michael Irving.

[02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:51.680]
And as it me or these people not pronouncing some of the names are like, stokely car Michael, not stokey.

[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:55.040]
I remember Mike Stokey and I remember stokeys out there on I-75.

[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.060]
Are they still in business?

[02:15:57.060 --> 02:15:58.280]
We talk about them all the time.

[02:15:58.340 --> 02:15:59.520]
I don't even know if they really still exist.

[02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:00.720]
Stokeys? Stokey.

[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:01.400]
Yeah, they're still around.

[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:04.320]
You know, where they get that rancid peanut brittle from about six, seven years ago.

[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:05.320]
They're still at the plaza.

[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:06.280]
Yeah.

[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:08.980]
And mother of butlers pies.

[02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:11.580]
What's the, what are the cookies at the turnpike plaza?

[02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:12.680]
Mrs. Fields.

[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:13.960]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:16.100]
You'll have a field today out there at the turnpike.

[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:18.980]
And of course, Nathan's, huh?

[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:21.060]
You know what they say?

[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:22.760]
You can't, I'm not going to say it.

[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:25.820]
Sometimes I'm about Nathan's weenies, but I'm not going to say it.

[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:27.860]
Pro 56 at 560 QAM.

[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:29.900]
Mike and look all.

[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:33.280]
This is 430560 QAM.

[02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:37.680]
Oh, this is honored.

[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:39.120]
This is not a tumor.

[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:41.280]
It's the one to two hour.

[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:45.960]
I've broken through a bedroom window.

[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:51.440]
And by 8M, you just wow.

[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:58.720]
Now, what I did I do was crypto.

[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:03.960]
But that ain't no to do if you play for the fish.

[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.020]
Against my girlfriend, for brought the tell me.

[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:17.040]
That is how the bitch was someone else's wife.

[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:18.880]
Oh, man.

[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:23.640]
The survival was being heavy, healthy.

[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:28.780]
And I found out when it changed me with a knife.

[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:32.700]
Why didn't that bitch tell me?

[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:38.180]
It was too dark to see.

[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:44.980]
She'd be in bed with her own bed.

[02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:50.700]
And that's the best part of me.

[02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:52.300]
We don't feel it now.

[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:53.480]
Wow, honey, like that.

[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:56.280]
I guess we both are doing so well that we got to that.

[02:17:57.060 --> 02:17:59.620]
I could have liked, you know, don't know what I was.

[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:00.800]
One of those obscured it.

[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:02.980]
101 at 560 WQAM.

[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:03.920]
You want?

[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:05.640]
I don't.

[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:06.460]
Okay.

[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:10.080]
Secret Service questions student on drawings.

[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:12.760]
Prosecutor Washington.

[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:17.760]
Secret Service agents question a high school student about anti-war drawings he did for art class.

[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:20.540]
One of which depicted President Bush's head on a stick.

[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:26.200]
Another pencil in ink drawing portrayed Bush as a devil launching a missile with a caption reading

[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:27.640]
and the war on terrorism.

[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:32.980]
The 15 year old boy's art teacher at Prosecutor High School turned the drawings over to school administrators

[02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:35.240]
who notified police who called the Secret Service.

[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.900]
We involved the police anytime we have a concern, and prosecutors superintendent Ray Tallcatcher told the Tri-City Hero newspaper.

[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:47.480]
Secret Service agents, I thought that's where you threw your money when you go on the turn pack in the toll catcher.

[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:50.980]
Secret Service agents interviewed the boy last Friday.

[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:52.820]
The student was not arrested, not been identified.

[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:57.240]
The school district discipline in, but district officials refused to say what the punishment was.

[02:18:58.160 --> 02:18:59.860]
Tallcatcher said the boy was not suspended.

[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:05.640]
The artwork apparently was part of an assignment to keep a notebook of drawings according to Kevin Craven's, a friend of the boy's family.

[02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:11.200]
The drawing that drew the most notice showed a man in what appeared to be Middle Eastern style clothing holding a rifle.

[02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:14.580]
He was also holding a stick with an oversized head of the president on it.

[02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:21.100]
The student said the head was enlarged because it was intended to be an effigy Craven said the caption called for an end of the war in Iraq.

[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:26.780]
A message left by the AP with an, what is it, whatever, was not returned.

[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:33.060]
If the victim you will kidn prosverus perceived as a threat to the president that were living in 1984 Craven said,

[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:37.520]
tallcatcher insisted it was not a freedom of speech issue, but a concern over the depiction of violence.

[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:42.540]
From what I saw, school officials write to be concerned, prosver pull a Steve Wind Taylor, be sane.

[02:19:42.860 --> 02:19:44.880]
No relation to Frank Taylor, who only had one thumb.

[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:52.680]
560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:56.140]
Which of these people best fits description to black?

[02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:59.560]
The guy that said we ought to do one about which black people are too white.

[02:19:59.700 --> 02:20:01.220]
I mean, how many of those are there?

[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:02.200]
530, man.

[02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:04.120]
Michael Jackson.

[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:05.060]
Oh, Jay.

[02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:06.560]
No.

[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:08.200]
I'm going to talk about white.

[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:08.660]
Look it.

[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:09.660]
He plays golf.

[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.120]
He doesn't know how to play golf.

[02:20:11.380 --> 02:20:11.840]
Oh, I see what you're saying.

[02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:13.540]
Brian Cumball.

[02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:14.400]
Oh, yeah.

[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:16.580]
What's his brother's name that stinks the joint out on CBS?

[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:18.480]
Greg Cumball.

[02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:18.820]
Greg Cumball.

[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:19.920]
I beg your pardon?

[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:20.840]
Said Greg.

[02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:22.800]
Okay, speak up there now.

[02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:23.860]
Read you to it, though.

[02:20:24.180 --> 02:20:26.060]
Greg Cumball, man, he's just awful.

[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:27.300]
He's just horrendous.

[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:29.680]
He makes them, they've been boring so exciting.

[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.180]
Oh, by the way, say how did they've next time you do in a game with him?

[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:33.580]
Josh.

[02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:34.300]
I'll do that.

[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:35.760]
Somebody can wait and hello.

[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:36.240]
Neil.

[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:37.100]
Yes, sir.

[02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:37.580]
How are you today?

[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:38.240]
Pretty good.

[02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:39.780]
I wanted to mention something.

[02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:40.800]
No one's brought it up yet.

[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:44.180]
And I hate to admit I was listening to Alan Colms on the radio last night.

[02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:46.160]
Oh, my God.

[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:46.740]
Wow.

[02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:47.720]
How depressing.

[02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:48.380]
You're the one.

[02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:50.240]
I hate somebody has to do it.

[02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:50.600]

[02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:54.620]
So he mentioned yes, I think it was yesterday the day before in the House of Representatives

[02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:57.020]
when they were doing the Pledge of Allegiance.

[02:20:57.420 --> 02:20:57.660]
Yes.

[02:20:57.940 --> 02:21:00.260]
It was Democrat, Jim McDermott of Washington.

[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:02.320]
It was his turn to lead the House in the Pledge.

[02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:06.800]
And when he got to the partitions of the part where he was supposed to say under God, he lifted out.

[02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:09.020]
And the Republicans went berserk.

[02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:11.840]
One of them got up, some guy from Texas, I think, named Sessions.

[02:21:12.820 --> 02:21:16.380]
Got up on the House floor and said this is an assault on American tradition and value.

[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:17.720]
I'm surprised you had to be stopped.

[02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:18.580]
Excellent.

[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:20.400]
And I'm surprised no one mentioned it.

[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:22.340]
I didn't see any stories about it anywhere.

[02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:24.260]
And I'm scouring like I always do.

[02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:26.900]
I never read one word about it, even under God.

[02:21:27.480 --> 02:21:30.360]
So, I'll probably show up later and I want to recommend a quick book to you.

[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:30.940]
Okay.

[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:32.580]
It's called Take Them Out Their Words.

[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:38.420]
Shocking, amusing and baffling quotations from the GOP and their friends 1994 to 2004.

[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:39.200]
Okay.

[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.720]
And it's just little quotations that you can throw in, irritate.

[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:44.280]
Okay, thanks, Paul.

[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:45.180]
Take care.

[02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:45.500]
Bye-bye.

[02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:47.360]
One nation under God.

[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:48.980]
That would have really done it, you know what?

[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:50.200]
Wish I'd have seen that.

[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:52.440]
Yeah, well, I'll scour for it.

[02:21:52.500 --> 02:21:53.000]
We'll find it.

[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:59.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, you don't forget to look for the QMV and 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, anchors away, located at Beach Place in Florida.

[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:01.860]
The other day, I'll stop by to spin the wheel for prizes.

[02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:05.040]
And we're just going to win 300 scratch-off tickets from the Florida lottery.

[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:06.300]
I don't know how many of you get a chance to win.

[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:07.160]
Maybe all 300.

[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:08.960]
And I have no idea because they just tell us crap.

[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:12.460]
It's the Anchor's Way Party for the Air and C Show today at Beach Place.

[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:16.620]
As long as they get in a commercial plug, they don't really care about the other information.

[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:18.740]
WDQA and Hello.

[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:20.480]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:21.500]
I have a edition to Niels Paul.

[02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:22.120]
Okay.

[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:24.020]
Bernie Mack.

[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:26.000]
Bernie Mack?

[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:27.000]
Yes, Bernie Mack.

[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:29.900]
I heard him earlier and we dismissed it as a...

[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:30.860]
He's just a black comedian.

[02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:31.920]
Yeah, he's just a black guy.

[02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:33.560]
Okay, well, why is he too black?

[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:34.280]
Another edition.

[02:22:34.700 --> 02:22:34.940]
Okay.

[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:37.560]
He may not fit the profile, but how about M and M?

[02:22:38.020 --> 02:22:38.820]
No, okay.

[02:22:39.080 --> 02:22:39.840]
Or for two, sorry.

[02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:39.960]
Sorry.

[02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:43.780]
You know who we forgot, though.

[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:44.480]
Who's that?

[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:45.320]
Give me a clue.

[02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:48.280]
Tell me, that's too fast.

[02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:49.100]
Give me a hint.

[02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:50.520]
I mean, kill a couple of minutes with this.

[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:53.580]
Give me a hint.

[02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:55.800]
First one is he smell like.

[02:22:58.360 --> 02:22:58.760]
M1.

[02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:00.640]
Second initial M.

[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:05.140]
Second initial M.

[02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:08.340]
You mean the last name or the second initial of his first name?

[02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:10.780]
I didn't say draw it out one letter at a time.

[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:13.420]
Got blonde hair.

[02:23:14.540 --> 02:23:15.340]
Blonde hair.

[02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:16.340]
Yeah.

[02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:17.740]
Well, not naturally blonde.

[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:19.100]
Bleach is it.

[02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:19.920]
Yeah.

[02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:22.080]
Things a lot of rap songs.

[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:22.960]
Yeah.

[02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:25.140]
Sounds like candy.

[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:26.280]
Yeah.

[02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:28.440]
Melt in your mouth.

[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:29.780]
WQM, hello.

[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:30.660]
Thank you.

[02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:31.160]
I speak to Neil.

[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:32.880]
I'm snickering as you're saying that.

[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:33.900]
Yes, he speaks to me.

[02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:34.660]
How are you, sir?

[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:35.380]
Pretty good.

[02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:40.180]
Hello, I'm just kidding.

[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:41.020]
Go ahead.

[02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:42.120]
Bear with me.

[02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:44.160]
I've been trying to get a hold of you for a while now.

[02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:44.820]
I'm here.

[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:45.460]
Slippery.

[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:48.500]
Been a long time listener since the bird seed days.

[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:49.380]
If you recall those.

[02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:51.920]
Yes, I do.

[02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:52.580]
Okay.

[02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:55.640]
Luke Kroner still having bad val movements because of those days.

[02:23:58.040 --> 02:24:00.460]
Well, all I wanted to say is like you always say.

[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:04.140]
They look like they could be a democratic.

[02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:07.980]
I'm going to snap the veto of the Joseph victory or something.

[02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:10.200]
So they're going to self-destruct is what you're trying to say.

[02:24:10.260 --> 02:24:12.220]
They're going to grab the feet from the jaws of victory.

[02:24:12.220 --> 02:24:12.780]
That's great.

[02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:13.320]
Looks like it.

[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:13.920]
They're well on their way.

[02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:14.620]
Exactly.

[02:24:15.300 --> 02:24:18.160]
And also like you might recall from those days.

[02:24:20.060 --> 02:24:23.080]
We might call you Neil Nostradamus because you predicted all this.

[02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:24.460]
Remember when you were for John Anderson?

[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:25.380]
Yeah.

[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:26.740]
And the Reagan was going to be elected.

[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:30.440]
You said all these appointees on the Supreme Court are going to bring.

[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:32.180]
You know, these are we going to rule.

[02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:32.940]
Remember those days.

[02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:33.180]
Right.

[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:33.480]
I do.

[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:33.820]
Sure.

[02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:34.380]
Yeah.

[02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:36.640]
Well, now we're paying for those choices now.

[02:24:36.820 --> 02:24:37.320]
You got it.

[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:38.840]
That's why we got what we got right now.

[02:24:38.980 --> 02:24:39.200]
Yeah.

[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:40.720]
And these are the Supremes.

[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:44.980]
And all these so-called patriarchy Republicans say, you know,

[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:46.460]
the thing America is about its choice.

[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:52.440]
When they just basically see decisions before the breastgate

[02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:54.280]
or whatever you want to call it.

[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:58.940]
At least we had the choice whether to listen to your or how it's turned or not.

[02:24:58.940 --> 02:24:59.940]
Now we have much choice.

[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:04.060]
You know, they they had the choice to turn not you on or off.

[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:05.180]
There are lots of Nazis, man.

[02:25:05.300 --> 02:25:06.620]
I mean, no sense of beating around the voice.

[02:25:06.740 --> 02:25:08.100]
There are lots of Nazis playing that simple.

[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:09.240]
We like to ask Pally.

[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:09.880]
I'll see you at the border.

[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:10.920]
Well, keep giving it to them Neil.

[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:11.580]
All right.

[02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:12.180]
Thank you.

[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:02.100]
30 seconds, I kept showing that dang thing over and over and over again.

[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:06.940]
Something about these Schwarzer cowboy anglers just kind of like let me limp if you catch my drift.

[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:09.440]
Or let me, yeah, like that.

[02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:15.640]
Louis Farricon 40, this is a battle, we haven't had a pool like this in a long time.

[02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:18.600]
Which of these people best fit the description?

[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:28.000]
Two black, Louis Farricon 40, Dion Sanders 38, Spike Lee 33, Al Sharpen 33, Jesse Jackson 31.

[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:32.340]
Oh, by the way, you know that Jesse's a baby, whatever that thing is, can't play that.

[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:33.640]
Jesse's baby.

[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:35.140]
No, you love child.

[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:36.000]
The love child thing.

[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:36.460]
Oh, yeah.

[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:37.480]
I didn't close.

[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:39.140]
I listened about the first two words.

[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:40.120]
Oh, that's it.

[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:42.240]
Fifty-seven, fourteen, Johnny Cochrane, fourteen.

[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:44.840]
Mike Tyson, seven, OJ's got only six.

[02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:47.340]
How come time aid OJ is so black?

[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:56.200]
Our city of four, Bobby Brown four, Michael Irvin four, Ryan Cox three, Alan Keys two, Chuck D's got one, James Brown one.

[02:27:56.900 --> 02:27:57.440]
Bishop Curry.

[02:27:58.320 --> 02:27:59.720]
I think he's kind of kid Korean.

[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:06.780]
Bishop Victor Curry one and no votes yet out of two hundred and forty five, a big zero for Eddie Murphy Bill Cosby.

[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:09.060]
Will Smith and even for Sammy Davis, Jr.

[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:11.940]
They figured leave him with the Jewish thing, all right?

[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:15.620]
You know what is, huh?

[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:16.680]
I said, all right.

[02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:18.300]
I'm looking for that thing.

[02:28:18.420 --> 02:28:18.960]
What is that under?

[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:20.420]
The eye?

[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:21.820]
Yeah, what is that under?

[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:25.200]
I'll never find it.

[02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:25.780]
Forget about it.

[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:26.420]
It's not worth it.

[02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:29.900]
Twelve out of seven, one out of five, sixty, WQ, much facing.

[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:33.180]
You've been here me talk for a long time for years now about fast train.

[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:37.440]
And probably wondered if it makes sense for you if you'd like to get out of the rut that you're like this stuck in right now.

[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:38.540]
The facts are simple.

[02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:41.580]
If you have the dedication, fast train can provide you with the necessary training,

[02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:44.440]
help you achieve a new high-paying computer career, and they can do it.

[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:47.140]
This is part of the best part of the deal in just four short months.

[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:49.360]
Just think about it by the end of the summer.

[02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:54.660]
You can be on your way, uh, working in a great new computer job, getting a big fat paycheck that goes along with it.

[02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:58.820]
Fast trains got day night and weekend classes, financial assistance for people who qualify.

[02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:02.560]
Once you complete your classes, fast train will even help you out and getting a new computer job.

[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:03.840]
So what's not to like?

[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:05.100]
It's really just that easy.

[02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:08.940]
Just pick up the phone, make that one easy call that could change your life in a big, big way.

[02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:12.620]
They got seven locations for it, including Miami Kindle for Lauderdale and Timber Pines.

[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:15.100]
So there's bound to be a fast train fairly close by you.

[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:18.020]
Check them out of the web at fast train.com and then make that call.

[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:21.560]
And please be sure and tell them the Todd Dreck, told you to call it, will brighten up their day.

[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:24.580]
Call 1-866-FAST-TRAIN.

[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:29.900]
5-8-Local. This is 5-6-6. The radio is on your hands.

[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:31.740]
Thank you, Ian.

[02:29:34.500 --> 02:29:35.280]
Absolutely.

[02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:48.640]
We need a leader who will give us back on track.

[02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:13.020]
Here.

[02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:14.560]
Oh my god.

[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:37.260]
Uh-huh.

[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:40.320]
Oh.

[02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:45.800]
1-18. I'd rather have a spastic hole in the middle of the week.

[02:30:45.980 --> 02:30:47.160]
But, you know, it's just something for you.

[02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:49.260]
You sure as hell can't call him being too black, can you?

[02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:49.640]
Nope.

[02:30:50.140 --> 02:30:51.420]
Just two full of crap, I think.

[02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:53.760]
We'll probably have a poll on that one these days soon.

[02:30:53.820 --> 02:30:55.500]
Which of these people do you think is two full of crap?

[02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:56.520]
I know who might win.

[02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:57.040]
Absolutely.

[02:30:57.480 --> 02:30:59.140]
Wait until you hear this, be gonna full of crap.

[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:03.360]
97-year-old handcuffed and jailed for unpaid traffic ticket.

[02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:06.280]
They won't do that again.

[02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:08.020]
Highland Park, Texas.

[02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:10.520]
But, is your love around and people up in Texas, you know?

[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:11.500]
They all round up.

[02:31:11.540 --> 02:31:12.180]
They don't must rail.

[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:15.840]
They like to smoke them out of their holes and go get them.

[02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:20.840]
Police say they had no choice but to go by the book when they handcuffed a 97-year-old woman

[02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:24.300]
and took her to jail for failing to pay a traffic ticket.

[02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:30.200]
Harriet Keltman was arrested last week after officer Stockton for having an expired registration

[02:31:30.200 --> 02:31:35.020]
and inspection sticker and realized there was a warrant for arrest for failing to pay a traffic ticket.

[02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:39.600]
Keltman, a former school teacher who was living in the Dallas suburb for decades,

[02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:45.280]
was in police custody for about two hours before her attorney arrived and she was released in her own reconnaissance.

[02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:50.200]
Our real beef with this is that no real judgment was displayed or actually carried out in the sensitive,

[02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:56.100]
said Keltman's son, Dr. Phil Keltman, Jr., a plastic reconstructive surgeon with Bayley University Medical Center.

[02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:02.740]
But police spokesman Detective Randy Milliken said the officers had no choice but to arrest Keltman's mother.

[02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:06.340]
However, a warrant begins with the words, you are hereby commended to arrest Milliken, said,

[02:32:07.580 --> 02:32:09.740]
How do you decide who you are arresting and who you don't?

[02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:13.900]
How about an aged 90 but not a 91 and up? How about between 17 and 20?

[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:19.380]
Phil Keltman, Jr., said his mother, in other words, maybe a little bit of judgment could come into play?

[02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:20.580]
No, no, they haven't got that.

[02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:23.300]
The book can't complain about their judgment because they don't have any.

[02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:28.300]
Phil Keltman, Jr., said his mother lives alone, cooks her own meals, goes out to lunch regularly,

[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:30.360]
and is involved in the community. She's got good eyesight.

[02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:35.200]
All of our enthusiasm should be tempered with judgment and therein lies my problem with this,

[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:37.580]
and basically mother's problem with it too, he said.

[02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:42.440]
Her other son, David, is a state-dhistory judge who said it would be inappropriate from to discuss the arrest.

[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:47.500]
97-year-old woman, man, which I think 90's old enough, but nevertheless she made it to 97.

[02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:51.720]
Out there driving around, she's got good eyesight. I'm sure her reflexes are great, huh?

[02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:55.660]
Nobody's asking why a 97-year-old woman is driving.

[02:32:56.360 --> 02:33:01.320]
I mean, she's got a few little pimples on her record there, but nevertheless, if you don't deny a 97-year-old woman.

[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:02.700]
You probably have a few pimples on it too.

[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:09.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:12.860]
Which of these people best pits the description to black?

[02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:15.260]
And so far, look at that.

[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:17.820]
Four votes separate to top three.

[02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:23.460]
Louis Farrakhan 44, Neon Deon 43, and El Sharpen be having 40.

[02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:25.960]
And Spike Lee's riding the rest to his moment up fast now.

[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:28.600]
Nobody QA in, hello?

[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:30.200]
Hey, Neil, great show.

[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:31.080]
Yes it is.

[02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:34.040]
Kind of surprised that I don't see Don King on that poll.

[02:33:34.060 --> 02:33:34.820]
Well, he is now.

[02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:37.160]
That's why we need you.

[02:33:37.460 --> 02:33:39.560]
That's why we need your input and insight.

[02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:40.980]
Don and his magic hair.

[02:33:41.380 --> 02:33:41.860]
You got it.

[02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:42.940]
All right, Bank of Life.

[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:43.380]
Thanks a lot.

[02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:46.160]
He kills me at Don King and other people is what we hear.

[02:33:47.980 --> 02:33:48.780]
It's amazing.

[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:51.660]
This kind of thing that goes on about people who are like a ledge,

[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:54.020]
murderers, and that's a legs like 50 cent and Don King.

[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:57.140]
And they just kind of walk around on the loose like, hey, I'm a big shot.

[02:33:57.300 --> 02:33:57.500]
You see?

[02:33:57.780 --> 02:33:58.060]
Oh, Jay.

[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:00.780]
Oh, Jay, forget about that.

[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:03.720]
Thank God they didn't play the race card of that trial.

[02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:06.900]
Speaking of trials, what's going on with Jason Williams?

[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:08.280]
Huh?

[02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:10.420]
The jury was deliberate yesterday.

[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:12.000]
Let's take a quick look at court TV.

[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:18.080]
It seems that if they're trying to find out if specifically he tampered with Chris Morris or John Gortonick,

[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:22.260]
they had to answer guilty already to the tampering with witness question.

[02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:23.060]
That's me.

[02:34:23.340 --> 02:34:26.100]
Now, they got a jury clock on here at court TV, but it's not moving.

[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:29.340]
Seven hours, 54 minutes and 27 seconds.

[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:30.240]
What does that mean?

[02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:31.420]
Is that how long they've been to the written?

[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:32.620]
Maybe it's jury rigged.

[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:35.300]
No, no, seriously, it's got to be longer than that.

[02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:36.120]
A common thought.

[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:36.900]
Yeah, look at that.

[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:37.400]
And participate.

[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:38.840]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:40.100]
But the same old crap, man.

[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:40.960]
Just kill and time.

[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:43.080]
Just fill up a bunch of time like we are today.

[02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:44.940]
At least we got to go to excuse.

[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:46.500]
I guarantee there are numbers aren't coming out tomorrow.

[02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:47.040]
Court TV.

[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:49.660]
They're pretty good though when they got the Jason Williams things on, huh?

[02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:52.400]
When you think I think.

[02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:56.400]
And remember the clowns, the jack holes who were saying,

[02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:59.040]
oh, the Kobe Bryant thing, this is going to be just as big as OJ.

[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:00.400]
Oh, my goodness.

[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:01.440]
Are they out of their mind?

[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:07.060]
I would say half of America don't know Kobe Bryant from an e to Bryant from Bryant Gumball.

[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:07.920]
Right?

[02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:08.540]
Right.

[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:09.000]
Who?

[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:09.940]
Exactly.

[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:15.360]
I mean, OJ, nobody don't know OJ whether they would like nothing or not, that's not the point.

[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:18.700]
Nobody don't know OJ and hate him like poison except in our building.

[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:20.340]
WQA, I'm hell.

[02:35:21.460 --> 02:35:21.880]
Rose.

[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:22.700]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:24.340]
Can I do the kneel?

[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:25.120]
Speaking.

[02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:28.200]
Yes, it is.

[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:30.360]
And we put you on that pole.

[02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:31.240]
Okay, great.

[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:32.380]
WQA, I'm hello.

[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:34.300]
Kneel.

[02:35:34.620 --> 02:35:35.060]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:37.180 --> 02:35:41.160]
Listen, you'll get these guys just related to last two.

[02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:42.300]
You can tell, you can kiss and cousin.

[02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:43.760]
WQA, I'm hello.

[02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:45.420]
Mr. Roses.

[02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:46.100]
Speaking.

[02:35:46.300 --> 02:35:49.240]
I'd like to nominate Warren Crowe Marty.

[02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:51.780]
Warren Crowe Marty, the Crow, oh my God.

[02:35:52.540 --> 02:35:55.120]
The Crowe is pretty black now, you mentioned it, you know what?

[02:35:55.980 --> 02:35:59.180]
And that lingo, his is kind of like, I got your crowbar, that's right here, home boy.

[02:35:59.260 --> 02:35:59.420]
Yeah.

[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:02.880]
I mean, e-bottom is one thing, but only one guy knows does the crowbar.

[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:04.560]
I got your crowbar, that's right here, home boy.

[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:07.720]
Warren Crowe Marty, let's get the old Crowe on there and speaking of Warren, how about Warren's sap?

[02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:12.240]
Warren's sap, I guarantee that Joshua will get that honor immediately.

[02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:14.180]
Would you not?

[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:15.120]
I will.

[02:36:15.460 --> 02:36:16.000]
Yes, you will.

[02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:19.000]
Or else, WQA, I'm hello.

[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:21.760]
QAM?

[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:24.160]
Yeah, is this kneel?

[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:25.240]
Yes, it is, sir.

[02:36:26.020 --> 02:36:29.100]
Kneel, I've got a couple of female entries for your...

[02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:30.460]
Well, how about just one would be excellent.

[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:31.660]
Narrow it down.

[02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:35.000]
Um, we got Oprah Winfrey yet?

[02:36:35.140 --> 02:36:35.800]
Okay, thank you.

[02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:37.220]
Oprah is too blessed.

[02:36:37.340 --> 02:36:40.140]
I see I had it like chopping off Midson's because he's got a couple.

[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:41.080]
We're not doing that anymore.

[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:42.360]
Okay, today we draw the line.

[02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:43.360]
Oprah is fine.

[02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:44.260]
That's a good choice.

[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.360]
Although I don't really look upon her as being all that black.

[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:49.040]
I look upon her as being like, I don't know.

[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:52.780]
Is she connected with lots of black causes and stuff?

[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:54.480]
She, uh, yeah, she does.

[02:36:55.620 --> 02:36:55.940]
Yeah.

[02:36:57.020 --> 02:36:58.540]
But she kind of like spreads it all around.

[02:36:58.640 --> 02:36:59.920]
I don't know, I just can't stomach her.

[02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:00.840]
She just makes me ill.

[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:03.600]
I feel, I feel like unclean when I see her on my set.

[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:06.840]
All the much worse when Dr. Phil pops up.

[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:10.540]
See, at least, at least, even though her show blows and she's got nothing to say,

[02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:13.160]
uh, at least she accomplished something on her own.

[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:16.260]
She didn't have to be like a, like a spin-off from somebody else.

[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:17.300]
Nobody popped her up.

[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:20.040]
I mean, unlike like the Jefferson's, which was a great show,

[02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:22.160]
I'm very, very funny and spot-of-what-and-jigger things,

[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:25.320]
uh, without all in the family, there wouldn't have been no Jefferson's.

[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:25.560]
Right.

[02:37:26.020 --> 02:37:29.160]
And without Oprah, there wouldn't have been no Dr. Phil.

[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:33.160]
The difference being that the Jefferson's was great and Dr. Phil

[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:33.940]
blows.

[02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:36.520]
WQM, hello.

[02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:37.500]
Hello, Neil.

[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:38.420]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:40.000]
We forgot Miriam Olufant.

[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:42.400]
Oh, we, how's Sylvie Forgett?

[02:37:42.420 --> 02:37:42.780]
Okay.

[02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:43.940]
Thank you so much.

[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:44.620]
Thank you, bye.

[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:45.300]
He's on her media.

[02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:45.740]
Thank you.

[02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:47.520]
Miriam the big, big, Elephant.

[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:50.660]
Hey, listen, she just got railroaded.

[02:37:50.700 --> 02:37:51.380]
You know how that is?

[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:52.300]
It's a racial thing.

[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:53.100]
No matter what it is,

[02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:55.020]
any time a black person does something bad,

[02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:56.060]
it's always a racial thing.

[02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:56.580]
We know that.

[02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:57.120]
Am I right?

[02:37:57.260 --> 02:37:57.660]
Who bet?

[02:37:57.800 --> 02:37:58.840]
That's American, uh, way.

[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:00.200]
American, and way.

[02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:01.340]
What?

[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.160]
Well, hey, we can't play that no more.

[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:05.420]
We're going to have to clear that per act.

[02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:07.480]
In fact, let me just, and I better not.

[02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:08.320]
I'll do it during the break.

[02:38:09.260 --> 02:38:10.840]
Listen to how good the bleep is and that thing.

[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:12.940]
Are you listening to it during the break?

[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:16.160]
Well, both listen to what I, all three of us will listen to it.

[02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:16.600]
How do you like that?

[02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:18.120]
We'll have a committee vote on it.

[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:19.400]
And see if we have to stick a,

[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:21.020]
I'm there in the middle, cover it up.

[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:24.260]
Because we don't want to be letting no nasty words go on here,

[02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:28.200]
because Michael Powell and John Adelstein and Michael cops,

[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:30.880]
all these other word cops up there in DC are going to get all

[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:31.540]
bent out of shape.

[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:34.040]
And there'll be people who are monitoring us who are sending off,

[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:35.640]
oh, angry, angry letters.

[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.860]
Oh, I heard this and I smelled that.

[02:38:37.980 --> 02:38:38.100]
Yeah.

[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:43.860]
And the public sits back and accept this as though this is what America's all about.

[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:44.980]
And this is this to me.

[02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:47.300]
This is the most amazing part to show you what a fabulous,

[02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:51.040]
you think the religion is to do a good job of turning the people's brains to mush.

[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:53.960]
They're a pikers when it comes to the mass media.

[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:57.160]
Who is going to be on American Idol?

[02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:58.960]
And how come that broad didn't win last week?

[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:00.840]
She got railroaded and it was a raw deal.

[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:04.700]
26 after 1 at 5, 60 WQM.

[02:39:04.780 --> 02:39:07.840]

On Saturday, it's closing night for the top of the park

[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:30.060]

And then you can hack it on the way home to get money for a gas.

[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:46.780]
Located just a half mile from both on on on the 5th and the floor to turn pipe,

Support radio 560, QAM.

[02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:31.980]
This is the grow and we're talking

[02:40:31.980 --> 02:40:34.480]
Hobble on 560W QAM.

[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:40.440]
Call me homie right here at 567-H-O-O-F-O-F-6.

[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:43.960]
Call me homie, let's be talking to Steve and Miami.

[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:45.680]
Steve, you know what me?

[02:40:46.100 --> 02:40:46.800]
Warren Camatti.

[02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:50.460]
Well Crow, what do the marbles have to do to win the World Series this year?

[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:52.240]
Oh, that's an easy one, Steve.

[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:54.760]
They got to swing them back, hit them both,

[02:40:55.260 --> 02:40:55.940]
hit some strikes.

[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:59.000]
Remember, the game of baseball is 50% hitting.

[02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:00.080]
Who has almost half?

[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:04.280]
50% feeling, 50% pushing, and 20% managing.

[02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:07.280]
But Crow, that's 175%.

[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:08.920]
What? Don't you be questioning me?

[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:10.040]
Would you be ignorant?

[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:10.820]
Be what?

[02:41:11.260 --> 02:41:11.600]
Ignit.

[02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:13.900]
Ignit, I said you'll be ignorant.

[02:41:14.180 --> 02:41:15.540]
Well, no, I'm not ignorant.

[02:41:15.900 --> 02:41:18.160]
Boy, I'm playing ball, fencing on baseball.

[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:21.320]
In a terrible country, it's men half my size.

[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:22.000]
Did you?

[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:23.800]
Well, actually I...

[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:24.680]
I played in...

[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:25.560]
I played in...

[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:27.120]
Are you gonna be out of the man?

[02:41:27.380 --> 02:41:28.260]
Can I be out of the man?

[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:31.020]
Call me homie, I'm the Crow.

[02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:33.620]
Out of gate G, gentlemen will be...

[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:37.900]
131 at 560, WQM, Curtis Stevenson for the Mad Dog at 2, just for half an hour.

[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:40.900]
Because Mad Dog, like I said, he came in for half hour,

[02:41:41.020 --> 02:41:44.260]
even the Crowian Artists isn't coming in before the baseball game, just for a lot of the half hour.

[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:48.020]
But Curtis is around, he's in a building, and he's got nothing else to do anyway.

[02:41:48.300 --> 02:41:50.120]
And so he can polish up his delivery, right?

[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:50.860]
Right.

[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:54.040]
So here we got Marlon's on deck at 2.30.

[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:55.880]
Marlon's at the Rockies 305.

[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:01.080]
After last night's Barnburner, you got the big 6 to 10, we apologize in advance.

[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:02.100]
Any case follows that.

[02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:04.360]
How'd you like to follow four hours of the big...

[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:04.980]
Wow.

[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:06.120]
Woof!

[02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:12.040]
5.67, hope 5.60, pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon Line.

[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:13.160]
Line 9, hello.

[02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:14.800]
Hi, it's Neil Rogers.

[02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:15.520]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:18.200]
This is Laurie from Arizona, and I just love your show.

[02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:19.000]
Thanks, Laurie.

[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:20.980]
Well, I have found a good one.

[02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:21.640]
Star Jones.

[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:22.820]
Who is it?

[02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:23.660]
Star Jones.

[02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:25.680]
Star Jones is excellent, right?

[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:26.780]
Very good.

[02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:27.440]
Thanks.

[02:42:27.700 --> 02:42:28.360]
Have a great day.

[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:28.860]
You too.

[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:29.320]
Bye-bye.

[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:30.300]
Freeze in Arizona.

[02:42:32.140 --> 02:42:33.440]
Star Jones is a good choice.

[02:42:33.860 --> 02:42:34.040]
Yes.

[02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:36.360]
My set goes in the off position.

[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:42.260]
5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:42:42.900 --> 02:42:43.580]
WDQA, hello.

[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:45.060]
Yeah, Neil?

[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:45.820]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:51.040]
Yeah, hey, first of all, I said that BDQA and Girl, yesterday was just top notch.

[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:53.240]
He might like this one, or forever.

[02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:55.580]
Did you think he was in that movie, Anaconda?

[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:57.580]
She was the Anaconda.

[02:42:58.260 --> 02:42:58.620]
Yeah, oh.

[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:00.820]
She was the Anacusta.

[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:06.140]
Hey, listen, I got the one for your poor Jim Brown, the running back, not today.

[02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:06.600]
Okay, thank you.

[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:07.980]
Maybe we'll have to move on.

[02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:08.960]
Thanks a lot, pound 4.60.

[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:10.200]
Have a good morning.

[02:43:11.420 --> 02:43:13.940]
All right, don't have to get tested, but don't get defensive.

[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:15.880]
He's got two votes already.

[02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:17.920]
In fact, he's right in there with Bishop Curry.

[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:19.180]
Have you ever seen the two of them together?

[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:19.420]
No.

[02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:20.600]
Same person, just awesome.

[02:43:20.700 --> 02:43:20.800]
Wait.

[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:30.100]
Bishop, Bishop Curry, if there's maybe a make a list of about half a dozen people who are the real, real problem in South Florida.

[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:33.180]
Professional Oshan Prabhakaturam, and he's one of them.

[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:38.360]
I can't think of anything constructive that this man has ever said or done.

[02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:43.020]
It's just always belly aching, always, always finding a racist under every rock.

[02:43:43.020 --> 02:43:43.680]
I make your pardon?

[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:46.000]
If you had a gut like that, you'd be belly aching all the time too.

[02:43:46.300 --> 02:43:47.060]
Oh, he got a big gut.

[02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:48.080]
You've never seen him?

[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:50.380]
I thought Bishop Curry was like a skinny old guy.

[02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:52.840]
Who might be thinking of different guys?

[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:56.840]
I must be confusing him with our old car wash guy, IOD.

[02:43:57.180 --> 02:43:57.500]
Spencer?

[02:43:57.940 --> 02:43:58.300]
Spencer.

[02:43:58.840 --> 02:43:59.860]
He was a skinny old guy.

[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.100]
Well, that's what I'm talking about.

[02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:01.820]
Aren't they the same guy?

[02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:02.840]
Bishop Curry and Spencer?

[02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:06.700]
If it's the person I'm thinking of, maybe somebody will clarify it.

[02:44:06.860 --> 02:44:07.440]
I don't think so.

[02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:08.260]
I think you got the wrong guy.

[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:09.720]
Bishop Curry is a big fat doctor.

[02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:11.780]
No, that's Bishop Tutu you're thinking about.

[02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:12.840]
No, no.

[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:14.440]
He worshiped him.

[02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:16.120]
He worshiped him just whatever regular.

[02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:19.820]
Well, I don't want to get into his personal assault.

[02:44:20.100 --> 02:44:20.620]
Okay, just relax.

[02:44:20.900 --> 02:44:21.540]
Okay, calm down.

[02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:23.260]
You're a little whipped up about poor Bishop Curry.

[02:44:25.020 --> 02:44:25.760]
WDQA and hello.

[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:27.640]
Yeah, Bishop Curry is kind of skinny.

[02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:29.020]
Yeah, I thought so.

[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:29.680]
Yeah, he is.

[02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:30.560]
Johnny guy.

[02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:34.460]
Just curious where I get to my nomination, which I think is kind of historically relevant.

[02:44:34.980 --> 02:44:38.620]
Have you ever thought about if Eric even approached you if you would have done anything with him?

[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:40.960]
Not really.

[02:44:41.260 --> 02:44:44.440]
I don't respect him to approach me, especially with an agent like I got a number two.

[02:44:44.740 --> 02:44:45.940]
I don't want to do that kind of radio.

[02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:47.900]
I just, I mean, if they're going to pay me a ton of money, sure.

[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:52.880]
Yeah, it's too bad because, you know, obviously the guys they got on are now just not professional.

[02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:56.720]
No, but even that, what they want to do is just it's not going to sell.

[02:44:56.780 --> 02:44:57.560]
It's like a death wish.

[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:03.400]
I mean, why would you want to like throw away all the years that I've invested for an outfit that's obviously failing already?

[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:05.880]
They've only been on three and a half weeks or four weeks, whatever it's been.

[02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:06.880]
And they're already failing.

[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:09.960]
They're people are quitting and they got two markets off the deal.

[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:11.500]
And I just don't see it going anymore.

[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:12.200]
The checks are bouncing.

[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:14.160]
Have you ever worked for an organization like that before?

[02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:14.880]
I guess not.

[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:15.580]
No, I have not.

[02:45:15.740 --> 02:45:16.740]
I haven't worked for one way.

[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:17.940]
I was going to go to hell.

[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:19.300]
I work for one right now.

[02:45:19.300 --> 02:45:20.480]
It's hard to get a hold of them.

[02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:20.740]
Okay.

[02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:21.640]
That's the only problem.

[02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:23.040]
They clear if he can get a hold of it.

[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:25.860]
What are the odds that Randy gets back to West Palm before the end of the year?

[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:28.080]
I say pretty good.

[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:32.180]
Hey, listen, my nomination for a guy who was, you would, I think you would appreciate this.

[02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:32.680]
Jim Brown.

[02:45:34.060 --> 02:45:34.700]
Jim Brown.

[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:36.040]
The original militant.

[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:38.400]
You mean the one that's got two votes on the poll right now?

[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:39.400]
Oh, is it you already on there?

[02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:40.380]
Don't feel bad.

[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:40.840]
I know.

[02:45:40.940 --> 02:45:42.500]
Then I'll switch it over and I'll say I'll sharpen.

[02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:45.460]
Oh, he's only got 47 votes.

[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:48.620]
In my last chance is John Thompson coached George down.

[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:50.300]
Okay, have you ever great day, pal?

[02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:52.300]
Wow.

[02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:55.300]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound.

[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:57.520]
Well, listen, I got one for another athlete.

[02:45:59.240 --> 02:45:59.600]
Okay.

[02:46:00.020 --> 02:46:01.900]
Before I Josh's time, Bill Russell.

[02:46:03.980 --> 02:46:06.200]
Great, great Celtic superstar, Bill Russell.

[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:07.840]
I mean, he was just, I don't know.

[02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:11.500]
He was a real, oh, and I got another one for you too.

[02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:14.820]
Okay.

[02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:15.240]
Yeah.

[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:16.720]
I can't think of his name though.

[02:46:17.100 --> 02:46:17.840]
They called him the grape.

[02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:18.800]
I don't want to say it.

[02:46:19.420 --> 02:46:19.800]
It's bad.

[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:21.140]
Basketball player.

[02:46:22.420 --> 02:46:23.200]
What was his name?

[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:24.520]
Tedis Rodman.

[02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:26.280]
Not Dennis Rodman.

[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:27.960]
Wilt.

[02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:30.460]
Oh, good God.

[02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:32.200]
The facts is a matter of start coming in.

[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:33.500]
Okay, we're not going to sleep at all tonight.

[02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:34.680]
How's that possible?

[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:36.200]
New York Knicks.

[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:36.960]
The grape.

[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:38.120]
Eight.

[02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:39.580]
Greenbub Dualtobar.

[02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:40.340]
No.

[02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:44.280]
See, I'm sitting on a sports station.

[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:44.620]
Okay.

[02:46:44.980 --> 02:46:46.000]
On a sports station.

[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:47.380]
I can go with a man.

[02:46:47.620 --> 02:46:47.720]
You are.

[02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:48.380]
Here we go.

[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:48.860]
I'm hurt.

[02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:51.360]
Like recently?

[02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:53.200]
Package you.

[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:54.600]
There you go.

[02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:55.640]
Well, what do you mean like recently?

[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:56.160]
Like they're using it.

[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:57.220]
Well, you're talking Bill Russell.

[02:46:57.460 --> 02:46:58.560]
And then you say the Knicks.

[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:00.080]
Well, there you go.

[02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:01.540]
It was Patrick Ewing, of course.

[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:03.880]
Didn't Patrick Ewing play for the Knicks?

[02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:04.660]
Yes, he did.

[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:06.220]
So what are we talking about here?

[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:08.300]
I don't even follow the NBA, Mr.

[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:09.900]
Different time to build.

[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:11.820]
No Bob Kuzi from Bob Pettit.

[02:47:11.860 --> 02:47:12.480]
How do you like that?

[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:13.780]
That's what you know about basketball.

[02:47:14.220 --> 02:47:15.560]
All you know is this crap we got now.

[02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:16.580]
This slam a jam a crap.

[02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:18.600]
Anyway, Patrick Ewing, put him on there.

[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:20.200]
And spell it right.

[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:21.980]
Wasn't he part of the Ewing family?

[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:22.560]
What was that show?

[02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:25.700]
That was five, five, six, seven, oh five, six, ten.

[02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:26.500]
I think he and J.R.

[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:27.320]
Used to be pretty tight.

[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:28.520]
Oh, I speak of the J.R.

[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:30.160]
Have you seen any of that?

[02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:31.220]
You don't read the taboids.

[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:31.940]
What's his name?

[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:32.180]
Larry.

[02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:33.900]
Played J.R.

[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:34.440]
Who?

[02:47:34.860 --> 02:47:35.340]
Larry Hagman.

[02:47:35.660 --> 02:47:36.180]
Larry Hagman.

[02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:37.860]
He is talk about Hagrid.

[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.040]
He is like an averge.

[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:41.660]
In the inquire, they've had him dying for months now.

[02:47:41.780 --> 02:47:44.800]
He just had a liver transplant not too long ago.

[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:47.600]
And now the liver just to spit out all the onions and bacon

[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:48.820]
and says, forget about this one.

[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:49.320]
Good new one.

[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:50.460]
That's his 12th liver.

[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:52.280]
And he turned it down.

[02:47:52.420 --> 02:47:54.080]
He said, now I've just given up.

[02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:55.540]
Somebody else better get the liver, all right?

[02:47:55.540 --> 02:47:57.680]
I'm just throwing in the towel.

[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:00.120]
WQA and hello.

[02:48:02.220 --> 02:48:02.800]
QA and?

[02:48:04.300 --> 02:48:05.260]
Too late, you lose.

[02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:06.140]
WQA and hello.

[02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:08.240]
How about Mike Tyson?

[02:48:08.980 --> 02:48:09.360]
Mike Tyson?

[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:10.280]
I'm not Mike Tyson.

[02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:12.260]
I bet you if I looked down there, I'd find...

[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:14.300]
This is always my favorite part.

[02:48:14.500 --> 02:48:15.420]
He's only got it as a vote.

[02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:16.940]
So it's good to mention him again.

[02:48:18.740 --> 02:48:20.120]
See, I guess it's my bad.

[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:22.740]
I should just keep reading this list over and over again today.

[02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:24.120]
But otherwise it's no fun.

[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:26.380]
Because the audience, when people do that, like to go,

[02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:28.360]
like that, say, why are they dumb?

[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:33.560]
Which of these people best fits the description of two black?

[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:36.220]
Louis Farrakhan 57.

[02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:38.560]
Neon Dion Sanders 52.

[02:48:38.980 --> 02:48:40.160]
Al Sharpen 47.

[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:41.820]
Jesse Jackson 42.

[02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:45.220]
So the top four are all within like, and Spike Lee 39.

[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:46.180]
The top five.

[02:48:46.620 --> 02:48:47.240]
They got a shot.

[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:48.880]
50 cent 20.

[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:50.400]
Johnny Cochran 15.

[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:51.920]
Mike Tyson's got a dozen.

[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:52.880]
I think I just said that.

[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:54.040]
Oh, Jay's got nine.

[02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:54.760]
Michael Irving 8.

[02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:55.820]
Our City Hall of Five.

[02:48:56.140 --> 02:48:56.880]
Brian Cox 5.

[02:48:57.380 --> 02:48:57.900]
Bobby Brown.

[02:48:58.640 --> 02:48:59.640]
He's knocking her down.

[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:00.400]
He's got four.

[02:49:01.260 --> 02:49:02.240]
Duncings got only three.

[02:49:02.340 --> 02:49:03.080]
How's that possible?

[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:05.060]
Allen Keys 3.

[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:05.580]
How come...

[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:06.340]
Yeah, Allen Keys.

[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:07.540]
We didn't even discuss him.

[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:08.060]
Wow.

[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:10.380]
There is one subhating piece of theory.

[02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:10.960]
Allen Keys.

[02:49:12.140 --> 02:49:13.960]
Mr. Goody Tushu's right wing.

[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:15.140]
Oh, I'll tell you another one.

[02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:16.000]
I don't know what his name is.

[02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:17.020]
Is it...

[02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:19.220]
Armistrand, are Williams or something like that?

[02:49:19.380 --> 02:49:19.800]
Something like that.

[02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:21.200]
You know the one I'm talking about.

[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:24.220]
The right wing black guy that's on the talking head shows all the time with the little goofy glasses.

[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:25.920]
How much did they be paying him?

[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:25.920]

[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:28.040]
Oh my God Almighty.

[02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:31.020]
Let's see.

[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.060]
Allen Keys has got...what does he got?

[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:34.020]
Three.

[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:35.460]
Don King 3.

[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:36.120]
Will Smith 2.

[02:49:36.260 --> 02:49:37.000]
Miriam Allfant 2.

[02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:37.680]
Jim Brown 2.

[02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:39.480]
Bishop Curry's got two.

[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:41.640]
He's a skinny guy.

[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:43.000]
Bill Cosby 1.

[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:44.180]
Chuck D's got one.

[02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:44.400]
One more.

[02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:44.860]
Cromarty.

[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:45.520]
The Crosgar 1.

[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:46.340]
Sammy Davis Jr.

[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:47.960]
And no votes yet.

[02:49:48.220 --> 02:49:49.580]
None 0 for any Murphy.

[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:50.540]
Warren Samp,

[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:51.400]
Star Jones,

[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:52.320]
Bill Russell Patrick,

[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:53.600]
you can just win on 3.39.

[02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:56.720]
So now we got less than,

[02:49:56.740 --> 02:49:57.760]
let's see, it's 140.

[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:00.120]
Love and 30 tomorrow is what?

[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:01.100]
Like 22.

[02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:03.600]
Less than 21 hours and 50 minutes away.

[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:05.460]
Now that we're counting.

[02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:06.980]
That's right.

[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:10.120]
A lot of hysteria, a lot of psychosis going on because this is a...

[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:10.940]
Well, first of all,

[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:13.280]
it's the first book to come after all this stuff that's going on.

[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:15.620]
First book after Stern got taken off by Cheap Channel.

[02:50:15.620 --> 02:50:17.320]
After Big 106 through in the towel.

[02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:19.740]
And all this other stuff.

[02:50:19.860 --> 02:50:21.680]
Plus, of course, Moe's got that bad January.

[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:22.200]
Absolutely.

[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:23.700]
You know, let's see if he can make the big comeback.

[02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:24.760]
The Moe and Gildy show.

[02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:26.320]
Or, of course, if not, well.

[02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:28.660]
Especially with Stern being off here.

[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:31.460]
We might have to start putting our heads together and thinking something really good to put on the morning.

[02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:32.000]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:50:33.060 --> 02:50:33.700]
What do you say?

[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:35.900]
I'm saying, hey Moe.

[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:36.220]
Bye.

[02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:36.780]
Absolutely.

[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:37.400]
Bye-bye.

[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:39.240]
And speaking of Moe,

[02:50:39.300 --> 02:50:40.740]
when a hair replacement is bad,

[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:42.140]
man, everybody laughs at you.

[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:44.140]
When you got one of them animals crawling around on your head,

[02:50:44.140 --> 02:50:46.000]
and people look and say, what a silly looking,

[02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:47.140]
whoop that is.

[02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:49.220]
You can always spot a bad hair piece.

[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:50.660]
But how many good ones go unnoticed?

[02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:54.760]
Because Charles Hopper has been designing and supplying great looking hair systems to showbiz people.

[02:50:55.140 --> 02:50:57.820]
And ordinary guys like you for more than 35 years.

[02:50:58.200 --> 02:51:01.380]
He's appeared as a guest on Good Morning America that today shows CBS Morning News,

[02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:06.480]
introducing his patent and hair system that offers you the most amazing natural hair line system in the universe.

[02:51:07.220 --> 02:51:09.480]
Now, the most critical area of any hair system is the hairline.

[02:51:09.580 --> 02:51:11.200]
In other words, it looks like it's going out of your scalp,

[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:14.660]
and it's okay if it looks like something is crawling around up there, ain't okay.

[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:17.960]
And Charles Hopper is new skin-like hair system is so great looking.

[02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:20.220]
It is 100% undetectable.

[02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:21.780]
And Charles gives you this guarantee.

[02:51:21.940 --> 02:51:23.800]
He tries his hair system for 30 days.

[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:24.740]
But 30, man.

[02:51:24.820 --> 02:51:26.940]
And after a month, if you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells,

[02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:29.800]
if you're not getting clawed at by men moving and everything that moves,

[02:51:30.020 --> 02:51:31.800]
even animals, return it for a full refund.

[02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:34.740]
And Charlie also services and repairs existing hair systems,

[02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:36.480]
including shampoo and trim.

[02:51:36.980 --> 02:51:38.500]
So don't delay, call Charlie today,

[02:51:38.860 --> 02:51:40.220]
and get yourself a great looking piece.

[02:51:40.220 --> 02:51:42.280]

Look, forget the mollo.

[02:51:47.980 --> 02:51:48.260]
Absolutely.

[02:51:48.380 --> 02:51:49.180]

[02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:01.400]
You way, yeah.

Paul This Month,

[02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:07.320]
On A&E.

[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:09.520]
I'm starting to get pretty good at that.

[02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:10.480]
You know that one finger deal?

[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:11.100]
Yeah, I'm good.

[02:53:12.900 --> 02:53:13.500]
Oh, man.

[02:53:13.780 --> 02:53:15.020]
Now, I think only you and I,

[02:53:15.180 --> 02:53:15.720]
and Boca-Briner,

[02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:16.680]
the only three people in the world

[02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:17.460]
that know what he said in there,

[02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:17.840]
Jackie,

[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:19.380]
Jackie Moe is what he said.

[02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:20.580]
They got to know his Jackie Moe.

[02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:21.960]
I didn't even know Jackie Moe was black.

[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:22.960]
I thought it was Jewish.

[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:26.300]
That's what your good friend, Jackie,

[02:53:26.420 --> 02:53:26.980]
Lee, used to say,

[02:53:27.060 --> 02:53:28.480]
all you got to know is Jackie Moe.

[02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:28.880]
Oh, I see,

[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:30.200]
he had forgotten what was in there, didn't he?

[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:31.360]
No, I didn't forget.

[02:53:32.140 --> 02:53:32.800]
I didn't either,

[02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:33.280]
I didn't think of this.

[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:35.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:53:35.580 --> 02:53:37.360]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T,

[02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:38.100]
all the bleeps,

[02:53:38.260 --> 02:53:39.060]
all the time.

[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:40.000]
We're going to do one of these.

[02:53:40.160 --> 02:53:40.620]
One of those,

[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:41.400]
you have a couple of these.

[02:53:42.180 --> 02:53:43.040]
Because nobody can say

[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:43.740]
it's nothing no more.

[02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:45.260]
The American public just sits back.

[02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:45.800]
Oh, yeah.

[02:53:45.900 --> 02:53:46.920]
Whatever you say, Massa.

[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:48.060]
Anything you say, Massa.

[02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:50.040]
Very submissive,

[02:53:50.180 --> 02:53:51.520]
just a cave and right on in.

[02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:52.440]
Whatever they tell us.

[02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:54.040]
See, in our case,

[02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:54.760]
we want the money.

[02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:56.500]
So I don't give a crap what they tell us.

[02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:57.420]
If they want us just to play

[02:53:57.420 --> 02:53:58.460]
four hours of that,

[02:53:58.920 --> 02:53:59.160]
real easy.

[02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:00.400]
They're going to end this loop.

[02:54:00.760 --> 02:54:01.360]
No problem.

[02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:03.280]
Just make sure they're checked.

[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:04.520]
Show up close to one time.

[02:54:04.520 --> 02:54:06.260]
It would be nice for the accounting bitch.

[02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:08.040]
WQM, hello.

[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:09.280]
Yeah.

[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:09.600]
Hi.

[02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:13.360]
You missed JG Walker.

[02:54:13.980 --> 02:54:14.580]
JG Walker.

[02:54:14.740 --> 02:54:15.440]
We got him on it right now.

[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:16.040]
Because you said it.

[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:16.420]
Thank you.

[02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:17.500]
JG Walker.

[02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:18.080]
Yeah, he's annoying.

[02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:20.560]
Very annoying and very.

[02:54:20.740 --> 02:54:24.480]
That whole act of his very offensive.

[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:27.420]
In fact, you would note.

[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:28.200]
Not well, I don't know.

[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:30.000]
Going back to like Amos and Andy.

[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:31.340]
All those things.

[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:31.340]

[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:31.340]

[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:31.340]

[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:31.340]

[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:31.340]

[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:31.340]

[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:32.980]
I think that's the stereotypical black folks that are on it.

[02:54:33.100 --> 02:54:34.480]
Like Esther Roll, what about her?

[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:35.300]
Did we put her on there?

[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:35.500]
No.

[02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:35.960]
No.

[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:37.040]
Too black.

[02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:39.200]
That whole show.

[02:54:39.340 --> 02:54:39.680]
Good times.

[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:41.140]
I think that was bad times.

[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:43.180]
For the black folks.

[02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:43.960]
Good times.

[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:45.700]
She's still dead, by the way.

[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:46.120]
Esther Roll.

[02:54:46.940 --> 02:54:47.660]
How about you QA?

[02:54:47.660 --> 02:54:47.960]
Am, hello.

[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:50.500]
Not me for your list today.

[02:54:50.620 --> 02:54:50.960]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:52.160]
Chris Rock.

[02:54:53.540 --> 02:54:54.100]
Oh, okay.

[02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:55.340]
We'll put him on there with great reluctance.

[02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:56.080]
He says Chris Rock.

[02:54:56.180 --> 02:54:57.040]
We like Chris Rock a lot.

[02:54:57.140 --> 02:54:57.440]
But he's.

[02:54:57.460 --> 02:54:58.680]
How can see where he's coming from.

[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:00.340]
He's pretty black.

[02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:01.660]
Yeah.

[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:05.300]
I mean, just literally, I mean, in every sense of the word.

[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:05.740]
He's.

[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:09.500]
When Chris Rock comes out, you don't have any doubts that here's a black comic.

[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:10.760]
You know, not just a guy that's funny.

[02:55:10.900 --> 02:55:11.420]
See what I'm saying?

[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:12.260]
What do you say?

[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:12.400]
No.

[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:13.180]
I don't know.

[02:55:13.260 --> 02:55:13.860]
Just put him on there.

[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:14.420]
I'm happy.

[02:55:15.420 --> 02:55:16.120]
WQA, I'm hello.

[02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:17.480]
Deal.

[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:18.380]
Yes, sir.

[02:55:19.220 --> 02:55:20.220]
I got one for the poll.

[02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:20.940]
All right.

[02:55:22.020 --> 02:55:22.440]
Pop Daddy.

[02:55:22.940 --> 02:55:24.560]
Pop Daddy is a magnificent choice.

[02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:26.040]
In fact, he's making a comeback now.

[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:27.180]
He's pretending to be an actor.

[02:55:27.540 --> 02:55:27.980]
Oh, man.

[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:28.920]
He blows.

[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:31.660]
He just makes me want to gag.

[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000]
I'm so glad we got him on it before the show ended.

[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:34.740]
P. Diddy.

[02:55:35.080 --> 02:55:35.980]
He sure put it on there.

[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:36.440]
P. Diddy.

[02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:37.800]
Or he'll like come and bitch slap you.

[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:38.260]
Josh.

[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:39.180]
Party put puff.

[02:55:41.140 --> 02:55:46.140]
Well, I'm sure that I'm sure Eric will straighten it out to protect your, you know, your future.

[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:47.120]
Wait here.

[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:49.740]
This story is speaking of that virus stalking the Vegas strip.

[02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:56.260]
The Centers for Disease Control has been helping Las Vegas deal with an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness.

[02:55:56.960 --> 02:55:58.520]
Too bad we can't play this other song.

[02:55:58.520 --> 02:55:59.940]
I'm working play some of that.

[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:05.280]
Gastrointestinal illnesses, the bane of the cruise industry and of course anybody goes on a cruise.

[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:07.060]
They deserve whatever they get.

[02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:08.860]
Josh, you ever go on a cruise?

[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:09.680]
No.

[02:56:10.140 --> 02:56:10.440]
Don't.

[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:11.500]
George.

[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:15.740]
No, talk about those gambling cruises to nowhere for whatever they are.

[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:16.720]
Are they sour or something like that?

[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:16.940]
Yeah.

[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:17.120]

[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:18.380]
Don't.

[02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:18.920]
Okay.

[02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:22.740]
Gastrointestinal illnesses have struck the Las Vegas gambling district.

[02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:31.560]
One casino hotel received 1,660 complaints of such illnesses between December and last week and outbreak that drove the attention of the Centers for Disease Control.

[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:35.420]
The California hotel and casino were getting and ever even heard of it.

[02:56:35.820 --> 02:56:41.540]
Guests and gamblers became ill, was asked to sanitize, dice twice per eight hour shift and chips and coins at least once a week.

[02:56:41.620 --> 02:56:44.660]
So David Tinelli spoke some form of Attaclark's County Health District.

[02:56:45.900 --> 02:56:50.580]
These hotel systems are where you were two years ago, David Forney, chief of the Centers for Disease Controls.

[02:56:50.580 --> 02:56:54.980]
Vessel sanitation program filled the annual meeting of cruise industry executives today at Port Everglades.

[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:57.480]
A lot of people are learning what you did two years ago.

[02:56:58.620 --> 02:57:06.380]
CDC officials have been helping Vegas deal with the outbreak and local health department expects to have a meeting soon with casino hotel representatives to discuss public health concerns.

[02:57:07.180 --> 02:57:15.920]
Over the past two years, cruise lines have reported to the CDC several thousand cases of gastrointestinal illnesses including the Norwag virus or Norow virus.

[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:21.280]
The rest of the board chips, followed from the outbreaks as well as from the war in Iraq put a considerable dent in the now recovering travel business.

[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:29.520]
Las Vegas health officials noted that not all of the 1660 complaints of gastrointestinal illness at the California hotel and casino were confirmed as Norow virus.

[02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:35.920]
The outbreak at the hotel casino a block from the Vegas tripp reached a peak in March and appears to be on the Wayne, Tinelli said.

[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:41.440]
Well, that's a good news. It's waning in Vegas, which nobody cares because they're all going to stay inside anyway, which is what they want.

[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:42.860]
They don't want you to go outside.

[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:49.380]
They don't want you ever to leave. They want to get you in there like locked the doors from the inside from the outside.

[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:50.820]
Keep your locked ass locked in.

[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:51.940]
And that basically what they want.

[02:57:52.140 --> 02:57:52.500]
Yes, right.

[02:57:53.380 --> 02:57:53.920]
It's fun.

[02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:58.260]
It's a lot of fun. I'm not going back, but it's from a, oh, gee, how can you say that?

[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:00.780]
Neal, you go try it now. Josh is going there.

[02:58:00.860 --> 02:58:01.900]
Now this coming month, right?

[02:58:02.340 --> 02:58:02.840]
Yeah, very soon.

[02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:04.300]
He's going very soon to Vegas.

[02:58:04.420 --> 02:58:06.020]
Gonna have a wonderful time loses ass.

[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:08.140]
And that'll be it.

[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:10.080]
But he'll come back all smiles here to your all.

[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:12.100]
It was great. And he's right. It's a lot of fun.

[02:58:12.340 --> 02:58:15.200]
Lose I'd rather take somebody else's money and lose it.

[02:58:15.220 --> 02:58:17.420]
Right. Don't get married, by the way.

[02:58:17.860 --> 02:58:19.060]
Okay. So here's the thing.

[02:58:19.120 --> 02:58:20.780]
I'm not going to get married. I'm not going to Vegas again.

[02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:22.700]
And if I lose anybody's money, how about Craig Reed?

[02:58:22.820 --> 02:58:23.680]
A couple of many would be good.

[02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:25.680]
Small, but it's small change to him.

[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:29.640]
Look at that race. We got Lewis Farrakhan 61.

[02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:31.700]
Dion Sanders 56.

[02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:35.120]
Al Sharpton 48. Spike Lee 45.

[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:36.700]
Jesse Jackson 45.

[02:58:37.020 --> 02:58:39.120]
We got a five-way race man.

[02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:39.680]
Why?

[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:41.680]
Look all the way here.

[02:58:41.860 --> 02:58:43.180]
Sports video 560.

[02:58:43.360 --> 02:58:44.820]
See you at 8 p.m.

[02:58:52.120 --> 02:58:55.480]
Back in the day when someone done a strong.

[02:58:56.680 --> 02:58:58.640]
We didn't take their cry.

[02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:02.920]
Infernal harbor or when the jobs drop their bonds.

[02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:05.700]
We bummed them bad.

[02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:09.360]
And now the Saudis, they hit us hard.

[02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:12.400]
And on our cards, our little flags wave.

[02:59:13.300 --> 02:59:15.900]
Has that Saudi love and recharge?

[02:59:16.540 --> 02:59:19.860]
Voice of bombers the wrong way.

[02:59:22.620 --> 02:59:26.200]
And of embarrass to be in America,

[02:59:26.920 --> 02:59:29.880]
where they follow wounds like cheese.

[02:59:29.880 --> 02:59:33.180]
The United States of arrogance,

[02:59:33.920 --> 02:59:35.620]
led by Bush and his family,

[02:59:36.040 --> 02:59:37.500]
breathing of his country.

[02:59:38.980 --> 02:59:41.500]
And the length of the darkest days,

[02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:43.200]
and I used to be.

[02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:47.180]
I don't want to be a packs of America.

[02:59:49.140 --> 02:59:51.480]
In the USA.

[02:59:56.360 --> 03:00:00.200]
What's a few thousand innocent lives?

[03:00:00.940 --> 03:00:02.920]
Stop living in the past.

[03:00:03.720 --> 03:00:07.260]
If you want that SUV to drive,

[03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:09.860]
you're gonna need more gas.

[03:00:10.680 --> 03:00:14.260]
It's the greatest country in the world.

[03:00:14.820 --> 03:00:16.380]
They train us too, Louis.

[03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:20.560]
And anyone who says that, obviously,

[03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:27.540]
enter forward to the end.

[03:00:27.540 --> 03:00:30.580]
And of embarrass to be in America,

[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:33.880]
where we take triad of degrees.

[03:00:34.680 --> 03:00:37.780]
We've a flag in wood-hast with our head in the sand,

[03:00:38.200 --> 03:00:41.780]
and lightly follow the powers that we have ascetic.

[03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:43.200]
And I thought, I thought, I thought,

[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:50.560]
I thought, I thought, I thought, I saw there.

[03:00:51.300 --> 03:00:53.860]
Right then.

[03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:13.160]
It sounds like a powerful song.

[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:13.160]

[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:13.180]
sing that kind of thing in wimp song emerge.

[03:01:13.180 --> 03:01:13.180]

[03:01:13.180 --> 03:01:13.180]

[03:01:13.180 --> 03:01:14.440]
And Marlon, that stuff.

[03:01:15.380 --> 03:01:17.800]
Oh, speaking of wrapping up the flag and stuff like that,

[03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:19.600]
for many Iraqis it was the final insult.

[03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:21.460]
Again and again they expressed outrage yesterday

[03:01:21.460 --> 03:01:23.940]
that Iraq's US appointed unelected leaders

[03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:25.760]
at overnight abolished the older Iraqi flag

[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:28.200]
seen by most Iraqis as the symbol of their nation

[03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:29.080]
and chosen a new one.

[03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:32.420]
A new and creative way to piss off the Iraqis.

[03:01:32.460 --> 03:01:33.260]
Aren't we doing a hell of a job?

[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:34.760]
We're liberating it.

[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:37.080]
What gives these people the right to throw away our flag

[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:38.860]
to change the symbol of Iraq as salah,

[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:40.900]
a building contractor of normally moderate public

[03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:42.060]
political opinions.

[03:01:42.420 --> 03:01:44.220]
It makes me very angry because these people

[03:01:44.220 --> 03:01:45.160]
were appointed by the Americans.

[03:01:45.580 --> 03:01:47.320]
I will not regard the new flag as representing me,

[03:01:47.400 --> 03:01:49.100]
but only traders and collaborators.

[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:52.860]
And as it taders and I do like the mashed taters.

[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:55.660]
Anyway, let's see, the poll is tight, man.

[03:01:55.780 --> 03:01:57.140]
Get on a hop on that poll and vote today.

[03:01:57.140 --> 03:01:59.280]
We got a really five-way race.

[03:01:59.480 --> 03:01:59.840]
It's going.

[03:02:00.540 --> 03:02:01.420]
It's going somewhere.

[03:02:01.900 --> 03:02:03.200]
Tomorrow 11.30 in the morning, man.

[03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:05.100]
Get your cheeks all puked up.

[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:07.220]
It's going to be a hell burner.

[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:08.240]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:11.900]
I'm going to show I'm crossing the QAF.

[03:02:12.220 --> 03:02:13.280]
I'm going to be for March 8th.

[03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:14.260]
I'm going to be for March 8th.

[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:15.260]
I'm going to be for March 8th.

[03:02:15.260 --> 03:02:16.320]
Many remeres.
