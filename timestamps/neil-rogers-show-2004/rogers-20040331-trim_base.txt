[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960]
Trudge Tracking?

[00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.640]
Maybe launch a couple missiles

[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.500]
Yes

[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.060]
Tour the place we know

[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.820]
Oh

[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.740]
And aim a Metaphella

[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.220]
Whose first name begins with O

[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.080]
There's one thing we all underestimate

[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.700]
The blue palcator will be finished

[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.320]
Until we blow up Pakistan

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.460]
Okay

[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.320]
We could chase and round forever

[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.940]
With our tanks and all our troops

[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.220]
The special forces are so tired

[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.960]
Of jumping through them clues

[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.880]
We don't need another place

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.920]
Until let's cut out all the nonsense

[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.900]
And we'll blow up Pakistan

[00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.140]
Oh right

[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.240]
Now clear the need and use rear-tank

[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.800]
You'll be sure I don't need stop to see food

[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.680]
And we'll blow up Pakistan

[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.520]
What did he say that he's a tad hootin'

[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.900]
What did he say?

[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.420]
Boom boom

[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.340]
You're free on

[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.020]
Ten oh two man I've been around some nervous knellies

[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.540]
In my time but I have never

[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.640]
Just like the thing we were discussing about

[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.960]
War Time Constiturious

[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.500]
Popeye Genko, look what we got

[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.000]
Uh, look what we got

[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.720]
Man, oh man

[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.480]
Get the staff shrunken there for muffin clearance okay

[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.620]
The trucking staff

[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.640]
Wow, wow, get the old truck and head in there for them

[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.160]
Boy, oh boy, talk about crazy then appear a bedbugs

[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.600]
Anyway

[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.680]
Happy Wednesday to you

[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.000]
It's a real happy day for us

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.200]
Cause we got a Marlin game

[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.400]
And the sun is shining, it's not gonna rain

[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.960]
Hey did you get this pump and a copy yet?

[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.040]
Yes okay

[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.000]
When you just relax you're a little wired too now

[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.180]
Because of all that shenanigans going on this morning

[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.580]
It was fun to watch

[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.900]
You know it is one thing when you

[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.920]
F**k something out that we can't put on the year

[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.820]
Under the current environment that exists

[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.800]
The current chilling climate that exists

[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.040]
But when you f**k that isn't even there

[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.900]
And then you have a couple of boneheads who can

[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.880]
Oh I hear it, it's under there somewhere

[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.060]
And there's nothing there

[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.360]
Then you know at that point they're both over the age

[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.020]
They both need a long cooling out period you know what I'm saying

[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.300]
Wow

[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.460]
So much going on

[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.800]
Carry non by the way is on our website today

[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.820]
She's our behind our

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.720]
Beauty curtain

[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.020]
We'll get to that stuff in a minute

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.740]
First the bad news besides the muffin clearance came in

[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.800]
Don't let them come in again

[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.880]
And aim more right before the show

[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.460]
That's that

[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.220]
No seriously

[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.660]
Uh even in the stewardess Michigan

[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.700]
They wouldn't do that to you before you're supposed to do a radio show

[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.580]
Especially a talk show

[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.720]
They wouldn't do that to you

[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.120]
Just mess with your mind

[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.360]
Everybody

[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.780]
Everybody

[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.020]
Now let's hear that again

[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.820]
Let's hear that again

[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.380]
How about a better bleep

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.840]
That's America searching for a better bleep

[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.780]
That's what we're doing in search of a better bleep

[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.340]
While bleeping people are dying all over the world

[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.820]
For example

[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.320]
Jubilant residents yank the bodies of four foreigners

[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.400]
One a woman at least one an American out of their burning cars today

[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.220]
Dranging the charred corpses through the streets

[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.780]
And hung them from the bridge

[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.920]
Spending the Euphrates River in Fallujah

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.140]
Five American troops died in a roadside bombing nearby

[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.100]
The brutal treatment of the four corpses came after they were killed in a rebel attack

[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.100]
On their SUVs in the Sunni Triangle City

[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.100]
About 35 miles west of Baghdad

[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.800]
It was reminiscent of the 1993 scene in Somalia

[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.200]
When a mob dragged the corpse of a US soldier through the streets of Mogadishu

[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.220]
Eventually leading to the American withdrawal from the African nation of Somalia

[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.800]
And one of the bloodiest days of the US military this year

[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.020]
Five American troops died

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.640]
When their military vehicle ran over a bomb in the suffrage incident 12 miles to the northwest

[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.720]
Champing Fallujah is the graveyard of Americans

[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.920]
Residents cheered after the grizzly assault

[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.160]
On two four-wheel-draft civilian vehicles which left both in flames

[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.560]
Others chanted we sacrifice our blood and souls for Islam

[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.740]
In other words

[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.240]
But a little bit like that

[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.200]
Associated press TV news picture showed one man beating the charred corpse with a metal pole

[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.220]
Others tied a yellow rope to a body

[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.980]
Hooked it to a car and dragged it down from the mainstream town

[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.060]
Two black and embankled corpses were hung from a green iron bridge

[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.280]
Across the Euphrates

[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.160]
Well, that's interesting now. I'd like to know when they bring into candy and flowers for the rest of the troops

[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.360]
The ones where I still alive now that we've reached the 600 mark even

[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.800]
They're gonna agree to us with candy and flowers

[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.600]
Right

[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.420]
Anyway, here's the result yesterday's pool

[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.660]
Do we have to really read all these names?

[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.660]
What a half

[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.120]
Well, we got Marlins on Dec. 1250 today

[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.420]
And the Marlins at the O'Rail's in Fort Lauderdale 105

[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.680]
The Humphreur the Hebrew Hammer follows the baseball game

[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.680]
And we got no rain in sight and it's a beautiful day inside Florida

[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.200]
So that means we have a nice short show today and believe me this is the appropriate day for it

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.180]
What was your all-time favorite Elvis Presley song we asked in our poehliest today on the famous neo-roggies.com where we don't have any phony options by the way

[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.740]
Elvis sucks 310 of you said that 22.7 percent

[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.300]
I thought it'd be a lot higher net. It started at about 38 percent and I went down from there

[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.560]
As the Elvis people came flocking in to vote on our pool. Can I say flocking? No

[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.960]
As the Elvis people came f***ing in. Oh, that makes any of the words then

[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.500]

[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.080]
Say sometimes no bleep is better than yeah, I see yeah, that's what we learned this morning

[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.180]

Hey, those two at the helm. We gotta be all we all ought to be on a beach by about 230 this afternoon permanently

[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.360]
Elvis sucks 310 of you said that 22.7 percent

[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.820]
But your favorite Elvis Presley song we have a long list. I'm only gonna read the ones in double digits

[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.380]
Can't help following a lot of 112 if that's the best Elvis Presley song in heaven help us, you know

[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.180]
Suspicious minds 110

Feel House rock 87 a little less conversation 70 at the sucks in the ghetto 63

Town dog 59 Viva Las Vegas 55 especially when Bob Lincoln sings that I get really worked up all shook up 51

[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.200]
Return to sender 42 Kentucky rain 40

Loose wage use 28 with apologies to Carl Perkins who still did fools Russian 25

[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.020]
One night 21. That should have been much harder than that. That's a great song. That may be the only really good song you ever did

[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.680]
Little sister 19. It's now or never 18 to wonder review 16. I want you. I need you

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.180]
I love you 12 blue Christmas 11 and after that it's single digits for all these other

[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.720]
Marginal songs where my ringer mind your neck was then good to not only have three

[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.820]
But what what is wrong when he's Elvis people even the people that liked him their tastings in there is in your touch man

[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.920]
What can I say that their taste is in your

[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.220]
um

[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.520]
Where my ringer mind your neck is just great. That was actually another pretty good song. Well anyway

[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.560]
There is the Elvis stuff from yesterday

[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.040]
If I could only tell them if we get out I should have had that tape roll in this morning

[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.360]
I'm getting a little slow in my old age in my cottage

[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.120]
If I would have had the tape roll and I'd play that the little meeting we had this morning

[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.460]
We could do a replay from oh now now you couldn't do it justice. Okay. It's couldn't do it justice

[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.580]
I can

[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.960]
Hearing things that don't exist. Oh, but I want a better bleep in there

[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:50.280]
A better bleed to cover up what you quizzling you cypaled in you you silly goose man

Anyway, Terry none she's behind to be the curtain if you're over the age of 62

[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.060]
If you're not collecting social security yet, but you're read on the edge

[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.680]
If you have 14 pieces of ID and if you have permission slips from the attorney general and all of his ass systems

[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.480]
Then you might be able to take a quick peek at the behind to be the curtain picture today. It's Terry none

Sorry, Terry. He was born June 26

1961 and for some reason the IMTB bio here is very very weak

[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.360]
I could look up some other bios this morning, but Eric decided to sleep in so I had a very short the

[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.360]

[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.360]
but uh i think this is god in the york i got to tip my hat to him because very rarely it is like one individual

[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.640]
It goes to show that people can make a difference

[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:07.480]
one guy put his uh put his heads together and come up with such a good idea and really carry it through so well

[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.780]
He's got 130,000 plus signatures already

[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:16.180]
And florida by the way is only about 170 behind texas were catching on i'm not gonna push it today by the end of the week

[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.420]
You're right we'll pass texas like those yahuas are standing still to move in the second place behind california

[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.420]
Which is uh often running

[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.880]
But i'm looking at the a page today and this is really interesting

[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.800]
Something brand new well first first before that

[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:31.460]
I

[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:37.560]
Notice at the bottom of the page on stop at cc.com scott says this project is getting very expensive for me to run

[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.400]
We've set up a paypal account to accept donations

[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.440]
I don't want you to get confused with that and the thing we're gonna raise donations for to buy the newspaper

[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.200]
And you want to say today or wherever

[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.280]
But i would hope that some in fact i know i'm gonna

[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.820]
With some cash if you can donate any amount even five bucks to stop at cc.com and the campaign for free speech

[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.760]

And when you click on that link letter generator it comes up with the thing for you to assign your name and address

[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.580]
And then all you do is press the button underneath that and it ought to you click in which state you live in

And you just click send to my two senators and about a bing there it goes you don't have to do anything else

[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.680]
Which i think is absolutely fabulous nice going scott sensational job

[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.400]
So coast to show you out of a 300 million people there's one out there

[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.360]
It's really doing a hell of a job nice going and he doesn't give a

[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.200]
About that

[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.040]
In fact, he does give a crap about it, which is why i started the whole thing

[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.760]
12 minutes after 10 at 560 wq aim

[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.140]
Let me tell you right now if the macros gets worn out your back is gonna tell you because you wake up feeling in the morning like crap

[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.280]
Like you haven't slept at all

[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.120]
So if you need new macros there all kinds of ways to do it you can head to your bedding or department store

[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.300]
Get ripped off where you can do the smart thing like i've been doing for a long time

[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.980]
Call our good friends a dollar macros one 800 macros

[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.880]
The out of macros backs up everything they see and they're advertising a 140 percent

[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.320]
But the competitor still lie a lot when you see a big macros said making outrageous claims

[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.380]
Be sure to redefine print and you'll discover all of those lies

[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.300]
Here's an example there's a big headline that says half off

[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.180]
But then you discovered that this only applies to limited select abitems you've never buy everything else is full price

[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:27.500]
And they probably double the regular price first and you'll probably never be able to make the third change if you don't like it anyway

[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.700]
But if down a macros derailleur has had no tiny print no disclaimers when you call one 800 macros

[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.520]
You'll see that the prices are so low other stores have to offer half off sales just to compete

[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.960]
Down a macros has a no-risk 30-day competitive change follow-up

[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.380]
On all beds including yours don't forget when you call down a macros at one 800 macros

[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.560]
You're getting your company ranked number one overall customer satisfaction from Kendall to Stuart Palmbeats to Ford Myers

[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.960]
And dollar macros reminds you to read that fine print because they want you to know what you're buying even if you decide to buy from somebody else

[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:03.200]
So what you'd be waiting for do the smart easy convenient thing just make that one easy call the one 800 macros or log under their website

[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.260]
macros.com

[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.020]
dial a macros at one 800

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.760]
MATTR ES the honest way to buy you a great bed

[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.440]
I

[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.160]
HATE this place

[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:28.540]
The medications don't work I've been here for seven years nothing works here. I hate this place

[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:36.180]
Nothing works here. The medications don't work. I've been here for seven years. I hate this place

[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.980]
Nothing works here

[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.560]
Thank you

[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.540]
George Bush

[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.360]
You can learn so that you can

[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.100]
Oh boy, baby. Yes, ma'am now you said you

[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.500]
So deputy just fine. My you be

[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.800]
At sent in your mind George Bush

[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.240]
Your position since they has John Kerry

[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.060]
Is up to your fate it's those questions

[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.200]
Of something national guard that might lead your rep

[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:18.740]
You

[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.660]
Just say you're not

[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.040]
What a funny thing

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.460]
Oh

[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:48.840]
The story

[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.640]
17 at 560 W and Rick faxed and said I love it finally

[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.120]
He's gonna test to find public under wrote just remember that she's been coasted on what to say until a cow's come home

[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.040]
I wouldn't be surprised if she invoked of the fifth one more than one occasion

[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.560]
He says I really hope she does and makes the whole of ministry whole administration to look for themselves into a grave

[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.840]
Says Rick whose relentless and also and he's right

[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.940]
Big Arnie says the year Wayne Heisenga talking about why he kept on set on his head coached at all pins

[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.700]
No, I did not I guess he called the a little dog this morning is what I heard Joe say at the end of a show

[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.960]
You didn't hear it? No

[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.960]
One of the things Wayne mentioned as a matter of fact I'm thinking right now in honor of this. Why do we play?

[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.480]
That's right. We can't what I just wanted to stir up a little psychosis in his theory and both of their minds

[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.240]
Because they're probably listening right now on the edge of each other's seat

[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.600]
Anyway see I heard that I heard the age yeah, but I didn't say anything else

[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.420]
Oh, we can't say age. Oh

[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.740]
Anyway, one of the things you mentioned is that they've wants to say religious man

[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.060]
Oh, yeah, what fact does that have to do with anything should he be fired if he wasn't religious man

[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.380]
And then he says Jesus Christ or speaking of a Christ

[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.340]
Yeah, what's that guy up there the attorney general of the state of Florida Charlie Christ

[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.780]
Here's a riddle for you and I'm not gonna give you the answer

[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.000]
What does Mark Foley that the Republican

[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.900]
Representative from West Palm Beach Mark Foley Charlie Christ and Charles Nelson Riley have in common now

[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.240]
That's the riddle I'm not gonna give you the answer

[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.760]
I didn't say anything

[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.660]
I'm just I'm just crossing that out there for you to think about

[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:41.920]
Throughout today dead because two of them are still alive. I mean, I don't want an answer. Okay. It was a rhetorical question

[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:48.020]
What does Charlie Christ Mark Foley and Paul and have in common? I'll think about it. Okay. Well Paul

[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.400]
End is dead so that couldn't be it anyway five six seven what am I gonna remember out having a pull question?

[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.620]
Yeah, well under a lot of stress and pressure today because before this year we had

[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.880]
Like a little seminar there's a brain trust came in

[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.220]
Like that

[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.920]
Wow that that was special man. I've heard some real crap in my time

[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.840]
So then the thing we can still say crap. I mean a darn good thing gosh darn and we can still say crap

[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.340]
Because that was the biggest pile of manure man

[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:19.800]
Even the cow fields in Iowa they have never seen or smelled manure like we just got laid on us for about 40 minutes

[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.960]
That was really talk about piling on

[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.160]
Here's today's full question

[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.040]
I don't think we ever actually we do this before

[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.140]
No, I never did. No, if you could be anything is living person for one year

[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.540]
Who would it be?

[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.540]
Now George said Rupert Murdoch

[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.080]
So I was thinking about it. I'm not really sure

[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.320]
Since you said for a year because I wouldn't want to be like impermanently, you know, he's old

[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:51.860]
Right, but for a year I could do a lot of yeah, you probably will be a lot of stash away a lot of bank accounts in Switzerland fights

[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.940]
I'm gonna put down Tom Brady

[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.720]
Okay, okay, because although I wouldn't want to get hurt in them football games

[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.960]
But nevertheless he's got his big and strong and of course they're with those looks and everything you do whatever

[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.040]
That you want, you know, I mean guys girls anything

[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:12.120]
I mean just I'm talking about friends of course, we're not talking about that right people to hang out with

[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.540]
So anyway, that's our full question

[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.420]
I think it's pretty interesting if you could be anything is living person for one year who would it be and don't give me this

[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.540]
Oh, I'm happy being who I am yeah, right. Oh please

[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.460]
I always want to do that, you know, I don't give me that crap. Okay, we're not that way. You can weigh in. Hello

[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.540]
Hey, good morning. How do you guys doing pretty good?

[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.420]
I was wondering if I could go speak him. I mean, okay

[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.200]
I just got a I got an idea for a poll. Okay

[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:49.860]
The poll would be basically you know who gave who gave the who's saying all those weapons and mass destruction and

[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.300]
Yeah, that's good. Okay

[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.260]
Oh

[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.640]
Dude, it's gonna be great. Thank God for that ballgame and we love the Marlins. They are the best. They're my favorites

[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.640]
Marlins and the Orioles in four-letter-day alarm. Marlon on deck pregame is a 12 15-amart game title 105

[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.300]
It's gonna be great in the sunshine state in fact. Let's play 10

[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.100]
10 what how come we haven't put the poll up there if you put the poll up now

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:22.280]
There we got to push you what we don't have anything for it yet. We got two names and then he can go away and then Josh can add a mother

[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:27.640]
That's my point see all right. We don't need to hold much of names because obviously he's got a little bit catching up to do up there in Orlando

[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.380]
He's got to start making a bacon for all them sandwiches. He's gonna be eating

[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.820]
So let's get with it Eric. Okay, let's hop on it baby. We got Terry none

[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.220]
And her brother Sam none they're on there naked

[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:48.580]
WQA and hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing pretty good? Hey, you know, uh, so I guess we're gonna get this right to testify, huh

[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.960]
This bush is a flip-flop artist

[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.960]
He says one thing and he does something else flip-flopper. Yeah, okay WQA. I'm hello

[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.200]
They're all doing stick to this way

[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.560]
Yeah, we're trying to save the world again WQA. I'm hello. What we haven't heard from that idiot in a long time. I'm

[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.620]
Yes, sir

[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:20.320]
Don't worry about nails thing. No, we're not there. Didn't ask a question. Okay, she's just Kate Christ man

[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.320]
Wow, if you could be any famous living person for one year who would it be? I think that's a fine question

[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.960]
And of course then when bush comes on yesterday and does that real quick with no questions asked in the oil how come you wait

[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.700]
It's so long and he's running away from the press. Uh, who's he kiddin man only the dumbest of the dumb

[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.920]
To a lot of what he really should have said was the political pressure got heated up so bad

[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.520]
We had to drag her out and put the bitch on here. We just hope she don't make a fool out of herself

[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.220]
And yeah, the audience said that's the name of that tune

[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.340]
I thought of course you were gonna say that but that's basically what he said

[00:20:53.200 --> 00:21:00.300]
WQA and hello, good morning. Yeah, I'm pretty good. Oh my god. That stuff in the luge are really boiled my blood

[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:06.420]
Yeah, I understand you know that what I'm about to say isn't gonna go over well and I understand you know

[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.140]
What you're about to say in other words, this is a preface to what you're about to say sort of

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.400]
Yeah, if I can

[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.000]
Do you feel allow me yeah, I just basically you know feel it

[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.320]
I mean, I understand the angle about uh

[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:28.040]
That we that we went to Iraq on false pretenses and the whole thing with Bush and I don't support him at all

[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.920]
But the fuck these hypocritical

[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.080]
Iraqis are gonna you know cheer that said I don't think it's gone

[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.480]
But then you know they don't like us being there and they're attacking people that are really trying to help

[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:48.500]
You know, I mean they're trying to help rebuild the help rebuild by closing down newspapers that they don't like the opinion of for example

[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.500]
And by taking cutting off their just taking away their jobs and

[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.600]
By turning by turning their cities into like a blood bath into a nightmare

[00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.720]
Well, I mean

[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.520]
You're right now you're buying this whole baloney that we went there to liberate your acutely

[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.960]
I would get some help I get some mental help immediately before the day's outbreak

[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.140]
We didn't get you three for one deal with Duffin clearance. Okay. We didn't get you held a deal package deal

[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.380]
They got package deals that every shrink and fail now because times are tough

[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:23.100]
We didn't go there to liberate anybody. Okay. The Neal cons designed this whole and then that's what's coming out now

[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.740]
With all this a kind of Lisa businessman

[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.860]
With Richard Clark and with Paul O'Neill and all of these people

[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.300]
This is nothing new

[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:36.340]
This is no like Paul Kerman said in the article right yesterday. There's no debate about this

[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:42.180]
They had the roadmap for all of this crap drawn out there five years ago two years before 911

[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.820]
They were just waiting for any excuse and that's why right after 911

[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.840]
Well, I would did a racquet of anything to do with this. I want you to go and find me some of the connection with Iraq

[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.220]
Yeah, I mean what kind of garbage is that?

[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:01.180]
And those people everybody there the Iraqis themselves and the 600 Americans and the Brits and the Australians

[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.480]
Everybody else who's died there

[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.080]
They'd still be alive today for word for this insanity not to mention of course how we've left on our guard on the war on tear

[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.860]
Because we've ever done all these resources and troops there into this bogus war in Iraq and you're buying into it

[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.080]
And how they should be grateful to us well, although first of all our crazy religious nuts, all right

[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.340]
We're not gonna straighten out. We're not gonna democratize the Middle East

[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.760]
That's a that's a pipe dream. It's a lunacy and if we want to democratize the Middle East

[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.200]
Why don't we start and sell those great democracies like Saudi Arabian Pakistan, huh? That would be good

[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.620]
Yeah, democratize the Middle East by fat ass lunatics insane crazy people

[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.680]
And this last guy talked to his another one

[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.220]

[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.180]
Yeah, right. He'd be real sympathetic. It's how he had to were patrolling the streets kicking his door down

[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.940]
That's right. That would be great and closing down the hero

[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.860]
Which probably be a better idea than whatever newspaper they shut down in Iraq. He'd greet them with candy

[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.600]
And flowers well, they had a shutdown that paper because it was a head to do something with Shiite. Yeah

First of all, I got to give you a name for the poll and then I'll say about Wayne calling it yeah

[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.840]
The number one thing on your poll is gonna be breaking spears you want to know why?

[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.880]

I see okay moving right along don't say spoiler to her in the movie right now

[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:37.240]
All right, listen Wayne called up on your buddy moe show and was yelling at him and Geldy for misquoting really

[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.800]
Yeah, I didn't hear

[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.160]
Oh, how come I didn't hear Joe?

[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.980]
I heard him say was that Wayne called the station. I didn't hear was on the moe show

[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.680]
Wayne called moe at like 745 and I guess he said he was in the car. He was unhappy with

[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:55.100]
The miss quoting by Geldy and Moe and said he wanted to send some things straight and miss calling about what well

[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.800]
By the way, by the way, Wayne hates you a moe. I should point that out. I've mentioned that before but just in case you forgot

[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.520]
Yeah, well he was I guess before the before

[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.620]
Wayne called in Galby and Moe were talking about how he had talked about

[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.460]
He's a feeling of the next name arena and he just basically just some quotes and

[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.840]
He wanted to say that that was incorrect. So basically he even calling as a friend. He called them to you know yellow

[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.900]
Well, what do you mean he said that was incorrect? I heard them play that the yesterday. He did say that

[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.180]
He said well, he didn't say he would be said he might be for the next day in marina or something like that

[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.920]
Right, he said it was a quote that Wayne claimed he said was that he wanted a

[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.860]
Feelie to be the next day in marina whereas Moe and Geldy were saying you know, oh, you know

[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:39.260]
Wayne's playing he's gonna be the next in marina and so I said I never said he was gonna be the next day in marina

[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.520]
Would oh, he's told others we had a big contrast between

[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.700]
Wayne high zingga and the jelly and moe

[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.720]
That's what happened. It was about I can say is excellent. That's the best news I've heard audio you made my day, pal

[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.760]
All right, buddy. Well put Britney on the pole. Okay. She's on air. She's on the pool position

[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.080]
Uh, isn't that great? That is great

[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.260]
Boy sure took us a half an hour before we finally got the interpretation of that

[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.400]
Of course you have to be one of Moe's listeners. How many's he got?

[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.360]
They've heard that we don't have like a big crossover between us and the moment

[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.420]
McGill Cabrera

[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.380]
McGill Cabrera the model is player. Oh, okay. McGill Cabrera I never heard of it in my life

[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:26.000]
I couldn't name it three marlins players if you stuck our gun to my nose. I couldn't name you one. Oh, I can let's see

[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.740]
Brad Penny he's gone in the team

[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:28.580]
Yeah

[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.000]
But the only effort about I don't I don't follow the baseball anymore. I gave up baseball the last time they said oh

[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.240]
I couldn't pay to the point of you just like hockey this year when they do the same thing next September

[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.340]
I'm gonna say oh well, uh, you know, although I won't give that up entirely, but if they ever play again

[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.400]
In fact, I got permission from and I want the audience to know that clearance

[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.880]
It wants to apologize profusely for that scam that we ran yesterday that we were forced to read the a course

[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.820]
That encouraged to read the promos for that auction, which it turns out it wasn't for sure to eat all

[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.400]
It was for the beeslees for a little what was the term used a new revenue stream

[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.840]
Yeah, I'm screaming all over myself just thinking about it. Okay a new revenue stream

[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.520]
That is the chinsiest that I mean seriously, you know you joke about the thing that maybe you're not joking about the

[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.180]
Deliverance and the banjo boy and all of that stuff

[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.860]
I don't think that's an exaggeration and of course we've all met Bob Vermouth have only

[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.580]
Speaks for itself

[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.840]
But I mean these people man

[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.700]
If you if you're out there in nice day like today and you're wondering around you see some folks up in a tree

[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.420]
You know, that's their tree house man the beeslees. That's not a possum

[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:37.840]
Boy, it is so scary a new revenue stream for the beeslees while good and tell people about tell say commercial enterprise and that they're

[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.240]
They're fleecing the public depending on a bunch of sports member obelio, okay

[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.220]
God

[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.520]
sends me a promo here like it's something for charity like something for a good cause

[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.400]
Oh, well, we never really thought about that. Yeah, sure

[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.320]
No, they were too busy of thinking about

[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:57.800]
Sticking bleeps where there aren't any words. Yeah, how do we describe that to the audience? How do we describe that?

[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.280]
I think what you ought to do it. I think what you ought to know listen

[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.240]
Let's give them a demonstration right now. You've got that is it in your DCS yet

[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.640]
That we got that the big word block. I got a cute up. Okay, let's play it

[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:15.560]
After the break all right, I'm gonna play that bit and then I'm gonna demonstrate to you the how all of this

Anyhow you doing pretty good. Uh, I wouldn't want to sit on the chair afterwards

But so before the last break you said uh, he said Josh Beckett you know what rhymes with Beckett and for like all anyway now listen

[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.420]
We're gonna play that bit and I never got around a plan but we've got it. Oh, what a word block here

[00:40:54.420 --> 00:41:00.440]
It is. It is everywhere the federal community begins commission is on a mission from God to protect your children

[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.880]
And perhaps yourself from the simple danger of dirty words

[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.900]
What you may not know is the FCC regulates your private telephone calls as well

[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.840]
That's why faith-based ministries corporation is proud to introduce word block

[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:20.880]
Simply attach the CCTV use device to your phone and the words of sitting will be blocked out instantly

[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:22.700]
Hello

[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.360]
Hello

[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.380]
You

[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:42.380]

[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.560]
Okay, now here's the deal every week

[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:01.760]
Polka Brian records is like four or five comedy bits and he asked to bring them into the station so that mufflinzy can

[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.340]
To find something productive to be doing and listen to them first to make sure that they're okay

[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.620]
They've got his squeal of approval to be on here

[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.480]
Right

[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:15.480]
So he brings these in yesterday which every two day I guess today that he generally shows up with a visc and

[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.780]
Muff sits down and listen to this and then he and clearance gets their heads together

[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.700]
That's the same clearance who gave me that memo yesterday and lied to me

[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.520]
And give me that pull crap about that phony auction about that new uh

[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.440]
Revenue stream, but anyway

[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:33.520]
And so they listen to these bits and so they get to this one and oh a little red light goes off in their head

[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:35.740]
Right

[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.820]
And duck goes through a whole

[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:46.080]
Herniotic son advance about he wishes that Volka would redo it so that the second bleep is as good as the first one

[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.120]
The only problem with that being is that Volka didn't verbalize any of the words that he bleaked out

[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.840]
In other words, he just put the bleep in there

[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.600]
There's no word actually there in a recording

[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.540]
But he wants to first bleep and a second bleep to be the same

[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.200]
Oh my god, we're talking about

[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.480]
A little crazy certifyably crazy people get the straight jackets

[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.040]
Get the honey junior straight jacket

[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.240]
Wow, I'll get the a not so straight jacket. Yeah for both of them

[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:18.600]
Man, that has got to be one of the most astonishing things and and we spent about I would say out of the 40 minutes

[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.840]
That we wasted in my life this morning with them the two of them in that seminar

[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.640]
About 20 minutes of it on at the bit

[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:29.360]
Playing it over and over. Oh, yeah, but I hear it. I hear it

[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.180]
They hear it because it's in their mind that they hear it a word that isn't there in their mind

[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.120]
That's what happens with you out of filthy dirty mind, okay

[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.440]
Emotional elder bush attacks sons critics

[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.040]
Top an emotional former president George Herbert Walker Bush yesterday

[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.320]
Defended his sons Iraq war and lashed out at White House critics

[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.580]
It is deeply offensive and contentable to hear elites and intellectuals on the campaign trail

[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:59.700]
This missed programs in Iraq since last year's overthrow of Iraqi leader son who's saying the elder boy said in a speech too

[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:07.420]
Hold on now, all right hold in a speech to the national pectoral chemical and refiners associations national convention and send it to the

[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.480]
Hotel Texas. Oh

So thanks for those little gas prices bush family

[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.120]
There was something ignorant in the way that dismissed the overthrow of a brutal dictator in the sewing proceeds of

[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.320]
basic human freedom in the that trouble part in the world he said the former president appeared to fight back tears

[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.800]
As he complained about media coverage of the younger boy that he called something short a fair and balanced

[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.220]
It hurts an awful lot more when it's your son who's been criticized than when they used to get all over my case

[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.540]
said Bush was often complained about media coverage of both boy presidency

[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:39.580]

See a lot of you people out there your intentions are good, but you're preaching the requirement just to keep repeating the same stuff over

[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:57.500]
We all know about fox okay anybody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail most about fox

[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.080]
Just out of protested I run Jeremy crap. Well, what is that

[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.780]
We'll be putting on their alcohol steam

[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.780]
It's just a joke. I'm so sorry

[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.460]
I mentioned that because if I mentioned name Josh just like Eric often does was it he'll put it on there

[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.660]
Don't put alcohol steam on there

[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:02.480]
By the way, did you talk to alcohol scene about getting in touch with his buddy Larry Flint and getting a hustle magazine to promote stuff at CC.com? No

[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.860]
I haven't spoken to him in that years ever since well

[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.080]
I'm sure he'd appreciate hearing from just about anybody at this point

[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.880]
Oh look at that we got the signatures back on there and now we're 199 behind Texas again

[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:19.060]
We're not making any progress Texas is doing it man. They're they're smoking

[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:25.760]
The last five signatures from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and California out of 130,000

[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.720]
720 on stop at CC.com

[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.740]
But we you know we squeeze this rock is as hard as we can as far as our audience

[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:37.560]
And they've done a pretty damn good job for me for me to say but they responded pretty to damn dark Josh darn well

[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:44.060]
Nobody cue him. Hello. I've got the definitive winner. No manual. I just not want to be Johnny deaf

[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.660]
Johnny deaf sounds good to me. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you

[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:53.060]
No man alive. He said does not want to be Johnny deaf. You wouldn't mind being Johnny deaf for a year

[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.920]
No, no problem at all. I would not mind it all being Johnny deaf for you

[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.240]
I bet even Josh wouldn't mind being Johnny deaf for a year wouldn't mind

[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.840]
He would much rather be Miguel Cabrera I guess

[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.520]
That would be Hugh Heft but

[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:11.440]
Now I don't understand why would you want to be you after he's an old man? I'm not talking about his looks

[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.720]
I'm talking about his lifestyle

[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:18.620]
But you're not you're missing the points you there are lots of young guys wouldn't you rather be a young guy who's I mean who

[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:24.620]
Have to be probably pop and Viagre like like pears like Mickey says but again. We're not going on like his looks

[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.180]
I just want to live the lifestyle if you have for a year

[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.400]
What's all the bunnies?

[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:37.480]
At the mansion. I think this was a bad question today. Oh, that's a good question

[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.960]
I don't think they get it

[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:44.260]
I'm not talking about you see I'm not talking about what Hugh Heft there was like 20 years ago

[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:50.620]
I'm talking about what he is now. He's a dottering old man who's surrounded by all these hot chicks and he can't do anything about it probably

[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.900]
Well, he's doing some of that

[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.280]
How do you know that? How do you know that?

[00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.220]
He's outside the window my he's outside the window peaking him

[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:09.240]
1057 at five 60 and listen okay fine no matter what you say I you know why wouldn't you rather be Tom Brady? This is an example

[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:16.660]
Tom Brady can have just about anybody he wants anybody male female

[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:23.320]
You name it take a take those you have your bunnies away from it right. That's right in a heartbeat

[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.280]
Just think about it. Okay. Just give it some consideration

[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.080]
All right because when we wave our magic wand

[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.720]

B全

[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:48.240]
I just think about me living in a...

[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:48.700]
Welcome!

[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.820]
I'm under age

[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.860]
I still don't see you

[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.780]
You should understand me

[00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:01.200]
Cause you could go to jail if you've been with me

[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.400]
Oh my God

[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.700]
My sweet, you and your friends and me

[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.320]
She was 25 or 6 just a few

[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:16.460]
You're rich, I've been my last sweet

[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.300]
Yeah, I call the cops as my child

[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.880]
I got the perfect to leave

[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.520]
Because I'm happy to be

[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.440]
Now my wife takes my name

[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.340]
I'm about to take my hand

[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.000]
Welcome!

[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.640]
Of my soul

[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.960]
She's under age

[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.500]
She'll face me

[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.380]
You should be better than me

[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:49.240]
I'm not rolling, I'm stepping in the dynamite

[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:53.200]
For the size she's looking right

[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.240]
I'm seeing this party

[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.220]
But she's just...

[00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.300]
Well, it's still planned

[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.100]
It passed the mustard

[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:03.420]
Let's see, LeBron James for the poll

[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.700]
Somebody says there's a good choice

[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.240]
Let's see, making about 80 million a year

[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:06.780]
Something like that?

[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:07.800]
400 million

[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.600]
Okay

[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.260]
Wait, and also Big Arnie, who's this out of control says

[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.160]
I would be Donald Trump

[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.040]
That's a good choice

[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.340]
Sure

[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.460]
Rich Promet living in New York plus I would finally have hair

[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.420]
Even though don't look too good

[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.260]
Good choice Arnie

[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.240]
Now anyway, this fact is through shocking

[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.140]
Clear Channel Radio and the Reverend Jesse Jackson announced today

[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.960]
that the Reverend Jackson will be host of five

[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.080]
What is it over a live one hour talk show airing Sunday 7 a.m. Central time

[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.440]
8 to 9 a.m. Eastern time

[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:35.720]
Keep hope alive

[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:41.240]
With Reverend Jesse Jackson will debut April 4th exclusively on Clear Channel Radio stations

[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:45.240]
And whatever it's changed from Chicago is WGCI AM, whatever that is

[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.880]
The broadcast will focus on issues of cultural, political and religious significance

[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.180]
But guess the appearances by community and world leaders and a live call and segment

[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.880]
But you must talk in jive and rhyme

[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.580]
You do understand that when you call in?

[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.000]
Absolute in jive

[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.940]
It'll be just fine if you call it on the line

[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.060]
But anyway

[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.200]
The show marks the first time Reverend Jackson will be hosting a radio program

[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.600]
I guarantee it's going to go over like Halifide Siberia

[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:09.960]
We will discuss the central issues local national and international of our time

[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.700]
We will offer information inspiration direction main points of view

[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.800]
We will talk with and hear from you

[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.620]
We intend to connect the nation with shared conversation

[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:19.600]
Your voice matters

[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.420]
Remember in the beginning was the world the world and you have the power

[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.320]
Keep hope alive

[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.060]
And don't talk no jive

[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.400]
Initially airing in New York San Francisco, Chicago Philadelphia

[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.720]
Detroit and North of Virginia

[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.780]
Keep hope alive with Reverend Jackson will be introduced to additional markets throughout the year

[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.600]
Third channel radio will consider syndicating the program nationally

[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.860]
Depending on listen and response

[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.940]
How do you like that?

[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.820]
Jesse Jackson's go a nationwide with his love child

[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.780]
Man

[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.160]
Really sad

[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.860]
And they were America's shirts today with the goddess

[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.780]
And Al Franken

[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.880]
And Jeanne Garafalo and all of these people

[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.520]
You guys to defend Muslim girl wearing scarf in school

[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:05.580]
The Justice Department announced to the government civil rights lawyers have jumped into a legal case to support a Muslim girls

[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:07.380]
Right to wear a head scarf in public school

[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.500]
Assisted attorney general for civil rights, I don't know we had civil rights anymore

[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.800]
I thought that was gone now

[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:14.900]
Yeah

[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.980]
Anyway the assistant attorney general for these things, Alex Acosta said the government lawyers would support 11-year-old

[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:25.800]
Nashala Hurrin, a six-rate student who was suiting Muscogee Oklahoma Public School District

[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.140]
For ordering her to enroll her head scarf or hijab, hijab?

[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.900]
Because it violated the dress code of the Benjamin Franklin Science Academy which you attended

[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:39.740]
The girl continued to wear her hijab, the school was subsequently suspended twice for doing so

[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:43.980]
The family appealed the suspensions which were upheld by a district administrative hearing committee

[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:47.320]
Her parents filed suit against the Muscogee School District last October

[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:53.860]
On Tuesday the federal government filed a motion in the federal court in Muscogee to intervene in support of Nashala's position

[00:55:53.860 --> 00:56:01.100]
No student should be forced to choose between following her faith and enjoying the benefits of a public education across the state and the state of the company government's court filing

[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.540]
I say leave it home, leave your faith at home, leave your schmuck visit home

[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:05.300]
That's my suggestion

[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.300]
Probably you'll burn a hell if you think of it

[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.440]
Good, that makes it even better

[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:15.860]
Now what was this thing that somebody who has faxed me here, trialed against in debts of sons hit with stones?

[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.120]
Oh yeah, that's right

[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:17.900]
Oh yeah, depressing

[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:25.720]
Time or Texas, oh that's a really a great place and that's a bastion of Americanism, the likes of which even W would be reversed by

[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:32.200]
Even QA would be reversed by, we thought after yesterday that we had no embarrassment factor on this radio station but I guess maybe we do

[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.200]
That thing would have auctioned yesterday's seriously, I'm never going to recover from that as long as I live

[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:42.960]
And you should have parents lining and whimpering, were you in there when he was going, oh gee well I didn't mean I apologize

[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:45.700]
I didn't mean to try to fool you and I just, they were right

[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:53.020]
You are so full of it man, you're in the crappy just seeping from your earlobe, okay, clearance, that's how full of it you are

[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.100]
And your boyfriend, your boyfriend, they're a man

[00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:00.660]
With that bit that we played, that word block, they're then both of them, you know, it's to both they're hearing it

[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:02.140]
Okay

[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.520]
As Marv Alper would say, they're hearing it from the crowd

[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.940]
That's funny when you get a shared delusion

[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:13.080]
Yeah, well I'm when you're sitting that close, usually only I can see the pink rabbit

[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:16.220]
When parents are sitting on the must lap, you know, it's easy to hear things

[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:22.200]
Tyler Texas, a mother who bashed your son's heads with heavy rocks, killing two of the boys, but so delusional

[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:26.680]
She thought the Lord told her to do it or attorney said, they're opening statements at her murder trial

[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.800]
This is so typical of religious crazy people I apologize for the redundancy

[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.160]
Does she follow what she believes to be God's will, unless she turned her back on her God defense attorney

[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.240]
Buck files junior asterigery of eight men and four women

[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:47.020]
How's it going? Buck, the NL-39, stay at home mother, has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity

[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:50.240]
To charge his a murdering eight-year-old Joshua and six-year-old Luke

[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:56.560]
Oh, look at those names, huh? Joshua and Luke and causing serious injury to Aaron 14 months at the time

[00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:01.000]
Aaron? Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty, and of course they're why not

[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.820]
I'd fry her ass right now, right on the crossfire this afternoon

[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:08.060]
I put her in Bob Novak's lap and fried up both of them

[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:13.700]
The deeply religious East Texas woman who was who homeschooled her children in New Chapel Hill

[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:18.700]
Weft as she listened to testimony and prosecutors showed gruesome photographs of her slain children

[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:24.920]
Her husband who had supported her sat a few rows behind with friends and family, her husband who supported her

[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.600]
Prosecutors contend Lany new right from wrong when she co-ed her children last May

[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:34.900]
Despite opinions from Fusseky, a psychiatric experts for the offense, two for the prosecution and one for the judge

[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.400]
All of whom said Lany was legally insane

[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:45.060]
District Attorney Matt Bingham said Lany attacked the baby first, hammering his head with a four-and-a-half-pound rock she had hidden under the ice crib

[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:50.480]
Aaron Lany will never be the same said, Bing, adding that the voice vision has been impaired, he'll never live independently

[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:55.700]
Lany then woke up Luke, let him outside the family's room, Brick home, and asked him to put his head on a large rock

[00:58:55.700 --> 00:59:02.220]
The prosecutor said Lany smashed the 60-year-old skull with a large landscaping rock then she went to get her older's child Joshua

[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:08.640]
He too put his head against the large rock in the yard his mother fasted his skull with a 16-pound rock the boys were found in their underwear

[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.220]
Oh my God

[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.560]
Feel God

[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.000]
It's a positive influence to the Bible

[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.980]
Right, the Bible really does a man, more connoisseur and all of these people

[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:27.240]
And Yoschki, 5.6705.60.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Line

[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:31.680]
If you could be any famous living person for one year who would it be?

[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.100]
WQA and hello

[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.140]
Bush and backup

[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.560]
WQA and hello

[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:40.180]
Hello

[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:41.160]
Yes sir

[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.400]
Who is it George?

[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.340]
Who is it George?

[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.200]
No, Neil

[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.600]
Neil, how are you doing?

[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.920]
Neil, I want to show you Neil

[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.480]
Remember back in 98, going westbound, 5.95

[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.960]
A big ass DOT truck pulled over and held the traffic up and a guy called me

[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.180]
No, I don't, no I don't

[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.660]
5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon Line

[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.420]
WQ and hello

[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.620]
Yes, Neil

[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:06.260]
Yes sir

[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.300]
I got one for the poll, Neil

[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.900]
Pat Robertson, I want to be able to talk to God too

[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.080]
Okay, Pat Robertson, there you go

[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.520]
Let's get him on there and at least we'll fill out the list with some names on there

[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.900]
Okay, they don't understand this is a very serious, scientific thing

[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.880]
They don't get it

[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.320]
They're playing fast and loose with our poll

[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.980]
Oh, what are f***

[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.080]
WQA and hello

[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.780]
Hello, Neil, I'd like to ask your poll, please

[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.520]
Yes sir

[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.840]
Joey, what a foo

[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.500]
Joey, what a foo

[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:33.560]
Joey, what a foo

[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.460]
Okay, this guy would like to be a raving lunatic

[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.680]
I would have picked W if I wanted that

[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.700]
Hugh Heffner has got 77, he's an author, right, a man

[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.620]
I guess you're right Josh, they all want to be Hugh Heffner

[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.740]
They don't get it, they all understand these old and feeble

[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:52.920]
Bill Gates, 27, see that's called, see us old far, it's always accused me of living in the past

[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:57.720]
I think a lot of you young rupps are living in these other people's past

[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.860]
We're not talking about how do you like to be Hugh Heffner 40 years ago, see

[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.900]
But Hugh Heffner is 77 and then we can bring them some Fel Dean

[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.200]
I thought about Hugh and ruled him out for that reason

[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.120]
Bill Gates, 27, Tiger Woods, 23, I think that's a pretty good choice

[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.620]
Tom Brady, 12, which I think is a fabulous choice

[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.720]
See a lot of the guys out there won't vote for Tom Brady because they feel like it's like a f*** thing, see

[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.400]
Because he's too pretty

[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.020]
And they don't want to stand, even though we're not tracing their votes yet

[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:32.460]
Ryan Jeremy's got 8, which I find just astonishing, shocking Britney Spears 8, Rupert Murdock 5

[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:38.680]
Johnny Depe 5, Miguel Cabrera's got 3, George W's got 3, Peter North 3

[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:46.320]
Ricky Martin 2, Michael Douglas 2, LeBron James's got 1, and Joey Butterfucko just went on their 193 votes

[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.700]
What would make this a thing work, whether you want it or not?

[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.440]
You know what I mean?

[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:50.760]
It'll work

[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.620]
It'll work?

[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.300]
It'll work

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.600]
It'll work for me, you want to know why it works for me?

[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.140]
Based on them

[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.800]
That's right, because we got the Marlon game

[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.720]
Miguel Cabrera, Josh Beckett, Brad Penny and your Florida Marlon

[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.700]
The Rupert of the rest of Mike B, I don't know

[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.980]
I just don't care, Mike Lowell

[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.640]
There you go, there's another one

[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.700]
Well there's only 25 guys on the team, I got 4 already

[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.440]
Let me think real hard

[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.400]
And of course Jack McKeehan is your manager of your Florida Marlon

[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.680]
He just turned 95

[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.160]
I mean he just turned on I-95, made a wrong, make a U turn, real quick Jack, you're on the wrong side of the road

[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.720]
That's something about Wayne Heizinger calling in Moe and Gildy this morning, that's something

[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:33.960]
That's funny

[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:42.080]
Because, especially, see what you're forgetting, maybe you're not, is that he's talking to the play-by-play voice of his Miami-Dophons

[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.980]
Whom he hates like poison, anyways, from all the reports I'm getting

[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:51.520]
So Moe probably is like, oh is he, but I mean, but I would love to know

[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.740]
Oh man, would I give anything to hear a tape of that conversation, wouldn't you?

[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:57.540]
I don't want to say we're going to put our spies on that, on the case

[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.560]
But man, would that be something a delight?

[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.540]
To hear that verbal intercourse between Wayne Heizinger, which we can't call him what I used to anymore

[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:12.000]
Because that would be really f***ing bad, and Moe and Gildy

[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.520]
So personally I think Moe is a lot worse than what I used to call Wayne, but nevertheless

[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.440]
A lot more obscene

[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.400]
11-13 at 5-60 WQM, fat is obscene if you're trying to lose it

[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.140]
If you're trying any of those low-carb diets, head forward to Lysow West Booker

[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:30.500]
Because when you're starting or restarting the adkins, the sugarbusters, South Beach or any low-carb sugar-free diet

[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:34.960]
The Lysow West Booker is like a miracle for you because the entire store is dedicated to you

[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.760]
It's the world's number one low-carb store with over 1200 low-carb products to choose from

[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.780]
Some varieties, some taste, thank the Lord

[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.320]
And they've got just whatever you're looking for, they've got breads and bagels, cookies, crackers, chips and brownies

[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.920]
Chocolate, carbolite, ice cream, pasta, sauces, ketchup, cheese, dates and lots more

[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.180]
And don't forget if it's new and great tasting, the Lysow will have it first through open every day, seven days a week

[01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:00.100]
From 10 a.m. till 10 p.m. you can always try anything in the store before you buy it

[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:04.100]
And there's staff noise-dieting inside and out, in fact there's some fat people around that joint too

[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:09.640]
And the adkins brands products are on sale all day every day, too, even on some Hustora

[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.140]
The Lysow West Booker, they're on the northeast corner of Glades in 441 right next to Boston Market

[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:21.080]
Or column tool free, 1-877 Low Carb that's L-O-W-C-A-R-B, or on the web it's lowcarb.com

[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.140]
There's only one Lysow has similar names but there's really only 1 D-Lights of West Booker

[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.200]
It's your official adkins retail center

[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:35.660]
The Lysow West Booker, they're on the west corner of Glades in 441 right next to Boston Market

[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:40.140]
Or column tool free, 1-877 Low Carb that's Lysow's Booker

[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:48.380]
And there's staff noise-dieting inside and out, in fact there's a lot more than one Lysow has

[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:57.100]
And there's staff noise-dieting inside and out, in fact there's a lot more than one Lysow has

[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:11.940]
And there's a lot more than one Lysow has similar names but there's a lot more than one Lysow has

[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.560]
And there's a lot more than one Lysow has similar names but there's a lot more than one Lysow has

[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:21.360]
And there's a lot more than one Lysow has

[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:27.080]
And there's a lot more than one Lysow has similar names but there's a lot more than one Lysow has

[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.840]
I don't have a lot of guys that said they want to be Hugh Heppner but nobody has said Larry Clinton yet

[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.480]
That was his tastelessness against you

[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:46.200]
Now this box here, this is exactly what I had in mind, here's somebody understands what I'm driving at

[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.880]
OK, Brad the Pitmeister, Brad Pitt, so I could be doing Jennifer's as this boxer, see

[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.380]
Right, that's where it's at

[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.720]
Oh, did I say so I could be doing so I could be

[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.080]
in other than M.A.C.

[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:56.500]
or seconds.

[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.240]
So that's one of those where if you put the bleep in,

[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.540]
see if I say doing Jennifer, that's okay,

[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.100]
but if I say,

[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.200]
in Jennifer, that could be some of the things.

[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.200]
No problem.

[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.800]
No, but I'm just saying that'll teach them to be,

[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.660]
so for Sticky would all their bleeps, you know,

[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.660]
will all their bleep being a bullcrap,

[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:13.900]
malconclerance.

[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.000]
If I were them, I'd be held a lot more worried about that

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.200]
phony auction deal that the beesleens are running.

[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.740]
I'd be a lot more worried about that.

[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.440]
And I'd also be a lot more worried about some of their

[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.040]
other shows because this isn't the show that's going to create

[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:25.620]
them a problem.

[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.280]
Did it create them a problem this last time?

[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:27.700]
No.

[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.240]
Is it going to create them?

[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:29.620]
No.

[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:29.680]

[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.440]
I mean, we're like, I've reached 99 and 44% pure.

[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.220]
And the other part we like, when in doubt we bleep it out.

[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.320]
But I mean, but I think because it makes them feel useful,

[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.320]
you know, like they're doing something.

[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.400]
Believe you me, if I had some real questions about what we

[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.160]
could say and what we can play and what they knew deal,

[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.300]
these, those would be two of the last people I would ever

[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:49.980]
ask them to.

[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.300]
Nervous Nellies.

[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.420]
Pean on each other's pants.

[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.860]
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.560]
See, the Hugh Hepneth thing, I'm trying to think of, I mean,

[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.540]
like Donald Trump would be good, these Donalds,

[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.940]
uh, under the age of 100, right?

[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:02.480]
Right.

[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.580]
Hugh Hepneth, he would be a good one if he owed it as he used to be.

[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:05.740]
Who isn't?

[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.080]
Hugh.

[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:06.800]
Right.

[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:08.500]
Exactly.

[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:11.620]
But nevertheless, he's off to the races because they've got this

[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.560]
image worked up in their minds, it's like your friend Josh

[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:13.980]
sitting there.

[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.860]
Oh yeah, the Hugh Hepneth, they're my steward.

[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.280]
But my big Stogie and my Matthew, but all these playboy,

[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.160]
but he's around right.

[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.700]
And your Viagra, the candy bowl.

[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:20.980]
Right.

[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.280]
Yeah, I think the word you're looking for is frustrated is what, uh,

[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.880]
Hugh, but who knows, I could be wrong.

[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:26.980]
He could be one hell of a stud.

[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.440]
He might be tired of it by now.

[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:28.800]
Who knows?

[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:29.920]
No.

[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.220]
Oh, I'm looking at this, we got to bleep this one out.

[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.920]
Oh, I understand, Alex Rodriguez, now that is a good choice.

[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.380]
There is a good choice.

[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.540]
I have to admit as much as I despise him like poison,

[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.420]
he's a good looking guy, he's making 25 million year,

[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.120]
and he's playing with the Yankees, he'll probably win the world

[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.220]
series and all of these things and these, there was a good buddy,

[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.680]
Derek Jeter, and they're like, uh, eaten and greeting and meeting.

[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:51.740]
And the other girls.

[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.220]
So Alex Rodriguez is a ninja, certainly a lot better choice than Miguel Cabrera.

[01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:00.180]
And you're Florida, Marlon, so we love on a show because game time is

[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.920]
105 pre-game at 1250.

[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:02.580]
Yeah.

[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.800]
I'm thinking you know how the Cubs and really feel they play mostly day games

[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.000]
too.

[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.860]
I'm thinking that the Marlon should play, even though it's a hundred degrees

[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:13.560]
in the shade, all through the summer day games every day.

[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:14.120]
Double headers.

[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.020]
Quite well early.

[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.060]
You're in the morning, it's not so hot.

[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:16.660]
Right.

[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.840]
Starting at about 1015 would be good, but a pre-game show at 955.

[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:20.560]
Hahaha.

[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:21.940]
Ah, yeah!

[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:25.880]
And next week, if you think this is a game, we got the opening day game.

[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:28.400]
I believe that's Tuesday. I'm not really sure, I think it is.

[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.500]
That's what I care, except for the fact that we have a two hour show that

[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.320]
there we get off at noon.

[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.540]
Oh, hallelujah.

[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:35.420]
Hallelujah.

[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.960]
Mad Dog's got a good scam going, he was off yesterday,

[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.760]
Kimbo was on, mad Dog's off again today.

[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.140]
Man, you talk about having a great student, he learned from me as well as anybody.

[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:48.360]
The Hebrew Hammer, he learned too a little bit, but the mad Dog, this man has learned the

[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.580]
100%, I give him a plus plus.

[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.260]
More money, less work.

[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.540]
Take the money straight to the bank, don't pay any attention to what they say, and just

[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.200]
have a smile on your big fat push.

[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.640]
That's it. That's the mad Dog.

[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.060]
All right.

[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:02.640]
There you go.

[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.100]
Come back tomorrow, though.

[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.620]
Oh, wait a minute, speaking of the Hebrew Hammer, I shouldn't, I shouldn't be so quick to judge.

[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:11.140]
Did you look at tomorrow's schedule and also for Friday?

[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.120]
Oh, look at that.

[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:13.860]
There's a guy here.

[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.480]
Oh, no.

[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.020]
Joe is a guy here for two days for the Hebrew Hammer Thursday and Friday, so hands

[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.540]
learned too, he understands, less work, more money.

[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.660]
And stay out of the building as often as possible.

[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.720]
You notice how often Hank does the show out anywhere now at this point?

[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.120]
Often.

[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:33.220]
DeBahamas, Vegas, tennis tournaments, golf tournaments, assulas, any placement in that

[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:34.580]
the festering joint.

[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.120]
WQA, and hello.

[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.220]
Good afternoon.

[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.160]
How are you, Neil?

[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:39.700]
Good evening.

[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.280]
How are you?

[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:40.940]
Fine.

[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:47.320]
I have two for the poll, and one I think with the accident would be Wayne Heisinga, and the

[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.560]
other one because of the power he has and the other one would be Kitty Carlisle.

[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.580]
Have a good day.

[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.180]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.860]
The power that he has, Kitty Carlisle.

[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.000]
Oh, okay.

[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.400]
You're right.

[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.100]
I should have been kidding.

[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:03.800]
We missed out.

[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.600]
Don't put either one of those on here.

[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.820]
Although you might put Wayne on there.

[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:08.200]
Right?

[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.000]
A lot of people.

[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.300]
He's got a lot of passes.

[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.060]
He gets in all the ball parts for free.

[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:13.600]
He gets to go in the locker room there.

[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.140]
No, you get this guy ahead in mind.

[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.460]
Go in the locker room, check out the guys.

[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.140]
567.0560, pound 56 on the, in fact, I understand the rumor I'm hearing is that Wayne showers

[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.700]
with the guys after every dolphin victory.

[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:24.640]
That could be wrong.

[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.000]
I mean, moment of just made that up.

[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.320]
How many QA and hello?

[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.720]
Neil, how are you going, man?

[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.180]
Pretty good.

[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.120]
I actually have two for your poll also.

[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:32.480]
Really?

[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.700]
Just like the last guy, okay?

[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:35.020]
Almost as good.

[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.620]
My first guy is actually two people almost.

[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.140]
Any one of them, a loose brothers?

[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.400]
I don't know if you know those guys are?

[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.320]
No, I do not.

[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:44.180]
They're the owners of the Sacramento Kings.

[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.380]
They're way out there and they actually, they were on a couple of hotels and I was Vegas.

[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.180]
Those guys are just constantly getting it.

[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.980]
And my second guy, I'm sure you, someone's already said them though.

[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:52.880]
Luis Miguel.

[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.020]
I mean, I got you to have his back or bronze and put up a...

[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:56.780]
Okay, great.

[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.080]
Luis Miguel, he said something about his got that bronze complexion.

[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:00.720]
Is that what he just said?

[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:01.320]
Right.

[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.540]
From all the sudden.

[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:03.420]
Right.

[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.260]
From all that Mexican son.

[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.120]
Luis Miguel.

[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.220]
Hello, Luis.

[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.000]
I'd lose an answer to a far where you're because your rectum is getting to be king size, okay?

[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.400]
It used to be a queen size, not like a king size.

[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:20.300]
5670560, 0.560 on the AT&T line.

[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.860]
If you could be anything is living person for one year, who would it be?

[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.580]
You have their 90.

[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.880]
Bill Gates 38.

[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:29.680]
Tiger Woods has got...

[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.540]
The third man.

[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.240]
Tom Brady 14.

[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.800]
Britney Spears 10.

[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.320]
Ron Jeremy 9.

[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.600]
Johnny Depp 7.

[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.220]
George W. is got 7.

[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.500]
Peter and Rostrat 5.

[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.740]
And Ron Jeremy is got 9.

[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]
Oh my God.

[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:42.640]
Woo!

[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.200]
Rupert Murdock 5.

[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.260]
Donald Trump 3.

[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.260]
How can you have her head like 90 and Donald Trump's got 3?

[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:51.540]
One of those things.

[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.860]
And Donald Trump has even got his own TV show now.

[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:55.960]
It's embarrassing as it is.

[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.080]
You're fired.

[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.660]
Ricky Martin 3.

[01:11:59.060 --> 01:11:59.920]
Miguel Cabrera 3.

[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:00.700]
Michael Douglas 3.

[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:01.840]
And the LeBron James appear.

[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.240]
Brad Pitscott 1 already.

[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:04.980]
Zero for Pat Robertson.

[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.320]
Two of our better food co-in Alex Rodriguez.

[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.360]
A. Rogers went on 230 votes.

[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:11.180]
Pretty weak response to then against a pretty weak pool question.

[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:11.900]
And they're mine.

[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:12.640]
I thought it was excellent.

[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.420]
I mean, see, I don't want to say...

[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.220]
If you could be somebody else.

[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:18.300]
Right.

[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.500]
Somebody famous who would it be?

[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.380]
What were you doing really for one year?

[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.720]
Because then you get this...

[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.260]
Oh, I'm real happy being who I am.

[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.240]
See them and they'll say that.

[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:26.420]
Do we believe them?

[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:26.580]
No.

[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.480]
But that's what they'll say.

[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.380]
But just for one year.

[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.280]
WQAM, hello.

[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.000]
Neil.

[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:33.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.260]
I don't want to slow.

[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:36.400]
Yes, I am.

[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.500]
Rush Limbaugh.

[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:38.780]
Rush Limbaugh, okay?

[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.480]
He wants to be a big fat pill-pop in the hypocrite.

[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:42.860]
Rush Limbaugh, got it?

[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.240]
You don't have to be Rush to be one of those.

[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.080]
That's true.

[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:46.920]
WQAM, hello.

[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:48.720]
Neil, hi.

[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.920]
Hey, if you got Ricky Martin on there.

[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.860]
Then the guy who's going to be getting the most action

[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:57.220]
for the next year, I'd say, would be William Hone.

[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:58.920]
William Hone?

[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.460]
Yeah.

[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.560]
Answering the musical question is William Hone.

[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:02.820]
William Hone.

[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.320]
He sure can't sing, can he?

[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:05.760]
No.

[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:06.800]
But he's...

[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.380]
I love that one, Vitho.

[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.440]
What the hell is that?

[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.240]
I don't know.

[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:11.120]
I'll find it.

[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:11.700]
You get it up there.

[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.500]
I think it's important.

[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.180]
The bits.

[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.220]
The bits I'm talking about.

[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.120]
Oh.

[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.000]
Man, oh man.

[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.360]
This guy's looking for trouble.

[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.400]
And all the right places.

[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:23.740]
And I'm just the right place, too.

[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.400]
It's paranoid wind, they both.

[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.240]
You've got to be thinking about what, though.

[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.300]
Talk to me.

[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.820]
Tell me your name.

[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.040]
You blow me up like it's all the same.

[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.340]
You made it clear, and I'm shaking away like a phone.

[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.340]
Yeah, say it then.

[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.160]
Woohoo.

[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.180]
You got to get rid of the way.

[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.220]
They crash in room to room.

[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.400]
I go crazy because she knows I should fly.

[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.860]
He sings like a fee.

[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.780]
Like every girl in history.

[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.360]
Cheap face!

[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.100]
Cheap face!

[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:05.000]
Oh, there's your guy that's got his 15 seconds of fame in all of a sudden he's a stupid

[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:05.520]
star man.

[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.980]
Can't sing his word about paper-second, he's probably getting some.

[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.120]
26 after 11 at 5, 60, that would be Q&A.

[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:15.020]
All you folks out there, please listen because this is very, very important thing.

[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:16.000]
We important thing.

[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:20.380]
Tomatopark is announced that they will be racing all year long from now on.

[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.080]
Now, that's news to pay attention to, but even more important is that coming up this

[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:28.940]
Monday April 5 is the last free spaghetti dinner night for the Tomatopark season that's

[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.180]
tracking poker season, got it?

[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.800]
They're going to be racing all year long from now on.

[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:33.620]
That is fantastic.

[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.880]
Nice going, Dick, and Steve and everybody else, and Brucey, and Kevin, and Wally.

[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:38.820]
I'll forget Wally.

[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.820]
That's right, the last free spaghetti night that's coming up this Monday April 5.

[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.780]
Free rolls in butter, free salad, and a free heaping plate of possible marinara sauce,

[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:47.740]
all free.

[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.680]
All you have to do is buy a Tomatopark program for this Monday April 5, and get your

[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.160]
free spaghetti dinner coupon, go to only this next Monday April 5.

[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:00.140]
Just a half mile from both I and I, 95 in the floor, to turn Pike Tomatopark as easy

[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:05.120]
to get to, and best of all, Tomatopark features free admission and free general parking every

[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.100]
single day of your life.

[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.120]
poker room starts at noon, goes on till midnight.

Live racing gets underway, nightly at 7.05 pm, including tonight.

you to watch and plunge your guts on.

[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:27.800]

[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:32.820]
current race schedule, call 954-972-2000, or go on the web at www.tomatopark.com.

[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.580]
Make a little hole in your perfect right now in Safe Sun Room for it.

[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:41.640]
Coming up this Monday, April 5 at Poppato Park.

[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.020]
I'm not going to do my own.

[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:47.660]
This is 420-062-2008.

[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:52.100]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.740]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:53.940]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:54.420]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.320]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.100]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.500]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:58.140]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:58.540]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:58.700]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.160]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:15:59.440 --> 01:15:59.440]

[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.120]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.540]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.280]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.040]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:04.920]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.660]
I'm going to do my own.

[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.040]
Well, I was busy reading all these important facts as well.

[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.680]
What will you do when I hear some old Jews

[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.900]
Will you back off and give me your land?

[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.280]
Lift me a towel and I'll sing you a song

[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:25.160]
And I'll steal from you all that I can.

[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:28.880]
Oh, I can choose to give me help from my friends.

[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.880]
Oh, I'm back news with a little help from my friends.

[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.500]
I can't lose with a little help from my friends.

[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:45.140]
What do I do when I close you's a way?

[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.940]
All your love is fanned afresh and long.

[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:48.940]
Oh, yes, I do.

[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.640]
I hold many times by the end of the day

[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.560]
As long as that death is not your own.

[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.080]
Oh, no.

[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:59.640]
I hear Jews with a little help from my friends.

[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.120]
My friend knows with a little help from my friends.

[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.880]
Oh, I can't lose with a little help from my friends.

[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:10.520]
Do you need any time?

[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.680]
I need somebody to care.

[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.280]
Could it be any time?

[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:22.240]
And you, woman, or kids, can be bears.

[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:26.520]
Would you take lands and then give up the fight?

[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:27.880]
Of you, I'd like to be a bear.

[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.740]
You describe all the time.

[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.060]
Do you have peace with me?

[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.400]
Is really my...

[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.120]
I want to stop the privilege or mine.

[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:41.000]
Oh, I give you a little help from my friends.

[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.720]
I'm back news with a little help from my friends.

[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.600]
Oh, I can't lose with a little help from my friends.

[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.080]
Yes, I'll kill you with a little help from my friends.

[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.520]
With a little help from my friends.

[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.720]
I'll kill you with a little help from my friends.

[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:00.840]
I'll kill you with a little help from my friends.

[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.240]
Let's go to the fight, six days later.

[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.600]
I'd like to lean on a little bit too hard in the button too.

[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.960]
Let's see, in recated glaciers, this is because of Anna Cornicovas' time.

[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.740]
Good point. Very good choice, Anton.

[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.900]
I almost did put Enrique on her and said, Tom Brady.

[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.140]
There you go.

[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:19.200]
I figured that Tom is probably a bigger man in the world of sports.

[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.780]
Here's one that says, how about Vanessa Paradise?

[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.760]
A hot-deppen cider is nothing to complain about.

[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:26.640]
What it says here.

[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.000]
Paradise.

[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:29.640]
Paradise.

[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:30.300]
Paradise.

[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:31.580]
Cinema Paradise.

[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.920]
I have no idea how you pronounce it.

[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:35.620]
Vanessa Paradise.

[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.800]
Oh, by the way, don't forget what your name is on our thing.

[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:38.980]
They're Terry Nunn.

[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:39.940]
I don't know who that is.

[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:48.260]
And what was the thing I had about Berlin about how they're going to like...

[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.320]
I'm going to go back and make sure that they do that.

[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:54.680]
Let's see.

[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.280]
Reference Donald Trump from Alfie.

[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:57.020]
And you're right, Alfie.

[01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:57.560]
I saw that.

[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:01.060]
It says, in the financial section of the Sun Central Day, there's an auditor's report that says,

[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.300]
Donald Trump's five casinos in Atlantic City are in serious trouble.

[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.520]
In fact, the big headline says, Trump off-saurus.

[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.720]
Not by choice for many reasons, including that beaver he wears on his dome.

[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.360]
Well, at least it's not a muskrat like the Mo-man wears, but anyway.

[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.680]
Here's one that says, Bill Clinton.

[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.520]
That's what Kyle says.

[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.680]
And then he's got a bunch of other rambling on here with your olignor.

[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:19.580]
I'll pretend I didn't see.

[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.180]
Bill Clinton, that's a good choice.

[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:22.860]
Right.

[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:23.200]
That's what it is.

[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.420]
So my good is in choice.

[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.320]
Why didn't we think of that?

[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.220]
Here's one that says, Neil Rogers.

[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.740]
It says, with your quit wit, hear more intelligence and your paycheck, excluding the homosexuality.

[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:32.880]
And also they didn't mention your looks.

[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.480]
Although, looks don't seem to qualify for you after you.

[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:35.760]
I don't know.

[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.180]
We've got some other pretty, you believe people on this list.

[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.080]
So they don't really care about that about being ugly.

[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.320]
They just figure if they look like...

[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.160]
And Terry, your words, he should write nothing to a...

[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:43.560]
Look at.

[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:43.860]
Wow.

[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:44.580]
Who, man.

[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:45.160]
He is.

[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:46.060]
They can choose sexuality.

[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:46.920]
They want to be you.

[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:47.940]
That's the gay you.

[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.640]
I think if Terry rewards you, if the Spaceship Land you'll find all of his kin hopping off.

[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.220]
I could be wrong, but I'm thinking he's out of this world.

[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.440]
Those long figured aliens.

[01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:00.660]
If you could be any famous living person for one year, who would you choose?

[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:01.840]
You have to know 94.

[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:02.700]
Bill Gates 40.

[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:03.900]
Terry rewards 35.

[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.200]
Tom Brady only 19.

[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.160]
Well, come on.

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.580]
You'd rather be who have toer than Tom Brady?

[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:09.340]
Man.

[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.980]
See, they don't get it.

[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:12.920]
They don't understand it.

[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.000]
They're the coolest.

[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.680]
I think homosexual men must be a little bit confused, you know what?

[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:18.940]
Maybe.

[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:24.980]
They think that just because of his past fame and his past endeavors, that Hugh Hefner is going

[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:26.560]
to get anything he wants.

[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:28.580]
They think he lives in a mansion full of playboy bodies.

[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:29.780]
Right, and he doesn't.

[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.740]
That's ancient history.

[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:32.240]
He probably lives in a nursing home.

[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:35.980]
But that's okay.

[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:38.280]
Tom Brady 19.

[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:40.600]
Rod Jeremy and Brittany Spears are tied.

[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.220]
That is the most disgusting.

[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.220]
We got to break that tie immediately.

[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:45.720]
Get them separated.

[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:47.660]
Johnny Depp 8.

[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:49.780]
Who is this?

[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:50.360]
Who's this thing?

[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.520]
I never was in the heavy metal.

[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.740]
I didn't really like it.

[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.700]
I wasn't famous here.

[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.780]
I'm fascinated by rap and by hip hop.

[01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.800]
I think there's a lot of poetry.

[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.620]
Are you kidding, Carrie?

[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:01.380]
You talk about Andrew.

[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.880]
You talk about a lot of social energy in it.

[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.720]
And I think you better listen to it.

[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:06.140]
Pretty careful.

[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:06.640]
Oh, God.

[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.220]
I like him good in the monsters, though.

[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:08.640]
He was great.

[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:10.440]
No, no, seriously.

[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.400]
I'm only going to vote for Carrie 20 or 30 times

[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.720]
because we've got to get rid of Bush.

[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.440]
But Carrie just, he leaves me very, very limp.

[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.340]
Johnny Depp 8.

[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.340]
George W. 7.

[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.320]
Donald Trump 7.

[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:21.240]
Peter North 6.

[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.260]
He started to make a little move on Ron Jeremy.

[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:24.720]
And wait till he catches him.

[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.120]
Alex Rodriguez, a Rod's got six.

[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:29.060]
But there's the Pennsylvania of our poll.

[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.040]
Bush 46.

[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:30.760]
Carrie 40.

[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.360]
Nader 3.

[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.340]
Is that pathetic?

[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.060]
I mean, Gore 1, Pennsylvania.

[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.320]
Bush 46.

[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:37.720]
Carrie 40.

[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:38.600]
Nader 3.

[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:39.580]
And Pennsylvania.

[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.140]
Maryland Carrie 48.

[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:41.700]
Bush 43.

[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:42.560]
Nader don't show.

[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.340]
Well, this is interesting.

[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.180]
They just showed those two.

[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:45.800]
That's it.

[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.380]
That's all we're getting while that was a good start.

[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.800]
Uh, Libra and James 5.

[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.100]
Rupert Murdock 5.

[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:52.960]
Michael Douglas 5.

[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:53.720]
Brad Pitt 3.

[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:54.800]
Ricky Martin 3.

[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.260]
Miguel Cabrera 3.

[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.100]
William Hong 1.

[01:21:58.420 --> 01:21:59.660]
And look at all the people that don't have any.

[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:01.620]
I always love it when people call in their facts

[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:02.340]
and he's suggestions.

[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:03.300]
And they get nothing.

[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.320]
Why in Heisenberg, Louis McGill, Rush Limbaugh,

[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:09.200]
Pat Robertson, and that's a pair of these.

[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.320]
Well, look at that.

[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:11.380]
And he wrote paradise on there.

[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.120]
There's no e on the end of that.

[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:13.840]
Oh, so.

[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.820]
And Joy Butterfucko is also got none of the two already won.

[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:19.000]
Well, there's Al Franken.

[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:19.460]
Look at that.

[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:22.060]
He's got that microphone all set up there in front of me.

[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.540]
He's talking in on the area, but he's a,

[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:24.660]
I guess, doing a dry run.

[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.360]
That's on Air America, which they've used today.

[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.780]
Gonna be able to hear it in South Florida.

[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.040]
No.

[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.520]
Can hear how it's stirring in South Florida.

[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:31.760]
No.

[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.660]
Can hear anything in the show worth a while?

[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:33.800]
No.

[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:36.160]
But anyway, we got the Marlin game.

[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.180]
That's worth a while, man.

[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.540]
That's worth an hour and ten minutes getting out of here.

[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.140]
What a beautiful thing.

[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.240]
We love the Marlins.

[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:44.220]
They're the best.

[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:46.760]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:47.500]
Yes.

[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.140]
This is Gov.

[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.180]
Yeah, okay.

[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.360]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.600]
Hey, can we still say it's not all on Air?

[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:55.820]
I'll check.

[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.440]
We'll check with West Coast.

[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.020]
WDQA and Hello.

[01:22:59.500 --> 01:22:59.900]
Yeah, Dale.

[01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.180]
It's gotta be Jack Pickle.

[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:03.340]
It gets the Web and it can actually look crazy.

[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:05.100]
Good choice.

[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:06.320]
What's not to like?

[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.720]
Jack Nichols and gets to all the Laker games for free, I'm sure.

[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:10.780]
Jack Nicholsson.

[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:11.260]
Got it.

[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:12.680]
We got it.

[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:13.200]
Give it.

[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:15.320]
5670560.

[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:16.220]
£560.

[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:17.560]
Tomorrow course is the big day.

[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:20.220]
A lot of this is probably why Muff and Clarence are so nervous

[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:23.500]
while they squeeze each other frantically, even more so than usual.

[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.040]
Because tomorrow at 11.30 in the morning, that trend comes out.

[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.240]
Now, it's not a whole rating book.

[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.800]
You do understand for your rating students out there in the audience.

[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.160]
It's just a trend.

[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.280]
It's the second trend.

[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.300]
That is correct.

[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.520]
But it's two thirds of the winner book.

[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.940]
These ratings operate just never stop in the major markets.

[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.520]
Just keep rolling, rolling, just like CCR rolling.

[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.200]
And so we got like December January and February coming out tomorrow.

[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.440]
And we're gonna be dropping off that real bad November.

[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.600]
We want to find out if we got any audience coming back.

[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.700]
And if not, we'll just play some music.

[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:56.360]
Right.

[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.620]
A couple of years more music.

[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:01.760]
So that way they don't have to worry about any dirty words and all these bleeps and s***.

[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.540]
All this neurosis and psychosis going on.

[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:07.980]
Everybody can just sit back and relax a little bit.

[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:09.100]
WQM, hello.

[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.060]
WQM, hello.

[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.960]
Hi, now, how you doing?

[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:14.640]
Pretty good.

[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:20.880]
Well, we got another exemplary of why you should never encourage your parents to idolize

[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.360]
through Tired Sports Heroes.

[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.720]
Did you hear what Paul Ronning said?

[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:24.940]
No, I did not.

[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:26.040]
Oh, God.

[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:33.120]
He says that the Notre Dame should drop its admission requirement in order to allow blacks

[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.960]
to be able to come and play football there.

[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.260]
In other words, blacks are too stupid to get into Notre Dame.

[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.540]
Blacks play the Notre Dame.

[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:40.160]
What does that mean?

[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.520]
There's plenty of blacks playing Notre Dame.

[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:46.320]
Of course there, but he just, he's saying there aren't enough and the black athlete is much better

[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.280]
and we can't get him if we can't see the lower standards.

[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.900]
Well, touch on Jesus, man.

[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:51.820]
Touch down Jesus.

[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.960]
I don't think that's going to happen with Paul Harning and probably a lay odds.

[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.860]
He's a silly old daughtering fool, OK?

[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.160]
He's a silly old guy.

[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.680]
He was one of those packers pack in the old days.

[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:04.640]
Can we still say that?

[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:04.940]
No.

[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.880]
Gina Fort Lauderdale says, subject for the pool.

[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.620]
How many, I don't get it.

[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.800]
That's one of your ten women listeners I'd like to help out getting a few more women

[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:15.320]
onto your pool.

[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.200]
Here are a few suggestions.

[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.480]
I don't like all of the following, but I'm sure somebody does.

[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.900]
I don't understand that.

[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:20.840]
She's got a list.

[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.260]
Pick the ones you want in this regard.

[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:23.680]
The rest.

[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.080]
Thanks for all the support of stopFCC.com and move on.

[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:32.700]
Now to our junior Roberts, Paris Hilton, Haydor, Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman, Oprah Winfrey.

[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:33.760]
This one is for George's.

[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.140]
Oprah Winfrey?

[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.160]
That's a good one to put on here, right?

[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:37.640]
She's worried.

[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.760]
She's got a billion dollars.

[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:39.840]
She has no talent.

[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.560]
She's loaded and has a lot of money too.

[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.340]
I think she's a guy.

[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.040]
I really do.

[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:43.380]
Really?

[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:44.240]
Yeah.

[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:48.920]
Oh, this guy that she's been supposedly going to marry for last days.

[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.960]
He's like a...

[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:52.000]
Yeah, he's a male beard, I think.

[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:52.820]
Yeah, she's a guy.

[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:53.460]
I think she's a guy.

[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:54.840]
I mean, I don't know that perfect.

[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:55.600]

[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.160]
Now let me ask you this.

[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.660]
Here's the question.

[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.560]
I don't want to answer it's a rhetorical question.

[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:04.320]
What does Mark Foley, Charlie, Chris and Oprah Winfrey have in common?

[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.620]
20-0-560 WDQM.

[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:10.060]
Hay, spring it a savings right now and save like never before.

[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.940]
And a new car, a truck from Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead.

[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.800]
They're on US-1 just 20 minutes off of the A-36.

[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.400]
Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead is worth the drive no matter where you're hanging it out,

[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.300]
because they're going to save you thousands on great new Toyota's.

[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:23.540]
Check out these great leases.

[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:27.580]
An O4 camera or a 4-runner for just 269 a month for 48 months.

[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.340]
How about an O4 Highlander just 309 a month?

[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:30.900]
Need a truck?

[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.420]
How about an O4 Toyota 10 with the safest truck in America for just 179 a month for 48 months?

[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:40.880]
These are just some of the savings going on right now at Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead.

[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:44.080]
And with the toll increases on people using cash on the Florida Turnpike,

[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.180]
Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead will give you a free sun pass when you get that new car truck as well.

[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.000]
General manager David Rich and the staff will do just about anything under the sun,

[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.500]
under the Planes Soleil.

[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:55.220]
I always thought Soleil meant sun in French.

[01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.980]
How can the Planes Soleil be purple moon?

[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:01.340]
I get that.

[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:02.320]
Oh, that's right.

[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:05.440]
I forgot about the greater life to rule the day and the lesser life to rule the night.

[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.760]

[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.300]
Dr. Phil McGraw is, I guess, I do yell at my children and don't know how to stop.

[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.820]
We'll talk about that more later now.

[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:04.380]
That's what he calls for, Dr. Phil.

[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:06.660]
And we start with Northport, New York. Hello.

[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:08.580]
Hi, Dr. Phil. Hi, how are you?

[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.040]
I lost my job a few months ago and kind of affecting my marriage.

[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.840]
I really can depressed about it.

[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:16.280]
What would you prescribe?

[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.500]
Alcohol and drugs.

[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.200]
What? I don't know. I don't know.

[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.860]
I'm contributing to the cause.

[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:22.540]
Oh, beautiful.

[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.820]
Coining New Jersey, hello.

[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.840]
Hey, boys, how's it going?

[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:26.780]
Fine.

[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.680]
Where you took this for me?

[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:29.760]
You're kidding.

[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.860]
I'm serious, you guys. I'm talking full tongue.

[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.360]
I don't mind doing that.

[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.880]
I don't have a shame to say so.

[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.100]
Obviously. Just lean forward and we'll all.

[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.220]
Yeah, that's how it goes.

[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.040]
Woo!

[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.980]
It's so done.

[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:45.720]
Go away.

[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:50.320]
145 at 560, nobody?

[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.920]
QM Robert Cheere, who's one of my favorite columnist rights,

[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.060]
Bush puts a cancer on the presidency.

[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.480]
Watergate insider calls this White House scary.

[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:05.680]
Worst and watergate, the title of the new book by John Dean Richard Nixon's White House Council,

[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.300]
is a depressingly accurate measure of the checanery of the Bush Cheney Cabal.

[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.620]
According to Dean, who began his political life at the age of 29 as the Republican Council

[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:16.180]
in the House Judiciary Committee before being recruited by Nixon,

[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.840]
this administration is truly scary and given the times we live in,

[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.120]
frighteningly dangerous.

[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.820]
And when it comes to lies and cover up, the Bush crowd makes the Nixon administration look like amateurs.

[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:29.580]
As Dean writes, they've created the most secretive presidency of my lifetime

[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.480]
far worse than during Watergate.

[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.480]
Dean knows what he's talking about.

[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.860]
He was the one who dare to tell Nixon in 1973 that the web of lies surrounding the Watergate

[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.600]
breaking of the Democratic Party headquarters and formed a cancer on the presidency.

[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:47.320]
When Dean went public about that conversation, the Nixon White House smeared him as a liar.

[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.260]
Fortunately, the conversation has been taped and Dean was vindicated.

[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.800]
The dark side of the current White House was on full display last week

[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:56.700]
when top officials of the Bush administration took to the airwaves

[01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:01.140]
to destroy the credibility of a man who had honorably served President Reagan, Clinton, and both Bushes.

[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:05.480]
The character assassination of Richard Clark, the former White House anti-terrorism chief,

[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:11.460]
was far more worrisome than Nixon's smears of Dean because it concerned not petty crime and pursuit of partisan political ambition,

[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:16.840]
but rather the attempt to deceive the nation and the world as to the causes of the 9-11 assault upon our national security

[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.180]
and to justify an unnecessary war in Iraq.

[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:25.140]
First, Bushes ate suggested that Clark had invented the meeting in which Clark said the President pressured him to find a link

[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:31.320]
between the 9-11 attack and Iraq, ignoring Clark's insistence that intelligence agencies had concluded that no such link existed.

[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:37.960]
But on Sunday, national security adviser Kym Lee's arrest was forced to admit that Bush had pressed Clark on an Iraq connection.

[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:43.220]
This backed up early assertions by former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill as the Bushes of Session with Iraq

[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:47.840]
from the very first days of his administration at the expense of focusing on Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.

[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.500]
But the Bush lines didn't work this time, maybe just because too many veterans of the U.S. intelligence community

[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:58.360]
are finding their voices and are wanting to announce an administration that is seriously under my the nation's security.

[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:05.500]
They are speaking out as 23 former CIA and other defense intelligence agents did and Robert Greenwald's devastating documentary uncovered.

[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.480]
They have stepped forward as did David Kay, Bushes' former chief weapons inspector in Iraq.

[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:19.900]
This is an administration that's been dominated by the neo-conservative ideologues who can then the logical restrain of the first Bush administration on foreign policy as it be trail of the national interest.

[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:23.900]
These neo-cons have made a horrible mess of things, but that gives them no pause.

[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:30.060]
They went to war with a nation that had no weapons of mass destruction and few connections to terrorism, but have cruddled Pakistan,

[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:36.700]
which sponsored the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and which recently was revealed as the source of nuclear weapons technology for North Korea, Iran and Libya.

[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:42.040]
The president's team is wrong to believe itself, where just lies can continue to law the global public,

[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.820]
Nixen's lies want him a second election but then he lost the country.

[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.400]
Bush smiles better than Nixen, but when the lies have exposed the smile turns into a character revealing smirk.

[01:31:50.820 --> 01:32:00.280]
That happened last week when the White House released photos of a skit performed for the amusement of jaded media heavyweights in which the president pretended to look under his desk for the missing weapons of mass destruction.

[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:08.420]
This may have immune to cynical audience, but to the general public, the carefully lip-synced policy pronouncements of the man who cried wolf has morphed into a sick joke,

[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:10.420]
where I trodber cheer in the early time.

[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:40.400]
The president was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and

[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:58.620]
but he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and shown stars who spiritual be Christian and Sahara were flexing their真的很 over the United States, he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and allowed prisoners to be held Up Stand at the back with learningeled detectives from the Catholic church, and labeled H茪 pilgrim to Hiroshima.

[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:10.380]
Eh says, Jin-i, Ah, sahara did perform a bread on a stove and was named in the написns, and he was a former president of the United States, and he was a former president of the United States, and Maja Bai was named saint Priest, and John Martin Lin here a former Lex P. rustic

[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:15.800]
with Elaine Doulon. If you could be how about Elaine Doulon, that's why he's

[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.820]
not 68 years old now. He probably ain't getting any. No. If you could be any

[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.840]
famous living person for one year, who would it be? You have to register in 95,

Heisenga and Oprah. Oprah, I don't have any. I guess there aren't any women out there

[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:18.180]
who'd like to be a no-talent bitch. It's worth a billion dollars. Who can go on TV

[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:22.640]
and just instantly like millions of American women to if she snaps her fingers, they say,

[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:26.420]
okay, when do I jump and how high? That's what goes on with that Oprah. The question

[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:30.160]
is just for a year and I get to like come back to my old body. I'll be Oprah for a year.

[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.960]

Oh, P. Diddy. Little Lion Limbaugh, little RT-Gurl. He said how can you go on if you're

find her even the least bit attractive. Okay, I mean, she I put her in the category of guys

[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:18.340]
who anything that's got the right body parts and that doesn't make any difference how what

[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.860]
they look like, what her face is. Just as long as she's got them certain body parts,

[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:27.800]
those are the guys, Josh, who are like, oh, you know, like Lucy Lou. She's a beast. She's

[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:35.100]
nasty. In fact, Clarence said he'd take the beast first. W.D. Q.A.M. Hello. Yeah, you

[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.500]
If you're taking something very simple, they're making it complicated. They can't

[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:35.780]
put something in the old. These additions. Let it be known that she's a lesbian. They

[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.920]
can always hot. They did. Britney Spears is already on there, sir. Britney Spears.

[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.680]
All right. Britney's climbing up the list. She's almost got a Tom Brady's ass. She's got

[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:12.040]
you doing? All right, Neil. Long time long time. 24-year listener. Hi, Pally. Hey, I got

[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.660]
a question. Who the hell would want to be Wayne High finger for a year? Baldwin Pockmark,

[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:21.060]
man. Good Lord. Listen, I've got one for your party. I think though he built the respect

[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.840]
of the public by calling and bitching out Mowen Gildey this morning. I think they like

[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:28.240]
him a little better now. Yeah. Wow. Let's see how they do when the dolphin season starts

[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:33.320]
to do it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The fact that G. Feetler was still on that roster. I find that

[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:37.160]
sewing uncomfortable. It's basically as just to me they're going to forfeit this season.

[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:42.000]
Well, they have to have a quarterback controversy. It seems and this is part of it. But enough

[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.320]
for it. I think what I'd like to be for a year before we went to prison. I'd like to

[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:52.880]
be John Gotti for one year. Yeah. In South Florida. I come down and I take over the

[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:58.160]
club truck business. I get 50 points on a dollar and take over the club business in this

[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:02.280]
town. And put these givens out of business. I love you, Neil. God bless America.

[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:05.720]
Oh, wait. Oh, wait a minute of business, too. Okay. Good luck, Pally. The problem is

[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:12.940]
John Gotti famous living person. Too late. Just missed. Oh, and guess what I saw last night.

[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.080]
I give up. What did you see? On the biography channel. I love that channel. I just absolutely

[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:20.540]
I'm obsessed with that channel. It took a channel. In fact, what's on it right now? Let

[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:26.800]
me take a peek during the day time. Wallace Simpson. Is she can do a Kevin Wallace? Wallace

[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:33.440]
Simpson. Oh, that's she was the Duchess of Windsor. Remember King Edward the eighth gave

[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.500]
up the throne so he could be the queen or she could be. Something like that. I don't

[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:40.840]
know about them. Queens. Yeah, you remember that. You read about that. Well, anyway, but

[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:46.820]
so last night I saw the biography of Chuck Veris. Oh, yeah, I heard about him. His name

[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:53.200]
was Charles. Oh, dang. Charles Hirsch, Veris. Okay. His father was a dentist. They were

[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:59.860]
very Jewish and his mother, her family was loaded, but then the depression had lost all

[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:02.940]
their money. But anyway, so now what was the name of the movie that they made about him

[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:09.540]
the gun show movie? No, no, no, about his autobiography. They bought the autobiography.

[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.740]
It was a George Clooney, a directed and was in it. Right. The one where he's a spy. Right.

[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:16.700]
The one where he claimed to be and nobody knows whether it's true or not. He was a CIA

[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:21.880]
spy and killed 33 people. Because I had seen that movie, which is the I had heard of those

[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:25.660]
rumblings about how he claimed all of these things. But anyway, so the biography thing was

[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:28.740]
really great last night. It was a good show. And of course they talked about the dating

[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:33.060]
game and how any of it's day back in the day, how revolutionary and outrageous those

[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:36.700]
shows were. And it made me think a little bit about all of these things that are going

[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:42.980]
on right now. Yeah, during the break, check your email. I sent you a funny thing. A funny

[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:49.320]
thing. Yeah, I admit it links to other funny things that I might buy. Oh, well, you know,

[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:54.540]

And you lay man.

[01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:01.800]
At a Homeland Security Donnerage, inviting you to boot duct tape on your radio when I

[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.220]
raised the warning color to Bing for the Neil Rogers 12 to 1 hour. Coming soon to

[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:10.620]
a cinema near you, it's the greatest romantic comedy in the history of film. You, Grant,

[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.740]
is a bum-ling to it. Well, if I may, I hope I'm not being too

[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:21.200]
forward. The London Zyzeh's a bum-ling to it is so light like that no more films should

[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.220]
ever be made as they would only fail in comparison to this brilliant piece of twit-headed

[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:25.940]
tightcasting.

[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:31.560]
If I may be so good as to ask you and stand it on time, I'm track it by standing here

[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:35.700]
in the middle of the street, but I'm very much like to ask you, if you see only one

[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:39.840]
Hugh Grant movie this year, then you certainly won't need to see this one because he's playing

[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.960]
the exact same 20 plays in all his movies.

[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.060]
I'm glad that you've been here with me and well, there's something I've been meaning

[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:50.720]
to, and what I need to say, it might be quite fetching.

[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:55.240]
And you think Elizabeth Herby left him because of that whole divine brown deal? No, she

[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:59.560]
left him because Hugh Grant is a bum-ling to it, now playing in Selected Cities.

[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:04.880]
I do rather hope you come to see me in a bum-ling twit-head. That is to say, if you don't mind

[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.160]
my being somewhat cheeky.

[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.940]
Oh, for the love of God, let's do shot!

[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:10.440]
Oh, well, I think I suppose that.

[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:13.620]
That's a cute thing, I'm trying to print it out right now, I think it's your printout

[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:16.780]
when it's out, but anyway, he may already just send me about his president Bush, a

[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:17.300]
homo.

[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:22.600]
Yeah, and he wakes to the Betty Bowers merchandise. There's some great things there.

[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:23.560]
Are they really?

[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:24.220]
Yeah, T-R.

[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.760]
Now, are they on auction now on thewqm.com?

[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:29.680]
No, but we can link them.

[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.760]
I think we just invented another revenue stream for our friends in Beasy Opener and Naples.

[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:41.140]
This is cute, that is our saving homosexuals, B-A-S-A, eights and eights.

[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:42.540]
That's a beautiful thing.

[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.880]
How many pages is this George?

[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.580]
Good, golly Miss Molly.

[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:51.880]
Let's see, Teresa Hines for years is somebody here I'd like to be Teresa Hines.

[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:52.660]
Okay?

[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.180]
Well, they got to start slow, but then maybe they'll catch up.

[01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:01.000]
Anyway, his president Bush, a homo, back to their saving homosexuals, asked what conservative

[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.840]
Christians throughout America are demanding to know.

[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:07.280]
January 2nd, and she had the thing in here where he was holding hands with Prince Bondar,

[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.220]
I guess they left that out.

[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:13.340]
January 2nd, 2004, Mr. Bush wondered over doing Mr. Scott Reed's senior strategist at

[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:15.380]
Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin's chat with the Prime Minister.

[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.980]
Mr. Reed introduced himself into his hands with President Bush.

[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.080]
The President chuffled, well, you got a pretty face, he told his surprise, Mr. Reed.

[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:21.940]
He wasn't done.

[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:25.120]
You got a pretty face, you were a good looking guy, better looking in my spot anyway,

[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:25.980]
you mean Scott McCullen?

[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:27.180]
Wow.

[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:31.600]
That's from the Toronto Globe and Mail, January 16th, 2004, I remember talking about it

[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.160]
at the time.

[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:32.440]
Remember?

[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:33.100]
Yes, I did.

[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:39.420]
It says, we at Baptist saving homosexuals have, enough so-called gays with a blunt love

[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:42.880]
of Jesus to know how to spot demons across a crowded sale at Sacks.

[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:47.220]
Outside of Italian shoes, nothing sends up a rainbow-covered flare that you're dealing

[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:48.960]
with a flaming homosexual more reliably.

[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:51.940]
They went a man breakfastly, gushes the word, fabulous.

[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:56.140]
Absolutely correct.

[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:00.480]
When a Christian lady hears this word outside of her herselon or floor, she instinctively

[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:04.580]
reaches for the Bible tracks in her purse because she knows a Nancy boy is within throwing

[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:04.980]
range.

[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.340]
Three months after the World Trade Center towers went down George W. Bush quoted, it's been

[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:13.100]
a fabulous year for Laura and me.

[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:17.520]
Therefore, conservative Christians throughout the land have become increasingly uncomfortable

[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.320]
as they doodifully mask each awkward pause with a flurry of plight of flaws and yells

[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.960]
of more warriors during President Bush's somewhat laborious attendance speaking.

[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.240]
The alternative there may have mastered the Queen's English, our President's vocabulary

[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:30.640]
calls to mind any number of Queen's English.

[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.960]
Even our least vigilant Republican social commas knows of notice that Mr. Bush has been

[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.980]
peppering his otherwise delightful litany of patriotic jingoism and pleasantly embroidered

[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:44.560]
CIA intelligence recaps with the Affeminate Maiden call, fabulous, three giddy syllables

[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.280]
that are tenement to poorly cooling.

[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.300]
Hello, it's Sailor.

[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:50.920]
That is absolutely unbelievable.

[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:51.960]
Fabulous.

[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:53.520]
And if I look for it, I can probably fire.

[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:54.380]
Hey, Sailor.

[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.380]
And we'll prevail because we're a fabulous nation and we're a fabulous nation because

[01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:02.320]
we're nation full of fabulous people, quote from George Bush in Atlanta January 31,

[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:03.220]
2002.

[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:05.540]
And it goes on.

[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:06.400]
This goes on forever.

[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:12.680]
It says everyone in our pretty President's acquaintance appears to be doing a fabulous job.

[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.900]
Again, his lovely wife Laura, what a fabulous job she is doing.

[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.900]
His brother in Collusive, Arab Herring, she had, he's done a fabulous job and on an

[01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:20.740]
encore as a whole list.

[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:21.620]
Cute.

[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:23.260]
We're going to put that on a website.

[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:23.800]
Sure, why not?

[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:25.320]
BettyBowers.com.

[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:28.000]
Along with Terry Nunn.

[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.720]
BettyBowers.com, when we put a link to it or we can put that up, whatever we want, whatever

[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:32.680]
we want to do, we'll do it.

[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:35.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:36.080]
Tomorrow's a big day.

[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.280]
We're going to hopefully tomorrow have the deal where you can start to get some money

[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:43.240]
into that newspaper ad for, say, stop by FCC.com.

[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:45.100]
Save our free speech.

[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:48.680]
And also tomorrow, of course, 1130, that trend comes out.

[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:50.300]
All right.

[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:56.140]
And of course, that, no, seriously, that's why some people are very walking around on eggshells.

[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:59.140]
Some people who should be no better than to get over emotional about these things, but

[01:45:59.140 --> 01:45:59.500]
nevertheless.

[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.100]
I sure hope they're not counting on us anymore.

[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:05.960]
Now that they curtail all of our free speech so badly, don't be counting on us.

[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.660]
We're just doing the best we can under very limited circumstances.

[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:14.180]
If you could be any famous living person in a, for one year, who would it be we asked

[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:17.760]
today on Eurajus.com, a highly unpopular poll question to that?

[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:19.220]
I liked it.

[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:20.060]
403.

[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.900]
I thought it was fun, but these people don't get it.

[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:23.480]
You have no 114.

[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.980]
114 guys out there want to be a dotting old man sitting there or reaching out for the

[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.380]
a, a viagra not finding it.

[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:36.040]
Bill Gates 51, Tiger Woods 45, Tom Brady 28, Brad Pitt's move right up on Tom's butt.

[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:41.320]
24, Britney Spears 17, A. Rob 13, Johnny Depp 13.

[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.520]
Oh, how all the way up here.

[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:44.600]
The nurse pulled it into a five foot of tie with Ron Jeremy.

[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:45.580]
12 a piece.

[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:53.340]
Donald Trump 10, George W. 10, Bill Clinton 9, LeBron James 8, Rupert Murroch 7, Michael

[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.840]
Bug was 7, technicals in five and a co-s are from there.

[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:56.980]
Oprah's got a pair finally.

[01:46:58.100 --> 01:46:59.220]
William Hong is even got a pair.

[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:00.600]
What are you on CNN?

[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:03.600]
Look at their look on her face and what are all.

[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:04.380]
I have a point.

[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:07.160]
What a nasty put them on that bitch.

[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:07.860]
Kind of leases.

[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:08.980]
You got that scowl.

[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:10.280]
Oh, you know what he's got.

[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:10.540]

[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:10.720]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:10.780]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:11.080]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:11.200]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:11.200]

[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:11.420]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:11.440]

[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.180]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:12.820]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:14.380]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:15.120]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.020]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:19.320]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.120]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:22.640]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.160]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:31.300]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:33.580]
I know what he's got.

[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:35.660]
Who's he married?

[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.260]
Who's it married to?

[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:38.260]
Who was it?

[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:39.820]
The French actress slash model.

[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:42.200]
OK, let's find out.

[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:43.120]
What was you researching?

[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:44.700]
Thank you.

[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:45.280]
Thanks.

[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:46.080]
Oh, come on.

[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.040]
We know who that is.

[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:48.020]
I don't.

[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:49.440]
Johnny Deff's.

[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:51.080]
Josh was researching it.

[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:51.880]
OK, researching.

[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.260]
You're going to be embarrassed when you fight out.

[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:55.240]
I'm going to be embarrassed.

[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:55.340]
You're going to be embarrassed.

[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:56.740]
You're going to be going with her.

[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.400]
No, it's not Kate Moss.

[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.440]
It's not Kate Winslow, either.

[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:03.560]
Maybe it's Kate Smith.

[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:05.920]
560-705-60.

[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:06.600]
How many?

[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:06.960]
60.

[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:07.780]
Who was it?

[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:08.420]
Harry Smith.

[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:11.220]
Have we haven't got this yet?

[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:12.620]
No.

[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:14.760]
Oh, it's going to be appropriate.

[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:16.060]
WQM, hello.

[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:16.940]
Dale.

[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:17.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.020]
I have one for your poll.

[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:19.680]
OK.

[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:20.440]
All right.

[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.420]
The great Neil God.

[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.400]
Yeah, we already asked somebody to say that.

[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:25.740]
I don't think any put it on me, though.

[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.400]
I might have turned two-ninth to eight.

[01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:27.960]
Probably.

[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:28.580]
Thank you.

[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.360]
I know who he's married to.

[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.080]
Why don't you look up IMDb?

[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:36.420]
Just look up Johnny Depp with a bio.

[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:37.560]
What'll tell you who he's married to?

[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:39.100]
How long can this take?

[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:39.720]
How many minutes?

[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:40.860]
Stop 30 minutes.

[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:43.240]
It is possibly take to fight out the name of Johnny Depp's wife,

[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:46.140]
which we all of us already know who he's married to.

[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:46.800]
Right?

[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:47.680]
We are.

[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.020]
Let's do it by presence of elimination today.

[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:50.380]
Oprah.

[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.120]
The other wife, you know.

[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.780]
It isn't the Joan Rivers.

[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:56.880]
It's not Anna Corticova.

[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:59.560]
It's not Terry Nunn.

[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:01.500]
It's not Janet Jackson.

[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.520]
He's still working on this.

[01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:04.680]
This is our computer wizard.

[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:07.160]
He's still working on fighting Brad Pitt's wife.

[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.760]
I'm reading on some site that.

[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.660]
Yeah, you probably found some pictures of what you probably found.

[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.040]
I know which one it was, too.

[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:15.740]
WQM, hello.

[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.060]
Yes, the snail Roger.

[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.140]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:21.920]
Yes, I'd like to be Captain Jean-Multi-Card.

[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:30.720]
That might have been the girl with the eyes right there.

[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:32.660]
You know what I mean?

[01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:33.020]

[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:34.000]
But he's a cancer.

[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:34.520]
He's girlfriend.

[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:40.940]
5670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:42.340]
These people are a panic today, man.

[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:43.900]
They got the happy pills came in.

[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:44.560]
I love it.

[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.760]
Too bad that the happy pills didn't get in

[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.220]
with our programming department this morning.

[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.160]
That's the last time.

[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:49.900]
You know something?

[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.580]
Next time they pull that, I'm just going to get them walk into the other room.

[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:56.000]
I'm going to turn on my TV and there's to dump my feet up on a coffee table.

[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:57.640]
And you'll let me know when they're gone, okay?

[01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.800]
Because I'm not going to do that no more.

[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:01.300]
Right before the show.

[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:03.560]
That would just say something.

[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:08.140]
I have to go through a long, agonizing thing about a bleep over a word

[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:09.800]
that isn't even being said.

[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.560]
A bleep over silence.

[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.000]
The Nessoparades.

[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.080]
The Nessoparades.

[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.140]
The Nessoparades.

[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:22.480]
Are you sure that's how you pronounce your name?

[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.260]
I'm telling you.

[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:24.440]
Why do you say periodis?

[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:25.860]
Because that's how it's spelled.

[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:27.160]
How about periodad?

[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:28.760]
Disordad.

[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:31.000]
That's what Eric Kingston's periodis periodad.

[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.240]
Hehehehe.

[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:32.900]
Hehehehe.

[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:32.900]

[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:33.580]
Ho ho ho.

[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.360]
He is tragic.

[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:37.600]
He's not going to suspend his one more time, Larry.

[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.260]
Get out of the way.

[01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:40.140]
Do you have there 117?

[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:42.220]
Nobody's going to catch the Hefner, my sir.

[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:43.400]
They're living in the past, man.

[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.160]
They don't get it.

[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:47.240]
Bill Gates 54, Integrawoods 46.

[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.280]
It's a one horse race so far.

[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:51.660]
WQM, hello.

[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.160]
QAM.

[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:55.940]
How are you?

[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:56.580]
Pretty good.

[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:58.180]
I got a little request.

[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.460]
Do you have a capacity to burn your list?

[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:02.060]
David Cassidy.

[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.580]
Why would you want to be David Cassidy?

[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.780]
He's living out here in Fort Ardell living a big life.

[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:07.560]
Yeah.

[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:09.120]
And that's what I got.

[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:10.160]
Okay, thanks.

[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.520]
He wants to be David Cassidy.

[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:13.000]
Maybe he can hang out with the guy with the eyes.

[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:14.340]
That was good timing.

[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:15.600]
I like David Cassidy.

[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.880]
He's got one date lined up anyway.

[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.340]
Would you stop?

[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.260]
Would you stop with that, with that factory stuff?

[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.660]
Oh, by the way, let me ask you this question.

[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:27.860]
I want you to answer it.

[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:28.280]
All right.

[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:29.300]
Mark Foley.

[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:31.360]
Congressman Mark Foley.

[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:34.660]
Attorney General Charlie Christ of Santa Florida.

[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:37.940]
And Rock Hudson.

[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:40.100]
What?

[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:41.980]
Do they share?

[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:42.880]
In comment.

[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:43.980]
I'll tell you.

[01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:45.460]
Okay, now, if you're thinking about that one,

[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.600]
Charlie Christ, Mark Foley, and Tony Perkins.

[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:49.680]
Remember him from Psycho?

[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:50.040]
Sure.

[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:52.380]
What do the three of them have in common?

[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:53.000]

[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:58.420]
Charlie Christ, Mark Foley, and Norma Kent.

[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:01.200]
What do the three of them have in common?

[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.500]
Again, that baseball.

[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:04.120]
I just, just stop and think about this.

[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:06.240]
Just fantasize about this all day long.

[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.240]
It will come to you finally.

[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:07.940]
All right.

[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:09.600]
I mean, you might, it will be a little slow.

[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:12.720]
Here's another one.

[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:13.520]
Not a dumbest one.

[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:15.740]
I don't want to use them all up in one day.

[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.300]
It's going to be really interesting in the state of Florida.

[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:21.540]
We get this thing, you know, because state by state.

[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.580]
All the way over to you have the prohibition on game urges.

[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:26.880]
But if that issue really becomes like a hot button kind of thing in Florida.

[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.520]
And if people decide they want to start like marrying all over the place,

[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.180]
besides in Key West, of course, where we know there are a bunch of heathens anyway.

[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:38.720]
But what's going to happen when Charlie Christ might have to make a ruling on that?

[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:40.340]
Huh?

[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:41.180]
I don't know.

[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:43.400]
You might have to call up Dick Cheney and see how he did it.

[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:45.640]
Hey, how's your new year's resolution going?

[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:49.020]
It's April 1, tomorrow, no fooling, but boy, a third or a quarter,

[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:50.120]
fourth of the year's gone already.

[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:51.700]
And you're still fat.

[01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:53.640]
And you're not making any progress, Ladi, I guarantee.

[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:54.600]
I can relate to that.

[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:56.720]
Well, it's just too darn difficult.

[01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:59.060]
The stupid love of those diet programs.

[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:00.640]
But with balance, for life, they make it easy.

[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.540]
Because you don't have to go into the supermarket and figure out what to buy.

[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:05.460]
First of all, because they do all that for you.

[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:07.940]
There's no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning,

[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:10.560]
no counter-recoding, no carbohydrate counting for sure.

[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:13.500]
Balance for life is based on Dr. Barry Sears' The Zone Diet,

[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:16.400]
and they deliver right to your door a little black sack.

[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:20.420]
And there's nothing like a little black sack because inside all the delicious fresh goodies

[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:22.480]
that you want for the entire day to keep you full and happy,

[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:23.960]
five feedings don't last.

[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:26.420]
Three meals, two snacks every day, right to your doorstep.

[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:29.900]
People are losing an average of 12 to 18 pounds a month for balance for life.

[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:33.040]
The Zone Diet is proving to lower your blood sugar, lower high cholesterol,

[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:34.120]
and high blood pressure too.

[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:35.520]
So what's not to like?

[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:38.300]
And if you ever wanted to try the South Beach Diet, here's your chance.

[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:41.160]
Because balance for life is the closest thing you'll ever find.

[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.240]
It's the only meal delivery company that offers you menu choices.

[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:46.860]
They let you go from phase one to phase three of the South Beach Diet.

[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:49.820]
The most difficult thing you'll have to do all week is just fill out that little menu.

[01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:54.080]
That's it, you fast it back to them, and you pick up from two choices for every meal and snack

[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:55.960]
on the meal all week long.

[01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:58.900]
So if you're tired of all the other fad diets, you haven't lost the weight yet.

[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:01.020]
You're over to yourself to try balance for life.

[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:04.560]
It could be the difference between being out there and losing that weight or being in a box.

[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:21.700]
You're going to be the most difficult thing to do all week long.

[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:21.700]

[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:21.720]
You're going to be the most difficult thing to do all week long.

[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:34.200]
You're going to be the most difficult thing to do all week long.

[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:51.700]

You're going to be the most difficult thing to do all day.

[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:07.520]
You're going to be the most hard thing to do all week long.

[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:09.660]
You're going to want something different.

[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:09.660]

[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:09.820]
You're going to be the most hard thing to do all week long.

[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:11.780]
You're going to be the most hard thing to do all week long.

[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.400]
You're going to be the most difficult thing to do all week long.

[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:14.400]

[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:14.400]

[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:14.400]

[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:15.340]
Always always always my favorite of yours

[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:15.360]
Always always always my favorite of mine.

[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:29.060]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:34.140]
Prop 17 at 5.60 WQM home to free and used to be landed at the brave in the free speech

[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:34.720]
finale anymore.

[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:38.040]
But we have some really nifty options that we got on our QM.com website.

[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:38.740]
Yeah.

[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:39.000]

[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.380]
We got the Marlins on Dec. 12, 15th in the second year.

[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:44.600]
Beloved World Champion for the Marlins.

[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:52.480]
Brad Penney, Josh Beckett, Miguel Cabrera, Michael O'Leary, Lowell Thomas, Old Jack

[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.980]
McKinley, just turned 110 today.

[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:54.880]
Happy birthday Jack.

[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:58.440]
Let's see, Tom says for one year I'd like to be Tommy Lee.

[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:00.320]
He's not Mirady Flays drums, he's rich.

[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:04.860]
And with that watch out, ladies, PS for all that I could live with the tattoos.

[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:06.640]
I just go on Tom, Tommy Lee.

[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:10.500]
And of course he was with the panel Lee back in the day, which he actually looked human

[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.040]
for a little bit for about how many seconds?

[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:13.020]
3rd man.

[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:13.360]
Yeah.

[01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:15.100]
That's bad.

[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:18.280]
Oh, it's speaking to the Marlins, got some bad news.

[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.920]
Oh, no, don't be the bearer of ill-tidings.

[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:21.160]
What?

[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:22.320]
The game isn't re-doubted, is it?

[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:22.940]
No.

[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:24.180]
Oh, not that bad.

[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:24.360]
Oh.

[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:28.880]
The Florida Marlins may be World Champions, but they're not likely to get state help with building

[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:29.820]
a new stadium this year.

[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:30.320]
Dang.

[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:35.200]
It's certainly dead for this year's Senate President Jim King, Republican and Jacksonville

[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.060]
said yesterday it's too late in the game.

[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:39.520]
It would look like we're just pushing something through.

[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.400]
Now, we've got something you can push through.

[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:45.680]
King's comments coming only a day before legislature will honor the team for his World

[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:50.580]
Title, a didn't dampen the hopes of team officials who still see a $60 million state sales

[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:53.580]
tax break as the key to building a new home team home.

[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:59.000]
It's important for the future of baseball and South Florida that we hold out hopes

[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.960]
that David Sanson and the insoli president, he said his goal is to keep the team in Florida,

[01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:06.260]
and that goal will not go away till the gap goes out on the last day of the session.

[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:11.440]
Still, King's opposition will likely kill any effort this year to help the team despite

[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:13.140]
Governor Jeff Bush's support to the idea.

[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:17.460]
If King says it's dead, if he's going to block it, it's dead.

[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:22.420]
Said House Majority Leader Marco Rubio, Republican of Miami, noted there are fewer than four weeks

[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:26.120]
left in the session if nothing happens this session will be because the team started

[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:26.940]
too dang late.

[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:28.960]
Oh, that's right, Jeff Cohenine.

[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:33.360]
How they come back to the scene of the crime, Jeff Cohenine, one of the original Marlins,

[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.040]
I think, when they had a very original team?

[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:35.440]
Yeah.

[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:37.320]
That was there.

[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:41.560]
I used to be a Marlin fan for about five minutes until I went out to the ballpark and

[01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:44.020]
listened to the idiots who went to the games and oh, God.

[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:49.120]
He's got to go back and tag up at first before he takes his lead again before the kickers

[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.040]
scratches his private.

[01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:52.380]
Oh, they had no clue what it's all about.

[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:56.080]
That's why one of the reasons why nobody shows up at the Marlin Games is because unless

[01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.140]
they're like, you know, winning every game, plus it's boring.

[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:04.760]
When Juan Pierre, the stolen base leader from 2003, several Marlins officials and players

[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:08.060]
will be in tell I have seen today to be honored by the House and Senate along with David

[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:12.360]
Samson, Jeffrey Luria, Larry Beanfest, Blindfest and Jack McKibb.

[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.340]
Don't forget your felding, Jack.

[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:21.640]
5670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:26.780]
If you could be anything is living person for one year, who would it be?

[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:28.860]
You have to know 125.

[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:33.960]
Bill Gates 55, Tiger Woods 51, Tom Brady's God.

[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:35.520]
God, third man.

[01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:41.340]
Red Fifth 27, Britney Spears 19, Johnny Depe 18, Alex Rodriguez 60.

[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:41.720]
Look at that.

[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.180]
Johnny Depe is keeping right up on Britney.

[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:45.220]
Who wouldn't want to witness that?

[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:45.620]
Look out.

[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:47.120]
Look out now, honey.

[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:52.140]
Bill Clinton 15, Ron Jeremy 15, Peter R. 13, Ron continues holding a slim lead.

[01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:54.180]
He's probably voting over and over again.

[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:54.960]
Got nothing else to do.

[01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:58.780]
Your grotesque Ron, okay, you're disgusting and gross.

[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:07.580]
George W. Tann, Rupert Murdoch 8, Michael Douglas 8, LeBron James has got 8 billion dollars.

[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:12.940]
Jack Nicholsson 6, Miguel Cabrera 5, Ricky Martin 5, Oprah's got 4.

[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:13.860]
I got 3.

[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:16.180]
Yeah, I like that.

[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:18.200]
I got 3.

[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:20.060]
If yours don't have any yet.

[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:21.000]
Nobody wanted to be you.

[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:22.240]
No, I don't make it up to you.

[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:23.000]
Wait until I see your picture.

[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:23.880]
I just went up to 4.

[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:24.680]
I'm going to tie with Oprah.

[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:25.440]
I will see you together.

[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:25.960]
No.

[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:26.620]
Same person.

[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:33.700]
William Hengtu and Rikaetu, Puk-Daddy-2, P. Diddy, Louis McGill, Louis McGill 2, but that's a periodist.

[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:35.280]
Still with E on there, Josh.

[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:37.120]
He's militant about that.

[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:37.480]
Why?

[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:38.400]
He's married to Johnny.

[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:38.840]
What?

[02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:40.960]
Type the instructions to the air if they're to change it.

[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.200]
I watched him do it.

[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:45.820]
One of the ways he can't change it only, or he can only add nuts and traps.

[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.060]
But why is that?

[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:47.880]
Come on, Eric.

[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.600]
Listen up the first rangel.

[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:50.080]
Look at there.

[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:51.100]
Listen up the co-tales.

[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:53.560]
You militant, Nazi, basted up there in Orlando.

[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:56.620]
Let Josh do this thing and quit the top of the limitation.

[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:57.720]
Why is that?

[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:00.840]
Based on what?

[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:01.560]
I don't believe you.

[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:02.880]
Based anyway.

[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:05.020]
Josh would have to go back to college to learn how to do it.

[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:05.960]
Wayne has got one.

[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.740]
Wayne Heizing, a baldy, old clockmark man.

[02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:10.320]
Pet Robertson, one time elite one.

[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:11.800]
None yet for David Cassidy.

[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:13.400]
Do I let a Fuku go or rush?

[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:14.600]
Nobody wants to eat rush.

[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:15.860]
What does it have to outcome?

[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:17.540]
I'd be rush for a year.

[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:18.360]
He's got bucks.

[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:19.780]
He's got some big bucks.

[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:21.100]
He's got all the right connections to.

[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:22.080]
Yeah, you'd love to be rush.

[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.560]
You're getting in touch with Wilma and some other good contacts.

[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.420]
WQA and Hello, Wobbles.

[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:27.560]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:28.180]
Pretty good.

[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:29.000]
Pretty good.

[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:29.380]
Pretty good.

[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:31.160]
Hey, you don't like the Florida Mars, man.

[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:32.880]
You know what that is?

[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:33.880]
Yeah, I know.

[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:35.460]
Because you're an idiot.

[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:37.040]
WQA and Hello.

[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:39.240]
Uh, Neil.

[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:40.060]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:41.380]
I have Z-main.

[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:43.120]
Matt Damon.

[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:44.980]
Matt Damon is not a bad idea.

[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:46.420]
There you go.

[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:47.720]
Okay, thanks a lot, Charlie.

[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:48.240]
Matt Damon.

[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:50.500]
The universe, uh, oh, uh, speak out of that.

[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:53.280]
Let me say Charlie, Chris, Mark Foley,

[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:56.140]
State Representative from Palm Beach, and Matt Damon,

[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:57.740]
the three of them has something in common,

[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.400]
and you think about what it might be.

[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:00.260]
I don't want to hear it now.

[02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:00.600]
All right.

[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:02.020]
Take about your answer, okay?

[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:04.200]
One of these days, when he least expected,

[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:05.960]
I will have you answer the question.

[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:08.420]
Hello, WQA and Hello.

[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:10.600]
Hi, Neil.

[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:11.360]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:12.920]
How you doing?

[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:13.980]
I'm doing great.

[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:14.500]
How are you doing?

[02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:15.880]
I'm doing terrific.

[02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:16.580]
Excellent.

[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:19.580]
Well, the reason why I'm calling this,

[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:21.380]
because I want to tell you that you're a big, fast,

[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:22.080]
okay, great.

[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:23.260]
WQA and Hello.

[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:24.200]
Neil.

[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:25.000]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:26.540]
Yeah, I've been one for your list.

[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:27.340]
Okay.

[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:30.340]
I can't take the guy's name, but instead of Hugh Heppner,

[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:33.880]
the young guy who started that girl's on wild business,

[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:36.180]
the tapes that you see on TV.

[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:37.640]
I don't know.

[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.200]
What's the name of that young guy that started the girls

[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:40.460]
from a wild business, George?

[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:41.120]
I don't know.

[02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:42.100]
I have no idea.

[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:44.420]
He's split in the high life.

[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:45.760]
Yeah.

[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:48.300]
And that would not mind being him for a year.

[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:49.780]
Okay, well, let's find out what his name is,

[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:50.560]
then we can put him on a pool.

[02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:52.900]
Or he just put out there, the young guy that started that girl.

[02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:53.680]
Oh, God, wild thing.

[02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:56.340]
That guy could find out what his name is before he calls.

[02:02:56.700 --> 02:02:57.860]
That would be a really good idea.

[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:01.980]
5670560, pound 566 on a AT&T.

[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.620]
Are the kids out of school today or what?

[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:05.240]
Is it just all the pills that got split around?

[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:06.440]
No, it's just, yeah, the ship came.

[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:07.500]
Somebody dropped a load on the ground.

[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:09.660]
They just fell all over the place and people are picking them up

[02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:10.600]
and popping them in like piss.

[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:11.260]
They didn't show up.

[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:11.960]
Like, Eminem's?

[02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:14.780]
I think some of these call me the good Eminem, myself.

[02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:15.440]
Oh, that's right.

[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.900]
Eminem, ****, I'm a WQA and Hello.

[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.120]
WQA and Ola?

[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:22.780]
Hey, you here.

[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:23.660]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.840]
I know when you ripped them better, man.

[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:27.340]
You had the belt.

[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:27.500]
Yeah.

[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:29.940]
What do you got for us, Pali?

[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:32.980]
I was going to tell you that for your poll, Mark Cuban,

[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:37.140]
not the Pandas of the audience, but he's pretty rich and young.

[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:38.140]
You got a big mouth, yeah.

[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:39.540]
And a sports dude.

[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:40.860]
There you go, Mark Cuban.

[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:41.860]
Okay, thanks a lot, Pali.

[02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:43.240]
Plus, still liking because he's Cuban.

[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:47.780]
Well, 5670560, pound, how about Bob Pouban

[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:49.000]
and the, what was that song?

[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:53.260]
Bob Pouban and the old Bokeh Bronze Angry with me right now,

[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:54.780]
because I should know that right off the top of my head.

[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.020]
The cheater, wasn't that it?

[02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:56.540]
I don't know.

[02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:57.260]
He'll confirm it.

[02:03:57.820 --> 02:03:58.180]
Oh, come.

[02:03:58.380 --> 02:03:59.000]
Where's my book?

[02:03:59.300 --> 02:03:59.940]
Give me seven seconds.

[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:03.400]
By now you're aware that the Federal Communications Commission.

[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:07.180]
That's great.

[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.140]
Every time we have a little pause, we'll play a word block.

[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:12.560]
Because Duff has got a mental block.

[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:14.480]
Be sure I put a lot of briefs in there too.

[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:15.880]
Okay, even though the words aren't being spoken,

[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:20.200]
that has got to be what I thought that the auction yesterday was the low point in history over QA.

[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:22.800]
And this was so much worse when you told me that,

[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:27.880]
last night, I got an email from Bokeh Bronze last night from undercocked.com.

[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:29.360]
Yeah, I'd forgotten about it.

[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.560]
Bob Pouban and the in-man, the cheater, it was number 12 in February, 1969, 1966.

[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:36.680]
I wish I had it here, I would play it.

[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.940]
In fact, I bet you it's on that one, one of those ones.

[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:40.900]
During the next break, I'm going to look around to see if I got it.

[02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:42.840]
Remember we did the one-hit wonder thing and we're sorry we did it?

[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:43.760]
Yeah.

[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:44.600]
Oh yeah, I had fun.

[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:46.080]
Bob Pouban and the cheater.

[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:48.180]
Oh yeah, I enjoyed it, the audience hated it though.

[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:50.380]
It's like this pool today, there's nothing wrong with it.

[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:52.740]
We don't get it, what does it mean?

[02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:56.860]
And obviously a lot of them aren't getting it,

[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:59.840]
which is why so many of them want to be who have nearing everybody else who's getting late a lot,

[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:01.140]
because basically they ain't.

[02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:05.020]
26th past November, like a Marlon game in and about a half an hour boy.

[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:09.160]
Our favorite team, the Florida Marlins, they'll kick some ass.

[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:12.120]
And on that field, there's a lot of grass.

[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:13.560]
There's a lot of grass on that field in here.

[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:16.380]
It's not really grass, but they may be smoking some.

[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:18.680]
Hey, if they were like the UM Hurricanes back when I did the games,

[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:20.120]
they'd be smoking a lot of grass, good stuff.

[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:22.740]
Hey, listen, it's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:24.740]

Yeah, I can feel it.

[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:24.420]
You can almost smell something.

[02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:27.980]
And of course in back in the day I would have played a little drop in right there, but

[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:30.020]
now if I hit that it goes moron like that.

[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:32.040]
Or if I wanted these it goes.

Hey Jacob how are you?

Pretty good Jacob.

[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:59.960]
Good listen I haven't spoken to you since the last year and I'm wondering who you're

[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:02.400]
going for this year whether it's a birth or carry.

[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.080]
The election last year I'm not there in 2000 sorry about I'm driving.

[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:10.020]
You listen to the show you have to ask me who I'm going to hope for.

[02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:13.260]
I haven't been able to listen because I work inside now.

[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:17.600]
I'm holding for 45 times Jacob I'm voting for carry a hundred times.

[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:18.360]
You think so?

[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:21.200]
I know so you're right on this question Jacob.

[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:25.700]
No just wondering you can you do me a favor I have a family request.

[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:26.320]
Yeah.

[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:28.120]
Can you have the FADs?

[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:30.660]
Can't wait that more no change.

[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:34.160]
I can take them have a great life okay get back in touch with reality.

[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:37.120]
Wow that is scary.

[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:41.040]
5 6 7 or we can play a little bit of it.

[02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:43.140]
Okay as much as yeah.

[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:45.580]
What is that what is that under?

[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:50.360]
Here comes under here come the FADs.

[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:54.720]
I can't say that is might be the at no it's under the it's under okay just relax

[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:57.380]
now we've got plenty of time to look all game got a couple minutes.

[02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:02.680]
There's the F word we certainly can't play that no more we can play the Bible says and

[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:06.680]
the Clintons and the cockamoon song I think we can play we can play a little bit of this.

[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:09.160]
There you go.

[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:13.920]
I think that's about it.

[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:31.280]
Okay that's the Zorrohars that's going to take it obviously is so about it's like she

[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.240]
doesn't realize that freedom of speech is dead in America you see while America was sleeping

[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.440]
the FCC and the government came in one day and says oh you can't say and you can't say

[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:43.540]
and all of a sudden like 90% of the stuff we used to play we can't play no more see

[02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:47.500]
that's why we're doing a stop at CC dot com deal which I noticed today Florida is really

[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:52.380]
sucking wind and not doing much on there at all really sad just when we had a chance to

[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:59.820]
overtake Texas they were right on their big fat Texas ass 18 170 behind lots not too bad

[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:05.260]
Florida's in third place out of all of the states the overall petition drive so far we

[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:13.540]
got 131,372 nice job against Scott and don't forget now he's added that link which I

[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:18.760]
think is fabulous where he can well fabulous see there go again it's my factory coming

[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:23.120]

[02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:57.900]
country to stop all the growth and perversion and the disgusting things like boobies we got

[02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:02.000]
boobies running the country and Jacobs got a call up and ask which one voting for that

[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:08.340]
Jacob that is so sad I want to hold my head in my hands and cry for hours anybody who votes

[02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:12.720]
