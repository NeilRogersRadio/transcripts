[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.400]
Luther Campbell and Glenda Campbell to you or

[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.380]
Campbell soup 1003 and 560 WQM Happy Thursday

[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.100]
to you boy we got a heavy a full plate today you know

[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.640]
what I do although it's half clean now thanks to

[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.660]
poppies for all the food that I didn't get because I'm not

[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.640]
there right all the script understand the

[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.080]
George and Josh both had a gigantic mouthful of

[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.320]
sausage well I had some pizza Josh had the

[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.460]
sausage yeah the big mouthful of sausage

[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.340]
and had a big smile on his pushes what I hear

[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.620]
and anyway we got stuff on that website today

[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.760]
because we want to contribute we want to

[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.660]
contribute to our half of the culture wars that

[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.440]
continue in America at a an escalating pace

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.980]
which you better take a look at our website today

[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.960]
because it can't be there too much longer

[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.640]
where man in the trenches because evidently

[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.480]
the way it works in America is that if the

[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.280]
FCC doesn't have authorization over something today

[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.720]
Congress will just pass a law regardless of

[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.800]
the first amendment and they'll have control over it

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.600]
for example they're going to pass a law about

[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.320]
private conversations that you have behind closed doors

[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.280]
and certainly magazines that you read things

[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.520]
that you read in your daily newspaper they're going to be

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.360]
checking that out and your imagination right and things

[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.800]
that you think about that may be a little bit sub-arosa

[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.400]
verbotent and can do it and the FCC will comment

[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.440]
and stop a heavy fine on your ass

[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.640]
cable may also be targeted and fight against

[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.240]
TV and decency this story is so grotesque

[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.760]
and so unacceptable I got the new vanity fair magazine

[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.140]
in my hand which is about 500 pages long

[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.500]
350 pages of which are ads very glossy ads

[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.820]
with a lot of marginal looking models

[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.400]
male female and some androgenous

[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.720]
but the microtection articles in there

[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.420]
and it's very very long and I don't know whether

[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.360]
I should read it or not or even make an attempt

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.280]
I get cross private on that

[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.200]
hit the highlights

[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.580]
and I can't do that oh I see it's not the kind of

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.980]
article that you can really hit the highlights

[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.420]
well we'll see I don't know anyway let's do the

[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.320]
result of yesterday's pull before we do anything else

[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.540]
no even before that what oh nothing you got to

[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.280]
tell the people about the site no before that

[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.460]
oh the Joe Roastering oh that yeah well

[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.720]
it's enough to make your scream

[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.640]
now blockhead there who evidently you know

[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.380]
too much football without a helmet will get to

[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.200]
you has been doing this eight to ten thing

[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.540]
for how many months now about 30 about 30

[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.360]
man a long time has he gotten paid yet

[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.200]
no a dime no a penny no he has to have that contract

[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.260]
has he had that meeting with Greg Reed who runs away

[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.820]
from him down the hall every time he sees him no

[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.440]
now that's fine I mean if Joe wants to continue

[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.380]
working for free we like having a misal eden we like

[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.360]
him a lot it's certainly a nice buffer there

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.080]
between you and him and us and you know who

[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.740]
absolutely right you know who the molmeister

[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.320]
but it would seem that if you're going to be able to

[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.200]
you know like what I do and mad dog does in the

[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.300]
Humper we all agree on this and I thought the little

[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.260]
dog was going to agree with us too Joe Roaster

[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.560]
but it's one thing to agree with it but you can't

[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.720]
take the money to the bank when they don't give you any of it

[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.420]
and I don't want to tell him what to do far be it

[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.360]
for me the combo can for all of them weeks and weeks

[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.320]
and weeks eight to ten or any other time

[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.340]
especially when I got a full time gig so that I don't need this deal

[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.660]
I would say pay up or buy buy you know I wouldn't just sit around

[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.700]
and well just maybe he's just too much of a nice guy I think that could be it

[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.500]
I could be or maybe a schmuck I don't know what the little

[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.520]
dogs deal in certainly related that maybe he just trust

[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.680]
Greg oh yeah that's one of these days it's a coming

[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.020]
don't we all no I want the money now

[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.980]
anyway here's the deal yesterday we asked what was the most

[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.500]
depressing movie ever made before we get to that

[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.960]
if you go to our website today I promise we won't let you down

[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.100]
today's picture is Angelina Jolie not stark naked

[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.980]
but you certainly get the nips and date nippy right so just nip it in the bud

[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.180]
and you better take a look at these pictures real soon because pretty soon

[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.040]
the FCC's gonna that was the next thing they're gonna do they're gonna have

[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.920]
jurisdiction over the internet don't ask me how but they'll

[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.100]
no finger out of way and of course the thing I like about that Dean and

[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.020]
Janet Jackson picture is that he's screaming yeah and he's got

[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.980]
he's got such a firm hold on that booby-man it looks like it's gonna

[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.900]
like burst any second that's silicone is gonna go spurtin right in his face

[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.220]
which would really be that's right so you got that picture you got

[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.300]
Angelina Jolie and then as if that isn't enough we've got something on

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.700]
there that'll make you scream see the crews man

[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.280]
and all glory now I don't want to say that when you see that motion that

[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.220]
she's making there it makes you really believe what I've been

[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.760]
turned you for a long time that she's got that big strap on yeah

[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.920]
because she's doing something there besides exposing that breast

[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.960]
exactly so we're gonna lock for you to prove on our website today and of course

[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.520]
take a good look at it because like I said the cultural wars dictate that pretty

[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.480]
soon you won't be able to like even undress with the lights on even just in the

[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.100]
privacy of your home with the doors all locked you won't be able to do that you

[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.780]
won't be able to take a shower unless you weren't like a at least a thong

[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.500]
right more than underwear for everyone you can sing a thong well here's that

[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.400]
picture again a John Kerry a hundred years ago and Jane Fonda then I'm anywhere

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.480]
near each other but nevertheless this is there is yeah there is way in the back

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.440]
several words behind but there's Jane Fonda and of course the bottom line of this whole thing

[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.940]
which a lot of assholes in the media seem to be forgetting is a

[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.120]
hennoi Jane turned out to be right and so was Kerry when it came back from

[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.960]
nom that it was an abortion

[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:20.600]
to me and make him look bad with that with that connection is completely false

[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.740]
we were at a rally for veterans at the same time I spoke Donald Sutherland

[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.880]
spoke John Kerry spoke at the end I don't even think we shook hands of 58,000

[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.120]
kids came back and body bags from Vietnam so who was right now but at any

[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.760]
rate hey wasn't it worth it what was the most depressing movie ever made we

[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.640]
asked yesterday we had a long list this is going to take till midnight to go

[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.400]
through all of these 1329 votes I don't I'm not going to read all the results

[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.840]
I'll only do the double digits I'll start at the bottom Ode to Billy Joe had 10

[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.920]
well momentum had nine kids had nine Seattle I just can't do it go to the website

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.540]
and look at the results Ode to Billy Joe 10 the pianist had 11 nothing like a

[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:07.000]
depressing pianist El Norte 12 papy on 12 beaches 12 last American virgin 12

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.180]
what dreams may come 13 on the beach 13 Bambi 13 oh Bambi don't do it

[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:18.820]
not just ball 13 Titanic 14 full metal jacket 14 Cooke was nest 15 casual

[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:25.640]
ease of orange deliverance 15 ghost had 15 love story 16 with Ryan O'Neal

[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:33.260]
and Ali McGraw and Ray Meland you figure out who he was yet no love story 16

[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:39.480]
green mile 18 looking for Mr. Good Ranch 18 nagnoia 19 Americanist 3x20 pay

[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.920]
it forward 23 ordinary people 23 voting for Columbine 24 a must see but

[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.860]
depressing because it happens to be true saving Ryan's privates 31 the dear

[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:55.900]
135 Sophie's choice 48 midnight cowboy 50 terms of endearment 54

[00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.340]
filth and alphia 56 midnight Express 59 with George Sarsadia he thought it

[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:06.220]
was a feel good movie for did leaving Las Vegas 60 old yellow 68 Brian song

[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.360]
even though we spelled it wrong Brian song 107 and Requiem for a dream wins

[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.300]
hand well I was so was fairly close but Requiem for a dream let all the way

[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.200]
to and never but linguistically like Seattle slew

[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.020]
29 or

[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.780]
for

[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.920]
interestingly there were three didn't have any votes running on empty blade

[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.660]
runner and captain crulley's mandolin so I guess the people that call

[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.840]
some of these in they just think I know pewter right right they got no PC or

[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.100]
maybe they just funnest or who the hell ready to try

[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.460]
just make a difference no we don't care because it kills some excellent time

[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.640]

Absolutely.

[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.680]
He wants to help us

[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.480]
We're running hard

[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.760]
He wants to help us

[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.900]
Does he have one in his day?

[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.060]
To really kick his tail

[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.100]
He's a baby

[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.940]
He's a baby

[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.060]
He's a baby

[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:21.200]
He's a baby

[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.140]
So big and tall

[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.560]
He's a baby

[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.840]
He's a baby

[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.220]
We've got 14 entries for our high couples contest

[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.140]
The deadline for our event is 2 o'clock tomorrow

[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.280]
We'll see if they'll come pouring in the ass in

[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.000]
Maybe they'd like to win a trip to Jamaica or to the Bahamas

[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.800]
Whichever one

[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.460]
Or maybe even a dinner at the pizza lock

[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.280]
So they can watch the rumors eat for free

[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.340]
Before we do anything else, this story is just so nauseating

[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.280]
See we really do have a culture war in America now

[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.400]
Make no mistake about it

[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.420]
And when I said even Georgia started to agree with me that maybe the Civil War was a bad idea

[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.440]
I never thought about it

[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.280]
But you're right

[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.540]
It's just a north-south thing

[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.660]
But generally, spicken if you want to draw a line it might not be a bad idea

[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.460]
Between the states where like living and breathing people

[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.980]
People who are living in the 21st century are

[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.900]
And people who are in the inner thaws who are like on their knees praying to God

[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.880]
Although there were plenty of them in Boston yesterday which looks to me is like pretty far in the northeast

[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.380]
Last time I checked, last time I was there at Fanny Will Hall and Quincy Market

[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.340]
But at any rate

[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.680]
So we've got a lot of Bible thumpers all over the US of A

[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.380]
But just generally speaking again, this culture war between the end of the thought Bible thumping hypocrites

[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.980]
It's out of control

[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:58.200]
And all this fury and hysteria, I mean it's just out of it's mind is what it is

[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:06.260]
Frustrated by the profanity and nudity on TV that culminated with Janet Jackson and Justin Tinkerbell's sexy Super Bowl dance

[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:15.300]
Angry lawmakers yesterday raised the prospect of expanding the fight against indecency on television to cable networks for the first time

[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.020]
Cable

[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.760]
Oh my God

[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:24.460]
In other words, it's going to get to the point where all of TV people just going to be watching tapes and DVDs

[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.160]
There'll be nothing way in a minute of the sports

[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.280]
Who said they're going to leave those alone?

[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:29.860]
Oh

[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.640]
Well, if you go to Blackpust, do they're not, right?

[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:40.900]
In separate simultaneous hearings, members of the House and Senate told members of the FCC and president of CBS Viacom, Mel Carmeson

[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:47.320]
That finds could just be the beginning of a new crackdown on profanity and indecency on US airwaves

[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:54.020]
Most immediately they appeared into a passing legislation that would increase tenfold the fine on TV and radio broadcasters

[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:59.800]
That violate FCC's decency rules to a maximum of $275,000 per violation

[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.580]
A House committee is expected to approve version of the bill today while senators have introduced their own similar bill

[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:12.560]
Lawmakers including Republicans usually wary of government regulation, hypocrites raise the possibility of getting even tougher

[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.960]
Such as passing a three strikes and a year off the air law that would revoke the FCC licenses of repeat offenders

[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.760]
Which would mean that infinity would lose all our licenses yesterday

[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.860]
Right?

[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:23.760]
Right

[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:32.740]
Reformers who focus on network TV are missing 85% of the story because 85% of Americans now get their TV programming from cable and satellite

[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:40.840]
FCC chairman Michael Powell said of course what he didn't say is that they have all of these parental controls both on cable and on satellite

[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:47.280]
So that if parents figure that any program is too hot to risqué they can to win it out program it out

[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.960]
But of course that's not really the point

[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.480]
Oh, what is the point?

[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.340]
Sunsaw or shit

[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:56.600]
Oh, Senator John McCain Republican of Arizona who's rapidly losing it since his cheeks swelled up

[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:05.920]
Favorite a suggestion by the consumers union that Congress required cable and satellite operators to offer all a card programming in which people pick and pay only for the channels they want

[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.840]
In other words God forbid we should have basic TV because something might come in on your TV that you don't want to see like maybe MTV

[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.840]
For example something like that

[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:21.080]
What about the scandal or maybe one of those reality shows where like a whole bunch of scantily clad people are cavorting around

[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.300]
Right almost bear ass naked or maybe even the freaking playboy channel might come in

[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.400]
Yeah, how do you like that?

[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.080]
I like it

[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.840]
God forbid you better not say that again. Sorry. See you don't like it. I like it

[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:48.520]
Congress would change this and this Congress would have to change the rules governing the FCC before the commission could expand its oversight of cable TV

[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.240]
Because cable is a subscription service that doesn't use the public airways

[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:59.160]
Historically it's been on the FCC's jurisdiction but in the aftermath of the Super Bowl halftime show there we go to that flap again

[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.880]
Congress may be willing to give the FCC greater authority over cable

[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.540]
How do you like that and then if that isn't enough then it'll be over the internet and it'll be over the books that you read in your book story

[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:16.600]
It'll be in your newspaper. It'll be on what you say in private conversation. It'll certainly be over the telephone

[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.960]
Mm-hmm all of these things it'll be what you drop in the bowl

[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.700]
Right you're right. No, it's supposed to go like that and don't think you assign language is safe either

[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:32.540]
Oh no, I have to do yeah, I saw that yesterday reading and even as fun your man forget about that going on

[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:39.620]
All your perverts on radio mum be so this is if this doesn't get to you

[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:45.320]
If this doesn't finally alert you to the fact that we've a bunch of Nazis running around on the loose now because it's an election year

[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.180]
And like I said yesterday both parties. I mean it's this is not a political thing

[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.840]
At least in terms of partisanship

[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.800]
It's all across the board because nobody wants to come down on the side of smut

[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.400]
I mean the first amendment when it doubt open a window and throw it out right

[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:06.180]
Because nobody wants to come down on the side of smut like that horrible flat in a super bowl like Titi

[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.120]
Oh

[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:15.300]
Nobody's in favor of titties. I certainly nobody wants to see no naked behind. Oh, and now you know what the big dealer making is?

[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:24.700]
I give up about the horse farting. I mean right America grow up already get a life get with it and grow the F up already

[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.260]
Can you do it? Oh Jesus

[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.380]
Ah farting horse how disgusting and tasteless. Oh geez

[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:38.740]
Like a bunch of overgrown children. That's pretty good. People are being butchered all around the world because of our policies

[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:45.920]
By the way, Lou Dobbs who I can't stand but he's been doing a pretty good job of doing this these exposés on which corporations are outsourcing

[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.100]
These thousands and thousands of jobs so that millions of Americans are unemployed now

[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:59.760]
And last night they took a poll on a show I checked it this morning. Do you agree with the administration that outsourcing of American jobs overseas is good for the American economy?

[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:06.000]
No, no, that's what they're trying to tell us now. Oh, I know just like the just like the tax cuts for the rich are good for the economy

[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.180]
And it's got to trickle down your leg of the thousands of votes they received on CNN 95% said no only 5% said yes

[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:20.140]
And those five the five percent were probably Chinese get made to go back to slaughter some more chickens

[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:28.140]
You get no more of those American jobs. I mean what kind of crap so they're not full and too many people are right especially the ones who are out of work?

[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:37.080]
They may think they are but even the American public is starting to finally catch on. They're starting as Heinz would say catch up and of course she happens to be Carrie's wife

[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.220]
With about a half a billion dollars. Ah

[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:52.380]
Now what are we going to do about this poll? We got to add some names to it which we'll get to after the break I do I mean I'll read like in bits and parts the Michael Jackson thing say what's much too long and too ponderous to go start to finish say when we should put it up.

[00:21:52.640 --> 00:22:01.820]
Put what up the poll. Oh, we can do it now. Okay. I mean we got a few names on there. What happened to Beyonce and goals?

[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:12.840]
Beyonce. Huh? We're doing it now. Avril Lavigne Kid Rock, Nelly Fertado, Outcast and Beyonce those are the first and then we'll get some names from the audience and we'll

[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:21.440]
Joshua Lattamann in between the chopper on the sausage there. Whatever he's doing. I think he's done. Is he done? He's done. Did he wipe it off?

[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.900]
Who do you think is the best recording artist or group of the past 10 years is our poll question today past 10 years?

[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:43.380]
Now if there's a debate on that I got my little book down here. What? Nothing. Just what he what he what he just do. Just what about the funny things that are going to happen. Oh 26 past 10 at 560 WQM A Valentine's Day is just a couple of days away.

[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.100]
Hope you guys are thinking about giving the same old tired flowers because guess what you're going to get in return not much.

[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:55.840]
So here are three words you need to remember Vermont Teddy Bear. In fact just think of Howard Dean and Vermont will come to mind immediately.

[00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:02.040]
Center a bear gram and work the lover boy bear the love band at bear are they new all star Valentine dress like a sports fan.

[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:07.820]
When it gets there she'll be completely surprised all of her coworkers will think you're the greatest for sending such an original thoughtful gift.

[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:13.380]
Then maybe she'll give you the gift that you're hoping and praying for like maybe a bus ticket to go downtown and get some action.

[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:21.500]
So just call one eight hundred eight to nine bear and a friend a bear counselor will help you choose the perfect bear for your Valentine delivered with a free chocolate their famous gift box.

[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:27.320]
It only takes five minutes to order overnight delivered to the Homer orfaces guarantee I guess we can't say orfas no more can we.

[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:37.040]
No. Okay. So call one eight hundred eight to nine bear or shop online at Vermont Teddy Bear.com and send your Valentine the Korean of alternative to flowers which die in wilt in no time at all.

[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:46.160]
Call one eight hundred eight to nine bear and be sure and tell them that old perverted neo toy to call the product called the FCC call one eight hundred eight to nine B.E.A.R.

[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.980]
Line line local. We're sports radio five sixty zero eight.

[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.260]
You.A.M.

[00:23:53.660 --> 00:24:04.600]
I think it is and the people I call in they're just like them like that they were on the year what a call the weed in their high and I mean it's terrible.

[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.700]
The year that I've been looked at listening to six ten and I miss here.

[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.560]
I wrote.

[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.980]
We'll put a stop to it now though. Thanks Michael Paul.

[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.000]
Slow down.

[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.920]
I see a cop about to make traffic stop.

[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.940]
I've got the highest plastic bag.

[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.680]
Can't let him see I'm smoking to be.

[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.820]
All right.

[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.860]
I'm not right because I'm smoking to be.

[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.120]
Hello officer did I turn wrong.

[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.580]
No that's definitely not my phone.

[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.600]
Ain't there's so many you can set me free.

[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.180]
All I was doing was smoking to be.

[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.680]
Oh my god.

[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.900]
I'm smoking to be.

[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.960]
I got lots of records but not with the police.

[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.960]
I'm high as a kind and I've got the munchies.

[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.160]
Let's go to don't and don't so say can we please.

[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:20.080]
That's what you get smoking to be.

[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.840]
But I know you can do.

[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:36.200]
Here's the facts from Gary says could you please add cool plate your poll no problem Gary also if you watch the South Park movie yet.

[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.480]
I heard that no not yet this weekend this weekend for sure.

[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:47.780]
Let's add some more names on there before we're getting this pile of stuff okay because they're not getting a lot of votes because most people don't see anybody they like on there yet.

[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:53.820]
We threw some of the the current obvious ones on there during the break such as a system of a down Lincoln Park disturbed.

[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.820]
I love Lincoln Park they're great.

[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.420]
I vote we put a list get on there.

[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.440]
You put on biscuit on there.

[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.100]
Josh's idea.

[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.760]
Oh no that's okay.

[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.240]
I won't get any vote.

[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.120]
I vote a Lincoln Park.

[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.700]
I like Lincoln Park.

[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.460]
Josh you too.

[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.760]
Well how do you like that?

[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.480]
How do you like that?

[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:16.220]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.160]
I'm almost tempted to put Afro man on there but I guess not.

[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.740]
I love Afro man.

[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.320]
Go to QA and hello.

[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.240]

[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:26.900]

[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.840]
DJ disturbance.

[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.780]
Hi you palies.

[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.680]
Come to QA and hello.

[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.180]

From the last ten years.

[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.540]
Yeah yeah they've been big.

[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.860]
In ten years the fish has been around since before Jesus was a baby.

[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.340]
Get out of here.

[00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.220]
Haven't they?

[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.360]
I don't know.

[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.600]
Sure fish is like a grateful dead type but that's old that's old news.

[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.840]
Let me say it again.

[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.140]
Of the last ten years now how about Elvis Presley?

[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.140]

[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.420]

[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:19.720]

[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.300]
How about the Fats Domino?

[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.280]
These people are so full of it.

[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.340]
WQAM hello?

[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.800]

[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.880]
Got it.

[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:34.780]
WQAM hello?

[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.300]
R.I.R.

[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.100]
WQAM hello?

[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:44.640]
Hello I'd like to nominate Train at the only city, the two cities I bought in less than

[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:44.940]
years.

[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.460]
Train?

[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.740]
Train yeah.

[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.340]
They had a song drop to do but it wasn't their best song but they got a new one out called

[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.420]
Paul and all the angels.

[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.320]
It's a great song.

[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.180]
Oh my god.

[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.780]
They might not agree because it's too poppy for you.

[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.300]
Okay thanks a lot.

[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.460]
I got another comment.

[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:00.880]
Go ahead.

[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:10.440]
I'm just absolutely infuriated about this latest turn of events in Washington, the FCC, the

[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.160]
communists.

[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.180]
And it's so disturbing.

[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.900]
Everybody in this country has a choice whether to watch TV or not.

[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.300]
And if you don't like it throw your TV away do something else to read a book.

[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:28.560]
I think it was some congresswoman or something in New Mexico complaining about her work.

[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.680]
Oh she was foaming at the mouth yeah.

[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.560]
Oh it's just you know democracy is dead.

[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.020]
This country it was a good idea at the time but it did not work.

[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:38.800]
You got it.

[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.740]
They stole the election and they stole the constitution and they were running off into hiding now.

[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:50.920]
Well you take for granted when you're growing up that it's always going to be here and it's

[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.520]
always known but it's not working and all of their fault.

[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.020]
And I'm pissed off.

[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.980]
Well stay pissed off until at least no member.

[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.440]
Well vote early and often.

[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.400]
Okay thanks.

[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:02.920]
Thanks.

[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.800]
This Texas mom facing trial for selling text toys and we had this trip before.

[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:08.200]
Yes.

[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.680]
But I thought it was an update.

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.300]
Oh well we're good to it maybe.

[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.420]
I got a lot of fish to fry here man.

[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.360]
I'm telling you right now I got piles and I got this vanity fair that weighs about 700 pounds.

[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.560]
Boy you know we're in a wrong business.

[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.660]
Wouldn't it be great to put out a real glossy magazine that a lot of people buy and it and there's like

[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.040]
6,000 pages in it and 5,800 of our ads.

[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.460]
Mm-hmm.

[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.380]
That's how I've done.

[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.980]
Okay well what do you think is the best recording artist or group of the past 10 years?

[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.300]
Lincoln Park 5, Beyonce 5.

[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:43.080]
Coldplay 3, Overellavine 3, Kid Rock 3, Outcast 2, Nellie Prattato 1.

[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.760]
Just like Overellavine, Canadian 8, System of the Down 1, Le Biscuit 1.

[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.180]
I totally get one and Sean Paul 1.

[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.400]
RuPaul don't have any yet.

[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.960]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a year.

[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:59.460]
We'll build up a good list here okay and then I can get up to my appointed grounds and rounds.

[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.760]
Then of course they can fact some in and they are.

[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.200]
And they are.

[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.140]
Stone-tabled pilots that's a good choice.

[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.340]
You don't like stone-tabled pilots like I'm just fine.

[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.840]
What are you some kind of anti-Somantic?

[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.780]
I would never say that.

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.060]
WQA and hello.

[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.340]
Hey Neil.

[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.060]
Yes sir.

[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:15.800]
How are you?

[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:16.680]
Pretty good.

[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:17.100]
How are you doing?

[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.860]
I'm expecting the answering of the telephone you'd call me for a loop.

[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:26.260]
So okay the season started and it was like an okay year for the Bruins and then they go into their slump and they think it's usual.

[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.900]
And I check the papers if they want like 5 or 6 in a row they have them like 8 or whatever.

[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.540]
They're right on the list.

[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.240]
Oh he's fast now.

[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.680]
Yeah we're only right on the right one point behind.

[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.740]
So I would like to nominate Pearl Jam.

[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:37.860]
Okay.

[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.040]
Eric, take care.

[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:39.640]
See you.

[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:39.840]
What?

[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.020]
Pearl Jam.

[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:41.940]
Last 10 years.

[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:42.800]
Okay.

[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.900]
What about Jimmy Hendrix?

[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:49.340]
Yeah.

[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:49.900]
You too.

[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.600]
What about Chicago?

[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:53.800]
Yeah.

[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.480]
What about Mozart?

[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:55.960]
What about Beethoven?

[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:56.780]
What about Bach?

[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.520]
List.

[00:30:59.420 --> 00:30:59.720]
List.

[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.080]
Lons.

[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.240]
Did Bach speak with a list?

[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.820]
WQA and hello.

[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:03.180]

[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.360]
Hello Neil.

[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.040]
Yes?

[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.340]
How are you doing?

[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.000]
Okay.

[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.620]
How about Dave Matthews?

[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.420]
Dave Matthews band.

[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.060]
Yeah.

[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.420]
I'm so sorry you said that.

[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:12.680]
Okay.

[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.700]
There are a lot of votes.

[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.000]
Thanks.

[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:14.640]
They ought to be.

[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.280]
See.

[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.380]
They ought to be what?

[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:16.720]
Band.

[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.860]
Band in Boston.

[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.120]
Where's the idea?

[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.200]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.720]
Found 5, 60.

[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.620]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.200]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.740]
We're getting hits up the ass.

[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.640]
Yeah.

[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:32.840]
Can I say that?

[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:33.420]
No.

[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.120]
Well no we certainly are on our website.

[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.680]
I'm talking about we're getting hits up the ass because we got so much stuff on there today.

[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.840]
Unexpectedly too.

[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.660]
I have a thank you.

[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.920]
Do you want to thank for that, um, for the, uh, senior cruise thing?

[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:44.920]
Albert.

[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.240]
Thanks Albert.

[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.440]
I bet people who want to thank for the Howard Dean and Janet thing where he'd like his Eric.

[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.360]
Just squeezing it.

[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.060]
Oh, Eric did that.

[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:52.340]
See?

[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.020]
Wow.

[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.040]
Nice job Eric.

[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.280]
Man.

[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.260]
Hey, offspring.

[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.080]
The video just started.

[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.700]
Are they more than 10 years old?

[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:01.820]
Yeah, they guess they're.

[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:02.300]
Yes.

[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.020]
Oh look at that.

[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.160]
We're just, we may even break the Janet Jackson records today.

[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.700]
Maybe not, but it just going nuts.

[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.260]
Somebody QA him.

[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:10.480]
Hello.

[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:11.320]
Hey, Neil.

[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:11.880]
How are you doing?

[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:12.560]
Pretty good sir.

[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.060]
I got some news for you sir.

[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:14.780]
Okay.

[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.300]
Okay.

[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.640]
The other day I came home from work and got a 14 year old daughter.

[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.720]
She was on the internet right?

[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.440]
And I get home and I say a bit sweet because you get on, um, Neil Rogers.com.

[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.460]
I want to see something about a bullet you got right?

[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.180]
Mm hmm.

[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.960]
And boom, I'll pop this, um, read my lips no more bush little bit.

[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:29.680]
Right.

[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.020]
And she like froze and looked at me like, you know, and this is me.

[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.760]
I was like, I don't worry about it.

[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.560]
Just a little, you know, smooth spot.

[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.160]
That's all in there.

[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.600]
Okay, poster.

[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.040]
Yeah, she freaked out that I really didn't, you know, say anything.

[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.500]
So she told all her friends now all of Miami Beach, China.

[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:43.780]
Hi.

[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.660]

Thanks for the fun man we needed.

[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.800]

[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:55.700]

Yeah, the last 10 years.

[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.960]
Luis just turned 70 by the way.

[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.020]
And he's got a big fat ass.

[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.740]

It's Super Bowl 38 showing some pig-scan.

[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:03.260]
You will see all the games highlights and long-likes, like Justin Timberlake's personal foul on Janet Jackson.

[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.040]
Oh, there he is! That's gotta be illegal. You can have hands home, man.

[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.200]
When you order Super Bowl 38, show in some pig-scan. You'll also get...

[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.300]
No, what's this? A striker! Oh, duck-head!

[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.720]
I've never seen him hit around like that.

[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.420]
Sports Curitator brings you a game for the ages.

[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.020]
But not all ages. Every truffle sweat, every bit of hot action, every tight end.

[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.620]

[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.500]
Sports Curitator Super Bowl 38 showing some pig-scan.

[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.580]
We put the triple X in Super Bowl XXX-VII.

[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.860]
So here's a fact from Scott in New York who says a couple of bands to end of the pool.

[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.360]
The pool fighters which I love.

[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.980]
And Queens of the Stone Age. And it also says in Peach Bush now, Amen!

[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.160]
Pist off and listening online to New York. Thanks, Scott.

[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.280]
Also you can go on our website as if we don't already have enough on here for you.

[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.500]
And we have that thing that move on.org thing.

[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.780]
Yes. And you can click on it and get all the info.

[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.240]
The one that says he knew.

[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.760]
Of course he didn't know much and he still don't know much.

[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:45.440]
He knew. Center the president and you click on it and it links you all the way to the move of center bush campaign move on.org.

[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.740]
It's pretty damn impressive.

[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.800]
I'll tell you one thing. Josh has certainly turned our website around.

[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.820]
I mean Eric. Just a joke Eric. Just relax.

[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.380]
Okay. Put down a guy named Baloney in the peanut butter sandwich.

[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.340]
J.M. says after seeing their Grammy performance and others.

[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.340]
White stripes is very, very good. White stripes.

[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.500]
Yeah. Whatever.

[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.480]
Well, no, see I would know a lot more of these groups.

[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.040]
But when you're in South Florida, there's nowhere to listen to music.

[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.020]
Do you hear any real music?

[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:13.860]
This is true.

[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.000]
But when I had my satellite dish in Europe, I knew all of the music.

[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.420]
I mean every group that was ever born because I had like a hundred different music channels.

[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.640]
See what I'm saying?

[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.040]
But if you don't see it, if you don't hear it, how do you know it?

[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:28.660]
Right?

[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:29.400]
Right.

[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:29.680]
Good point.

[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.840]
You can all have guns to make discs for you like some of us did.

[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:33.420]
I see.

[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.060]
Yeah.

[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.340]
Yeah.

[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.020]
Yeah.

[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:36.700]
Yeah.

[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.260]
Oh my God.

[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.360]
Yeah.

[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.900]
Well John makes all kinds of discs about European music.

[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.120]
For me, I put in a car and I listened to it and I love a lot of it.

[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.380]
But who down those, whoever saw it, see, unless you see the videos.

[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:47.700]

[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:48.960]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:49.380]
Right.

[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.760]
Nora Jones, somebody says it's a little mellow for my taste, but still outstanding.

[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.600]
Says Frank.

[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.560]
Fifteen year listener.

[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.180]
Thank you, Frank.

[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:57.780]
Nora Jones.

[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.040]
You ever stole a freight train?

[00:37:59.240 --> 00:37:59.880]
Five votes already.

[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:01.760]
Does she really?

[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.660]
She really does.

[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.880]
What about Grace Jones?

[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:04.580]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.840]
Rick says, good morning.

[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.820]
Let the Republicans keep.

[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.180]
Look at this.

[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:09.720]
Exchore.

[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.200]
Anything you meant excoriating Rick?

[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.540]
The president of one of the biggest corporate contributors to the Republican party, talk about

[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.500]
shooting yourself in the foot.

[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.020]
Viacom can pull all their money and give it to the Democrats.

[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.900]
I'll bet you a million dollars that the bitch that was filming at the mouth will not run

[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.260]
against again as a Republican.

[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.940]
They'll find her a nice little office job in Iceland as the assistant to the assistant secretary.

[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.340]
You won't hear from her no moe.

[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.300]
Don't want to be a chronic pastor, but no one has brought out this point.

[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.000]
Oh, now you have Rick, whatever you're talking about.

[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.940]
He must be talking about that bitch from New Mexico, the one that was just hyperventilating

[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.120]
it.

[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.440]
And what you did, and you knew it, you knew it, and you put this on anyway, and all you

[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:51.860]
care about is ratings, and you've taken money and fattening up your wallet, not like

[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.080]
them.

[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.820]
And she was quavering and shaking and filming at the mouth and other body parts.

[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.020]
It was incredible.

[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.120]
All over that.

[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.660]
I mean, grow up America, please.

[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.400]
The darkness.

[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:13.760]
Put them on there.

[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:14.960]
Yeah, please.

[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.020]
We were just talking about the room.

[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:16.240]
Great.

[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.260]
See, that's because I'm watching much music, which I know this is an incredible concept,

[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.260]
but they actually show videos.

[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.580]
We don't get much music down here.

[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.100]
Put it here.

[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:27.360]
You can see it on.

[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.200]
In fact, what do you got?

[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.700]
You got MTV and MTV 2.

[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.120]
And what else?

[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:32.980]
VH4.

[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:33.760]
Oh, I hate it.

[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.200]
Wait, sometimes has some good shows and retro stuff, but that's retro.

[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.420]
Yes, and an old stuff like that.

[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:38.520]
Right.

[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.280]
Like the four seasons, stuff like that.

[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:48.540]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, six, eight, oh, and before we go on, reality TV could have

[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.980]
sung to a new low, literally and figuratively, with a new dating show for dwarves.

[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.340]
Over to dwarf.

[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.080]
Hey, they need to date too.

[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.860]
The littlest room features lonely Glen Foster, a self-styled ladies man who is four foot

[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.720]
five inches tall.

[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.260]
He's a little shorty.

[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.140]
That's twice my height.

[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:08.160]
The diminutive celebrity has to be has to find a wife from 12-pint size women.

[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.060]
Tall slim blonde British TV.

[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.040]
This is from the, this is London magazine.

[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.180]
Tall slim blonde British TV presenter Danny Beer will power over the cast to do a snow-white

[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.160]
act as the hostess.

[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.160]
Viewers could be glued to their sets as 23 year old Foster goes on a series of dates and

[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.360]
there was the field where short list of five a short list.

[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.160]
Get it?

[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.380]
Several women of normal height will then be introduced to the show.

[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.640]
Foster will have to choose the woman he's most compatible with for the grand finale.

[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.680]
Well, you can show them how it's done because you have to get on a high cherry and when

[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.660]
they bring in the normal women like you have a climbing gear with your 10 foot tall wife.

[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:42.900]
He turns right the show from America's Fox Network has already run into trouble with

[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.200]
the critics.

[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.980]
Reality TV pundits Steve Rogers accused the broadcaster of sinking low with the project.

[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.600]
So to speak.

[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.180]
Wait, wait, a reality TV pundit.

[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.500]
That's a, that's a job.

[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.200]
Right.

[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:54.600]
Of course.

[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.980]
Well, how many reality shows we got on this week?

[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.980]
About 30 minutes.

[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:00.780]
The New York Daily News had it think you've seen it all with reality shows.

[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.380]
Wait till the littlest room.

[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.140]
This show gives new meaning to a mini series.

[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.280]
The show is scheduled to be screened in the west the next two weeks.

[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.640]
Ready for it?

[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.040]
Sure.

[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:11.360]

[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.580]
In fact, maybe we can have a hottest, the dwarf couple contest one of these days.

[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.060]
What do you say?

[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.580]
Let's go.

[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.460]
WDQAM line nine.

[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.220]
Hello.

[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:22.900]
Daniel.

[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:23.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.660]
I'd like to nominate Eminem for your poll.

[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:26.560]
Okay.

[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.460]
All right.

[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.180]
Thanks, pal.

[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.240]
See I need my word.

[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:30.320]
Eminem.

[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.880]
Not the candy, but the, uh, asshole.

[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:33.740]
I mean, the, uh, rapper.

[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.360]
He just, uh, I mean, the guy likes it.

[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.360]
There are a lot of people that like him.

[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.120]
I don't know why.

[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:40.780]
That's why.

[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.180]
Is that why it is?

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:42.540]
Sure.

[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.360]
He just, uh, give me the creeps.

[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.560]
But it's not a question of what I like or what you like.

[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.300]
It's a question of what they like, right?

[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.080]
See, see, that's the one thing about the show.

[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.740]
It's still the democratic process, which is why we take the poll so that you folks can

[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.420]
tell us what you like and what you can't stand things like that.

[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.320]
Even if it's us that you can't stand, we don't care.

[00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.140]
We're still getting the money.

[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.920]
Unlike your rose who's working for free.

[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.500]
I still can't get over that.

[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.460]
How you like that music?

[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.540]
Uh, on TV.

[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.260]
Well, I guess after these hearings finish, we won't be able to have that no more.

[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:22.920]
Only Bible music because, uh, and Jesus music, only approved Jesus.

[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.720]
Jesus loves me.

[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.360]
Yes, he does.

[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.340]
So take off the prohibitive because she's the buzz.

[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.560]
Anyway, ex-offices as Bush's file details cause concern.

[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.980]
I got a whole bunch of stuff on that.

[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:33.960]
Do we want to talk about that?

[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:34.920]
Well, maybe a little later.

[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.140]
Steroids indictment slightly.

[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:39.500]
Very bonds trainer.

[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.060]
He's in big.

[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.980]
He's in deep crap.

[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.620]
Bible lessons, these clergy forgot.

[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.280]
Oh, this is it.

[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:44.920]
Don't let me forget.

[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.740]
Maybe I'll save the Michael Jackson and Vanity Fair thing for tomorrow.

[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.060]
Or I'll just read a little bit of it today cause I this rare article by Derek Z Jackson

[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.040]
who writes for the Boston Globe.

[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.820]
It's just too good to pass over.

[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.340]
He said, Passover.

[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.200]
Sorry.

[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.200]
Bible lessons, these clergy forgot.

[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.160]
Of course, they're having a big history and Boston now about the gay marriage thing.

[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.060]
And what a lot of people don't seem to understand is it doesn't really make any difference

[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:13.260]
what the Massachusetts legislature does because the state supreme court there's already

[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:18.960]
said that civil unions calling it other names, calling it hey, pali, then they're going

[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.460]
to cut it.

[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.100]
Call it Fred.

[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:20.940]
Right.

[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.300]
And that's not going to cut it.

[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.720]
And then nothing short of equal marriage rights is going to.

[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.360]
So they can pass all the laws they want.

[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.540]
They can have all those crazy, Bible, thumb, and idiots out there.

[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.760]
I was reading a one article about how a lot of these people are like falling on the ground

[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:39.160]
with their hands praying to God, you know, all these religious nuts about how Sodom

[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.600]
and Gamori is going to come back.

[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.240]
And I was thinking of Edna Wallace on Passons, you know, oh, angels, she's always falling

[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.660]
on the floor, you know, putting her hands together.

[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.480]
Oh, angels, yeah.

[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:48.820]
And of course, she's a crazy person.

[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.640]
So you see the connection there, religious, not crazy person, same people.

[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.060]
Redundant.

[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:54.760]
Right.

[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:56.460]
WQA, hello.

[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.120]
Hey, what's going on?

[00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.020]
How are you doing, pali?

[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.120]
I'm doing okay.

[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.060]
Well, I love you.

[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.660]
You pick me up, but I'm standing here.

[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.580]
I got something very actual.

[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.320]
Go ahead.

[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.400]
You know, it's really a fighting to me.

[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.820]
But all that's going on in the world right now is all this stuff about the Janet Jackson

[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.980]
and this cultural war we're going to get into.

[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:13.280]
Right.

[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.880]
A democratic candidate's are running for cover.

[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.400]
You know, they're not talking about it.

[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.340]
They don't want to bring it up.

[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.900]
They're just afraid of the Christian crazies of the Republicans are.

[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.820]
You know, no one has got the balls to stand up.

[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.760]
Anyway, you only people have the balls to do it.

[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.140]
Are people like Michael Moore who are running for public office?

[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.080]
And why not?

[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.840]
That's a good question.

[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.940]
Why won't you run for office?

[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.180]
You know, why won't those people like the Ed Alonaires and the Michael Moore's?

[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.820]
Why don't they stand up and put their beliefs out there and run for freaking office?

[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.100]
They run their mouth, but they don't do anything about it.

[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.420]
Yeah, but you didn't realize what they would do to Michael Moore in 10 seconds, man.

[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.640]
They would just discredit him and all while he said this and he said that he's just

[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.300]
he's too easy too far over the end.

[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.840]
Now listen, he's way too far over the edge for mainstream America at this point.

[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.140]
Yeah, but you know what?

[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.400]
But that's a certain level of that.

[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:58.420]
That's a lot of that.

[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.260]
Okay, just because I'm the religious fund, I agree with you.

[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.780]
He is not over the edge on that part, but I'm some of the other beliefs.

[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.600]
Yeah, he's over the edge.

[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.480]
But the bottom line.

[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.000]
America's not ready for Michael Moore yet.

[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.980]
I sure is how land and you are, but America's not.

[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:14.960]
Well, the problem is, is not so much the aspect of what Michael Moore believes, as far as

[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.040]
his religious beliefs, okay.

[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.800]
And it's overall picture.

[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:24.320]
It's a part of the conservative party, you know, in this whole country is based on this.

[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.000]
You know, we're still, so I can't believe how, you know, we really are, the country,

[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.120]
when this whole thing happens, how it's going to work.

[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:35.820]
You would have thought that a couple had intercourse on the stage in the middle of the

[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:40.980]
Super Bowl, and that CBS kept focusing on it and then promoted it for repeat next Sunday.

[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.980]
I mean, the hysteria is unbelievable.

[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:43.780]
It's scary.

[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.880]
And I like to say, I consider myself to be conservative when it comes to my political

[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.820]
beliefs, but the problem is, is that when stuff like this happens, you go look and say,

[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.360]
oh my god, I got to get out of this party.

[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.440]
I need to load some more help.

[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.120]
There's no way to run through, because they always stuck into it.

[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.400]
Well, let me know when you find one.

[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.880]
Good luck to us, Pali.

[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.300]
10.57 at 5.60 QAM.

[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:09.880]
My and Lord, this is the fourth real fight city of QAM.

[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.780]
I can't show those pictures of Hitler flying over the crowd.

[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.860]
I'll show you all the way.

[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:29.940]
We are.

[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.140]
You burn me like my strength.

[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.680]
I'm a kind of.

[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.780]
You know what he said of the crowd?

[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.040]
You understand the stupe of his track of everyone.

[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.480]
Roll another plot.

[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.520]
Oh my god.

[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:14.360]
I was going to clean my room until I got out.

[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.640]
I was going to get up and find the broom, but then I got out.

[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.280]
Oh my god.

[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.420]
You messed up.

[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:25.920]
And I know why.

[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.280]
Why?

[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:26.500]
You know what?

[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:26.500]

[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.000]
You know what?

[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.000]

[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.000]

[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:31.600]
You messed up.

[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:37.360]
I was going to go to class before I got out.

[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:38.280]
Come on, young.

[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.700]
I could've cheated and I could've passed.

[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.320]
But I got out.

[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.540]
I'm taking a big semester.

[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:48.840]
And I know why.

[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.860]
Because I got out.

[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.420]
Because I got out.

[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.520]
I was going to go to court before I got out.

[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.700]
I was going to pay my child support.

[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.260]
But then I got out.

[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:06.980]
No you ain't.

[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.800]
I'm going to pay my child support.

[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:10.880]

Because I got out.

[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.900]
Because I got out.

[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.140]
I wasn't going to run from the cops.

[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:32.980]
But I was out.

[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.120]
And I know why.

[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.980]

[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.420]
I was going to get out.

[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.760]
Now I'm jacked up.

[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:58.280]
And I know why.

[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.840]
Because I got out.

[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:03.940]
Because I got out.

[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:04.960]
Because I got out.

[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.940]
Because I got out.

[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.180]
Because I got out.

[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.500]
I lost my keys.

[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.720]
Because I got out.

[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.980]
Now I'm sleeping on the sidewalk.

[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.520]
And I know why.

[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.340]
Because I got out.

[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.040]

[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.500]
I'm going to stop singing this song.

[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.940]
Because I'm high.

[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.160]
And if I don't sell one copy.

[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.060]
I'm a wild one.

[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.320]
Because I'm high.

[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.740]
Because I'm high.

[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.040]
And you're like that man.

[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.700]
That's how I was watching Megalomania.

[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:03.840]
It was awesome.

[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.200]
That's how I was watching Megalomania.

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:08.240]

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:19.400]
ilation of her.

[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.560]
It was amazing.

[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:21.920]
I had a shows on my underwear.

[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:21.940]
Carrying someone.

[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:22.020]
Or maybe she could be like her who would not come over,

[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:26.720]
I see Andy says you mentioned Afro man earlier haven't played him in a while

[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:30.740]
That's why I just played him says I hope that's another band bit not yet, but wait till tomorrow Andy

[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:36.760]
Right everything's gonna be banned. I don't know what it's gonna take. I think there's gonna be a revolution in America

[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.480]
I really think so Jefferson said there was gonna have to be

[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.300]
Who's the best recording artist or group of the past 10 years?

[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:54.260]
That's what we're axing today on the orages.com. Dave Matthews band unfortunately is leading 24

[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.320]
I said they get a lot of votes and they are outcast second place unfortunately with 19

[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:06.180]
I'll stone-table pilots 10 Lincoln Park 10 Nora Jones 9 the food fighter 7 Beyonce's got 7 big ones

[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:12.600]
Coldplay 7 kid rock 6 M&M 6 Av Avrilovine 5. I love Avrilovine

[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:17.620]
She's not a great singer, but she's a great entertainer. So yeah, I like her. She's got two songs

[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.500]
Sean Paul 3 Nelly Furtado 3

[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.240]
System of a down 3 lib biscuit 3

[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.720]
Now that's not how you used to say name it a group, but I don't think I'm gonna say it in a moment like

[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:29.740]
Train

[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:40.000]
Train 1 and no votes yet for disturbed Queens of the Stone Age the white stripes that dark this incubus or Chennai 20 out of 128

[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:46.800]
Somebody says dream theater. Okay, all top graduates of Berkeley School of Music unlike most others on your list of rely on gimmicks and looks

[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.020]
Dream Theater

[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.080]
Elmer says they probably won't get any votes

[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:58.200]
But the best band to come out the past 10 years is interpool. Are you making groaning sounds? I was doing Elmer because you said Elmer says oh

[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.420]
What a dwarf

[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.820]
George would probably enjoy them. They've been compared to past greats like joy division in velvet underground very big in New York City in Europe

[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.680]
But for the most part in America of course they remain fairly obscure

[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:13.660]
But what do you expect from a country you believe just in Tinkerbell as a talented recording artist excellent point Elmer

[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:18.140]
Excellent outstanding and now the fact that just absolutely tickles my rectum

[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:25.160]
Raccoon is just amazing. This has to be a joke doesn't it say it's a joke a although it's from a hospital and maybe it's a mental hospital

[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.700]
It says the best recording artist for the past 10 years is Celine Dion

[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:38.660]
Let's put on your okay. Let's put that nasty bitch on there Celine Dion even though she's been around for like 30 years

[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.340]
She has sure come on look her

[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:47.220]
Celine Dion she was doing hits in French like since 1950 she was doing hits. Yeah

[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.660]
No, not Celine Dion

[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:54.860]
Okay, I hope you're right because I just buys that

[00:52:54.860 --> 00:53:01.340]
In fact, I don't know anybody who likes her. They're actually here in Canada. She's where she's from everybody

[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.480]
Let's see you're right 91. She don't qualify

[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:10.500]
Thank God

[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:14.580]

Get a whole lot of stuff in.

[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.340]
Why not?

[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:45.740]
I'll give you a clue who we left out.

[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.740]
I know you like this group.

[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.480]
Oh, it's cold.

[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:55.860]
You and me baby doing it like in Wisconsin and please don't tell anyone that I am their cousin.

[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:01.680]
You and me baby let's do it like the Kennedys.

[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.900]
I'll drown you in my new life.

[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.700]
Buried your club back to me.

[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:15.120]
You and me baby, do it like Madonna and have a Latino gang bang if you wanna.

[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.560]
What the hell is it?

[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.340]
It's Britney, she's a toxic.

[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:44.520]
She's not only toxic, she's just about naked.

[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.000]
You have a penis video?

[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:47.940]
No, that yeah.

[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.740]
That would be a sob with a border.

[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.720]
Set your alarm for 1 a.m.

[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:53.460]
Alright.

[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.500]
I think toxic qualifies to get Britney on her even though she can't sing for Christmas.

[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:20.780]
But if she can sing for her, she can sing for her.

[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.780]
You haven't seen this video in a while.

[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.580]
Where will you see it?

[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:34.140]
She is wearing nothing.

[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.480]
My favorite.

[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.340]
She's wearing silver glitz on her body.

[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.280]
Like a little glitz and then some glitz on her.

[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.940]
No rhymes with glitz.

[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.100]
Give me bits.

[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.580]
Schmitz.

[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.580]
Oh right.

[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:54.740]
I think I need to take a few.

[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.880]
And anyway, even I'm amazed by that.

[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.880]
It's 1121 at 560 WDQM.

[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.360]
You watch CNN in case the world starts falling apart.

[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.380]
I'm gonna watch all the video.

[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:11.300]
There are a limited dates.

[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:11.820]
Pequini Week.

[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.120]
Shriver request has some teed off.

[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.680]
I noticed the anxious Michael Mayo, my close personal friend, Michael Améo-Vitz, whatever his name is.

[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.420]
Wrote a column about this this morning.

[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:25.640]
If you work for the Broward County Public Defenders Office, your investment options include the career of your boss's golf teacher.

[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:34.400]
Public defender Al Shriver is asking his 167 lawyers, clerks, secretaries, investigators and other employees to invest in the future of his daughter's boyfriend.

[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:41.000]
Craig Pauling by helping him to pay to play in the National Golf Association Hooters Pro Golf Tour.

[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.180]
Speaking of Hooters.

[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.900]
Pauling was also helping Shriver polish his game as well known would be golf champion, whose plate on the golf channel showed the big break.

[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:58.120]
In an email message sent to his staff last week, Shriver asked for a minimum of $100 from each employee and is seeking a total of 50 grand to help keep Pauling on the road for a year.

[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.300]
He signed the message, the boss man.

[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.720]
Shriver denied that he was forcing his employees to give Pauling money.

[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:09.360]
I'm doing nothing wrong. I told everybody if you want to participate fine, if you don't find again, Shriver said,

[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.160]
have you with as an investment because he would be inclined to share any winnings?

[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:13.480]
Shriver!

[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:14.340]
Wow.

[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.220]
Here's what I'm going to do with the Michael Jackson thing.

[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.620]
Let me take a couple of more calls quick.

[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:25.580]
And I'm going to read a section at a time. It's just too long and vanity fair, but you've got to hear it.

[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.820]
I trust me.

[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:27.200]

[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.180]
Hello.

[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:30.200]
Yes sir.

[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.100]
Yes, is this not WID?

[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:33.740]
W-O-F.

[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.160]
All right.

[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:36.800]
What's your McCall?

[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.120]
Two stone temple piles need to come off.

[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.000]
They're two old.

[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:41.320]
They're two old?

[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.700]
Yeah, they're two old.

[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:46.740]
I think they're like 92, 93.

[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.660]
Oh, crap.

[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:48.540]
Yeah.

[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.060]
And my boat would be for poison the well.

[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:53.840]
Poison the well?

[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.820]
Poison the well.

[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.680]
That's what I just said. Poison the well?

[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:58.620]
That's correct.

[01:04:58.620 --> 01:04:59.680]
Okay, thanks, Pally.

[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:00.720]
Thank you, bud.

[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:01.420]
Okay.

[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.860]
See, you've got to take off those two stone temple piles.

[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:04.240]
Take it off.

[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.200]
Huh?

[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.560]
We're taking them off.

[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:07.380]
Take them off.

[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.800]
Take them off there. This guy knows this crap. That's pretty obvious.

[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.100]
He knows this is W-O-D.

[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.120]
That's right.

[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:13.400]
Oh.

[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:14.760]
They're all outing.

[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.100]
They're all in great.

[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.360]
Michael Jackson's favorite band, Boys in the Well.

[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:18.800]
I see.

[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.300]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.180]
Yes sir.

[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.160]
Shakira.

[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.000]
Shakira is great.

[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:26.780]
We love Shakira.

[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.160]
Oh, man.

[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.000]
Oh, lover.

[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.880]
See, even I'm obsessed with it long before you ever heard of Shakira.

[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:33.680]
That's the true.

[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.460]
That is true.

[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.220]
No, that's right.

[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.780]
You like to stuff that wasn't big hit.

[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:38.880]
That's right.

[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:39.500]
You like to finish?

[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:42.300]
I had bought both her Spanish language records because I was so obsessed.

[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:42.880]
See.

[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:43.740]
Okay.

[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.520]
Anyway, can I have better do it now?

[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.600]
Michael Jackson refers to white wine as Jesus' juice and red wine as Jesus' blood.

[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.100]
He refers to the, he prefers the juice and usually drinks out of soda cans so that nobody

[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.660]
will know he's consuming booze.

[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:02.480]
In and out of rehab over the years, traditions to demoral and morphine, the King of Pop also

[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.460]
habitually gulp down soda cans of wine, especially when he was on airplanes.

[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:12.560]
On a flight to Frankfurt in 1999, for example, his former business advisor, Myeonghul Lee, who

[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.220]
was accompanying him, had to help the staggering Jackson stand up to get off the plane.

[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.720]
He was lying on the floor by the time we landed.

[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.460]
Lee says, I told security, can't get drunk like that on white wine.

[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.980]
And the security people said that it's not only wine, but that it takes pills with it.

[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:31.240]
The incident may be telling because in January, Michael Jackson was arraigned on seven counts

[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.540]
of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent with intent to commit

[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:40.260]
a felony between February 7th and March 10th of last year at Neverland, his 2700 acre

[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:43.840]
ranch near Santa Barbara, which he's converted into a mini Disney land for kids.

[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:49.140]
The boy in question in the case of cancer victim who was 13 at the time alleges that Jackson

[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:53.660]
gave him wine in Coke cans on a flight from Florida in February 2003, running under the

[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.240]
nose of the boy's unsuspecting mother.

[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.260]
The boy knows Jackson's name is for white red and white wine, which Lee says only his

[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:04.480]
inner people know, adding that it tells you the boy spent quality time with Michael.

[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.500]
The boy in his siblings, however, said that all the kids around Michael knew about Jesus

[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:12.000]
juice and that he told them Jesus drank it so it must be good.

[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.940]
Lee says he's not surprised at the boy's allegations.

[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:19.020]
Lee was with Jackson in Tokyo in 1998 when Jackson announced with the great fanfare

[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:23.380]
a new venture with a Japanese consortium to open three theme parks and a chain of stores

[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.120]
called Wonder World of Toys that would stretch across Japan.

[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.620]
The project failed almost immediately, according to Lee, because of what happened to the 13-year-old

[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.200]
son of what won a Jackson's Japanese partners.

[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.240]
During this time, Michael took the boy to a theme park one evening.

[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.680]
One of Jackson's people gave Michael three cans, soda cans full of Jesus juice.

[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:46.000]
Later that evening, the boy became sick, security informed me that he appeared drunk when

[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.780]
he came back and his father was very upset.

[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:52.160]
In the current case, the trip to Boyne's family made a Florida coincided with the

[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.460]
earring of the British documentary on ABC last year, in which Jackson now 45 told interview

[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.680]
or Martin Bashir that there was nothing wrong with sharing his bed with little boys.

[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:03.820]
It was a very brazen thing for Jackson to admit, given the fact that in Los Angeles in

[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:08.940]
94, he had had to pay $25 million to Jordy Chandler and his family in order to settle a

[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:13.560]
civil suit in which Jordy, then 13, charged that Jackson had masturbated and related him

[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.940]
during their relationship, which ironically also included a trip to Florida.

[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.420]
Similarities in Michael Jackson's motor-sopper and eye between the latest bizarre scandal

[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.600]
and the one that preceded it abound right down to the tactics of intimidation and the

[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.960]
controversial use of the nation of Islam for security.

[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:34.400]
In 1993, our members of the Tufts Out Central LA gangs, including the notorious Bloods,

[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:35.960]
were transported to Neverland.

[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.960]
The employment of these Tufts was said to have sent a strong message to Neverland employees

[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:43.560]
who might have considered cooperating in the Jordy Chandler investigation, not to mention

[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.760]
the subliminal message it gave out to other boys and their families who might have been

[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.800]
thinking of coming forward.

[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:51.820]
When 70 members of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department and DA's office, including

[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:56.340]
a team of forensic experts, invaded Neverland last November 18, while Jackson was in Vegas,

[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.160]
they had already spent five months investigating the child's allegations.

[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.740]
Although Jackson was repeatedly taken by surprise, cops with search moans also went to the

[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.400]
homes and workplaces of Jackson employees and a private investigator named Bradley Miller,

[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.480]
his high-powered and expensive criminal attorney, Mark Garagos, had already been on the case

[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:16.080]
since February, a curiosity in itself since no criminal charges had yet been filed.

[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.760]
And that's enough for right now.

[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.480]
It goes on forever.

[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.540]
It's a, it'll make you puke.

[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.360]
That's all I can tell you.

[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.200]
It'll make you very angry and make you puke and realize that it's all just what you

[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:26.760]
think it is.

[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.580]
28 after 11 at 560 W. Kim don't forget guys Valentine's Day is this Saturday right around

[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:36.940]
the corner.

[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.780]
But you're not given about flowers again this year because man they're dead in no time

[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:41.200]
at all.

[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.060]
So you know if you want to get nothing in return, give flowers a chocolate if you want to

[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.920]
get something good in return, here's the answer for you three words to keep in mind for

[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.540]
Montetti Bear.

[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.040]
Send her a bear gram at work like maybe the lover boy bear, the love bandit bear, the

[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.200]
new All Star Valentine dress like a sports fan.

[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.540]
When it gets there, she'll be completely shocked.

[01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.680]
She'll say, Oh my God.

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.660]
And all of her coworkers will think you're the greatest guy because you said an original

[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.360]
thoughtful gift.

[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.060]
Then maybe she'll give you the gift that you're hoping and praying and Jones in for.

[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.980]
Just call 1-800-829 Bear and a friendly bear council will help you choose the perfect

[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.920]
bear for your Valentine delivered in a free, with a free chocolate in their famous gift

[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.360]
box.

[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:19.080]
It only takes five minutes to order overnight, delivered to the home or office is guaranteed.

[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.420]
I said, orifice again.

[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.220]
I apologize.

[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.640]
Call 1-800-829 Bear or shop online at from Montetti Bear.com.

[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:29.000]
Send your Valentine to Creative Alternative Flowers this year and let me say it again, you

[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:29.820]
still got time.

[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:37.960]
Call 1-800-829 Bear right now and tell them that crusty old Neil told you to call 1-800-829-BEAR.

[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:48.960]
This is the most disgusting program.

[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.500]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:04.960]
You have just wasted your vote again.

[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.680]
Pull the lever for our Dean.

[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.100]
Oi!

[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:20.020]
Carey and at words kicked his butt big time.

[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:25.320]
Love you can't date behind.

[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:29.900]
O Dean's older.

[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:35.200]
I believe his campaign is all done.

[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.500]
Absolutely.

[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:42.720]
Oh, Dean.

[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.240]
Oh, Dean.

[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:58.940]
Oh, he was flying high before I awoke.

[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:04.540]
And then he grabbed that mic and screamed.

[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.340]
That's when he scared everyone away.

[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:18.460]
I think we can forget our Dean.

[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.760]
Yes.

[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.720]
Oh, Dean.

[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:35.860]
Oh, Dean.

[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:42.600]
He's a loser and now so you.

[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.680]
It's 11.30 for a couple more.

[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.980]
I actually watch music that I like.

[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:52.600]
Sam Roberts.

[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:53.940]
He's Canadian, eh?

[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.660]
You don't like Sam Roberts?

[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:56.380]
Who?

[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:58.440]
Oh, my God.

[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.760]
Sam Roberts and what about Nickelback?

[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:03.760]
Okay.

[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.480]
That's spelled NICKELC.

[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.840]
There's a couple more for you.

[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:09.820]
Let's see.

[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.640]
Here's one that says I'm a jury and banana springs.

[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:13.600]
You can fax anytime, Jerry. You're one of the best.

[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.980]
Sorry for faxing two days in a row.

[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.400]
Had I known today's poll was going to be music.

[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.680]
I wouldn't fax yet day about the movies.

[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.660]
I'd like to suggest the counting crows for today's poll.

[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.660]
Their first CD, August and everything after, was released September 2003.

[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.600]
Technically, they aren't in the last 10 years.

[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.080]
It's been 10 years and five months.

[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:29.580]
That's okay.

[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.480]
Let's count the counting crows.

[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.640]
Are we counting the counting crows?

[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.060]
Well, I don't care whether you like them or not, see?

[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.980]
I don't like Dave Matthews' band either, but Dave Matthews' band is kicking in.

[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:42.280]
I know.

[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:43.940]
I might have.

[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:44.720]
And I told you they would.

[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:45.860]
59 votes.

[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.100]
The best recording artist of group of the past 10 years.

[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.500]
I can't believe you never heard of Sam Roberts.

[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:55.640]
They're great.

[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.640]
As he's band 59, outcast 22, MNM17,

Over Levine's got six,

[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.360]
Chennai's got six,

[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:14.540]
All right.

[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.200]
What did she get screwed, huh?

[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.240]
And you would like to have seen it.

[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.900]
Ready for Tano's got six, White Stripes 5,

[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.140]
Shakira's got four, we love Shakira.

[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.000]
Four, we love Shakira.

[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:27.760]
In English.

[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:28.760]
Ah.

[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.380]
Limpus get four, Sean Paul four,

[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:32.660]
System of Down 3,

[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.220]
A Train 3, tool.

[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.560]
I thought we were taking tool off of there.

[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.180]
Let's get rid of that tool.

[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.300]
Inkibus 2, Disturb 2-1,

[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.000]
Darkness 1, Dream Theater 1,

[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.160]
Super Grass. Super Grass.

[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:45.640]
You got any?

[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:47.500]
Yeah, no matter fact.

[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:48.720]
What about Angel Dust?

[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.780]
One, sorry.

[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:50.860]
Enrique Iglesias 1,

[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.760]
And no votes yet for Queens of the Stone Age,

[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.260]
The Bloodhound Gang have none?

[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.360]
Shame on you!

[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.160]
Ah, they just went under.

[01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:57.460]
Poisoned the well,

[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.480]
Sam Roberts and Nickelback just went under two.

[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.580]
Out of 245, St. Roberts.

[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.160]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.900]
Pretty embarrassing when I know a good group

[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.920]
that you never heard of before.

[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.200]
And they're not just big and candid.

[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.940]
Seriously, you're good. I'll wait till I hear them.

[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:14.340]
Okay.

[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.200]
I'm going to have to go out and buy his CD today just to prove it to you.

[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.820]
Okay, great. Not good, great.

[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.700]
Anyway, in fact, the Sam Roberts was at the, you know,

[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.700]
the big Rolling Stones thing we had here last year.

[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.000]
Yeah, last year, last, these SARS-Rick-covered concert?

[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.380]
Correct. He was one of the many, many performers.

[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.520]
Well, you heard some of that.

[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.480]
Okay. Who else was in that?

[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:36.300]
There is.

[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.300]
Well, a whole bunch of people.

[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.340]
Anyway, Mike said, what? Huh?

[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:44.120]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:47.840]
Mike says, have you listened to the magical voice of Josh Groban?

[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.040]
No. Have you?

[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:51.540]
No. Have you ever heard such a voice? Simply magical.

[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.600]
He's saying during the tribute to Columbia Shuttle's astronauts,

[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.520]
proud of the Super Bowl, his album is number one of the Billboard charts.

[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.640]
Mike, Josh Groban.

[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:58.420]
Oh, that is.

[01:15:58.540 --> 01:15:59.200]
That never heard of it.

[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:00.200]
Says Mike.

[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.800]
Well, put him on here. Somebody will know who that is.

[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.540]
Here's Frank who says,

[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.180]
oh, Frank's got a whole bunch of them again.

[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.080]
Shame on you, Frank.

[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.140]
You did bad.

[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.880]
It says it's hard to determine only one, but some of the bands who made a good impact on me recently,

[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:13.760]
three doors down,

[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.520]
Puddle of mud with two D's.

[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:16.700]
Yes.

[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:19.740]
Adema with an A in 70 and pod.

[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:21.780]
Okay.

[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.820]
We're not asking to do.

[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.280]
I know the questions.

[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:26.860]
Who, pod?

[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:27.360]
The pod.

[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:27.760]
The O.D.

[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.480]
Yeah. What does that mean?

[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.740]
Pable upon delivery or on death.

[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:33.840]
Pable on death.

[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:34.800]
Pable on death.

[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.880]
In other words, you'll be accountable to God when you die, Kevin.

[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:39.780]
I see.

[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.640]
Well, we're not going to put no Christian group.

[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:42.920]
We're not going to put them in there.

[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:44.180]
We're going to have something for today.

[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:44.940]
I'm going, am I right?

[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:45.760]
Jesus Christ.

[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:47.220]
Yeah, even he's got to have something on there.

[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.620]
They're big in spite of their foodoo magic.

[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:50.580]
I see.

[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.340]
Okay, we're getting a gigantic list built there from the last 10 years.

[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.700]
Don't be given us any old timers.

[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.620]
Join Joe and Mark tonight, 10 PM to midnight.

[01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.600]
At the Sanbar and a grow stop.

[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.500]
I enjoy $3 becks and becks lights.

[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.200]
Plus you can win tickets and t-shirts.

[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.460]
I take it to what?

[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.860]
Well, you'll find out when you go there.

[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.960]
That's the 10 o'clock tonight to Sanbar and the grow with the lovely Joe and Mark, who are on, of course, 2 to 5 and a.m.

[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.000]
Right here on Q.A.M.

[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.580]
21 till noon.

[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.180]
We got the mad.

[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:14.500]
Let's see.

[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:16.340]
The schedule is a looks pretty pristine to me today.

[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.220]
The mad dog at 2.

[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:20.200]
The Willie Williams show has been postponed until they let him out.

[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.480]
The humprobe on it for Panther preview at 7.

[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.060]
Panthers who won 2 in a row.

[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.840]
I'll tell you, Roberto LaWongo is playing so great.

[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:32.700]
What a shame that nobody in South Florida really appreciates him or hockey or anything else.

[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.360]
And by the way, the rules changes they want to make really sad to me.

[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.440]
It's the most empathetic.

[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:39.880]
Anyway, Penguins at the Panthers should be a Gimme 2 points tonight.

[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:40.860]
Come on, boys.

[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:41.740]
Let's make a 3 in a row.

[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.920]
Although the islanders tied Dallas overtime last night full full.

[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:45.800]
So let's see.

[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.540]
What's the difference now?

[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:47.880]
Is it 9 points?

[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:49.380]
Huh?

[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.680]
61 to 52.

[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.420]
I think the islanders are 9 ahead of the Panthers for that last playoff spot.

[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.560]
Any K-Fall is the hockey game.

[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.700]
Joe and Mark, like I just said, overnight.

[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:02.540]
I am lost.

[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:06.260]
This is sports radio bicycle QAM.

[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.400]
Burnham, with a dramatic reading of No Scrubs by TLC.

[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:13.860]
Dr. Burnham?

[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.480]
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly, also known as a buster.

[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:21.600]
Always talking about what he wants and just sits in his broke ass.

[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.920]
So no, I don't want your number.

[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.760]
No, I don't want to give you mine.

[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.960]
And no, I don't want to meet you nowhere.

[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.620]
No, I don't want none of your time.

[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.240]
And no, I don't want no scrub.

[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.500]
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me.

[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:39.440]
Hang out the passenger side of his best friend's ride, trying to holla at me.

[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:40.720]
No scrub.

[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:41.840]
No scrub.

[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:42.700]
No no.

[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:43.860]
No scrub.

[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.840]
No no no no no.

[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:46.600]
No scrub.

[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:47.340]
No no.

[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:48.720]
No.

[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:48.840]

[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:50.680]
No.

[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.440]
Got some bad news for you.

[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:53.160]
What?

[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:56.560]
Miss Fudge, of course, who would be the one?

[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.060]
Although before he headed, the National Enquire headed on the cover of this week's issue,

[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.900]
which I have a situational issue with what he's talking about.

[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:07.880]
John Kerry's secret life exposed affairs with stars, drug abuse, and plastic surgery.

[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:15.880]
And now, Miss Fudge breathlessly reports with like a screaming police flashing light on the top of his website.

[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:24.600]
Historically, a friendy behind the scene dramas unfolding around Senator Kerry and his quest to lock up the Democratic nomination for president,

[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:32.060]
campaign drama, rocks Democrats, Kerry fights off media probe of regionalized infidelity, rivals predict ruin.

[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:42.560]
You ready for that?

[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:43.500]
No.

[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.680]
In an off the record conversation with a dozen reporters earlier this week's General Westlake Clark,

[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:54.940]
plainly stated, Kerry will implode over an intern issue.

[01:19:55.620 --> 01:20:00.260]
Kerry commotion is why Howard Dean has turned increasingly aggressive against Kerry in recent days,

[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:04.900]
and is the key reason why Dean reversed his decision not to drop out of the race after Wisconsin.

[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.320]
Top campaign sources tell the Fudge Pack report.

[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:17.800]
A serious investigation of the woman in the nature of a relationship with Senator John Kerry has been underway at Time Magazine, ABC News,

[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:23.680]
the Washington Post, and the Associated Press, where the person questioned, in question once worked.

[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:24.640]
Ready for that?

[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:25.620]
No.

[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.240]
So here we go again.

[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.300]
Time to get your passport, boys and girls.

[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:32.940]
Wow.

[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:37.940]
Just breathlessly with lights flashing and with just forming at the mouth.

[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:40.780]
How much did Richard Melonsky pay for this one, baby?

[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:41.260]
Huh?

[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.040]
Just plastering it.

[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.480]
I hope his girlfriend there in New York.

[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.760]
Hope she's really proud of me, you know.

[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.280]
It's like cutting bitch.

[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.000]
Fag-hag.

[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.120]
Yeah, here it isn't the inquiry, like I said, I didn't bother with this.

[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.400]
Should we take a peek at it?

[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.400]
I got some more bad news.

[01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.100]
All of a sudden, you're looking so great.

[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:58.600]
Yeah.

[01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.840]
The fact you just sent me.

[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:00.200]
Yeah.

[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:01.620]
Horrendous News.

[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:06.140]
US Representative Robert Wechler, Democrat of Bucke, filed a lawsuit.

[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:16.100]
Well, his lawsuit seeking to require electronic voting machines to produce a paper trial was this trail was dismissed yesterday when a Palm Beach County judge ruled he did not have standing to sue.

[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:28.700]
He filed a lawsuit against Florida Secretary of State Glen Hood and Palm Beach County Supervisor elections to resell up for the anxious one claiming the use of machines that don't produce paper duplicates of the voter cast violates voter rights.

[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.940]
Without that paper trail, a manual recon isn't possible, but it's argued.

[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:40.920]
But circuit judge Karen Miller ruled yesterday that Wechler didn't have to stand the file suit and since he couldn't prove either as a citizen or public official, he'd been hurt by the voting system.

[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.560]
Wechler's complaints would be better addressed to the legislative remedies.

[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.900]
Her office said.

[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.560]
How do you like that?

[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.100]
I don't.

[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:50.680]
Nauseating.

[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.960]
Let's see, David says couldn't get through yesterday.

[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000]
I want to nominate the elephant man is the most depressing movie ever.

[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:57.500]
Good choice.

[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:57.740]
Yeah.

[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.900]
For today's poll, infectious grooves says David.

[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:01.620]
I got nothing.

[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:06.620]
The best band had less than years easy will co says somebody else Roger.

[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.200]
I beg your pardon.

[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.320]
We got it.

[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.240]
And we're going to help us to John curious of during the next break.

[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.060]
I'm going to have to go through this stuff because evidently it's on it.

[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.100]
It's on the verge of bursting loose now.

[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.920]
Isn't that going to be embarrassing and humiliating?

[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.460]
What do we do now?

[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.560]
What do we do now?

[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:23.780]
Punty.

[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.220]
Loan Ranger.

[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.580]
We drop back ten yards.

[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:28.900]
And I guess we just punt.

[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.360]
That's with the P.

[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.220]
Yeah.

[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:31.600]
The nervous.

[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.640]
Don't turn us in.

[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:34.820]
I said punt with the P.

[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.660]
I can't find the I mean maybe somebody has stolen all out of my inquire.

[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:40.340]
Oh no.

[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.500]
I sure is how I'm not going to go over and oh here it is.

[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:43.140]
Wow.

[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:49.400]
John Kerry's secret life, the plastic surgery, the marijuana used, the affairs with stars.

[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:56.280]
First wife, Julia Thorne admitted she's let a lonely life and contemplated suicide while she was married to Kerry.

[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:02.620]
His conquest allegedly include Dana Delaney, Morgan Fairchild and Catherine Oxenberg and there were many others.

[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:09.020]
John Kerry is so vain that one former girlfriend says he always wanted to make love where he could see himself in the mirror.

[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.160]
That's the telling revelation of a political insider.

[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:21.140]
Spoked that the inquire was part of an in-depth investigation of the Democratic presidential frontrunners colorful and controversial secret life.

[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.960]
While Kerry has worked hard to nurture a straight-air or war hero image,

[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.780]
the inquire probe is uncovered shocking details about the senator.

[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:33.680]
He's an admitted pot smoker with an eye for the ladies and as dated the I just got to tell you who.

[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:38.180]
He fooled anti-vietnam war demonstrators in the thinking he threw away his military medals during a protest.

[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.740]
He's had plastic surgery at least once while who cares.

[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:47.180]
Although his iris sounding name has served him well among his many iris constituents and massachusetts, he's actually from Jewish roots.

[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:47.800]
Uh oh.

[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:48.580]
Oi!

[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:53.360]
Voters will be amazed to know about the real John Kerry said a source in Washington.

[01:23:53.420 --> 01:24:00.920]
He is not all that he appears to be and the political insider was followed Kerry's career for years said he's coming with a lot of baggage.

[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.960]
He's so vain the first time he took Hollywood star Dana Delaney home.

[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:09.200]
His big move was showing her video clips taken of him in the Navy while it was in Vietnam.

[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.760]
She never went out with him again.

[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:18.180]
He dated Morgan Fairchild and Michelle Phillips and they've been both they both donated to other democratic candidates in this year's election.

[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:22.080]
What does that tell you what they think of him now in other words other candidates running against him?

[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.540]
It says Kerry could compete with Bill Clinton as a womanizer.

[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.480]
Well guess what seems to be Clinton won two terms, Danny.

[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:27.820]
Right.

[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:34.800]
Between his two marriages he was notorious for hitting the singles bars in Boston and Washington with a posse of wealthy friends.

[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:43.320]
Even after it was married a gorgeous 22 year old blonde was spotted leaving his Boston townhouse in September 98 while his wife was in then tuck it.

[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.260]
Oh and I got a great line for that but not the way things are going right now but just let it go.

[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:51.760]
Earl says India Ari Ari.

[01:24:52.500 --> 01:25:00.900]
I kind of in the Shade mode folk folk soul don't get a lot of radio play after I think suspected music is too deep and thought provoking for today's studio artist.

[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.660]
I mean studio products is Earl.

[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:04.360]
Okay. Or you got it.

[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.900]
Laura Jay who's a little bit testy about our poll today.

[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.000]
A little bit foaming at the mouth kind of Laura just calm down Laura.

[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:16.980]
Please qualify with this statement means who do you think is the best recording artist or group of the past 10 years?

[01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:18.720]
Is that a complicated question?

[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:19.840]
I understand.

[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.020]
No fairs even lower.

[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.100]
Pardon?

[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.920]
It says I just thought it was music on there was a spot.

[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:29.680]
If you look at billboard you'll see that Celine Dion is one of the top recording artists of the last 10 years.

[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:34.400]
Her career began to pick after her Titanic hit my heart will go on.

[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:40.000]
In 1997 and skyrocketed after that that's what was in the last 10 years.

[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:45.600]
Now if you meant to say who do you think is the best recording artist or group whose career began only in the past 10 years?

[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:46.840]
That's entirely different.

[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.720]
Well of course that's obviously what we meant.

[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:53.720]
See right obvious we shouldn't have had to say who began only last 10 years.

[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.380]
Who do you think is the best recording artist or group of the past 10 years?

[01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:59.320]
That's pretty obvious.

[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.380]
We're talking about newcomers.

[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.080]
We've made reference to that how many times each hour?

[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.060]
About 30 minutes.

[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:04.360]
Laura.

[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.320]
Now if you don't like her that's fine.

[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:07.880]
No I don't like her.

[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:08.780]
I despiser.

[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.220]
I find her nauseating, revolting.

[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:16.060]
She makes me want to get on my hands and knees and all fours and just puke all over the floor several times.

[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.360]
So she says it's your show and you certainly can do whatever you want.

[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:19.880]
Thank you Laura.

[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:24.460]
But I would like to participate and put in one vote even if that's all it is based on how I interpret the original question.

[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:28.600]
But that isn't the question see because there's no one on that list thus far from my would vote.

[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.140]
Well see you Laura.

[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:31.780]
Sorry.

[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.560]
Yeah come back another day and play.

[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.980]
I mean there's no law that says you have to participate in our poll.

[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:38.460]
Now I guess we left out.

[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.040]
I know y'all need some help.

[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.900]
Give me back for the sex you know.

[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:44.040]
I can switch the stuff.

[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.660]
Give me back.

[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:47.040]
Give me back.

[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:47.660]
Give me back.

[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:48.560]
Give me back.

[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:49.080]
Give me back.

[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.240]
Tell the whole world.

[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.120]
The list has nothing to do with it.

[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.440]
We left out destiny's child.

[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.140]
Oh Jay how do we forget to leave it?

[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.060]
I'm always trying.

[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:00.820]
But I mean I'm trying to be fair now since we're putting groups on there that I'm you know that we aren't all that great.

[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.180]
It's not a question who we like.

[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:02.440]
Right.

[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:04.560]
Because who we like the audience don't like anyway.

[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.700]
But that's the answer to how we forgot.

[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:08.000]
Right.

[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.020]
We're trying to forget it was suburbable.

[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.440]
How do you like that carry stuff huh?

[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:14.380]
Carry stuff.

[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.140]
There's a lot of you.

[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:17.060]
No, don't carry.

[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:17.880]
Yeah.

[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.660]
Yeah well we got the daily death report.

[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:21.620]
I don't have time for that.

[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:22.280]
I'll save it for tomorrow.

[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:23.320]
Thanks again, death man.

[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:24.400]
But I'll save that.

[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.440]
There's too much of a too heavy of a plate.

[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.360]
It's like a little buffet and loading it up.

[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:32.540]
And all this care all these strokes.

[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.700]
Adrian says the strokes.

[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:36.780]
Okay.

[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:37.940]
Got the strokes.

[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.400]
You want to see the crew stroke it's he said.

[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.420]
Exposing her nip right on our website there.

[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.540]
And then we got the Howard Dean.

[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:47.540]
So now we're starting to find out what's going on behind the scenes.

[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:51.300]
And now we know why Howard Dean woman he said well I'm going to quit.

[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.360]
And the next man he said not so fast.

[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:54.940]
He got an advanced copy.

[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.260]
Now we're finding out that maybe there's something going on behind the screen.

[01:27:59.460 --> 01:27:59.900]
It's a scene.

[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:00.480]
Yeah.

[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:01.620]
Wow.

[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:05.620]
Isn't this going to be humiliating, embarrassing and degrading.

[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:05.920]
Lovely.

[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.840]
And the way they got to fly you.

[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:08.760]
You have to go.

[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:09.800]
I know you don't want to do it.

[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.080]
But you just have to go to the fudge report.

[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.020]
I don't want to do it.

[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:13.700]
I know.

[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.260]
I want you to do it.

[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:15.980]
I'm not going to do it.

[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:20.580]
Because he is just he's got to be squeezing himself so hard that there's blood spurding.

[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:23.720]
We're all over the day in his bedroom which is probably where he's hanging out.

[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.480]
I don't want to be part of that tally.

[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.920]
No, no, you have to look at it.

[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:27.740]
You must see this.

[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:31.760]
Look at the flashing light like a police light.

[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:32.780]
You know on a cop car.

[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:33.900]
The bubblegum.

[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:35.820]
You see it?

[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:36.960]
Drug report.com.

[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:37.680]
Come on in here.

[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:38.980]
I go campaign drama.

[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.620]
Rocks Democrats carry fights off media.

[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:42.820]
Probe of recent lives in fidelity.

[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:44.220]
Rivals predict ruins.

[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:44.900]
Ruin.

[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.860]
Not just bad news but ruin.

[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:50.300]
Boy.

[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.920]
I'm not getting my bubblegum machine.

[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.020]
You're not?

[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:54.300]
No, it's loading.

[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.440]
It's slow loading.

[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.920]
Oh my god.

[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.380]
Mine popped right up.

[01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.760]
And the website too.

[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.120]
We better rock.

[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:02.720]
Oh, there it is.

[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:03.740]
Does it have audio?

[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.100]
No.

[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.740]
This should have audio.

[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.160]
Boy, what a...

[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.620]
Hey, you got a black and white fudge report.

[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:12.380]
There's color there.

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.480]
Oh yeah, not on the bulb yet.

[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.120]
There's like a little tiny bit of color like somebody peed on it.

[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:17.880]
Or like somebody red.

[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.640]
So you read the link on it.

[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.340]
That's about as colorful as you ever get on that crap website.

[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.280]
Oh, but I had 80 brilliant hits.

[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.340]
Yeah, take a hit of this, Matt.

[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:26.560]
Schmuck.

[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.040]
So there you go.

[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:31.100]
They're rubbing their hands in their legs together like a grasshopper right now.

[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.680]
Seeing that carry is going down.

[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:33.540]
But you know something?

[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.160]
If this all comes about.

[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.820]
If it comes about.

[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.560]
That means that Edwards is going to be the man.

[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:41.220]
Okay.

[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:41.700]
Would you think?

[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:42.380]
I'll take him.

[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.700]
I see a ticket of Edwards and Dick Gabbhard.

[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:49.420]
Or Edwards and West Clark.

[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.080]
Sure.

[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:50.900]
Got it?

[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:51.900]
That sounds good.

[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:52.740]
Not Howard Dean.

[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:53.520]
Howard Dean, I don't care.

[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.240]
He may be trying to salvage himself, but the fact is that long before any of this surface,

[01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:59.840]
he's proven himself to be a real loser and more ways than one.

[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.540]
Plus he's got that me as wife.

[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.480]
Yeah, me as Kate.

[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.480]
Be careful that you say Kate.

[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:05.140]
Yeah, I guess.

[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.500]
Unbelievable, spastic.

[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:11.160]
Steve says, how about adding rascal flats to your pool, they're a country band but they're great.

[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.020]
Well, why the hell not?

[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:13.380]
We didn't say what kind of music, right?

[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:13.480]
Right.

[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:13.960]
Why the hell?

[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:17.380]
We don't want to get Laura all upset against us and other facts, let me just go and put that.

[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:19.120]
I wonder if that's Laura Ingram, you think?

[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:20.500]
Probably.

[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:21.660]
Ah!

[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:25.600]
Steve Urbay, I mean that Dave Matthews band, sorry.

[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:30.280]
What do you think was the best recording artist or group of the past 10 years?

[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:33.580]
We're talking about people that just came to be known in the last 10 years, right?

[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:37.440]
Not people who've been around a hundred years old trolls like Celine Dion, okay?

[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:44.560]
Dave Matthews band 75 Outcast 26 Radiohead 25 M&M 21 Nora Jones 19.

[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.480]
The food fighters, what do they got?

[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:48.000]
19.

[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:55.900]
Should I have 20 19, cool place 16, Lincoln Park 15, kid rock 10, Beyonce 9.

[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:06.800]
Avril Lavigne 7, White Strap 7, Nelly Furtado 6, and it's a single digit down from there.

[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.480]
So what about the Curie thing?

[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.140]
What do we do now?

[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:14.100]
Drop back, drop back to about 15 yards pun.

[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:17.160]
And watch that ball, watch who the balls roll.

[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:27.980]
I mean just psychotic hysterical, the Fudge Report foaming at them out that all body parts spewing all kinds of green ooze out of his...

[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:28.280]
Welcome!

[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:28.840]
Wow.

[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:31.020]
WDQA, hello.

[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.520]
Hey, Leo.

[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:33.320]
Yes sir.

[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:34.980]
Matchbox 20.

[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.680]
Matchbox 20 is a good choice.

[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:37.880]
All right, cool.

[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:38.700]
All right, buddy.

[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:40.040]
Thanks, thanks, Kelly.

[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:42.220]
How come you didn't think of matchbox 20?

[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.220]
I don't know, maybe older than 10 years, but...

[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.380]
Oh, let me look.

[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:45.740]
Yeah.

[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:47.740]
Then run for a long time.

[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.860]
No, get out of here.

[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.020]
You're right here.

[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:50.360]
You're right here.

[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.200]
Imitated and duplicated matchbox 20.

[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:53.420]
And palpitated?

[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.100]
See.

[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:55.600]
How about Gordon Lightfoot?

[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.360]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:58.620]
Oh.

[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:02.180]
Let's see, matchbox, how about Sarah McLaughlin?

[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.440]
There you go.

[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:04.860]
What's wrong with her?

[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:05.500]
Nothing.

[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:07.720]
What's not to like about Sarah McLaughlin?

[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:08.580]
She's Canadian, eh?

[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.420]
I'm beginning to think everybody's Canadian.

[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:13.140]
Oh, the good, too, I guess.

[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:14.160]
All the one?

[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:15.100]
All the good people.

[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:15.980]
Right.

[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:18.020]
There's a few straight people here.

[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.220]
Fuck third, man!

[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:20.700]
Let's see, Dave Matthews' band.

[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:21.500]
Who am I looking for?

[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.000]
That's box 20.

[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.000]
Oh, matchbox 20.

[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:24.940]
No, you're wrong.

[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.680]
They're from Orlando.

[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.400]
Did you know that?

[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:29.220]
No, I didn't.

[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:29.920]
Oh, no!

[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:31.340]
Oh, no!

[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:31.940]
What?

[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.080]
Rob Thomas?

[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:34.220]
Yeah, of course.

[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:35.380]
Is he smooth?

[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:36.440]
He is.

[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.000]
A smoothie.

[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:40.460]
Like I said, bad choice, but they do qualify because in 97.

[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.460]
They had push in 97.

[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:42.980]
All right.

[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.100]
So on they go.

[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.280]
Rob Thomas?

[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:46.960]
Oh my God.

[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:48.100]
I'm so sorry.

[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:48.640]
I said they do.

[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.960]
They don't say his name without saying that.

[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:52.760]
What do you mean by that?

[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.100]
In other words, like when that Santa Aniston came out.

[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.720]
Oh, which meant with matchbox 20s, Rob Thomas?

[01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:58.460]
With Rob Thomas?

[01:35:58.780 --> 01:35:59.180]
Yeah.

[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.520]
If I ever hear that one more time, I'm going to shoot somebody in the foot anyway.

[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:08.320]
5670560, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon.

[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.260]
Wireless line.

[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.340]
WI-L-E-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.400]
WI-L-E-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.420]
WI-L-E-Q-A-M-HELLO.

[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:20.780]
Hello.

[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:21.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:22.600]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:23.160]
Hey, oh.

[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:26.800]
How can I see the four of us right at 91.90?

[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:27.800]
You guys think that one off to?

[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:29.100]
How can I see his old?

[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.160]
Yeah, but they dropped like at 91.

[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:33.860]
Oh my God.

[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:34.760]
Well, that'll be good news.

[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:35.260]
Thanks a lot.

[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.140]
If we get them off of there.

[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:36.600]
Wouldn't that be good?

[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:37.480]
Yeah.

[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.820]
I would be delighted to get them off my list.

[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:42.160]
I like outcast.

[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:43.240]
I don't.

[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:43.600]
I don't.

[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.340]
They get outcast 94.

[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:48.400]
Well, their first hit was 94.

[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.400]
That's 10 years.

[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:49.960]
Leave them on there.

[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:50.140]
Yeah.

[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:54.840]
They may have started diddling around 91, but their first hit was 94.

[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:55.700]
That's what counts.

[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.440]
When they came into prominence.

[01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.260]
When somebody actually heard of them, see what I'm saying?

[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:06.140]
5670560, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless line.

[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:10.200]
Don't forget, join Jo and Mark tonight, 10 PM to midnight, in the San Bar at the Grove

[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:11.740]
period.

[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.620]
Stop out of enjoy $3 best and best lies.

Plus enjoy a chance to win tickets and t-shirts at the 10th of the night, San Bar on the

[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:19.280]
Grove.

[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.680]
I've got so much crap piled up here.

[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:21.740]
I can't even read the stuff.

[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:22.920]
Does anybody care?

[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:23.200]
No.

[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:24.200]
I'll join Mark Mike here.

[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.200]
Come to QA.

[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:25.540]
I'm Hello.

[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.120]
I'll cast 90, come out 94.

[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:29.760]
How big a pardon?

[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:30.780]
I'll cast 90.

[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.020]
I have their first album 94.

[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:32.900]
That's what I just said.

[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:34.520]
Sorry about that.

[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.100]
Okay.

[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:38.800]
56070560.

[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:39.560]
Well, let's see.

[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:42.400]
2004 and 94.

[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.500]
And it was July, by the way, which this is only February last time I checked.

[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:47.360]
Ain't that like right about 10 years?

[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:47.600]
Yeah.

[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:48.000]
Okay.

[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:49.620]
I'm just checking if my math is correct.

[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.560]
I mean, that could be wrong.

[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:53.340]
I'm old in Fibral.

[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:54.440]
Let's see.

[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:54.920]
Pearl Jam.

[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:55.900]
Pearl Jam came out in what?

[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.820]
About 1825.

[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:57.440]
Pearl Jam 2.

[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.120]
Something like that, right?

[01:37:58.540 --> 01:37:59.540]
Raise against the machine.

[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:01.800]
I could not look it up.

[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.260]
You're lucky I got my book here, man.

[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:11.100]
I'm the floor, my 850 pound book and the smashing pumpkins.

[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.040]
How do I speak of the smashing?

[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:14.220]

[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.160]
10 years old, 5th.

[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:15.580]
What is it?

[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.260]
I think they're old.

[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:19.500]
He ever ruck get out of that joint.

[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:21.060]
Did you say joint?

[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:22.420]
Let's see.

[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:23.540]
Oh, Delarice.

[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.340]
Let's get in here on there.

[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:26.800]
I betcha, betcha, what's your name?

[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:27.660]
We'll vote for her.

[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:29.180]
Laura.

[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.420]
Laura Ingraham will vote for Delarice.

[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:34.420]
Although she probably won't because she was dused by an angel.

[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:35.660]
Let's see.

[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.700]
Raise against the machine.

[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.200]
The rascals.

[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:39.860]
The raspberries.

[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:40.800]
Oh, I love the raspberries.

[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:41.180]
Don't you?

[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.540]
Like a little whipped cream on them.

[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.400]
Oh, I mean, raise against the machine is not in my book.

[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:47.700]
How can that be?

[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:49.880]
It means they never had a top 40 hit.

[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:50.900]
Oh, oh, I see.

[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:52.620]
They're just not commercial enough to be in this book.

[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:53.500]
That's how that be.

[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:54.020]
Correct.

[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.640]
Well, you can look them up on the air while I'm doing this.

[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.340]
And so I shall.

[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.460]
So you shall.

[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.180]
I mean, you can sit there on the fudge report.

[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:00.540]
Okay.

[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.060]
And then be packing at the whole tunnel.

[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:02.440]
Oh, man.

[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.060]
I sure hope you got off of that thing real quick.

[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.420]
Backed out of there so fast.

[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.080]
Fashing pumpkins November 94.

[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:08.040]
All right.

[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:08.980]
Okay.

[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.140]
Let's see.

[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:16.520]
Turing keyboardist Jonathan Melvoine, brother of Wendy Moell,

[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:22.120]
a winter princess revolution, died of a hero in overdose on 71296 at the age of 34.

[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.120]
Do you see?

[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:25.540]
A little bit of a problem there.

[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.440]
The sman's pumpkins just a little bit too smashed.

[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:28.900]
I do.

[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:29.660]
I love them a lot.

[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:30.140]
They're great.

[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:41.380]
Now, did you look up raging against the your machine looking down?

[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:46.040]
Well, you know, something I wouldn't blame me if you had raging against that machine because it's so frickin' slow.

[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:46.300]
Yeah.

[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.720]
Well, that's what we got.

[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:48.920]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:50.660]
I'll get before this hour's on.

[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:51.060]
But I want to read.

[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:58.820]
Well, this is going to take me two days to read this whole Michael Jackson thing from this, this month's the March edition, March issue of Vanity Fair.

[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:02.940]
And it'll make you want to puke all over your carpenting, all over your expensive carpenting.

[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.100]
And you can go drive concepts, right?

[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:04.860]
Right.

[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.060]
WQA and hello.

[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:07.720]
Hello.

[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:08.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:10.400]
Yeah, who is this?

[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.480]
This is Neil.

[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:12.000]
Who are you calling?

[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:12.540]
You calling for me?

[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:13.900]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.260]
Hey, I'm going to shoot today.

[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.700]
I'm going to have to agree with Dave Matthews.

[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:19.900]
You agree on what?

[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.660]
I agree that that's the best.

[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:24.420]
Okay.

[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:31.940]
And also, I don't think, I don't agree with, with rage against machines.

[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.440]
Other things like not together anymore?

[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:35.420]
Like what?

[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:37.420]
They're not together anymore.

[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:41.260]
Rage against the machines in the together anymore, George?

[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:42.000]
No, they're not.

[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.540]
No, that's what Johnson is.

[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:49.460]
he joshes on it. So then let's see, muffler, hello. Okay, thanks, pal. It's 92 anyway. Plus it's 92. So guess what?

[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:55.820]
Rage against the machine. They're not together anymore and it was 92. What about band on an almond?

[01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:01.960]
What about it? I'm sorry. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5. What about the call?

[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:09.920]
The video you went in the middle. Hey, yes sir. How about collective soul?

[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:15.460]
Collective soul. Yeah, what do you think? I don't know. Check the date.

[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:24.040]
May I think one year under the line? Under the line? Yeah. They're not going to be in this book anyway.

[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.480]
Yeah, the other way. Okay, thanks, pal. I get lost. Collective soul. Phil Collins. Collective soul. He's

[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:38.200]
he's perfect. He's got a thumb right on him, Annette guy. 6494. Shine. Okay. Okay.

[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:45.300]
She gave it to me by the time and Roy Cohen and gave her Hoover. It's a tremendous past noon at 5 60 WQM.

[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:50.720]
Man, I'd say to this, that carry thing just. It's like it's like we were just on such a role here.

[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:55.840]
You know, in all of a sense, like somebody just like a gigantic balloon, a balloon with a pin.

[01:41:56.220 --> 01:42:00.300]
I guess you're more deflated than I am because what? I was just happy with anybody but bush.

[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:05.000]
No, I understand that, but don't you understand? He's he's 30 points ahead of his passion.

[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.800]
And I started to say before I interrupted myself that if this all pans out, okay?

[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:15.700]
And if this all blows up in his post, at least better than we find out now, it's only right as opposed to

[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:21.440]
hey, guess what? It's like a weekend for the Democratic Convention. He's the candidate at oops. Oops.

[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.440]
Here we go again. Right. So if we come to find out, he's got just too much

[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:31.340]
propanous baggage to carry into the election. Right. Voting. He's clean. Right. Voting. He's clean or

[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:37.100]
Edwards because he's pristine. Yeah, he is. Right. Except for that thing on his lip.

[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:41.320]
I miss was bitching about that thing on his lip this morning. He told a lot of us. He wouldn't tell

[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:47.460]
him what it was. I miss has those all over his face. He's got a face. How can he tell us?

[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:51.120]
I was going to his head. Yeah, he's going to be going to his headway now with earphones. 12 and a top

[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:56.020]
13 at 560 WQM. It's the last mortgage you'll ever need. I bet you George's life on it.

[01:42:56.500 --> 01:43:00.680]
It's the only one mortgage from financial group. The benefits are incredible. You pay zero closing

you pay only three hundred and thirty four bucks a month. If you have a two hundred thousand dollar

[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.200]
loan, you pay only six sixty eight a month. And don't forget, once you refinance it, you know,

[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:23.500]

cost or expense. You pay zero underwriting fee, zero dot fee, zero closing cost. Even when you

[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:55.200]
I always like it. Words he looks a lot younger than 50. Financial group 1-800-940-LND,

[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.280]
either an equal housing lender, restrictions do apply and rates are subject to change monthly,

[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:01.700]
4.21 APR.

[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:29.660]
My, my, and low. This is 4.0560.

[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:33.240]
How come I don't see Brittany on our pool?

[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:35.440]
Huh? Good question.

[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.780]
I mentioned a lot of people like that Brittany on their pool.

[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.920]
It's right. She is toxic, man.

[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:41.920]
And also Pearl Jam 94.

[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.340]
Okay. Okay. So we're screwing up all over the place.

[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:44.800]
I want to...

[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.760]
Okay, well this is very accurate.

[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:48.100]
I need that one.

[01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:49.420]
Nine inch nails.

[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:50.200]
Yes it is.

[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:55.820]
I want a f*** you like an animal!

[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:56.880]
Like a pilly goat.

[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.420]
Damn it this thing's not on!

[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.460]
How come this isn't working?

[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:08.020]
What you treet you knocked over my bonga?

[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:11.860]
Nine inch nails.

[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.900]
Unplugged. Only on M.T.V.

[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.320]
Okay Pearl Jam 94 will get that on there right away.

[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:21.060]
I'm positive about that. Somebody says Lady and Jupiter says no doubt.

[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:22.400]
And we'll get that on there no doubt.

[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:23.180]
Even though...

[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:23.800]
Okay.

[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:30.540]
What about this thing about the Broward County government corruption and its worst and the new times and the north?

[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.140]
That doesn't sound like something we're going to talk about, does it?

[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:33.520]
What?

[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.660]
About the North Broward hospital district?

[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:37.340]
Oh I don't know.

[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.960]
And a big expose by new times.

[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:42.900]
I think we've got more important fish to fry. Maybe not more important but I'll look at it later.

[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:44.560]
Because it's got a link to a website.

[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.220]
Thanks a lot but we'll see.

[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:50.140]
Just being overloaded with crap here today, you know what I mean?

[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.500]
Now isn't that interesting? What is your up? There's your boys.

[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.320]
Where you at?

[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:57.800]
Oh that's a link. They're not out there.

[01:45:58.140 --> 01:45:59.080]
I love the loud.

[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.940]
Link 182 there aren't they?

[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.360]
One of their best songs ever. Well they should be.

[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:05.640]
Link 182.

[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:10.480]
And the good part of this one is they're not in their underwear.

[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:11.300]
Right.

[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:12.660]
This is the next one.

[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:19.060]
I didn't think enough until the first two got one.

[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:22.660]
You'll be sorry where I'm gone.

[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:32.180]
Oh right.

[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:43.660]
I never come to any games since the team just had such better days.

[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:45.420]
Those were nice.

[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:47.760]
We're making a lot of progress.

[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:51.540]
So we get from Link 182 to away from Lumpiskin.

[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.700]
Anyway getting back to the Brittany thing.

[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:55.640]
You notice how I haven't even changed a channel.

[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:57.100]
I've got all these different music channels.

[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:59.160]
Right from versions of MTV and much music.

[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.640]
But the Brittany thing was under twice within what a half an hour.

[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.220]
45 minutes. They're about 20 minutes.

[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:05.760]
How do you like that?

[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:06.600]
Toxic.

[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:12.840]
And in the meantime MTV and America says, well based on all of this beer over Janet Jackson's titty.

[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:15.940]
We're not going to put that on before 10 o'clock at night.

[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:20.580]
We're going to show Toxic 10 pm to 6 am because Viacom is crap in their pants.

[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.100]
The good news is Viacom doesn't own much music.

[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.160]
Maybe we should get our pilgrim gear back out of the closet.

[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.160]
Or maybe just head on across an agro falls from across and come on over.

[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.040]
Get those hats.

[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.880]
That was a fuckle shoe because it is so pathetic man.

[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:38.380]
The culture wars in America are exploding.

[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:42.840]
And people have thought that some of us were exaggerating when we talked about fascism in America.

[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.880]
And the goose stepping Nazis that have taken over the country.

[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:51.760]
Forget about it. Forget about the First Amendment because you've got two political parties there.

[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:53.580]
With the backbone of a fruit fly.

[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:55.200]
With the backbone of Greg Reed.

[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:58.180]
Man, anyway, getting back to Michael Jackson.

[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:02.740]
This magazine, this vanity fair.

[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.920]
You only wish you had in the bank whatever they're getting for the advertising and this thing.

[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.660]
You can't even find the table of contents.

[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.400]
It sponsored all that.

[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.120]
And of course you'd also like to see some of the people in it.

[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:16.280]
But that's beside another fair.

[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:22.640]
Vanity fair in the March issue just out yesterday along with a swimsuit issue of sports illustrated with Anna Cornelhoia.

[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:30.720]
Over the years, Jackson has dulled out millions of millions of dollars to lawyers, doctors, accountants, security people, con men, voodoo chiefs,

[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:35.060]
business advisors, members of his bankrupted dysfunctional family.

[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:40.480]
And ex-wife who allegedly threatened to kill his secrets, former staffers on remittance and the families of young boys.

[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:43.100]
He has made his special friends all over the world.

[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:46.260]
There is almost never a time when he is free of crisis.

[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:48.100]
And as a result, say many who know him.

[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:52.680]
It's become more and more difficult for him to trust his advisors not to feel paranoid about something.

[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:55.740]
He has a lot of skeletons in his closets as Lee.

[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:57.000]
That's young, holy.

[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:01.700]
Some are real and some are in his mind which makes him a prisoner of all those around him.

[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:03.340]
The result is often chaos.

[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:13.600]
Jackson has a $200 million plus bank loan guaranteed by his half interest in the Sony ATV music catalog, which owns the publishing rights to 251 Beatles songs and many other pop songs.

[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.900]
And it falls due in 2005.

[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:23.600]
These days it's difficult to get a straight read on Jackson's finances other than the cash flow situation which is reportedly dire.

[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:28.140]
Nobody really knows if there's money or not says either reason or one of his recent managers.

[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:32.340]
The coveted Sony ATV catalog is worth hundreds of millions of dollars however.

[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:42.820]
As I reported in this magazine last year, Sony has the right to first refusal of Jackson 4th to sell his share and he cannot sell, according to the lead before October 2005, the 10th anniversary of the partnership.

[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:48.300]
There are reports that Jackson meanwhile is being bailed out by a number of interested parties including Alvin Malnick.

[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:49.280]
Remember we talked about that?

[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:50.300]
Yes.

[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:54.280]
The flamboyant Miami lawyer who once represented Meyer Lansky about their great friendship.

[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:01.240]
Malnick reportedly put up much of the money to settle two civil suits against Jackson last year, a figure estimated to close to $10 million.

[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:07.660]
In times of trouble in the past, most notably during his first molestation case, Jackson has turned to drugs.

[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:15.220]
Cat Pelicano remembers a very high Michael Jackson in her house in August 93 nodding out and drinking glass after glass of orange soda.

[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:22.680]
Cat is the former wife of Anthony Pelicano, the private investigator who worked back then for Jackson's attorneys, Bert Fields and Howard Weitzman.

[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:29.460]
Fields has been questioned in a current FBI investigation involving Pelicano's use of wiretapping for clients.

[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:37.660]
Pelicano, who's now in jail, was then the muscle that Jackson's team used to intimidate potential witnesses against the singer and to accuse Jordi Chandler's father of extortion.

[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:43.140]
After the first molestation scandal broke, Anthony wanted to get Michael out of the country as soon as possible, Cat says,

[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.020]
when Michael came into the house, my three-year-old daughter asked if he were a boy or a girl.

[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:51.220]
I told her a boy that some boys had long hair, but did they wear makeup, she asked?

[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:59.580]
That day, Cat Drover has been in Jackson to the airport where they boarded a private jet for Asia, a few months later, Jackson checked himself into a London detox center.

[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:05.700]
His state that was prompted by a frantic phone call, a Mexican doctor had made to one of the pop stars business advisors who recalls,

[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.900]
the doctor said, either the drugs are going to kill him or he's going to die by flying out of a window because he thinks he can fly, you better get someone here who listen to.

[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:15.140]
Otherwise, there won't be a Michael Jackson.

[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:22.660]
Elizabeth Taylor was enlisted, that bag hang. She immediately said, I'll go, she got him into rehab and he got himself out right away.

[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:28.980]
While Jackson was in London undergoing detox, LA and Santa Barbara authorities negotiated terms for his coming back to have his,

[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.340]
genitals photographed. If he returned voluntarily, they wouldn't handcuff or arrest him.

[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:43.240]
It turned out that Jordi Chandler had been able to draw very accurately certain distinctive markings on Jackson, which gave the boys lawyers the ammunition they needed to settle the civil suit at such a high price.

[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:46.760]
The case was settled the night before Jackson was to give his deposition.

[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:54.320]
Several months later, when the authorities were finally ready to bring charges, the boy and his family declined to prosecute, saying they feared they would be harmed.

[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:59.760]
There were reports the boy and the current cases also provided drawings of Jackson's private parts to the police.

[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:07.400]
Throughout the 90s, Jackson portrayed himself as sort of a pure, a ethereal Peter Pan, but he had serious drug problems.

[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:17.220]
Last year, I covered the civil trial in which European concert promoter Marcel Avram was suing Jackson for $21.2 million for canceling two millennium concert schedule for New Year's 2000.

[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:27.960]
During his first appearance in from the jury, Jackson practically fell asleep and when he came back later, he grimaced its spectators, made devils horns with his fingers and generally behaved as if he were 12 years old.

[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:31.540]
He ended up losing the case and having to pay Avram $5.3 million.

[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:40.520]
Looking back, I remember being struck by one exhibit presented by the plaintiff, Avram said he had paid to two German doctors for nearly $264,000.

[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:48.660]
I later learned that the doctors had not only taken care of an injury Jackson suffer when he fell on stage in Munich in 1999, but also previously put him through drug detox.

[01:52:48.660 --> 01:53:01.480]
In expense reports submitted in Lausanne that young Holy brought against Jackson, which was settled last June, their entry showing $62,645 over to the Mickey Fine Pharmacy in Beverly Hills.

[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:06.840]
I wonder if that's like the Mighty Fine Pharmacy, the Mickey Fine Pharmacy in Beverly Hills.

[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.140]
Maybe he and Rush could compare notes, you think? Maybe they could do rehab together.

[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.040]
Or at least Rush could give him almost phone number anyway.

[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:20.720]
27 past noon at 5.60 WQML City where you can go and relieve yourself from all the stress in the world and that's the world famous pizza lot.

[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:33.680]
Isn't that what they say? All the time. In the Czech Republic.

[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:37.980]
Anyway, they got it all. Every kind of pasta that you've ever loved and the something you've even heard of.

[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:45.820]
They got chicken dishes and veal and seafood, cow's own, super subs, garlic rolls just dripping with garlic to the best you've ever had and three different kinds of fantastic pizza.

[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:52.080]
Everything is cooked fresh to order just the way you like it. Nothing soggy enough to sit around all day, waiting to fall into a lump.

[01:53:52.560 --> 01:54:01.700]
You'll find a pizza lot in the pizza lot. Plies on university, drag between 5.95 and RodeWrite Beyond Pier 1 imports for takeoff, for delivery, for catering which they do for as low as $5 per person,

The hottest working criminal in show business is back in jail.

[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:31.320]
And that's where he's recording his brand new CV. James Barles, dumbest hits.

[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:34.480]
I screwed up, good. You knew that one now.

[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:39.320]
Scudder, scudder, I got caught.

[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:47.300]
It's James Barles, dumbest hits. There's no bad. No back and fingers and no audience.

[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:50.520]
It's just James Barles getting down in luck.

[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.980]
That was gonna brand new. Could've planned it.

[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:53.700]
Yeah.

[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:59.480]
The Godfather of parole has made another God off of a snake, but he's not ashamed.

[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:03.620]
If I didn't hold, say it now. I'm back and dead and I'm proud.

[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.640]
Put down that licking stick and pick up James Barles, dumbest hits.

Hey, the way we fight, the deal is James Brown.

[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:13.160]
Won't you buy my latest criminal record?

[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:14.880]
No. Thank you very much, Godfather.

[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.760]
Now available on Capitol offense records.

[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:20.520]
Yeah, put that out, licking stick. 1232 and 560 WDQM.

[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:24.660]
Miss Fudge wants you to know that it's a world exclusive and you must mention the drug of the Fudge Report

[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:26.640]
and give credit where credit is due to the drug.

[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:27.840]
Fudge Report and smudge.

[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:32.660]
Okay. Fulming it to mouth. And of course that right wing pipeline that's connected to his...

[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:32.980]
Right, go.

[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.980]
I mean, you just know they're pulling out the smoke right in there.

[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:36.920]
So you just know it's coming right from the horses and...

[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.560]
Like the Alaska pipeline?

[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.260]
Exactly.

[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:40.200]
It's like the oily bird.

[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:47.340]
567-0560, the best recording group of the past 10 years or artist or whatever.

[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:50.900]
George Dono Sam Roberts, which means it's pretty inversely in the main.

[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.120]
Well, I'm finally glad over music on Burst You and something.

[01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:56.280]
Dave Matthews van is pretty inversely 91.

[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:58.600]
I mean, how is that possible? Can you explain that to me?

[01:55:58.860 --> 01:55:59.120]
Freep.

[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:00.880]
There must be Republicans.

[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:06.640]
Outcast 29, radio hit 28, the Fulfighters 24.

[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:13.420]
I wonder if you'd rather see the Fulfighters on your plane or that pilot, that Christian pilot?

[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:14.920]
Cracker, please.

[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:18.920]
Norgion's 22, M&M-22 speaking of crackers.

[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:27.100]
Chennai-22, Lincoln Park 17, Coldplay 16, Counting Cros 14, Kid Rock 14.

[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:28.980]
Beyonce, she'd been having nine.

[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:35.380]
Lint Biscuit 8, Shakira's got eight, Over Levine 8, White Stripe 7, Sean Paul's got six.

[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:37.280]
RuPaul ain't made the list yet.

[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:40.260]
Nelly Furtado 6, Pearl Jam 6, and we apologize.

[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:41.900]
I thought they were around longer than that.

[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:43.560]
I didn't know.

[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.940]
Well, their first hit was 94 and that's what qualifies, okay?

[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.780]
It just seems like they've been around a long time.

[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:48.300]
Too long.

[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:48.700]
Yeah.

[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.240]
Matchbox 24, Sarah McLaughlin 4, system of down 4, Incubus 3, Incubus is great.

[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:55.860]
Sensational.

[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:56.160]
Yeah.

[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:57.120]
Who knows who that is.

[01:56:57.340 --> 01:56:57.600]
That is.

[01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:58.620]
Just shut up.

[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:00.780]
Queens of the Stone Age 3.

[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:02.000]
I got it.

[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:02.880]
They fucked this again.

[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:03.640]

[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.280]
They fucked this again.

[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:05.820]
They fucked this again.

[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:48.600]

[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:48.600]

[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:48.600]

[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:48.600]

[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:52.900]
They were butt to ass.

[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:56.100]
That's not dead enough.

[01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:57.220]
That's not dead enough.

[01:57:57.220 --> 01:57:59.560]
We need to be careful.

[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:00.820]
That's not dead enough.

[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.580]
In that case, and it's dead enough,

[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:05.460]
not dead enough.

[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:07.000]
They've been surviving,

[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.160]
Don't it make sense to you figure rhymes with

[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:11.560]
Bigger

[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:20.700]
See there you go to cracking a whip if you don't stop that jazz man. You're gonna be on the outside looking in

[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:21.900]
560

[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:26.000]
0560 pound of the zoo pound 560 on the AT&T and

Verizon wireless line with the mocus

[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:33.760]
See there he goes again with those president bush comments you better start respecting your president here

[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:36.220]
You're a dictator. No, I think they're gonna call off the election

[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:39.920]
I think that's what miss fudges counting on they're gonna call off the whole election

[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:14.700]
Where I don't see destiny's child. Did they hop over all these other people? Where are they?

[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:18.240]
You got your thumb on them. They got zero

[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:24.060]
They got zero like I said I feel a whole lot better about life now and no doubt got zero

[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:55.260]
But younger they are the better

[02:05:55.260 --> 02:05:56.540]
I'm on my list

[02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:58.140]
I'm on my list

[02:05:58.140 --> 02:05:58.860]

I'll get you

[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:07.700]
Here's somebody else we left off

[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:08.520]
How could we do that?

[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:10.060]
Pink as in one of the pink

[02:06:10.060 --> 02:06:10.760]
And one of the

[02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:12.220]
Have I got pardoned?

[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:12.780]
I said indeed

[02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:13.540]
Yes

[02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.060]
Man doubts himself with gasoline

[02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:18.620]
In order to bank and threatens to send himself on fire

[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:19.860]
Okay

[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:25.020]
A disgruntled customer doubts himself with gas in a downtown bank and threatened to ignite himself this morning

[02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.420]
For order to help pull these said

[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:30.080]
Police talked to man to setting aside his the volatile fuel

[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:32.240]
Which was stored in a plastic gatorade bottle

[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.020]
And the lighter

[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:38.960]
And then took him into custody with no store of low injuries reported the incident started around 10 to 40 this morning

[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:42.940]
In the lobby of the some-trust bank building in the 500 block of East Las Olas

[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:45.720]
Police said the unidentified man walked in said something

[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.120]
Mumbled a little bit like that

[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:50.360]
And then sat down on the floor of the lobby after dassing himself with gas

[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:53.280]
He threatened to like the lighter that he was holding

[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:56.160]
Employees and customers were quickly evacuated from the bank

[02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:57.120]
While police talked with the man

[02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:59.140]
They eventually talked him into settling down

[02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:03.540]
And setting down both the lighter and gasoline and surrendering after the men was washed down

[02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:04.940]
They washed him off

[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.500]
He was placed under observation rules

[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.340]
Sited in these states Baker Act

[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:12.120]
Which allows police to take somebody to custody temporarily if they're in danger to themselves or others

[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:13.580]
The Baker Act isn't

[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:15.780]
Like they showed an under-grade read long time ago

[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:17.320]
Before he screwed up QAM

[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:19.380]
By the way Joe Rose has worked nine weeks in the morning

[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:20.940]
Eight to ten seconds to hasn't got paid a dime

[02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:22.440]
I just thought I'd mention it again

[02:07:22.900 --> 02:07:24.660]
For the embarrassment factor for Greg

[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:26.420]
Wow

[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:27.540]
Hey listen

[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:30.460]
You wouldn't face anybody either if you thought you could keep getting that

[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:31.800]
That's why he keeps stalling

[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:32.040]
You know

[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.580]
Remember all the paperwork with this one

[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:37.780]
And that one no don't don't you know don't put them on a payroll install if you wish

[02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:40.100]
Because then that way you get their services for free

[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:43.640]
Because the word retroactive isn't in the beastly corporate handbook

[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:45.620]
Nobody gets paid retroactive

[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:47.380]
Unbelievable

[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:48.280]
Scandalous

[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:52.300]
But if that's the way we do it that's just the way we do it

[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:56.380]
And of course the FCC would all this outrage about Janet Jackson's booby

[02:07:56.380 --> 02:08:02.760]
Let's really outrage us and obscene is the way the let him just a small handful of companies buy up every then and now of course this Comcast does

[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:04.680]
Anything if that goes down which I don't think it will

[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:08.100]
I think now that the spotlight is on these batches

[02:08:08.100 --> 02:08:09.940]
I think they're finally going to draw the line right there

[02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:11.960]
You think?

[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:12.960]
Let's hope

[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:15.040]
And I'll tell you he's going to be the happiest about it

[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:15.560]
Oh I said

[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:16.040]
Yeah

[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:20.300]
Has he continued struggling by his fingernails trying to hang on to it

[02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:22.980]
WQAM, hello

[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:24.720]
Yeah I can speak the nail

[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:25.400]
Speaking

[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.660]
Yeah I know I got one free pull

[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:29.320]
Okay

[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:31.560]
The chin blossoms

[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:34.560]
The chin blossoms

[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:36.640]
Hello

[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:38.200]
The chin ball

[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.760]
The chin blossoms

[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:41.200]
What kind of a zad?

[02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:42.180]
Or the chin blossoms

[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:45.860]
Yeah, what's he talking about?

[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:46.800]
The chin blossoms

[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.940]
Go back to your other stuff he were talking about last time

[02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:52.960]
Is he just babbling?

[02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:53.920]
No, he never knows

[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:54.580]
We're putting them on there

[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:55.080]
Who?

[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:55.860]
The chin blossoms

[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.160]
The chin blossoms

[02:08:58.100 --> 02:08:59.720]
That's what I tried to say to you

[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:01.040]
He kept saying the chin blossoms

[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:01.920]
I know he was

[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:04.120]
I think that can't place a mean chin ball if he asked me

[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:06.520]
Some of these people are very inarticulate you know what?

[02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:08.540]
Maybe they've been drinking too much

[02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:09.580]
Gin

[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:11.200]
Jesus juice

[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:12.440]
Maybe they've been playing too much

[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:13.760]
Gin rummy

[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:15.860]
Or drinking too much Jesus juice out of soda cans

[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:18.760]
Don't let me forget to read some more of that Michael Jackson stuff before the show is out

[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:21.440]
Hey, don't forget to continue under tomorrow and maybe even the Monday

[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.260]
It's a long piece

[02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:23.640]
It's a long, long piece

[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:23.860]
What?

[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.280]
You know, it will save you like five of them

[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:28.060]
How I wonder how much this is in the US of A?

[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:29.220]
It was five and a half bucks Canadian

[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:31.820]
Because it's a big four fifty

[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:34.600]
It will save you four and a half bucks from by the March Vanity Fair

[02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:37.000]
WQA and Hello

[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:40.860]
Hey, I got one free poll that you get for a guy

[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:41.540]
Good one, okay

[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:42.980]
Super furry animals

[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:45.800]
Super furry animals

[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:46.520]
Yeah

[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.440]
I have a lot of good songs

[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:50.220]
Such as

[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:51.560]
Um, duh

My favorite

[02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:57.300]
Isn't that your favorite?

[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:57.740]
Sure

[02:09:57.740 --> 02:09:59.480]
Oh yeah, my favorite song of theirs too

[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:01.060]
Super furry bush

[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:03.580]
I can't believe that no, what I don't know

[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:05.160]
They don't know from nothing to Bloodhound gang

[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:07.520]
I guess they weren't that big in the US in the first place were they?

[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:08.540]

[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:10.080]
The big ones

[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.580]
You and your Rocky Mark

[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:19.700]
You and me

[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:23.580]
You and me

[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:29.520]
You and me

[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:30.020]
You and me

[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:30.020]

[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:30.020]

[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:30.020]

[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:30.020]

[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:30.020]

[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:30.020]

[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:31.820]
I'm fit with monkeys

[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:33.360]
I get my life

[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:34.340]
Plus than nothing

[02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:35.560]
You just broke me

[02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:40.700]
Beauty can't talk about those feces no more man

[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:43.360]
The feces of the species can't be doing that one no more either

[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:45.080]
Because Michael's pals

[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:46.760]
Oh, which reminds me

[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:50.140]
Was it Myra Breckenridge by Gord Vidal or was it Myron?

[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:54.280]
I think it was Myra Breckenridge where he used the names of the Supreme Court

[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:58.540]
Justices who voted, you know, the seven dirty words this is against WBAI and George Carlin

[02:10:58.540 --> 02:11:04.080]
He used the names of the justices to describe private parts

[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:04.620]
Okay

[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:10.400]
And for example penis was Renquist with that time was just none of the justice not the chief justice

[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:12.680]
Which he is now unfortunately that Nazi William Renquist

[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:15.460]
Renquist he substituted all through the book for the word penis

[02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:20.180]
For breasts guess what word who was the oh it's so ironic

[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:21.120]
Powell

[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:22.440]
How do I say it?

[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:23.080]
For heaving Powell's

[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:25.500]
Puh, puh, puh, puh

[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.000]
And that grade?

[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:26.840]
That is great

[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:30.920]
So go on read Myra Breckenridge and you'll probably start walking around and dress guys

[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:33.460]
Kevin Q.A.M. Hello

[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:35.040]
Yes is this Neil Rogers?

[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:35.820]
Yes sir

[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:38.660]
Okay Neil I have something really important for you

[02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:40.280]
I think you appreciate this

[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:50.580]
If you can and people that you know can push for the idea of the National Democratic Party pushing for a constitutional amendment

[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:55.980]
That would ban the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries

[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:58.860]
Oh yeah that's coming next week we're going to be pushing for that real hard

[02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:00.260]
Let's start pushing it right now right

[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:07.740]
This guy doesn't listen now president and his people told us two days ago that that's good for the economy

[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:08.880]
Here for the American workers

[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:15.620]
And you thought overseas is good taking all of these big corporations and allowing them to ship all those thousands and thousands and zillions of jobs overseas

[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:20.260]
So they can get those 50 cent a day Chinese workers to build all their craft

[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:21.600]
That's good for the economy

[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:24.000]
Hold your breath pal you're in a dream world man

[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.860]
Give yourself some medication and a good tank of oxygen and take a deep breath

[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:31.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:35.720]
Count 5 6 8 8 and 10 and Verizon wireless line

[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:39.080]
I'll say it again CNN loot jobs last night they took a poll on that

[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:44.080]
Outsourcing jobs good for the economy good for the American worker or a bad

[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.280]
95% of the thousands are that bad not good

[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:48.940]
What a surprise huh

[02:12:48.940 --> 02:12:49.960]
And the other 5% said

[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:54.280]
Who was that one another 5% were like like I said the 5% and now we're a

[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:55.120]
Chicanos

[02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:01.080]
And of course this comes run on the Hill of El President he's saying hey all those illegal aliens coming on in

[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.900]
Well, let's give them a little bit of you know time to hang around and do their thing they're providing

[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:09.820]
You know it's funny about that is you know how you used to joke you used to joke about as soon as they wash up on shore

[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:12.960]
They get a driver's license and a dire 57 Chevy right now

[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:13.140]
Well now

[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:15.760]
That's right

[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:21.320]
So you can't complain about American workers anymore because pretty soon if you leave bush in there there won't be any

[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:26.800]
But everything's just fine right oh we're fine WQM hello

[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:28.500]
You

[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:29.800]
Yes sir

[02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:31.240]
Hello

[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:33.980]

[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:37.980]
I have a question for you

[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:38.380]
Go ahead

[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:47.040]
Why can't I pick up the you just show on my computer because you suck

[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:53.020]
George said that I didn't say that well why do you say that to him that's what yeah

[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:57.260]
This guy is a little too slow for me to be messing with he's not looking for a smart response

[02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:02.000]
What do you mean you can't pick it up are you how about on your pop up posters are coming on that

[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:04.780]
Where were you calling from?

[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:09.780]

[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:17.120]
I'm trying to find a car but I want trying to get on information to get you on the computer

[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:21.140]
Oh Miami it's not allowed in Miami the mayor won't allow mayor Diaz won't love Miami

[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:28.860]
5670560 we've been banned in Miami baby and pretty soon if Michael Powell has this way you know I would love to do

[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:33.920]
I would love to do a show on the internet I realized I couldn't make this kind of money but why not maybe

[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:39.900]
Maybe that's the future right then of course with my luck just today that we started all the FCC had Congress

[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:44.780]
Pass another law today and now the FCC is regulating all content on the internet and they can't say crap

[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:51.920]
Right it'll happen like the day that I did the show with for a while for an hour right or did we do an hour

[02:14:53.300 --> 02:15:00.860]
40 minutes I think we do that twice I was like I think the day was his very first day that he was supposed to start when a transmitter went out for a couple of hours

[02:15:00.860 --> 02:15:06.660]
That was the day he never got on the year and so for all and I did a show on the on the internet and we said

[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:12.980]
And the F word and the S word and the P word and the C word and the D word and the A word and every words have been invented

[02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:19.460]
A day and it was a lot of fun as opposed to the fact that they forced us to do because we have to watch our language

[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:26.380]
Because we have the word police the language police we have the pot police the J walking police and now we have the god damn

[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:37.700]
And the thing that is so unbelievable how many stupid people are could be out there why aren't they just screaming at the talking head that works in the networks

[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:42.980]
They keep every time there's a story associated with these hearings that are going on or anything else have it with Janet and Justin

[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:49.940]
They show it over and over now okay so I'm not seeing the booby boy differences to make at this point you've seen it 75 million times already

[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:54.560]
But they keep showing it again and again how many million times we've seen it already

[02:15:54.560 --> 02:16:01.420]
But third man who the hell cares are you disgusted yet I wasn't disgusted the first time well look at it again

[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:09.380]
I really couldn't care all always if you look at near Rogers dot com you'll see both boobies in the nice nice matching set isn't amazing how much they look like each other

[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:15.980]
We look at the back page because it was getting crowded up front. Oh yeah we got so much stuff going on that website right now man

[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:21.720]
You got the Angelina Jolie today with the little nip action right in fact everybody have a little nip today

[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.960]
Everything is our going wouldn't surprise me if everybody takes a good nip

[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:30.660]
We're sports radio 560

[02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:32.240]

But heads it's the one to do our you love Shakira's time ten years underneath your clothes

[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:44.720]
Oh look at the clock that's nearly the story

And now you'll love her new album Shakira sings other people's hits

[02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:01.460]
She already made music history by recording her first English language album

[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:07.220]
And now she's taking her art form to the next level by re-recording songs that were already hits in English

[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:09.540]
Only this time there in English again

[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:16.160]
And now she's taking her art form to the next level by re-recording songs

[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:17.780]
Shakira sings other people's hits

[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:24.960]
Shakira sings other people's her own

[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:36.760]
If you really really like Shakira's CD laundry service then you'll really really really like her new CD

[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:39.220]
Shakira sings other people's hits

[02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:41.320]
No denemos en español en estos momentos

[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:45.640]
I'll tell you one thing, be sure to write a note to self on your wrist, I'll allow me a momento

[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:45.900]
See?

[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:52.280]
See the toxic video by Britney Spears, I guarantee everybody will be moist within the first twenty seconds

[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:54.240]
Okay, I have a towel that

[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:58.420]
Okay, appearing Wednesday on ABC's Good Morning America

[02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:05.900]
Jason Williams' wife Tanya said he has been frustrated by the claims made against him since the shooting of that limo driver

[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:12.260]
Gus Kristoffi and reveal that he's created a website to thank her husband supporters, isn't that great?

[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:15.500]
No, I'm curious because I've been reading everything I can get my hands on

[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:21.440]
And I can't find no more about that dead dog, you know, the rock-watter, his pet rock-watter, that he lost the bed on and then

[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:24.940]
Shot him in the head and one other time and killed him, only we care about that dog

[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:31.140]
I mean it says here, Jason Williams is known both in the NBA where of course he used to play for the nets

[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:35.020]
His community and his family as a big teddy bear, they said

[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:35.500]
Right

[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:42.020]
I think the dog committed suicide and so did Gus Kristoffi with a 30 inch shotgun

[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:43.560]
With three feet long

[02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:44.420]
Yeah

[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:48.480]
And that always a good idea to commit suicide with a three foot long shotgun

[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:50.020]
If your arms are three and a half feet long

[02:18:50.020 --> 02:18:54.620]
But the only problem is that the shot was from not that close range

[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:57.680]
So probably what he did is he handed it to the dog

[02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:59.560]
But that's right, the dog was already dead, right?

[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:03.740]
Well I got a new dog, he gave it to the dog and said I'm gonna walk across the room and pull it

[02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:07.660]
And he passed, so he shot from across the room and then he ran ahead and then

[02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:11.660]
He ran in and just like Tom Welling, right, he caught the bullet in his chest

[02:19:11.660 --> 02:19:15.060]
He had only problem on the light, Tom Welling was, he died, caught the shot

[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:20.080]
And when Jason came in and was like blowing into his mouth

[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:23.060]
In fact, maybe before the shooting he was blowing into his mouth

[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:27.260]
But anyway, and the guy said he's dead, the cop said he's dead

[02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:29.020]
Or whoever the hell it was

[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:31.760]
Not the cop, the cops went there, who was it said he's dead?

[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:33.540]
Dr. McCoy

[02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:35.820]
Dr. Robert Young

[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:38.220]
And anyway, he said, oh man

[02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:43.040]
That's what he said

[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:43.740]
Oh man

[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:44.940]
Yeah, just like that

[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:45.540]
Oh man

[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:46.540]
It's not just like OJ

[02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:47.120]
Oh man

[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:48.620]
Oh man

[02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:50.840]
And anyway, Jason Wiggins was a scumbag

[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:51.720]
Anybody who likes him?

[02:19:51.980 --> 02:19:52.380]
Scumbag

[02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:53.300]
There you go

[02:19:53.740 --> 02:19:59.020]
5, 6, 7, what do you think is the best recording artist or group to come along in the past 10 years?

[02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:03.580]
See now, and I were saying it to come along, probably should have put that in there otherwise we won't get what's your name all upset again?

[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:04.260]
What was your name?

[02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:05.040]
I don't know, lady

[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:05.260]
Laura

[02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:07.640]
I wonder if that was Dr. Laura Slesinger

[02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:09.600]
Hey, we got nude pictures of her

[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:13.160]
Oh wait, now we're not going to pollute our website with that crap, okay?

[02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:14.320]
Anybody want to see that?

[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:14.600]
No

[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:16.020]
You can see her pie

[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:17.940]
Oh jeez

[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:20.520]
No chance

[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:22.420]
WQA, I'm hello

[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:25.500]
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up

[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:31.660]
See, he's out of a whole new thing

[02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:34.840]
Okay, we've got him cornered, we got him corralled now

[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:36.360]
So he's got a whole new deal

[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:38.380]
Your buddy, your close personal friend

[02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:39.080]
Yeah, I'm like, what?

[02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:40.960]
WQA, hello

[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:41.940]
Hey Neil

[02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:42.860]
Yes, sir

[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:44.380]
It's my anniversary today

[02:20:44.380 --> 02:20:46.680]
Three years removed from South Florida's environment

[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:47.440]
Where?

[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:50.800]
It's my anniversary three years removed from South Florida

[02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:51.800]
To where?

[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:53.400]
I think the Sarasota

[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:56.060]
Wow, you know

[02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:57.520]
The reason I'm calling you is that

[02:20:57.520 --> 02:20:59.740]
During the Ileon stuff, you know

[02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:02.000]
One thing that really impressed me about

[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.120]
How you talked about how the media just

[02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:06.500]
Distributed everything

[02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:08.080]
They called all the problems

[02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:11.840]
Over here they're doing the same thing with this poor girl, Carly Rochelle

[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:12.560]
They got killed

[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:13.080]
Right

[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:15.840]
They are parked out in front of this poor lady pal

[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.860]
Gay and his day out

[02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:20.100]
And what about that poor judge over there

[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:21.980]
Who, you know, what that was he's supposed to do

[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:24.840]
And you know what, he's supposed to be getting the keys to it

[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:25.200]
Yeah

[02:21:25.620 --> 02:21:28.660]
And uh, but I'll give you an example

[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:30.880]
Okay, about a week before she got abducted right

[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:33.900]
There's a woman who had a art gallery in Sarasota in downtown

[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:38.420]
He was, they found her stabbed 40 times in her art gallery

[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:40.220]
And now you don't hear no more about it

[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:41.800]
Since this Carly thing came out

[02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:43.880]
See, one thing you're starting to catch on to

[02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:46.360]
Like you said, I've been trying to tell you this for a hundred years

[02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:48.940]
Is that the media will tell you what you're supposed to care about

[02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:50.140]
And you're like, I don't know

[02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:51.680]
Like Scott and Lacey Peterson

[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:54.700]
There are five people in America of the herelitives

[02:21:54.700 --> 02:21:56.140]
The people directly involved

[02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:58.520]
There are five other people who give a flying crap about that

[02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:01.240]
But the media insists that we have to be concerned about that

[02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:04.560]
I'm so waiting to hear what happened to those shares office in Highly

[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:07.240]
It was running the end court service three years ago

[02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:08.460]
I'll be waiting to hear what happened

[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:10.240]
Three was more than that like six years ago

[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:12.080]
Yes, it's longer than that but you still have that

[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:13.520]
Good luck, Capali

[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:15.060]
I'll stay on City Island, man

[02:22:15.060 --> 02:22:15.460]
Thank you

[02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:17.080]
I'll see if the economy rests on

[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:19.560]
Oh, there's lots of men

[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:23.460]
And part the reason you treat a man

[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:26.480]
Yeah, and that's the problem

[02:22:26.480 --> 02:22:29.720]
I'll tell you one thing I'm really grateful for that nobody has said for the poll today

[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:30.840]
Bye, bye, bye

[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:32.400]
Oh, thank the law, everybody said that

[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:34.940]
Because at that point I would have fallen right on the floor

[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:35.660]
Pro position

[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:37.980]
Man

[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:44.040]
5,6,7,0,5,60, pound, 5,60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:52.200]
See, like, then we discussed this couple days ago that we can't find anybody of any age of any sex of any persuasion of any breed

[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:54.480]
The likes of a blind of the plan

[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:54.800]
The likes of a blind of the plan

[02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:57.740]
Think of it, I think it is really a singer, a performer and anything

[02:22:57.740 --> 02:22:59.160]
Right, creatures from other dimensions

[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:05.720]
But again, just like this last guy was saying now, the media tells you, oh he's a superstar, he's great

[02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:07.240]
Sure

[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:12.040]
Deaf blind girls in special ad don't like him

[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:13.280]
WQM Hello

[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:15.860]
N-Yes, or J-G

[02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:18.260]
WQM Hello

[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:19.960]
He's a mind-missal

[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:21.320]
That was Bonerboy

[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:22.660]
Q-A-M

[02:23:23.380 --> 02:23:24.140]
WQM Hello

[02:23:24.140 --> 02:23:27.240]
How about, Dane

[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:29.440]
Great Dane

[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:31.720]
C-Dane, Sanger, we're my corn

[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:33.000]
Corn?

[02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:33.800]
Corn is good

[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:35.780]
And it really is special, corn is good

[02:23:35.780 --> 02:23:36.740]
We'll put in corn on there

[02:23:36.740 --> 02:23:38.100]
Put corn on there right away

[02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:39.600]
I like that Indian corn

[02:23:40.060 --> 02:23:41.060]
That the blue stuff

[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:42.460]
I like it grilled

[02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:46.280]
Oh man, you ever had to put in the tin foil and grill that Indian corn?

[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:47.580]
Oh man, that is a good one

[02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:49.520]
That is so great

[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:51.160]
And that corn really is special

[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:56.020]
And you know what, M.S. Fudge says too, it says that corn hole really is special

[02:23:57.660 --> 02:23:58.540]
567-0560

[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:00.120]
Pound 560

[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:03.160]
Correct them on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:07.700]
He's just squeezing his knees and his, I mean if he had anything there he would squeeze that too

[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:09.400]
But he doesn't, but just going now

[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:14.360]
I got a word exclusive, I'm famous even more than before, I got 8 billion hits on my website

[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:14.720]
Yeah

[02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:18.500]
And you're still safe on self-hating packets, so what difference does it make, M.S. Fudge?

[02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:21.240]
It's so tragic

[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:28.620]
How do you look yourself in a mirror and know that you're just a pawn of people who would love to stoke your ass into an oven immediately if not sooner?

[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:31.560]
WQM Hello

[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:34.300]
Q-A-M

[02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:34.800]
Q-A-M

[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:36.740]
WQM Hello

[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:40.020]
Yes sir

[02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:42.720]
Yeah George, is my prescription ready?

[02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:47.860]
Call Walmart, he's got it

[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:49.580]
WQM Hello

[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:50.680]
Yes, Neil

[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:51.480]
Yes sir

[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:56.920]
In regards to the election I think perhaps we'll have to elect someone from the floor of the convention

[02:24:57.860 --> 02:24:58.840]
From the floor?

[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:01.900]
Yeah, now when they come to floor

[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:03.360]
And who would that be sir

[02:25:03.900 --> 02:25:05.560]
Pardon? That would be Hillary Clinton

[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:08.200]
Hillary Clinton, there you go, Hillary might do it

[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:10.060]
You won't think about her, she ain't screwing around

[02:25:10.060 --> 02:25:11.260]
That was guys anyway

[02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:13.100]
Right?

[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:15.840]
Right? I think maybe he's got something going there

[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:18.760]
Hillary comes out of nowhere and all of a sudden grabs the flagger runs with it

[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:21.520]
Hey, we don't aren't that crazy about her but America, whatever

[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:24.680]
I don't know what that's all about, it's kind of reminds me of Dave Matthews van

[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:25.160]
Same thing

[02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:29.380]
It reminds me of McDonald's and White Bread and vanilla ice cream

[02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:31.560]
But McDonald's is okay, listen to me

[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:37.040]
It reminds me of all of these things that America's obsessed with that are mediocre at best

[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:40.000]
Dave Matthews van 103

[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:42.940]
And I don't think we're getting a free, I believe it

[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:45.440]
Okay, I'm telling you

[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:47.460]
You just don't understand the magnitude of this man

[02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:48.800]
You better get with it, get with the program

[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:50.360]
No, Mr. Hip Hop

[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:53.920]
You got the hot part of it going pretty good but not the hip part

[02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:57.260]
Dave Matthews van 103, by the way

[02:25:57.260 --> 02:26:01.560]
You would like Sam Roberts, he is a good singer, they have a good craft

[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:03.640]
I'll listen to the free CD, somebody's going to send me

[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:04.460]
Okay, hint

[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:08.740]
Radiohead 36, outcast 36, Chenaya 234

[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:12.380]
Nora Jones 28

[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:15.000]
Foulfighter 25, MNM25

[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.280]
Counting Crows 23, I have no idea who they are

[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:19.500]
You're lucky

[02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:21.660]
Bad, bad

[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:23.800]
Pearl Jam 20, Lincoln Park 20

[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:27.940]
Cool, a cold play 17, Luke Warren play, Kin Rock 16

[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:30.780]
Shakira's got only 11, shame on you people

[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:35.660]
Beyonce's got 11, now that's, see that's so ridiculous

[02:26:35.660 --> 02:26:38.520]
What? I mean you could argue which one looks better

[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:42.360]
Between who? Shakira and Beyonce and Ols

[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:43.020]
I wouldn't argue

[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:45.120]
No, but I'm just saying you can have that argument

[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:47.640]
But is there any argument as to which is the better singer?

[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:49.180]
No, okay

[02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:53.780]
Limp viscate 10, Avril Lavigne, and I can go single digits from there

[02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:58.840]

[02:30:24.340 --> 02:30:26.820]
It always comes back, whether it's Bubba, whether it's Kerry

[02:30:26.820 --> 02:30:29.280]
No matter who download is, aww they were screwing us on

[02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:30.440]
It's a kid

[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:31.220]
It's a kid of the nation

[02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:34.640]
See, show off for your military duty and performing your military obligation

[02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:36.400]
That's just smear in somebody, see

[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:37.300]
It's all of this

[02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:38.640]
Right, wingers, that means nothing

[02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:39.040]
Right

[02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:42.320]
But if you had that banana problem, there's somewhere along the line

[02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:44.980]
If you had that wayward banana, then we're gonna get ya

[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:46.480]
That's always the same crap

[02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:51.040]
Speaking of people with banana problems, get back to the Vanity Fair Michael Jackson story

[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:53.720]
That goes on for 100 miles, spotted banana problems

[02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:57.400]
Anyway, this, what's your guy's name again, Lee?

[02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:58.880]
What is his name?

[02:30:58.960 --> 02:31:01.040]
Young, young holy, Michael's buddy

[02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:06.740]
Lee tells me that in 1999 he employed Dr. Neil Ratner and an anesthesiologist and former rock drummer

[02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:08.660]
To put Michael through detox in soul

[02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:13.620]
Ratner, the government star witness against prominent Manhattan gynecologist Dr. Neil's Lawrenceon

[02:31:13.620 --> 02:31:15.980]
Who was convicted of insurance fraud in 2001

[02:31:15.980 --> 02:31:20.160]
Admitted of being stoned himself, much of the time he ejected his patients in the 80s

[02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:21.680]
And you're gonna love this

[02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:28.100]
And to once collapsing in an operating room after mistakenly shooting himself up with a paralytic agent

[02:31:29.260 --> 02:31:34.020]
I met with a doctor on a regular basis, says Lee, we were getting Michael off when he was addicted to him

[02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:35.000]
Or maybe just getting him off

[02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:41.180]
Demarol and morphine, his problem is asleep disorder, he's up to 48 hours of the time and then crashes

[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:48.160]
When I ask Ratner about his work with Jackson and soul, he says patient doctor relationships are not something I choose to comment about

[02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:57.560]
In Washington DC, in about 2001 after Jackson appeared at a benefit concert for 9-11 victims, he left his ubiquitous black bag filled with his prescription drugs behind

[02:31:57.560 --> 02:32:00.900]
It was found by Washington police, so we turned it no questions asked

[02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:07.920]
Clearly, Michael Jackson is not the defenseless creature and victim of racism he and his family in hand were so assiduously claim him to be

[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:12.980]
In the never-ending stream of interviews they grant and mostly dominate on cable TV and network news shows

[02:32:12.980 --> 02:32:22.820]
And in real life he doesn't speak in the false set he employed most recently in the controversial 60 minutes interview on CBS in December when he was asked only very general questions relating to the current case

[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:26.200]
And when he charged that he had been injured by the Santa Barbara police during his arrest

[02:32:26.780 --> 02:32:32.620]
People have spent time with Jackson report that he has a soft but normal guys voice in the phrase of one person

[02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:41.500]
Since his charges of police brutality have largely backfired his slide is once again claiming that the side is once again claiming that the family accusing him now is only out for money

[02:32:41.500 --> 02:32:48.960]
And that set of Harbor County District attorney Tom Stedden who along with LA County officials investigated him in 93 but didn't bring charges is out for revenge

[02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:54.240]
Those are the twin spins held by Jackson supporters whether they coincide with the facts or not

[02:32:54.860 --> 02:33:00.260]
The 10-year-old boy had been given only a few weeks to live and Michael Jackson was number three on his wish list of people he wanted to meet

[02:33:00.260 --> 02:33:06.200]
Adam Sandler was first and then Chris Tucker but at just a moment in 2000 when he was being asked to come up with the names

[02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:15.460]
Jackson's image happened to be on MTV in his hospital room and he put into the screen and told his friend Jamie Masada on a LA's life factory I want to meet Michael Jackson too

[02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:22.820]
In order to get the boy who weighed only 60 pounds to eat Masada would say you've got to get better if you're going to see Adam Sandler

[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:29.480]
The Hispanic boy from East LA had been operated on for an eight pound cancerous tumor on his left kidney his spleen and kidney had been removed

[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:36.460]
But the cancer is spread across his lungs and liver he hadn't taken the chemotherapy well and his blood type was the rare own negative CMV negative

[02:33:36.460 --> 02:33:43.160]
He had sores in his mouth and couldn't keep any food down he started a week candle open ice cream but after two spoons he started vomiting blood

[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:47.460]
Masada recalls would you try again Masada beg them if you eat you can meet anyone you want

[02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:54.040]
The boy gradually got better and after several months Masada who visited daily took him in his wheelchair to the life factory on sunset strip

[02:33:54.040 --> 02:34:00.620]
where the comics on stage took special notice of him some of them also did benefits for him and anyone who donated blood out of the club free

[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:08.500]
Masada a charitable Iranian immigrant who arrived in LA at the age of 14 sponsors the life factories comedy camp during the summer

[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:15.080]
The program helps underprivileged children turn their pain into laughs by having them do stand up routines under the two lids well known comedians

[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:19.760]
The boy in question along with his younger brother and older's where the hell is it?

[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:32.320]
Older sister had participated in the camp Masada phone neverland told whoever answered to try to watch a local TV broadcast that night about the blood drive for the boy and asked if Michael Jackson would call to cheer him up

[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:42.080]
Two days later Jackson called at that time the voice parents would married as teenagers when their early 30s instilled together when they followed a household where money was always short

[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:52.460]
One Saturday in last December I visited the gritty East LA suburbs where the family had lived in the arts here in El Monte where the boys' maternal grandparents reside used clothes and toys priced at $0.50

[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:56.800]
were displayed in Mercado style lawns and across bushes what is that?

[02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:59.820]
Market style I see like an open air market

[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:02.280]
Thank you very much.

[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:15.740]
Many people spoke only as Sponial and would say little about the family there were no drawn curtains and no trespassing sign on the grandparents door to the lower middle class people with little education living these small filled streets neverland with all its enticements but seemed like an incredible dream.

[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:28.920]
Both parents accompanied the boy along with the sister and brother neverland in August 2000 to meet Jackson the father also went with the boy to have lunch on the Sony lot with Adam Sandler who introduced him to Rob Schneider, Chris Tucker according to Masada became kind of a mentor to the boy.

[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:33.900]
Outfitting him in a Nike clothes the boy in turn took Tucker to Neverland to introduce him to Jackson.

[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:42.980]
George Lopez also befriended the boy these comics are now distancing themselves from the case and they represent his early acknowledge or even deny their clients meetings with him.

[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:53.880]
One day when the boy began to improve he told Masada me and my dad went to Neverland not long after Masada claims the father stopped by the life act to show off a car with the TV in it which he said was a gift from Jackson.

[02:35:53.880 --> 02:36:08.180]
Jackson and also in his family his pickup director go to chemotherapy appointments but they didn't pay many visits Neverland after about a year and a half of Kimo Masado says and all the special attention from the comics and trips Neverland the boys can't you when cancer went into remission.

[02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:13.420]
So you see what a small price to pay being molested for your cancer went to remission right there you go.

[02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:15.000]
Okay to be continued.

[02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:17.840]
God it is so long and the story too.

[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:21.180]
Now you're not going to be nothing are you.

[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:21.520]

[02:36:22.700 --> 02:36:35.780]
Remember I mentioned this before I must forgot it because you never mind don't forget from the Boston Globe by Derek Z Jackson Bible lessons these clergy forgot because they're gnashing their teeth and forming at the mouth about those gay marriages up there in Boston.

[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:46.180]
He says Boston Archbishop Sean O'Malley is called the decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to legalize same sex marriage or tragedy and part of the madness around us.

[02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:53.420]
Catholic bishops in the US voted to declare homosexual acts immoral many prominent black ministers have condemned the S.J.C.s ruling.

[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:58.140]
Sounding like Mississippi's senator Trent lot who once compared homosexuality to addiction.

[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:05.320]
Bishop Gilbert Thompson of Boston's New Covenant Christian school said to say the research of thing is a gay Christian is saying there's an honest thief.

[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:10.880]
Many black ministers are indignant and any parallels to gay marriage in the African American civil rights movement.

[02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:19.720]
The Reverend Wesley Roberts of Boston peoples back to church said to equate what is happening now to the civil rights struggle which black said to go through would be to be little what we've gone through as a people.

[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:27.700]
Top politicians in Massachusetts is governor Mitt Romney and House Speaker Thomas Finner and are exploring every way possible to block the S.J.C.s ruling.

[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:35.740]
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry like many politically correct wishy washy centrist since he supports civil unions but opposes gay marriage.

[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:44.360]
Republican president Bush of course opposes gay marriage and built Clinton the Democrats signed the defensive marriage act which allow states to disregard gay marriages from other states.

[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:52.940]
To date the ministers and politicians have offered no serious evidence to show how loving gay or lesbian couples are changing rings at an altar will level the republic.

[02:37:53.320 --> 02:38:00.320]
O'Malley warns we can't afford to be asleep at the switch. Romney says marriage between men and women is defended by 3000 years of recorded history.

[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:07.100]
The Reverend Gregory Groover of Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church says the voice of God tells him that gay marriage is wrong.

[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:13.880]
This is as wrong headed as using the Bible justifies slavery not how the African American ministers could forget that argument.

[02:38:14.340 --> 02:38:22.460]
Such clergy plays a game of pick and choose conservative Christians rush to pause letter to the Romans for proof that homosexuality is a wicked degrading passion.

[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:30.300]
Paul complained their women exchange natural intercourse for unnatural and in the same way also the men giving up natural intercourse with women were consumed with passion.

[02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:36.440]
Men committed shameless acts with men they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die.

[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:41.240]
It is just as easy to find chapters in the Bible that are way out of step on the march through the equality.

[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:47.660]
Ephesians says wives be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church.

[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:52.700]
Just as the church is subject to Christ so also wives ought to be in everything to their husbands.

[02:38:52.700 --> 02:39:03.700]
That one out with the Flintstones Ephesians also says slaves obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling in the singleness of your heart as you obey Christ render service with enthusiasm as to the Lord.

[02:39:03.940 --> 02:39:05.800]
That one out with the emancipation proclamation.

[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:08.880]
One would think these ministers have more important things to do.

[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:14.140]
The Catholic Church has some nerve talking about the sanctity of marriage when it allowed untold numbers of children to be abused by priests.

[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:22.580]
In their tortured thinking black ministers who fret about gay marriage is it because of the epidemic of fatherlessness and they cared about fatherlessness they ought to fight harder for jobs.

[02:39:22.580 --> 02:39:30.220]
Child support mentoring programs public education and a change in the drug laws that punish young urban black men far more harshly than young suburban white men.

[02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:34.720]
While they're right that they could also call for a boycott of black entertainment television and its pink videos.

[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:43.280]
The best guess is that these clergy are so loud in their condemnation of gay marriages because they need a scape-joke to obscure their failures or powerlessness in protecting their flocks.

[02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:49.500]
Gay marriage of two loving people cannot possibly be equated with the abuse of children and the Catholic Church's cover-up.

[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:53.480]
Gay marriage of loving people does not belittle the civil rights struggle it gives it full blossom.

[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:57.580]
Funny these ministers have conveniently forgotten the passage from numbers which says,

[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:04.200]
as for the assembly there shall be for both you and the resident alien a single statute, a perpetual statute throughout your generations.

[02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:07.340]
You and the alien who resides with you shall be alike before the Lord.

[02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:10.500]
You and the alien who reside with you shall have the same law and the same ordinance.

[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:19.420]
The Christian ministers have forgotten the words from Galatians that among the baptize there is no longer a Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male or female.

[02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:29.440]
There is only 27 after 1 at 560 WQM I got something good for is that everybody can enjoy with your diabetic for just a normal everyday Joe and that's indirect diabetic.

[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:38.100]
It's a delicious meal replacement drink that sweetened with splendour which is made with sugar so you don't have that nasty aftertaste like the drinks that are sweetened with aspera, aspera, aspera, or saccharin.

[02:40:38.100 --> 02:40:39.820]
They taste like aspera, tame.

[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:45.020]
Recommended by doctors and dietitians for people who can't sacrifice proper nutrition just because they're in a hurry.

[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:56.060]
Endurex diabetics is a completely balanced nutritional supplement that provides use with all the essential vitamins minerals you need for a healthy life plus fiber and the oxidancy at the good news is it's low in saturated fat and cholesterol too.

[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:02.920]
Endurex diabetics gluten free and lactose free and 8 ounce can provides 237 calories of easy digested nutrition.

[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:06.600]
Pick it up all over town now more and more people are picking it up and drinking it and doing it.

[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:16.340]

Buy and local here's for 3.560 she'll 8.8 am.

[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:59.700]
The fridge is controlled because everything that you thought I would be is falling apart right in front of you.

[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:10.800]
You're a bastard.

[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:19.140]
I was on my way to whitekin with snow and not knowing from all there into snow was lots of ice.

[02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:26.520]
So I get right on a store and low and beholden I should think that my head and my diet.

[02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:34.160]
So try it you like it and just one other thing I might invite.

[02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:35.640]
Watch your step.

[02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:41.140]
He hates the frozen ice of her head so you don't crack cold in your head.

[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:44.620]
And diet doesn't matter where you're at.

[02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:49.180]
I heard you was fat.

[02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:54.100]
And a heart problem man and died because of it.

[02:42:54.220 --> 02:42:56.100]
I'm saying evil people are the people.

[02:42:57.040 --> 02:42:59.760]
Crazy people are crazier than a bed bug.

[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:05.800]
Now what is this on my I'm telling I don't we need to be until midnight or a little more Lincoln Park to the other.

[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:09.840]
I want to tell you that he's more like me.

[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:24.180]
Well I like that series just emailed me on 18 year veteran of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office is accused of stealing wallets of cash from six men during traffic stops.

[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:25.480]
What a great way to make a living.

[02:43:25.700 --> 02:43:26.980]
He was marauding the guatts.

[02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:33.700]
In one case threatening to arrest a man who questioned his question about the missing money and threatening them deported.

[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:37.740]
Happens to all the time.

[02:43:37.940 --> 02:43:41.000]
They deported James Taketiko's.

[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:49.320]
So it's pretty one resigning with charge with grand theft a third degree felony is accused of stealing more than seven seventy six hundred bucks from Guadalaman,

[02:43:49.460 --> 02:43:52.740]
and Mexican guys while he was on duty.

[02:43:54.020 --> 02:43:58.200]
Did it and I create duty while he was doing his duty.

[02:43:58.440 --> 02:43:59.880]
That's another thing in Palm Beach.

[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:05.800]
Jesus there's so many I got one piece of the news and it's all a carry business that's going on and everything else.

[02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:08.760]
Harvard approved students sex magazine.

[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:10.000]
Oh thank god.

[02:44:10.020 --> 02:44:12.160]
Don't let the Michael Powell see that's going to be next.

[02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:16.260]
Oh look at this I can't believe it.

[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:24.380]
We're all going to burn in hell for watching this incubus video more than once in a day.

[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:29.780]
Wow.

[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:39.140]
Anyway see right after they finish with the cable and with the satellite and everything else that's going to be the anything in print books magazines.

[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:41.720]
They might have to burn a few of those books.

[02:44:41.980 --> 02:44:44.320]
That's correct and some of the people who wrote them too.

[02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:47.640]
We're going to be burning witches at the stake in Salem again.

[02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:51.200]
Harvard University has approved a student magazine about sex.

[02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:52.320]
Oh my god.

[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:58.620]
That will feature arts, sex advice and fiction as well as photographs of undressed Harvard undergraduates.

[02:44:58.620 --> 02:44:59.100]
Oh right.

[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:12.340]
We are aware of the fact that some segments of the population would find the contents of this tasteful said associate dean, Judith H. Kid, no relation to Trevor Kid, a member of the 14 person board that approves all student organizations.

[02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:17.960]
However the committee considered this to be an issue of freedom of speech and my question would be what's that?

[02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:18.860]
I don't know.

[02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:19.740]
Never heard of it.

[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:21.300]
Freedom of speech.

[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:23.740]
You know, I'm not a big fan of his.

[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:24.880]
He makes me sick, Mel Carmison.

[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:25.580]
Mm-hmm.

[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:28.280]
But he made a good point yesterday and probably many others that didn't hear.

[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:34.460]
And that is that they continue making all of these threats to commission but they never tell a broadcast what the real regulations are.

[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:38.120]
Yes. They have these vague and you know they won't really define it for you.

[02:45:38.420 --> 02:45:45.100]
It's like having a big gigantic highway, a brand new highway they build and all the smokies are sitting around with their radar detect with their radar guns.

[02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:46.800]
And they won't tell you what the speed limit is.

[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:47.600]
Why don't you figure it out?

[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:49.780]
We'll let you know when you break it.

[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:50.160]
Right.

[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:17.040]
The committee made up of faculty, seven students approved.

[02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:20.340]
H bomb magazine Tuesday with a 12th and nothing vote.

[02:46:21.220 --> 02:46:25.120]
The vote lets the magazine's publishers apply for funding but doesn't guarantee the money.

[02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:26.940]
When it would be published is uncertain.

[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:29.860]
The magazine can't take its photos on university property.

[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:32.880]
A policy that applies for all the schools undergraduate publications.

[02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:36.600]
Vassar and Swarthmore colleges also have sex themed magazines.

[02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:40.180]
Though H bomb is the first such publication for Harvard.

[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:49.200]
A Harvard closing newspapers through a described H bomb is a porn magazine but it's supposed to be a description of the statement released by Harvard itself.

[02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:56.560]
We are proposing what we are proposing is an outlet for literary and artistic expression that is both deserved and needed not a pornographic magazine.

[02:46:56.920 --> 02:46:59.080]
If there are naked people there must be pornographic.

[02:46:59.160 --> 02:46:59.340]
No.

[02:46:59.940 --> 02:47:00.560]
No. 30.

[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:04.180]
Just like our website. We got some naked people on there. Is it pornographic? No.

[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:05.000]
No. 30.

[02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:05.940]
Yeah.

[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:15.240]
I think I saw the three wise ladies on this video there is some time too.

[02:47:16.180 --> 02:47:21.100]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pound, five, sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:24.300]
What do you think is the best recording artist or group of the past ten years?

[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:28.640]
Dave Matthews band is so far ahead of winning hands down your pants. Not even close.

[02:47:29.740 --> 02:47:30.460]
WQA and hello.

[02:47:31.180 --> 02:47:32.380]
Hey, how are you doing, bud?

[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:32.840]
Okay.

[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:34.080]
I got a name for you Paul, man.

[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:34.660]
Yes sir.

[02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:35.540]
311?

[02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:37.460]
311.

[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:38.360]
Yeah.

[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:39.480]
Might have to look that out.

[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:40.580]
Not very popular.

[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:41.900]
They are good band but it's been around.

[02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:42.520]
How long have you been around?

[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:44.660]
It's not ten years, not ten years.

[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:46.380]
But they don't get much airplay. That's a problem.

[02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:47.160]
Okay.

[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:49.200]
I got a couple of things too.

[02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:50.060]
You know what I mean?

[02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:54.040]
We was watching that Spanish channel last week and it's your actual movie on that channel.

[02:47:55.180 --> 02:47:56.040]
That's your last week.

[02:47:56.500 --> 02:47:58.340]
Plus the naked twangers you've had last week.

[02:47:58.720 --> 02:47:59.080]
Excellent.

[02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:01.460]
So I don't know why we don't get on them also.

[02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:03.540]
Now they're not speaking the right language, man.

[02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:04.300]
We don't care about them.

[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:05.800]
They can say or do whatever they want.

[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:05.940]
Right.

[02:48:05.980 --> 02:48:06.800]
I got one more thing on my face.

[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:07.660]
Let's get one more for that.

[02:48:07.660 --> 02:48:08.180]
Instead of sure.

[02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:08.860]
Decent.

[02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:09.660]
Right.

[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:15.440]
I was driving down sample a couple of months ago and I've seen something on a billboard you might like on a chart.

[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:18.000]
It said, God accept an email.

[02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:18.980]
They'll figure it out.

[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:20.940]
And that's starting to advertise it.

[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:24.860]
God accepts an email.

[02:48:25.060 --> 02:48:25.940]
I didn't get on your knees.

[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:27.680]
Oh, a knee with a K.

[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:29.740]
Oh my god.

[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:31.060]
It actually said that.

[02:48:31.060 --> 02:48:32.540]
And I wanted to call you a couple of months ago.

[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:34.040]
But I'll call you on the phone.

[02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:36.460]
That's enough to maybe drop a big load right in this year.

[02:48:36.580 --> 02:48:38.060]
In fact, I think I just did.

[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:38.860]
Have a great day, Polly.

[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:39.840]
Thank you, too, buddy.

[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:40.280]
Thanks.

[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:41.300]
How do you like that?

[02:48:41.380 --> 02:48:42.380]
God accepts an email.

[02:48:43.900 --> 02:48:44.940]
R-R-R-R.

[02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:54.360]
We got pilots on airlines now preaching the poor bastards, the captive audience on a plane.

[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:59.080]
We got farbicinigoy and putting up billboards over about God does this and God does that.

[02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:04.600]
And God accepts an email as you get on your knees, which of course the priests have a lot of practice saying that.

[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:06.240]
Man.

[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:09.760]
And in the meantime, everything's going to hell on a hand-basket.

[02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:11.700]
I think the crazy people have taken over America.

[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:13.200]
Absolutely correct.

[02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:13.760]
Wow.

[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:19.040]
I am the perfect dude to just highlight the way I say it's all you've dressed.

[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:23.780]
I love the way I'm dressed.

[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:24.360]

[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.980]
I love the good times I see red.

[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:31.540]
I love the good times I see red.

[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:34.200]
20-2-2-560 WQN.

[02:49:34.340 --> 02:49:36.880]
President's Day is just a few days away on Monday, no less.

[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:38.900]
And every President's Day for whatever the reason.

[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:40.400]
Do you know what the significance of that is?

[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:41.440]
Day off?

[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:42.940]
No, no, I don't mean that.

[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:46.840]
I mean the fact that they run the mattress sale every President's Day all the betting and department stores.

[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.820]
I guess because George Washington with the father of our country and he slept around.

[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:50.340]
I don't know.

[02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:52.320]
Anyway, here we are at this time.

[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:54.140]
The betting and department stores run the phony sales.

[02:49:54.140 --> 02:49:57.900]
They double the price and they say, look, we're giving a half off and it's right back to where it started.

[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:04.980]
If you don't want to get sucked in by that crap, if you want real rock bottom prices on the best mattress is going every day 365 days a year.

[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:05.740]

In toy stores now, the Janet Jackson Toplas doll comes complete with Terri way Velcro top.

[02:51:12.220 --> 02:51:14.280]

1-45 at 560WQAM.

[02:51:31.420 --> 02:51:35.060]
Just in case you missed this earlier, Miss Drudge is foaming at the mouth.

[02:51:35.220 --> 02:51:37.680]
A world exclusive no less must credit the Drudge report.

[02:51:38.180 --> 02:51:40.360]
Did I just credit the Drudge report? I think I just did.

[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:47.380]
Campaign drama, rocks, Democrats, carry fights off media promo-vreson alleged infantility, rivals predict ruin.

[02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:47.940]
Oh, my God.

[02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:56.100]
A frantic behind the scenes drama's unfolding around Senator John Kerry and his quest to lock up the Democratic nomination represent, the Fudge report can reveal.

[02:51:57.060 --> 02:52:02.060]
Intrigued surrounds a woman who recently fled the country, reportedly at the prodding of Kerry, the Drudge report is learned.

[02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:13.840]
A serious investigation of the woman in the nature of relationship with Senator Kerry has been underway at Time Magazine, ABC News, The Washington Post, The Hill, and the Associated Press, where the woman in question once worked.

[02:52:15.060 --> 02:52:22.720]
A close friend of the woman first approached the reporter late last year claiming fantastic stories, stories that now threaten to turn the race for the presidency on its head.

[02:52:23.380 --> 02:52:28.320]
In an off-the-record conversation with a dozen reporters earlier this week, General Wesley Clark, kindly stated,

[02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:33.820]
Kerry will implode over an intern issue three reporters and attendants confirmed Clark made the startling statements.

[02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:43.740]
The Kerry commotion is why Howard Dean has turned increasingly aggressive against Kerry in recent days, and is the key reason why Dean reversed his decision to drop out of the race after Wisconsin Top Camp.

[02:52:43.740 --> 02:52:46.640]
The campaign sources tell the infamous Fudge report.

[02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:55.500]
Now, USA Today says today, in fact, I don't know if I have time, because I got two of them, one from the New York Daily News, one from USA Today.

[02:52:55.820 --> 02:53:01.640]
See, I think what we're discovering is that there are a bunch of scumbags, so let's start all over again and we'll let Michael Moore just appoint him.

[02:53:04.520 --> 02:53:10.140]
Okay? Michael Moore for present and Martin Sheen for VP. He can hang out in the West Wing.

[02:53:11.860 --> 02:53:28.940]
USA Today reports as Texas Governor George W. Bush prepared to run for president in the late 1990s, top-ranking Texas National Guard officers and Bush advisors discussed ways to limit the release of potentially embarrassing details from Bush's military records as former senior officer of the Texas Guard said yesterday.

[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:43.580]
A second former Texas Guard official was spoke only on condition of anonymity was told by a participant that commanders and Bush advisors were especially worried about mentions in the records of arrest of Bush before we joined the National Guard in 1968, the second official said.

[02:53:44.100 --> 02:53:48.380]
The following is? No. Should I read that again? Could you?

[02:53:48.380 --> 02:54:01.120]
A second former Texas Guard official was spoke only on condition of anonymity was told by a participant that commanders and Bush advisors were especially worried about mentions in the records of arrest of Bush before he joined the National Guard in 1968.

[02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:10.800]
It'll be those DUI billed buckets and a top advisor of the State Guard commander said he overt conversations in which superior discussed cleansing the file of damaging information.

[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:12.040]
Cleansing.

[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:21.380]
The White House dismissed Birketschard yesterday. It is an outrageously false statement said White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett who handled records in late 1990s as an aid to Governor Bush.

[02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:27.040]
Administration officials dismissed Birkets as a disgruntled former guardsman who had a falling out with his superiors.

[02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:35.840]
Two forms in Bush's publicly released military files, his enlistment application in a background check contained blackout entries in response to questions about arrest or convictions.

[02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:46.100]
Bush acknowledged in biographies published in 1999 that he was arrested twice before he listed in the Air National Guard once for steaming a wreath and another time for routiness at a Yale Princeton football game.

[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:56.260]
The nature of what was blacked out in Bush's records is important because certain legal problems such as drug or alcohol violations could have been a basis for denying an applicant entry into the guard or pilot training.

[02:54:56.820 --> 02:55:01.320]
Admission to the guard and to pilot school was highly competitive at the time, the head of the Warren Vietnam.

[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:07.480]
The National Guard said it privacy is the reason for blacking out answers the full onmarked records have never been released.

[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:14.180]
Bartlett didn't respond Wednesday to a request to release the records with nothing blacked out which Bush could do as the subject of the records.

[02:55:15.060 --> 02:55:24.900]
Bartlett says that the state guard commander Major General Daniel James III discussed cleansing Bush's military files of embarrassing or incriminating documents in the summer of 97.

[02:55:24.900 --> 02:55:36.700]
At the time, Berkett was a Lieutenant Colonel Chief Advisor to James. He says he was just outside James open off his door when his boss discussed the records on a speaker phone with Joe Alba who was then Governor Bush's Chief of Staff.

[02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:45.500]
In Berkett's account Alba told James that Bush's press secretary Karen Hughes was preparing a biography needed information on Bush's military service.

[02:55:45.500 --> 02:55:51.600]
In an interview, Berkett said he'd be called Alba's words. We certainly don't want anything that is embarrassing in there.

[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:56.980]
Berkett said he immediately told two others about the conversation and noted it in a daily journal that he kept.

[02:55:57.500 --> 02:56:04.080]
The two officers George Khan and Dennis Adams confirmed he was a day in 2002 that Berkett told them of the conversation within days.

[02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:09.500]
Soon afterward there was a series of meetings of top commanders of Texas Guard headquarters at Camp Maybrey.

[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:15.320]
Bush's records were carried between the base archives and the headquarters building according to Berkett and the second guard official who was there.

[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:22.780]
The meetings were confirmed in a 2002 interview by USA Today with William Leon who was the state guard's Freedom of Interferation Officers in the 90s.

[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:32.060]
He was involved in discussions about what to release. Leon declined a comment on the substance of the meetings except to say we were making sure we released it properly and we made sure we didn't they timely manner.

[02:56:32.060 --> 02:56:40.120]
Contact at home Wednesday and he refused to talk to reporter. He even said don't ever call me again at home. I'll call your publisher and sue you.

[02:56:41.460 --> 02:56:50.400]
Got that got it. Berkett first made his allegation just before the 2000 election when it was carried on some Internet sites but when largely unreported by the mainstream news media.

[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:57.240]
The issue resurfaced yesterday in the Dallas Morning News is Bush's military record took center stage in the presidential campaign again.

[02:56:59.460 --> 02:57:07.700]
Oh man it's just enough to make it weak you know we crank up the FF and if you could find a station to play some real music or just crank up you know what I'm using channels.

[02:57:25.140 --> 02:57:27.140]
You never know what he's going to say you know I'm saying.

[02:57:28.660 --> 02:57:32.240]
Things are going right now don't back that ass up man. Oh geez.
