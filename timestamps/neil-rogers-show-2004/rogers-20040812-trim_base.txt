[00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.480]
What a joke!

[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.160]
Mind if I shed hair stranger?

[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.560]
I'm not gonna do about it.

[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.500]
Where he head?

[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.240]
I'm going west to Deadwood.

[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.540]
Deadwood, then.

[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.340]
Well, I hear they got a lot of curses going on.

[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.260]
I'm looking for a job.

[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.180]
With going to work, you look in fear.

[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.760]
Well, I want to be a coolie.

[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.700]
You know, one of them jinxed that word on the railroad.

[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.500]
He ain't Chinese.

[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.540]
Then I can wait for the China.

[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.700]
Push legal dope.

[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.780]
Next stop, Deadwood, under Russia.

[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.400]
And, who?

[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.540]
Dambanka.

[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.040]
Hell, this is it.

[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.420]
Oh, who love?

[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.300]
Thank you, Dambanka.

[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.600]
I said one step behind.

[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.200]
This must be Deadwood, alright?

[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.300]
Yeah, that's me.

[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.340]
Thank you, I know.

[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.460]
What's that guy's going in there?

[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.080]
I'll put a rubber band on my head.

[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.900]
Ooh!

[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.720]
You better go see Owls' Where I Laugh.

[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.600]
God, I'm fine.

[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.980]
Maybe I could be a hooker.

[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.620]
That's it.

[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.780]
Oh, what the fuck?

[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.500]
You want to talk to me about that?

[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.200]
Yeah, I used to be a big star.

[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.760]
See?

[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.400]
But I got the whole...

[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.640]
Oh, I'm looking for work.

[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.100]
You don't care, son of...

[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.160]
Get this ugly!

[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.880]
You old man out of my office!

[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.160]
And beat him to the piss!

[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.220]
I ain't stupid, I'm a lie!

[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.660]
I don't care to what I say!

[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.660]
Wait!

[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.280]
One more!

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.220]
No care to treat bitches!

[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.060]
I'm Toshin'!

[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.080]
Ow!

[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.300]
Don't do that!

[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.080]
20 after 10 at 560 WDQM.

[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.780]
Here's the poll question today, which is already up and has got a few votes.

[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.300]
One will be the biggest impact of Howard Stern on WDQM.

[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.640]
He'll send the ratings way up.

[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.380]
He'll screw up Neil's show.

[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.660]
He'll bring tons of people back to AM Radio.

[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.540]
Not much.

[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.580]
I don't give a crap about Stern.

[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.820]
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds.

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.140]
Or he'll increase the crank calls big time.

[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.180]
Ha ha ha!

[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.900]
I think I touched all the bases on that poll very well.

[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.920]
And by the way, that is our poll today with the elected or not clearance and Duff.

[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.260]
So Duff was over there in Fort Myers and with the Robert Greeper practicing for a censoring

[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.380]
the Howard Stern Show starting on Monday of being the Dump Button Monkeys sitting there

[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.200]
with our triple Dump.

[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.720]
Never take a triple Dump.

[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.200]
Well, anyway.

[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.660]
Better fact.

[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.200]
Let's see, Craig and Miami says the biggest impact on the Stern Show will be complaints filed

[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.980]
by all those fascist, quizzling old Jews in Miami Beach.

[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.260]
And others, by the way.

[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.000]
Quizzling old goyem.

[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.000]
Speak of quizzlings.

[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.780]
Yes, we have the sovereignty video is up and running on the side.

[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.960]
Okay, the sovereignty one, which is what we play that clip for where Bush gets laughed at by the audience

[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.620]
because he has no idea what they're talking about.

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.980]
The clip is up there on neo-rages.com.

[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.280]
So long we're taking a peek at Eva Herzegovah and at our voting on our poll, take a peek at that too.

[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.480]
And also take a peek at Ricky Williams' appropriate video if you haven't seen that.

[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.520]
Or even look at it again.

[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.420]
In fact, the best way to watch that is if you're smoking a big fat one and then watching the video.

[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.380]
At same time.

[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.960]
Indeed.

[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.760]
Kind of like doing it in the stereo.

[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.100]
So anyway, we've got a few votes on there already.

[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.540]
Let's take a peek and see how it's coming because we have very limited time today.

[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.760]
Thanks to the Marlins.

[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.220]
Oh right.

[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.860]
We love the Marlins and especially when they play day games.

[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.820]
And like I said the other day, in fact, maybe that was another one of my psychic moments.

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.380]
Remember when I said to you, what's really going to be great is when Stern is on

[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.280]
and we started about 10.45, close to 11 o'clock.

[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.100]
And then at 12.30 we bail off for the Marlins pre-game show.

[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.680]
Oh yeah!

[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.460]
And get paid not the same but more because Stern coming on guarantees the double bonus every reading book.

[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.800]
Guarantee.

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.240]
Cheng.

[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.320]
Are you starting with a change stuff again?

[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.260]
Oh, touching.

[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.980]
What will be the biggest impact of Howard Stern on WDQA and we got 43 votes so far, nothing in the spectacular.

[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.980]
He'll send the ratings way up 18.

[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.660]
I don't give a crap about Stern 9.

[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.460]
He'll bring tons of people back to AM Radio 6.

[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.160]
He'll screw up Neil Show 5.

[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.700]
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds 3.

[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.980]
He'll increase the crank calls big time 2 and not much none.

[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.360]
Oh!

[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.380]
Big O!

[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.580]
None say the whole thing.

[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.440]
There's no big impact.

[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.660]
I think that's obviously true, right?

[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.560]
Right.

[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.480]
But for this audience it's pretty amazing.

[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.440]
Now you saw that the L president ate nominated Porter Goss of Florida to be the new director of the CIA.

[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.180]
Right, Goss, the other political.

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.660]
Now first of all, probably most people don't know this, that's not his real name.

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.560]
If you know what his real first name is, I give up.

[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.220]
Misha.

[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.620]
Yeah, that's his real name.

[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.020]
And of course it comes to Jewish so he didn't want to be called Misha Goss.

[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.260]

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.700]
Oh.

[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.820]
President Bush has said that Representative Porter Goss is the right man to lead the CIA.

[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.960]
This is in the New York Daily News today to lead the CIA but as a five months ago, the nominee didn't think even he was qualified to work there.

[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.700]
Much less be the director.

[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.960]
The Florida Republican tool filmmaker Michael Moore in March, it is true I was a case officer,

[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.860]
claimed this in services officer and yes, I do understand the commission of the business,

[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.000]
but I couldn't get a job of the CIA today.

[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.940]
I'm not qualified.

[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.020]
He's got this on film, by the way.

[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.060]
Goss who went on to become a multi-millionaire in the congressman after leaving his job as an agent explained,

[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.480]
I don't have the language skills.

[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.320]
I, you know, my language skills were romance languages and stuff working for Arabists today.

[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.960]
I don't have the cultural background probably and I certainly don't have the technical skills as my children remind me every day.

[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.840]
Dad, you got to get better on your computer.

[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.400]
So the things that you need to have, I don't have.

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.660]
More interviewed, Goss, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for the Documentary Fair and High 9-11,

[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.500]
the part was edited out by Moore Still has all the footage.

[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.860]
I'm sure it's a lie.

[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.500]
Liberal lie.

[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.000]
Michigan Goss faces tough criticism in the confirmation process from colleagues like Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator J. Rockefeller,

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.060]
who agree with him that he is not qualified.

[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.860]
Here's the guy who says, oh, I'm not qualified to even work there.

[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.600]
Much less be director.

[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.740]
And Bush says, oh, yes, stick him on there because he's a good partisan Republican.

[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.120]
And it will suck up to the Florian's real good too.

[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.800]
That's a bit rich.

[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.420]
Now, do you think that most people in Florida have any idea about Michigan Goss?

[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.060]
I don't think I have any clue what that's all about.

[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.140]
5.670560.

[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.100]
We'll kind of interspersive you called here today because I know we got a lot of great calls coming lately.

[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.420]
We'll have some heavy-duty stuff to pass along and then we'll zip right into that Marlon pre-game show.

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.460]
It sounds like a plan to make.

[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.600]
Like it about 12...

[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.520]
About 30, man.

[00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.080]
About 30.

[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.080]
And then of course, like I said, after the Volga game, you got Mohawar David.

[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.760]
Oh, don't go.

[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.740]
Going in for the suspended Hank Goldberg.

[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.080]
He much beloved and much mist-hank Goldberg, the Humper.

[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.840]
The Rotten.

[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.540]
Superstar, sports radio, what do you have to know?

[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.100]
I'm going to tell you, if they think we're going to sit still on this show and watch you Hank,

[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.140]
if you know, just tossed on ceremony slay off the door, they're not going to happen.

[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.920]
We're not going to sit still, but we're not going to put up with it, all right?

[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.720]
You grave robbers.

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.000]
You'd easily be...

[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.140]
Oh, it just tells me that the kid with a banjo, he's still hanging out over there at Beasley Headquarters on a West Coast.

[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.240]
Yeah, still pushed.

[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.780]
Yeah, got a little long in the tooth, but of course that's the one tooth.

[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.200]
He gives Numeen the expression long in the tooth.

[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.040]
He's still picking on it in the banjo, too.

[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040]
Somebody QA in the hospital.

[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.860]
Hello.

[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.140]
Somebody QA in the hospital.

[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.400]
Hi, Valley.

[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.160]
Somebody QA, by the way, a fat boy is still in the hospital.

[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.200]
QA in, hello.

[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.620]
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.060]
Good morning, buddy.

[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.320]
Great.

[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.900]
Hey, listen, I want to talk a little bit about the weather.

[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.860]
You know, when there's a hurricane and on the right side of that hurricane, not only do you not get rained,

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.680]
but the weather is fantastic.

[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.900]
It clears up, blue skies, and everything.

[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.560]
So one thing to remember, with the hurricane, there's always a blow and a suck, okay?

[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:09.800]
Yeah.

[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.640]
All right.

[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.560]
I think your call was one of those, in fact, maybe both.

[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.400]
26 past 10 at 5.

[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.840]
60.

[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.500]
Is he picking on Brian or across again?

[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.840]
Yeah.

[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.040]
Good.

[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.480]
Nice going.

[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.420]
A little Brian or across the weather, furry.

[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.360]
Getting everybody whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.940]
Is there any rain out there?

[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.960]
Look out your window right now.

[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.200]
I'll be right back.

[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.940]
See any rain?

[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.300]
No.

[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.220]
In fact, I'm looking out my window.

[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.080]
I see blue skies.

[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.860]
The sun is shining.

[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.540]
Looks beautiful.

[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.140]
Hey, if we are what we eat, why don't we just eat better?

[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.760]
Well, the truth of the matter is we are creatures of heaven when it comes to eating.

[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.740]
We don't want to give up those comfort foods.

[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.200]
Our taste buds basically rule our logic.

[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.500]
For those of you out there on low carb diets, you know how hard it is to live without pizza.

[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.500]
So if you're on one of the low carb diets, cut and carbs' cafe has got a real treat for you.

[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.740]
Cut and carbs' cafe will find them in sunrise.

[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.200]
They're building up a following for their multi-grain pizza.

[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.520]
Their multi-grain pizza is full of fiber that delivers a great taste.

[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.340]
Imagine that a pizza you really can eat while staying two-year low carb diet.

[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.580]
It's all about their philosophy of good low carbs, good ones.

[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.020]
Cut and carbs' cafe understands that you owe it to yourself and your kids to eat better.

[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.280]
So how about eating a tasty pizza with less carbs and turning those carbs into lean muscle?

[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.880]
And there's nothing like having a lean muscle.

[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.120]
Give them a try by calling them at 9.5.4.

[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.020]
5.14.001.

[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.000]
I think they only want me to do this so I can read that phone number 80 million times ago.

[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.400]
9.5.4.514.

[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.280]
Oh! Oh!

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.300]
Oh! One.

[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.720]
They're located in the same place as Applebee's and Office Depot and the Sungrace.

[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.580]
Come today at 9.5.4.

[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.460]
5.14.

[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.680]
Oh! Oh!

[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:37.800]
One.

[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.320]
Come carbs' cafe also has a conservative way out.

[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.940]
Raff, Sobie Salads, Carbo Diaz, as well as some fat-free low carb ice cream too.

[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.080]
This copy is garbage.

[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.160]
Just drop this number down and soon you're going to be enjoying that delicious pizza made fresh to order and stop feeling girly.

[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.500]
Don't delay column right now at 9.5.4.

[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.620]
5.14.

[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.280]
Oh! Oh!

[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:56.820]
Oh!

[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.300]
One.

[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.900]
That's 9.5.4.

[00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.800]
5.14.

[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.300]
Oh! Oh!

[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.000]
One and be sure and tell them that an old Neil Sinterbaugh.

[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.360]
5.14.

[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.400]
Look all the 65 species.

[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.180]
The radio's on yours now.

[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.020]
A few in.

[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.720]
I guess that's okay.

[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.940]
I see you screwed me up on that.

[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.960]
What would it be?

[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.060]
No, Karen screwed me up on the whole thing.

[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.040]
I'll skip that.

[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.900]
We don't have time for it anyway.

[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.600]
Right.

[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.980]
I was going to put a Brian Rorckross bit.

[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.280]
I mean, that's a rejoin.

[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.000]
That's where it was.

[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.440]
Oh no, that's the nothing new data.

[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.780]
It's a lot of data.

[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:39.460]
It's a lot of data.

I think Duff is going to have a nervous breakdown.

[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.820]
We should have put that on there too.

[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.120]
Okay.

[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.720]
Duff Lindsay has a nervous breakdown.

[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.260]
Yeah, let's get that on there right away.

[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.140]
I'll add it.

[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.300]
Because he had a couple of days of practice over there on a West Coast.

[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.200]
And evidently yesterday, I can't use the N word.

[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:25.660]
But evidently, the entire last 45 minutes of this during show were involved in various descriptions of the N word.

[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.800]
As in kiss a good morning and things like that.

[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.820]
And monkey and a lot of a pejorative term.

[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.180]

[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.180]
So your carpets are drying just an hour and a half.

[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.020]
They smell emity fresh.

[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.960]
They look like brand new.

[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.320]
You really can clean today and entertain tonight.

[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.440]
With all these years of continuous service and soft food, I guarantee you,

[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.780]
I bet Greg reads life on it.

[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.400]
You can trust the good folks at dry concepts to do a stupendous, unbeatable job.

[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.120]
And right now, to save an extra 15% off on the already unbeatable price,

[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.860]
tell them to put you under stand-by list when you call dry concepts.

[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.320]
And they'll save you like I said even more than they're already unbeatable price.

[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.960]
Call them toll for a 1-800-248-5071.

[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.860]
That's 1-800-248-5071 or online at dryconcepts.com.

[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.860]
Dry concepts making carpets clean since 1979.

[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.180]
Oh, just shabet.

[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.940]
The Teresa Heinz carry book of it.

[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.180]
I don't have time for all this.

[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.120]
Let me finish.

[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.320]
I eat some hot.

[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.120]
Hello.

[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.160]
I am Teresa Heinz Kelly.

[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.640]
I know fine languages.

[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.680]
That makes me smarter than you.

[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.180]
I am a billionaire.

[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.460]
That makes me richer than you.

[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.720]
I have been married to two politicians.

[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.220]
That makes me a whole lot, unhappier than you.

[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.060]
So just find my grandpa.

[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.860]
Sit down and shut up.

[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.320]
And if you don't like what I am saying,

[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:44.600]
SHABET!

[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.420]
The Teresa Heinz carry book of etiquette is available wherever, find me.

[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.200]
Shut up!

[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.260]
She's heavily medicated and makes no mistake about that.

[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.660]
1047-560WQM Marlon pregame at 1230.

[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.300]
The Cardinals in town are playing at Marlins again.

[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.940]
Marlins had a couple of tough losses.

[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:58.920]
Can't score any runs.

[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.320]
They got the runs.

[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:00.860]
Not.

[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.800]
Now let's fast you just send me if there's anything I love.

[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.600]
It's people that tell me what to say and what to think and what to do.

[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.240]
I love that.

[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.060]
It says it's great that Howard Stern is going to be hurting it in South Florida.

[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.440]
The more freedom of speech, at least as much as a lot of the day on the air waves, the better.

[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.020]
Plus since Howard is increasingly filling his airtime with bush bashing,

[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.920]
that can only help our cause, especially in this way instead of Florida.

[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.540]
I can curl with that whole heartedly.

[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.220]
In fact, maybe Howard and I can team up to make sure that Kerry wins Florida.

[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:26.940]
Huh?

[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.320]
Maybe.

[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:34.600]
It says now another part in underlined and in a big bowl print.

[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.020]
However, it is crucial.

[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.740]
Oh, and before I read the rest of this, this is a hoot.

[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.960]
I noticed that you, I'm looking at that radar, there's a little blob in the glades,

[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.440]
but it's nowhere near a data browser.

[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.680]
I noticed that you, now I want them up, Lindsay to understand.

[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.840]
I said, let's put on there.

[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.100]
Duff Lindsay will have a nervous breakdown.

[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.880]
He said, okay.

[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.960]
And then you put on the pole.

[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.820]
Duff Lindsay will have another nervous breakdown.

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.620]
Is that what you said?

[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.440]
No, it's something something like something the stones would sing.

[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.440]
Is it maybe his 19th?

[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:07.960]
Or maybe it's like,

[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.080]
another nervous breakdown.

[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:10.580]
That's bad.

[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.720]
But at any rate, he's got any votes.

[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.180]
He's got one.

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.080]
He probably voted that.

[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.280]
Anyway, this facts, unsigned, of course.

[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.380]
However, it is crucial that QAM not censor Howard show locally.

[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.940]
I sure hope that Muckers listening to this.

[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.520]
In this post-superbowl wardrobe malfunction era,

[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.600]
Howard's network already has at least five layers of dumps and delays.

[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.420]
He's constantly doing battle with his network censors

[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.380]
who are hard at work protecting his listeners.

[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.640]
Don't add to the unlistability of the show.

[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.400]
For QAM, this is the perfect example of you knew what you were getting scenario.

[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.580]
Remember the Rush Limbaugh and the ESPN?

[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.580]
Or Scott Farrell on QAM?

[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.480]
If QAM is bringing Howard on board for his ratings,

[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.940]
why would a wanna further chop up a show that's already chopped up at the network level?

[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.180]
When it's precisely that on the edge content that brings in listeners,

[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.880]
well, I guess we want a lot of on the edge content brings in listeners,

[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.760]
but people don't want to lose their license, goofball, expert.

[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.020]
It says, by the way, as soon as Burshines is in a radio and decency act in the law,

[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.640]
which will penalize not only stations but also broadcasters,

[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.280]
Howard's his, he will just play music to one of the 17 months left on his contract.

[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.460]
Great, that'll bring in the end revenues and listeners.

[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.460]
He also said that as soon as Mel Carmison got canned or left the infinity

[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.840]
and via a con that he was gonna bail out and he'd take a walk along with some other people.

[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.400]
Did he say that?

[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.500]
Yes, he did.

[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.140]
Did he take a walk?

[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:26.520]
No.

[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.620]
Is he still there?

[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:28.360]
Yes.

[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:28.920]
Yes.

[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.280]
Also, and here's my favorite part of this facts.

[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.740]
I love people that are condescending that talk down to you like,

[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.200]
well, you better understand this and you better understand that.

[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.460]
Also, don't integrate stern listeners.

[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.780]
Studies are showing that they were intelligent, wealthy,

[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.220]
and they can impact in the election and support our anti-Bursh cars all the same team.

[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.100]
Some of them, I'm sure, are intelligent, wealthy and will make an impact.

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.480]
A lot of them are morons, just like our audience.

[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.060]
So this is so an answer about, don't say this.

[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.080]
I'll say whatever I want to say, okay?

[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.520]
Unless, of course, it's about something we can't say, like Hank.

[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.940]
Our good close personal fat friend Hank,

[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.780]
which really frosted my ass.

[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.620]
I know that they would just like to have him like Vanishing Disappear

[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.620]
and an addition to which anything that Moe has involved,

[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.100]
I always wonder what kind of subversive stuff just might be going on in the background.

[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:15.680]
You know what I mean?

[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.160]
I wonder what kind of crap is going on there.

[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.360]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Paraiso Wireless Line.

[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.540]
Porter don't call me Misha Goss, says he's not qualified to be even a member of the CI,

[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.340]
much less the director, and Michael Moore has got it on film,

[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.020]
the interview right from the Horses ass.

[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.440]
I love it.

[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.500]
What will be the biggest impact of how it's stern on QA and 241 votes is our,

[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.200]
well, we're getting a few votes on this one anyway.

[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.960]
He'll send the ratings way up 81.

[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.320]
I don't give a crap about stern 60.

[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.480]
He'll screw up Neal's show 37.

[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.100]
He'll bring tons of people back to AM Radio 29.

[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.120]
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds 20.

[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.740]
He'll increase the crank calls big time 8, not much impact 5,

[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.680]
and definitely you'll have another nervous breakdown.

[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.540]
Another nervous breakdown.

[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.480]
1 vote for that.

[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.860]

[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.680]
National Hurricane Center now. What's that guy's name? You know, I don't know. What

[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.780]
uh, Sean, is it a requirement to work that they have absolutely no

[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.700]
personality at all? Are you like a deadpan dead pus? I mean, that guy is pathetic.

[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.040]
They just had him on CNN and he said, Oh, beware on the West Coast or Florida. West

[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.220]
Coast. For as the hurricane, it's gonna make that little turn that you turn over

[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.880]
the West Coast to Cuba and come up along the West Coast of Tampa and be wearing

[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.020]
the keys. We got how many listeners we got in the keys.

[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.960]
He's got 30 men. Mattin down the hatches. Ron Harrison is still dead, right?

[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:20.860]
Far as I know. Yeah. I just, I just don't get it. I just don't understand so much crap

[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:25.540]
that happens. What will be the biggest impact of Howard's

[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.700]
during coming to QM this coming Monday morning, August 16th from 6 a.m. to

[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.320]
whenever he's good and ready to give up the ghost and we're more than happy to

[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.420]
sit in the background and the woodwork while Duff is in there with a yellow button

[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.120]
banging and banging and banging and banging. That's a Robert Creeper said he's

[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.440]
spent most of the last two days over there and he was doing banging on it.

[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.900]
They're installing it now as a matter of fact. Are they really? Yes they are. The

[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.860]
82nd delay is an 80 or 30 man. It's a multi-layered multi-rear

[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.700]
word delay. So all you're certain people just be happy that you're going to

[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.500]
get whatever little tidbits you got, you know, whatever a couple of words

[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.560]
here and a couple of words there and then in between Duff's going to be playing

[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.200]
that Thor music. Yeah. Which is there's a little message in that mean that we're

[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.080]
two chickens, Nick, who puts a real stuff on here so we're just going to download

[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:21.500]
and see how it goes. You're going to be hearing that a lot. I'm sure. Wait we have a preview.

[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:27.940]
Yes. Oh you can't say.

[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:37.320]
I'm going to get it going again though. 346 votes on the poll. I give it a full result when I feel like I

[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.220]
wouldn't have a lot of time to deal around here because we got that Marlon pregame show.

[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.080]
Now in case you wonder what this is all about the game was scheduled for tonight but

[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.460]
because the weather theory is about everybody all whipped up into a frenzy about the hurricane.

[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:51.060]
There are some scattered showers that look in the radar. There's a little bit of pop-up

[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:56.380]
here and pop up there and whatever. It's popping up all over the place. A little bit. Nothing

[00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.140]
in the nothing moment is right now but because they were really a feared and scared they don't

[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:06.140]
want to lose this game. It's a big big-ass game. The cardinals in town tonight. I have the

[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:11.220]
best record in baseball and continue to be. It's just amazing and I don't get it. But so they

[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.500]
moved again to an afternoon game. War of five. You can head over there right now and fill

[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.280]
up the ballpark. I see the only had 18,000 some obvious they did the rain last night.

[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:25.160]
Yeah. Was there like some kind of a tornado? Was there like a hurricane the end of the

[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.600]
world? Cloud in the sky? Pigeon with diarrhea? What was the story last night? They only

[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:36.420]
weak fire. Huh? Hale of fire. Pretty weak. Considering. And that's right I forgot though

[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.340]
that they've lost a few games. In fact if you look at the mothlies and the ratings you'll

[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.820]
notice that in June even though the Marlins did very well in the spring book on our

[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.300]
station and on TV as well with the ratings they've ever had. If you look at the June

[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:54.480]
number it's way way down from May. Oh it's picking the numbers right in fall. It's just

[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.940]
dawned on me. I don't know why I'm a little slow sometime because I'm an old fart could

[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:03.740]
be it. But they had like only about a four was it a four seven and men? I forgot. And

[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:08.400]
Lingson stinks in jinx and Texan next to the five one I think I'm saying to beat him out.

[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:14.080]
That was with stern off the air right. So you can imagine once he comes back on the

[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:19.520]
year on Monday how many listeners they're going to have. Wow they got no problems they've

[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:27.820]
got that wall of men. And Duff is jealous. Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:33.020]
on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line at poor child man he'll never be the same. I

[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:37.040]
predict he'll be like we wouldn't like by about nine thirty on Monday it won't take

[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.920]
even two full days. No don't you think based on what you heard this morning what he was

[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.140]
telling us let's start an office pool. No no seriously and how do they know if there's

[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.020]
going to be a topic that's going to be like off limits and that we don't want to have

[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.880]
on the year because it's going to be licensed threatening. How do they know how long

[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.560]
they're going to be talking on it and what are they what are they going to put on in the

[00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:00.120]
middle of it. Seriously because we're not I'm one thing I'll tell you we don't mind

[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.760]
coming on ten fifteen ten thirty year eleven o'clock but we don't come on before ten

[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:17.080]
under any circumstance. No no chance of that. WQM hello. WQM hello. Yes. WQM hello.

[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.440]
Yes sir. I watched my mouth out with still have two days you have company offer very

[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:30.740]
at language that you think they'll be very careful. What do you mean the last few days.

[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.280]
A couple days ago I said something with a D and you like. Well don't say it again.

[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.580]
They can say it on our America but we can't say it around easily broadcasting because

[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.800]
the world works. Well see I don't get it this company they're peeing in their pants

[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.060]
over every word that's ever been intended but they're going to put Howard Stern on the

[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.660]
table. These people are crazy but go ahead. Now let me ask you a question. Are you

[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.860]
good? Don't take this wrong but are you going to take it whatever way I feel I think

[00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:01.180]
it. That's right. Are you going to use him as like I I gauge to see as far as what you

[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:06.780]
could get away with or you just go. I'm sad. Let him put his. Let me just tell you

[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.620]
this I don't listen to his show. I won't listen anymore his show that I listen to

[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:14.760]
Moe when I come in the studio in the morning at about the quarter to eight and then

[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.720]
George comes in around eight o'clock and then we start talking so we don't we don't

[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:22.020]
listen anymore so maybe 15 minutes a day 10-15 minutes. No I'm not interested in that.

[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.860]
I don't care what he gets away whether what he does. I do my show and I understand the

[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.920]
parameters they've made for me and I don't have a I'm not happy about it but I don't have

[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:35.200]
a compulsive need to go on ear and go way over the line and use the N word and do a lot

[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.660]
about this. I just don't have any need for that. So this show has got nothing to do with

[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.520]
his other than it follows it and we'll be glad to take the big lead in you know.

[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.340]
The ratings the ratings are going to definitely you know.

[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.000]
Writing and going through just a couple of days. I don't listen to Howard Howard's boring

[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.840]
you know the same old thing. Well if you get boring I agree with that but he's got a

[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:57.980]
gigantic audience and he's going to bring a lot of people to this station. But you

[00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:02.780]
know young young Ron and old you know what this game they're going to disappear now.

[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.860]
Okay listen have a heart in the dumpy so chronic five six seven oh five sixty pound

[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:13.880]
five sixty on the AT and T in Verizon wireless line. I think these twenty five minute breaks

[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:21.440]
our excellent. Let's have a lot more of them. Oh. This radio station man is so shameless.

[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.260]
If we could if we if we would let them do forty five minutes of spots an hour they'd

[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:30.920]
say oh sure great. Just like with the worst team remember that whole business. How come

[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.020]
you got getting stuff so bad well maybe we don't have any show left you got to run

[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:39.100]
the run about forty minutes of spots an hour plus of course they had D for one. Oh god

[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:46.700]
and that's how they do it. How do I can't hear this enough. I'm just have to play this

[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:57.400]
back to back. If the book puts on the bill. I thought that the moment whatever that reunion

[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.860]
thing I thought that was good. Yes that call which one. Ginger not the moment the

[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:09.600]
more temple in the. That one. I thought that was I thought he had peaked at that point

[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.900]
but that was small potatoes compared to this ice-cold bokeh wherever you are where is

[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.960]

[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:11.860]
Your fire. We don't want you anymore and please just go away.

[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.980]
I guess the gyms are. We can't thank you.

[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.420]
That's not matter. I just got fired. Who will that be all?

[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:19.860]
Yeah, yes.

[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:27.400]
Oh, why so? We don't accept hard blocks. Especially one that expired in 1959.

[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:34.300]
And I'm thinking. What would you like to meet among the six? You look crazy.

[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:39.380]
I think we're in heaven now.

[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:44.340]
That's just paper. Jesus and I will love you. Get your paper.

[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.760]
Hey, you want to pay for it? I don't read that.

[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:53.520]
Well, yeah, would you like a free sunset? No. I'm out of it. I want to buy a paper.

[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.240]
I don't understand. Maybe it's because I don't look good in yellow.

[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.720]
Wait, I got it. I don't know if I'm still with the side.

[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.120]
Yeah, that's it. Just happened to have a market here.

[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:11.840]
Will, wait for wreckage mission. There. Hello, everybody.

[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.120]
I will wait for wreckage mission.

[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:20.040]
Give up on the break. We'll be in trouble here. Why would I have my train?

[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.980]
We're going to have hurricane Charlie, man.

[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:30.560]
Moving northwest 17 miles an hour maximum, winds 80 miles an hour, 137 miles from Key West.

[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.980]
Hurricane Charlie, watch out. Panic.

[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:38.680]
Okay. And even though it's going to be a nice day today, since this weather bitch on the CNN tomorrow

[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.680]
going to be another story.

[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.880]
You're going to get what foe or maybe defoe.

[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.960]
So panic if you like. If it makes you feel better.

[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:51.580]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless

[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.560]
live less than an hour away from Marlon's baseball baby.

[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.200]
The cards and the Marlon's at P.P. Park.

[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.540]
Look at that phone. Are they up whipped up to a friend's ear?

[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.960]
What? I can feel it. Huh?

[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.780]
Well, they heard this is a Marlon game.

[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.700]
It happens every time we should just lie a lot.

[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.180]
Oh, Marlon games later on.

[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.200]
Why don't we be the biggest impact of Howard Steward on WDQ?

[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.400]
And that's our pull question of a 406 votes.

[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.000]
We're starting to get like a little response out there,

[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.940]
which means there might be somebody listening all the way down.

[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.080]
This is the last week before kids go back to school.

[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.960]
Right? Correct. Nobody rowered.

[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:27.380]
He'll send the ratings way up zooming up there.

[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:30.120]
143. You say that 35.2%.

[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.140]
The QM ratings are going to go through the roof.

[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:33.720]
We're going to have bonus money up the ass.

[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.580]
It's going to be great.

[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.620]
I don't give a crap about stir 97.

[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.320]
He'll screw up old Neil show 55.

[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.420]
He'll bring tons of people back to AM radio 43.

[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.720]
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds.

[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.960]
32. He'll increase the crank calls big time 15.

[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.740]
Doug Lindsay will have another nervous breakdown 13.

[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.400]
And not much, not much impact.

[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.040]
Nine. Say that.

[00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.440]

[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.280]

[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.900]
Good one. That's one of our friends at Bell Sound.

[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.280]
By the way, do we mention that Bell South stocks?

[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.880]
No. We'll be do WDQ and hello.

[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.600]

[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.200]
WQ and hello.

[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.700]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.240]
What's going to happen when Howard goes on to one and they have to postpone the

[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:41.780]
morning game?

[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.040]
Good point. Go play with your boyfriend.

[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.700]

[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.440]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T.

[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.000]
Well, your people, man, they're just so.

[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.160]
I have no right.

[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.160]
I like it. You're not.

[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.780]
No, not my people.

[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.600]
Your people.

[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.080]
A little mod of counties with cheese.

[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.100]
Your people are the Mario Coney WQ and hello.

[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.220]

[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.220]
Hola.

[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:07.440]
Hello.

[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.360]
Hey, how are we doing?

[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.480]
Okay, we're doing.

[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.320]
Okay, I'm from Tarantina.

[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.720]
Don't say the house turns a nipple liquor.

[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.900]
Yeah, and that he's a jerk off.

[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.380]
Okay, and I love you.

[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:20.940]
Okay, great.

[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.800]
5.6705.60.

[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.500]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.300]
Get a lot of these good calls in before the pregame show.

[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.240]
Get everybody in the mood for that Marlon victory today.

[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:32.960]
All right.

[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.840]
WQ and hello.

[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.980]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.440]
Neil Rogers.

[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:39.900]
This is Charlie Chad.

[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.260]
I got to tell you something.

[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.380]
New cross.

[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.640]
George, you're starting, mom.

[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.620]
You got a belt for a little room.

[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.740]
Yeah, okay, Gray, whatever.

[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:47.300]
Another one.

[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.500]
That must be one of the stern people.

[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.560]
That's part of the bonus on the program.

[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.440]
We'll get people like that.

[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.640]
Don't we don't do names on the show.

[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.780]
Okay, whether it's Jerome or this guy.

[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.240]
What's his name?

[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.800]
Mama, Baluts, whatever it is.

[00:55:59.100 --> 00:55:59.860]
Yeah, he's a new guy.

[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.800]
He's self-proclaimed stud.

[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.600]
Lives at home with mommy.

[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:02.380]
Great.

[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.480]
Or just like the guy with the eyes.

[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:05.900]
So, Mommy, I know.

[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.340]
Nobody has got mommy's body.

[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.600]
And just like Tony Perkins in psycho.

[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.200]
Yeah, mother.

[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.520]
Mommy's up in the attic sitting in a rocket in the rocking chair.

[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:15.900]
Somebody cue in.

[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.180]
Hello.

[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.540]
Hey, Neil.

[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:24.500]
Do you think that Misha Goss will now go after the person that outed Wilson's wife

[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:25.700]
with the CIA operatives?

[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.940]
No, we all know that it's either.

[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.160]
No, don't stop bringing up that story again.

[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.740]
Okay, otherwise they're going to come and take your ass away, man.

[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.020]
All right, man.

[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:34.560]
I want to do that.

[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.140]
Don't give up my phone number.

[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:36.460]
Okay.

[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:36.980]
Okay.

[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:38.840]
560.

[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:39.860]
7.0560.

[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:40.920]
Pound 560.

[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:41.500]
Misha Goss.

[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.700]
I thought that was pretty good line.

[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:43.380]
Yeah.

[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.640]
People get paid big bucks to come up with lines like that.

[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.980]
That people come up with crap that Jay Leno says.

[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.280]
And Jay Leno makes me sick to my stomach.

[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.280]
He's garbage, man.

[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:51.920]
He's so bad.

[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.120]
All he is is just a walking chin.

[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.060]
That'd be a good poll question one day.

[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.240]
Who do you think plays a better chin ball?

[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.400]
Rea Schreiber.

[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.800]
Jay Leno or Duff Lindsey.

[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.500]
Jay.

[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:06.800]
Somebody Q.

[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.300]
And hello.

[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.420]
Hey, no, yes, sir.

[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.880]
I thought I would turn down a long time.

[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.100]
Start back or send it.

[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:17.880]
I'll listen to the last six months, but I've been listening to one of three point one,

[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:18.580]
which is nothing.

[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.780]
He can barely get that in brown.

[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.860]
And then I was also listening to that.

[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.120]
Be at the station over and for my she can get that sometimes.

[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:28.280]
And I noticed that the delays about an extra 30 seconds on the beach.

[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.200]
Station over the one.

[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.620]
Yeah, yeah, you have in West Palm.

[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.740]
So if they're going to put that kind of delay on there,

[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.420]
I mean, they're going to be dumping him a lot more.

[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.740]
But they don't have that much.

[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.640]
They're going to run the show.

[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:38.940]
That's what I'm putting in it.

[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.960]
He makes fart sounds all the time.

[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:41.960]
Not really.

[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.980]
And if you're going to be curious, he makes fart sounds.

[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.700]
Are you sure not permitted on a beach?

[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.800]
You don't hear that on a beach.

[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.560]
These station in April.

[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.480]
They're going to be dumping nights and suddenly shows on every word.

[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:52.120]
Listen and go.

[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:52.660]

[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.780]
Anyway, that's it.

[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:55.980]
Thanks for the good news, pal.

[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.280]
Yeah, but yeah, fart sounds.

[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.480]
We're not allowed to play fart sounds, but how it's making fart sounds all of it.

[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.500]
We've been playing fart sounds for how many years on this show.

[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.420]
About 30, man.

[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:07.260]
Until February and March, when the beesleaves cave didn't enjoy started saying,

[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.720]
you can't do this and you can't say that.

[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.180]
And not only that, but if you work for beesleaves, you can't even make a fart sound like in your personal life.

[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:19.540]
My local species, Fort Royal High School, is the way you am.

[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.740]
Come on, fight for it.

[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.680]
Chak, chak, chak, chak, chak, chak, chak, chak.

[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.220]
I'm a five, been up with chak.

[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.920]
Torval back is up with chak.

[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:43.840]
I'm a four-wheeled, four-wheeled, four-wheeled, four-wheeled,

[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.800]
in love with chak.

[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:56.200]
I'm 45 at 560 WQM, only 45 minutes away from that Marlon pregame show.

[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:58.560]
Oh, I am pumped up and farted off about that.

[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.280]
Or as you've pumped off and farted out.

[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:00.540]
Careful.

[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:05.940]
The Washington Post on WMVs says, in days before the Iraq War began,

[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.220]
veteran Washington Post reported Walter Pinkers put together a historic questioning,

[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.960]
whether the Bush administration had proof that Saddam Hussein was signing weapons of mass destruction,

[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.040]
or is that distraction.

[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:18.380]
But he ran into resistance from the paper's editors and his peace ran only

[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:22.460]
after an assistant managing editor Bob Woodward, who was researching a book about the drive toward the war,

[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.560]
helped sell the story, Pinkist recalled,

[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.660]
without him it would have had a tough time getting into the paper.

[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:30.520]
Even so, the article was relegated to page A17.

[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.900]
Page 17, eh?

[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.940]
We did our job, but we didn't do it up, and I blame myself,

[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.120]
mightily, for not pushing harder woodward's in an interview.

[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.160]
We should have warned readers that we had information that the basis for this was

[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.920]
a shakeier than widely believed.

[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.820]
Those are exactly the kinds of statements that should be published on the front page,

[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.280]
not on 17, eh?

[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:54.540]
As violence continues in post-war Iraq and US forces have yet to discover any WMVs,

[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.720]
some critics say the media, including the Washington Post,

[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.540]
failed the country by not reporting more skeptically on President Bush's lies

[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.580]
or contentions during the run up to the war.

[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:06.520]
An examination of the paper's coverage interviews with more than a dozen of the editors

[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.600]
and reporters involved shows that the post published a number of pieces

[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.180]
challenging the White House, but rarely on the front page.

[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.000]
Some reporters who were lobbying for greater prominence for stories

[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.360]
that question the administration's evidence complained to senior editors

[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.980]
who in the view of the reporters were unenthusiastic about such pieces.

[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.660]
The result was coverage that despite flashes of groundbreaking reporting

[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:28.460]
in a hindsight looks strikingly one-sided at times.

[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:29.740]
One-sided.

[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.340]
Following that, the group's stepping media man.

[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.780]
But don't forget, Team Channel, we got that progressive network now.

[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.840]
Oh yeah, to show you how fair and balanced we are.

[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.620]
I like this little cartoonism into caricature.

[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.440]
The new QM Howard Stern dump monkeys.

[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.440]
Definitely never looked better.

[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.760]
Looks like you got a good tan over there in April's and four Mayors.

[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:51.320]
You got tan?

[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.840]
What if you got a tan high?

[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:53.080]
Right.

[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.760]
So 560, 705, 60, pound, 560 on the AT and T.

[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.980]
Let's get at least 100 calls on now before 1230.

[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.360]
Well, this is a good practice though, you know what?

[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:01.740]
Right.

[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.020]
Kind of like cutting down the show to make room for Howard, make room for the Marlins.

[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.740]
Make room for daddy, you know, anything.

[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.020]
How's Danny Thomas doing still dead?

[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:10.720]
Still.

[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.100]
What will be the biggest impact of the Howard Stern show on WQAM?

[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.540]
Wait a minute, I didn't give you the weather.

[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.880]
Well, we're not supposed to do the weather because we're not interested in news on this station.

[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.180]
Well, the 211.30 this morning showers until a few thunderstorms are continued to move north

[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.040]
over the coastal waters from my Midwest Palm Beach.

[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.600]
Occasional lightning, just a 30 miles an hour 30.

[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.600]
Not 30 minutes.

[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.420]
And locally heavy seas are possible.

[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.940]
A few of these showers and thunderstorms are moving shore with southern Miami-Dade south of Homestead.

[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.880]
And along the coast from Fort Lauderdale, the Boynton Beach.

[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.540]
Right to today, here's the forecast.

[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:48.720]
Partly sunny, scattered showers and thunderstorms, highs in the upper 80s.

[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.180]
South winds 10 to 15.

[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.080]
Chance of rain is a 30.

[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:52.780]
percent.

[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.860]
Tonight, partly cloudy and windy, scattered showers and thunderstorms,

[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.100]
lows in the upper 70s and low to the lower 80s of the coast.

[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.560]
Suddenly winds 10 to 15.

[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.040]
The evening becoming southeast, 20 to 25 after midnight.

[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.840]
Chance of rain about 60 percent.

[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.520]
And Friday, mostly cloudy, very windy.

[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.980]
No more showers and thunderstorms with gusty winds in the afternoon.

[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.620]
Eyes in the upper 80s.

[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.140]
Suddenly winds about 30 miles an hour.

[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.080]
Chance of rain 70 percent on Friday tomorrow.

[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.340]
So that's what it is.

[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.140]
Doesn't sound like the end of the world to me.

[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.680]
I mean, let's hear exactly right in the path of this thing.

[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:25.500]
Right?

[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:26.120]
Right.

[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.160]
We're fine.

[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.060]
So, huh?

[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:29.380]
We'll be fine.

[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.280]
Maybe Defe is going to drive back down to again.

[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.860]
Maybe he wants to go back down to the west coast.

[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.520]
I think after Monday, he'll be ready.

[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.300]
So you can hold the storm off for a couple of days.

[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:37.980]
Defe will be ready.

[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.000]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.600]
And Verizon wireless line.

[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:44.480]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:47.720]
QAM.

[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:50.620]
WDQAM.

[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:50.860]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.780]
Yeah, you're on the air.

[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:53.680]
You're on the air.

[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.460]
I'm on the air.

[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.220]
Let me say it again one more time.

[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:00.440]
Yeah.

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.360]
I just heard on the radio.

[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.360]
I missed out about the house.

[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.880]
And what was that with the delay?

[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:06.780]
The delay.

[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.820]
The show that he does on Monday?

[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:09.700]
Yeah.

[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.000]
You'll be hearing that the day after the circus, okay?

[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.460]
Just a short delay.

[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.820]
5670560, it's kind of like the tapes, you know, the Pope and aliens, stuff like that.

[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:19.160]
Right.

[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.400]
I mean, how is going to be talking about the election?

[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.100]
The one between doing Truman, of course, but nevertheless it'll be an election.

[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.600]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:35.820]
We're going to delay and delay and dump and dump and dump.

[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:37.120]
I'm telling you right now.

[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:38.860]
That's it.

[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.160]
I'm going to be hearing a lot of that music in there and filling those gaps with big, big gaps.

[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:44.720]

[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:55.320]
I mean, when our operations manager, our dump monkey and charred tells me that the show he listened to yesterday,

[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:02.760]
there was like 3, 540 minutes about the inward and various forms of the inward and porch that and all this other stuff.

[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.100]
Or was it monkeys, I think?

[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:07.180]
A lot of those.

[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:07.620]

[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:09.640]
Yeah, dump monkeys.

[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.080]
And then that he would have had a dump to speed up that like the last maybe 40 minutes of the show.

[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:16.900]
How do you do that?

[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.900]
I mean, what are we going to do in the process?

[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:24.140]
I evidently not a lot of thought has been given to these things by our brilliant management,

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.940]
who of course upper level management's out of town this week on vacation.

[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:31.380]
We'd all be a lot better off if he'd stand permanent vacation and Greg's case.

[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:36.500]
But nevertheless, he's coming back on Monday on his stand and he'll be there for the debut of this, whatever it's going to be.

[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.820]
It'll be a day beauty.

[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:38.720]
Oh, yeah.

[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.380]
Line nine, everybody's favorite, WQAM.

[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.220]
Yeah.

[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.580]
This is Brian and Rochester.

[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:45.920]
Hi, Brian. How you doing?

[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.060]
I'm doing pretty good.

[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.480]
It's a great day in Florida.

[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.640]
I mean, I lived in Bokahol from 91 to 98.

[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.240]
Yeah.

[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.780]
And I just love those hurricanes now.

[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.000]
They couldn't get better.

[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.980]
One coming from each end, you know?

[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.560]
Yeah, one coming from the right, one coming from the left.

[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.260]
Yes. I mean, I would just love to see the Gulf of Mexico meet the Atlantic Ocean.

[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:09.660]
Someday in my lifetime.

[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.260]
Yes. What a dump that place is.

[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:13.540]
Yeah.

[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.940]
Yes. I mean, I'm very happy to be back in Rochester, New York.

[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:18.640]
What a dump.

[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.800]
Yes. I mean, I'll take the Brighton Jews over the Bokah Jews any day.

[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.220]
Okay. Good luck to you, Palli.

[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:24.960]
Hey, thanks, Neil.

[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:25.640]
See you, Brian.

[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.680]
It's the, you know, about the West Coast rappers and East Coast rappers.

[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.160]
Well, we're going to have our own battle between the Brighton Jews and the Bokah Jews.

[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:33.420]
Oh!

[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.160]
I mean, like that.

[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.740]
Each year, a hard outer, your, uh, uh, uh, Kishky, whatever.

[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.920]
It's enough to tear my Kishky's up.

[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.840]
They don't have Kishky at my favorite deli here in town.

[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.160]
They might be pretty fioed about that.

[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.400]
It must be a little bit fioed.

[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.960]
It'll tear your Kishky's up, but it's great.

[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.520]
Even the Goyam like Kishky.

[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.300]
That's great.

[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.580]
Five six, no.

[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.920]
Five six seven, oh five sixty, pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Island.

[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.380]
We apologize for the long grace today.

[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:55.580]
No.

[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.780]
But we have to get a lot of spots in because we need to make some money so we can put

[01:05:58.780 --> 01:05:59.620]
how it's turned on the year.

[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:00.600]
And we can pay clearance.

[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.700]
It wouldn't play Duffer.

[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:06.160]
The extra money is going to be getting for being the, uh, port, I mean, the, uh, dump, uh, button monkey.

[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.160]
So many monkeys around in so little time.

[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.220]
WQAM, hello.

[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:10.880]
Neil.

[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:11.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:12.320]
How are you?

[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.000]
Well, great.

[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.020]
Listen, I waited to call you so you got back.

[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.260]
I read the first column.

[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.060]
I believe it was very Jackson Road of a Howard Sturry.

[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:20.840]
Very Jackass, yes.

[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:21.300]
Yeah.

[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.120]
And I saw.

[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:27.600]
I kind of took issue with the fact that, uh, this year management would allow, would like,

[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.360]
and I took out an insult to you that they say that they don't care how long the Howard

[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.120]
Sturry goes over your time slot.

[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:34.600]
Right.

[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.020]
And, and they don't care if it takes more than they'll keep him on.

[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:38.680]
Right.

[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.560]
After you've been the number one, I mean, I, uh, the staple of that station.

[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.580]
Oh, they don't care about me.

[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:44.500]
I'm old man.

[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.400]
I'm small potatoes, you know, they can do whatever they want with me.

[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.900]
And they, they, they think that this is, they got the big enchilada now, man.

[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.680]
They think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread and they're going to run with it.

[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.720]
And the rest of us can just, uh, goose depa law.

[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.060]
And as long as the money stays the same, I will.

[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:01.680]
Well, I know you, I know you don't care, but I have a, I have a question.

[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:07.460]
In your opinion, doesn't the risk of having a experience diluted show because they're going

[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.480]
to have to take a lot of that out?

[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:14.760]
Uh, isn't it too much of a risk, especially after the rating you guys got on the, on the

[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.880]
station, the last one?

[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.120]
Too much of a risk.

[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.720]
Time will tell how to have a vinyl.

[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.220]
I don't know.

[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:20.860]
Wow.

[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.600]
Well, it's shocking.

[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.840]
It's shocking to me.

[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.120]
I can't believe that they're putting a show on, especially at a time when they, they always

[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.120]
do the thing that seems to make the least sense.

[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:34.340]
When the, when the crap restarted coming down about, uh, kiss a, uh, good morning and, uh,

[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:37.520]
the other stuff we were playing and we getting a lot of heat about the stuff on the station,

[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.320]
then they put for real on the air.

[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:40.700]
You know, with all his stuff.

[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.360]
And then it made no sense.

[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.380]
And I'm thinking to myself, why at this time are they putting him on the air?

[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.240]
They know what he does.

[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:50.100]
They know he's going to like jeopardize the license and do a lot of all that and never,

[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:53.220]
you know, pay attention to what they tell him and he didn't and they had a can of

[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:57.460]
that, you know, and they made them, and now on the heels of that experience and coming

[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:01.240]
out of time when it's even more chilling than it was before because you had the, uh,

[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:05.700]
super bowl incident, the breast bearing craft and everybody and their brother is gone into a

[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.580]
cocoon now into a panic mode.

[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.240]
Uh, and now they put a certain on there.

[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.380]
I don't understand it.

[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.060]
Yeah, and it's like a joke.

[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:16.220]
I used to think you were joking when you said about how incompetent these people are, but I mean,

[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.880]
it's beginning to, they, they're just spreading it out for you know.

[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.980]
These people are mo' runs.

[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.540]
He hates it, he hates it, he hates it.

[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:22.620]
He hates it, he hates it.

[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.320]
Have a great day, Pat.

[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:23.920]
All right, all right, all right.

[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:24.660]
Pray for us, please.

[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.600]
Okay, Robby Rosarimese, everybody pray for those of us at QAM.

[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.500]
Look what happened to the Humper for crying out loud.

[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.160]
I thought something great was going to happen.

[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:33.900]
That was funny.

[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:37.280]
We're going to have this great award winning lineup and everything was going to go smoothly and

[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.220]
we're going to like, uh, make millions and millions raking into Bucks at QAM.

[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.960]
And everything was going to be just fine, you know, like, uh,

[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:44.960]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.440]
I can't store what say if she could.

[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.360]
But the fact of the matter is it looks like once again Greg Reed just keeps

[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.800]
Diddlin and Diddlin and Diddlin hasn't got any idea what is going on,

[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.920]
what the repercussions are.

[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.700]
And I sure hope he's got the normed Kent's number real handy.

[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.380]
Write it on your sleeve, Greg, as a momentum of our association.

[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:02.960]
Speed down.

[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:03.640]
Yeah.

[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.780]
Let him fit the five at five sixty WQM.

[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.600]
I've been telling you about Alayzer Recharge, the toner and recharge cartridge

[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.280]
specialist the past few weeks here on the show.

[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.680]
A lot of you have called 1-800-287.

[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.860]
Now you two twelve you've saved a lot of money and you're printing an office

[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.740]
equipment supplies.

[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.940]
And for those of you who haven't called, I can't imagine what you're waiting for.

[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.460]
Because Alayzer Recharge has got all the things you're looking for, ink jets,

[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.640]
thermocarboned paper, supplies that provide service support and maintenance for most

[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.220]
Mason models of machines to make them run like brand new again.

[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.440]
In fact, you could probably use some help right there on that fax machine that I paid for.

[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:34.220]
Oh, help me Jesus.

[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:39.300]
When you call 1-800-287-9212, you'll deal with just Bob, the sole owner,

[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.800]
who's been supplying businesses in South Florida with what they need.

[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.760]
In most cases within 24 hours for a long time.

[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:49.300]
Alayzer Recharge can save you up to 50% on new cartridges as compared to depot pressing

[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.800]
and don't forget, all the cartridges sold by Alayzer Recharge are remanufactured,

[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:54.540]
not refilled.

[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.920]
Anybody in their brother can sell you cheap refilled piece of crap cartridge, but keep in mind

[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.080]
you only get what you pay for.

[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.880]
Remanufactured cartridges are the only smart way to go.

[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.520]
And Alayzer carries a complete line of cartridges for printers,

[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.680]
copiers and faxes along with brother and Xerox drums too.

[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.740]
Alayzer Recharge is probably the individualized service, offers a no questions

[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.120]
act satisfaction guarantee.

[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:17.940]
So if you need toner, cartridges or anything else in this line, pick up that phone

[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:18.860]
and call it just Bob.

[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:25.060]
At Alayzer Recharge, it's a tool free call called 1-800-287-9212.

[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:31.080]
That's 1-800-287-9212 or log on to their website, alayzerrecharge.com.

[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.340]
My name is local, this is my city.

[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:35.940]
The rate is all yours.

[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.940]
Kill me!

[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.760]
This is at a Homeland Security Tom Ridge, advising you to put duct tape on your radio

[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:47.840]
when I raise the warning color to pink for the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.

[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.200]
Ricky Williams said goodbye to football.

[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.340]
Oh Ricky, I can't do this.

[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:04.380]
I want to stroke your legs when slip your track with my greasy nose.

[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:12.300]
But you rather slow-faced flip, now I'm pulling up my fly for the season.

[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:19.960]
Gash my heart to bed, reflex, here's well up in my eyes.

[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:26.880]
Oh no, a pair of breezes, and I might bustle by the bridge.

[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:36.160]
There's a way, see, in my trailer, and then I find you no longer here.

[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:45.600]
You've got to get my life set of failure, and over the hearts of all the sports players,

[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:50.940]
on a woman's face as well, now you're building junk.

[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:58.100]
It's your chose I want in my mouth, on the half of a few stars.

[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.440]
Bad two likes for whole radio.

[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.780]
You leave those like me.

[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.780]
And only the Shats funds we can see.

[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:17.080]
It's promo 2 at 5.60 WQM, we're just warming it up for the Marlon Pregame show.

[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.620]
Look at that window there, how's it look?

[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.340]
Oh, beautiful here.

[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:22.900]
Sunny and vial is what it looks like here.

[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.880]
You'll have a few showers here and there pop up a spotty, curinere,

[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.080]
that's it, don't panic, okay?

[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.660]
Or is it a good time to start panicking?

[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.780]
Or just getting the cry driver over to Naples for a Myers right now,

[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.220]
be there just in time for the good stuff.

[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.380]
What will be the biggest impact of Howard Stern on WQM?

[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.280]
That's our pullquestmealranges.com today.

[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:40.860]
482 votes.

[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.060]
He'll send the ratings way up, zooming up there to astronomical heights,

[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.760]
even with all those dumps and delays and crap like that.

[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:48.440]
Too bad.

[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.260]
35.28% 173.

[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.040]
I don't give a crap about Stern 108.

[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.940]
He'll screw up Neil show 66.

[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.120]
He'll bring tons of people back to AM radio 46.

[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.500]
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds 38.

[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.480]
He'll increase the crank calls big time 21.

[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.900]
Dufflin's you'll have another nervous breakdown 17,

[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.860]
not much impact only 13.

[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:14.540]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon world of slime.

[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.520]
Norma can't stop emailing me, okay, you're getting on my nerves now,

[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:18.240]
stop bugging me.

[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.100]
And the same with my financial guy who's driving me absolutely crazy.

[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.620]
Well, we tried to send you something airborne expressed yesterday.

[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.360]
See, I live in a building where all the stuff goes to the concierge.

[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.060]
I don't think people will come knocking on my door.

[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.560]
Oh, here's FedEx, we have delivery for it.

[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.240]
It doesn't work that way in an apartment building, you know?

[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.960]
It doesn't? No.

[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.780]
And I'm getting all during the show.

[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.700]
This goes down to like on a daily basis.

[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.760]
Once I walk out of this room at about 1230-03,

[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.220]
I'm going to get on the phone and raise some holy hell.

[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:46.780]
Just for the hell of it, I'm just tired of crap.

[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.080]
It's hard to people doing stupid things, you know what I mean?

[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:49.720]
You mean holy hell.

[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.660]
You mean holy hell, don't you?

[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:53.880]
Holy crap.

[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.720]
Speaking of crap, Pentagon auditors have concluded that

[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.820]
Haliburton failed radically account for more than $1.8 billion

[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.720]
worth of work in Iraq and Kuwait.

[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.340]
The Wall Street Journal says, setting a Pentagon report.

[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.080]
This amount represents 43% of the $4.18 billion

[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.840]
that Houston-based Haliburton, Kellogg Brown, and Root,

[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.400]
has billed the Pentagon to feed the House troops in the region

[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.260]
the newspaper said.

[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.640]
It said the findings in the 60-page Pentagon audited

[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.040]
reported August 4th, but not publicly released,

[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.740]
they're likely to increase pressure on the U.S. government

[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.880]
to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of payments to Haliburton.

[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.340]
This, it said, potentially threatens the services that Kellogg Brown

[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:34.240]
and Root provides U.S. troops and other personnel in Iraq and Kuwait.

[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:36.640]
Vice President Dick Taney, as some of you may remember,

[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:40.080]
was Haliburton's Chief Executive from 1995 to 2000.

[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.000]
Another cook, we won't business with a bunch of crooks,

[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.520]
and America says, oh yeah, 50% of us, we never met a cook, we didn't like.

[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.340]
Got all mighty.

[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.000]
How is it possible that there are so many stupid people?

[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.980]
And this porter, Misha Goss, from Florida, who's supposed to be now

[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:57.960]
the new director of the CIA or at least he's Bush's appointee.

[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.020]
Michael Moore's got the footage where he had told him an interview just

[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.020]
earlier this year.

[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:06.180]
He's not qualified to be in the CIA much less its director,

[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.520]
and he gave him chapter in verse, I can't wait.

[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.260]
I wonder how long before the media starts showing us that clip.

[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.460]
How do you think we're going to see that?

[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:13.480]
Oh, over the book.

[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.060]
Hold your breath right now.

[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.560]
Oh, look at the breath.

[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:18.960]
Take it.

[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:18.960]

[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.840]
I just write 670560, pound 560 on a 18 and T in Verizon line.

[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:25.800]
WDQA and hello.

[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.380]
Yeah, the biggest impact with Howard Stern will be Barbara Bowie,

[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.360]
we've placed in Georgia.

[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.540]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.120]
See, there we go.

[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:35.020]
There's one of those cars.

[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.940]
Just like I said, got one IQ smaller than his penis.

[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:43.000]
567560, pound 560 on a 18 and T.

[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:46.000]
In fact, that's what most Stern people, that's about it, isn't it?

[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:46.500]
Bob Bowie?

[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.200]
Bob Bowie, sure.

[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:47.640]
And you?

[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.900]
Bob Bowie, it's a medley of their material.

[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.400]
And Howard Stern rules.

[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:52.900]
And Bob Bowie, that's pretty much it.

[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.180]
I'm not saying that there are some real intelligence people listening.

[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:56.840]
How many of you think?

[01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:57.940]
530, man.

[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.200]
How many QA and hello?

[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:00.640]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:00.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:01.320]
Great.

[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.860]
I was wondering, you played George Pevieler Day

[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.320]
an excerpt from a Bush speech where he's now.

[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.160]
He just did a big bon hit and people are laughing in the background.

[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:09.780]
Yeah.

[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.200]
I heard it's a part of it and it was incredible.

[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.020]
You can see the video on NeilRodges.com.

[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.280]
Yeah, you can see the video and I'll play it again for you right now,

[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.460]
since that's what you're looking for.

[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:17.240]
Yeah, thanks a lot.

[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:17.840]
I looked last night.

[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.080]
It wasn't on there, but I'll check it out.

[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.620]
It's on there right now, as we speak.

[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:22.720]
It can make this stuff up.

[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:23.720]
Exactly.

[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:24.880]
It's unbelievable.

[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:26.340]
I think it's exactly what Kelly see.

[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:26.840]
Thank you.

[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.540]
What do you think tribal sovereignty means in the 21st century?

[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.380]
And how do we resolve conflicts between tribes and the federal and state governments?

[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:35.860]

[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.600]
Travel sovereignty means that.

[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.200]
It's sovereign.

[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.560]
You're a...

[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.620]
You've been given sovereignty and your...

[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.640]
You, there's a sovereign entity.

[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:49.860]
Okay.

[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:57.260]
And therefore the relationship between the federal government and tribes is one between sovereign entities.

[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:57.800]
Right.

[01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.000]
And it's almost as good as...

[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:00.100]
Abougarrabe.

[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.640]
And almost as good as the one about...

[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:03.640]
What was the...

[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.180]
Here, I've got it here somewhere.

[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:05.820]
Pull me once.

[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:06.780]
Our enemies...

[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.900]
No, not to pull me...

[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:08.760]
I can't get pulled again.

[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.860]
Our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we.

[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.800]
They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we.

[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:16.820]
Yeah.

[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:17.800]
How didn't this...

[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.060]
Oh my God.

[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.020]
Well, I got a story on our website by Mark Morpher.

[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:22.700]
It's way too long.

[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.360]
I'm not going to read it.

[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.660]
How do you know what's time for major change in American leadership?

[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.620]
Let us count the signs.

[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.200]
He says, I just read the first paragraph or so.

[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:35.440]
He said, you know what's time for a serious change when the president of the West actually mutters the infantile, instantly infamous line.

[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.240]
Our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we.

[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.640]
They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we.

[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:49.860]
Just after finishing phonetically spelling out his name and his favorite his red crayon, I'm yet another budget-reaming 417 billion dollar offense-spending bill.

[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:58.780]
And you know it's time for a change when not a single one of the original and spiritually curdled military yesmen standing around the ceremonial signing table.

[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:11.360]
Those sad automatons with their wooden smiles and stiff spines and bone-dry souls, not one broken away hysterical, but a sad suicidal after, followed by an uncontrolled wailing and the ranting of flesh and muttering of oh my freaking God.

[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.840]
What the hell is this man doing is leader of the free world.

[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.920]
The whole story is on our website by Mark Morford.

[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.680]
How time to get out the bush.

[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.640]
A-Linus Pass known in 560 WQM when you're-

[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:38.280]
The shini is real pissed.

[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:42.740]
He's daughter-don't-lack-guys.

[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:50.140]
Where she stands no one knows her party's between the fire.

[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.560]
Here's what she denies is.

[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.140]
The GOP has her needs.

[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.060]
First has the gay amendments.

[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:11.580]
Come out from the closet deep.

[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:21.000]
We should see her the sun and the other left beyond.

[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.240]
Where she is one.

[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.960]
He's gonna see my dashies.

[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:31.300]
God's rattled her way.

[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:39.280]
And some you put she hair on thin yarn.

[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:54.940]
Deep, we should see her the sun and not a daughter who is a lesbian.

[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.360]
Well, 15 at 560, 15 minutes away from the Marlon pregame.

[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.620]
Show Cardinals at the state of the plate of Marlon's.

[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:04.260]
Craig and Mimey, if you send me any more of his fancy George,

[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.340]
it's gonna be-

[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.900]
I just wanted you to feel my pain.

[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.540]
Why do this?

[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.360]
Craig and Mimey get a life.

[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.120]
I need you pathetic tragic soul you.

[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.560]
What's certain coming in?

[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.500]
I guess QM has balls after all.

[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.900]
Oh man, get a freaking life.

[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:21.300]
Look at the Milky Balls.

[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.980]
Yeah, no brains just balls.

[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.380]
And don't actually lean too happy about it over there at UN.

[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.080]
How many of that guy to call it on Tuesday?

[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.680]
How many UN guys on Death Road?

[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.440]
They say-

[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.880]
560, 560, 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.280]
Wireless line.

[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:40.320]
Let's get these 85,000 calls going here before 1230.

[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:40.860]
What do you say?

[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:41.820]
Let's go.

[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.020]
At least WNQA and H.

[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.120]
Hey, now.

[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:45.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:46.780]
Just to tell you-

[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.420]
He's on by the way.

[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:47.860]
All right.

[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.320]
Just to tell you, the buzz doesn't cut nothing out of Howard's show.

[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:52.220]
How do you know?

[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.280]
Well, I've been listening to it for the last two weeks.

[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.660]
You can pick it up like in Coral Springs when I'm driving around.

[01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:56.960]
Right.

[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:57.260]
You're right.

[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.680]
Yesterday for a half an hour.

[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.660]
That's all they were saying.

[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:00.700]
And they get-

[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:01.080]
Here we go.

[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.600]
Yeah, the end of the show.

[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:03.800]
You had to carry the whole thing.

[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.800]
I mean, it was Gilbert Gottfried and that guy already been-

[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:06.920]
Right.

[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:08.260]
...for the end work, the whole end-

[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:08.940]
The whole end-

[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:09.740]
So I make a period there.

[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.540]
Well, I guarantee you won't hear that on this station.

[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.040]
Yeah, so I don't know what to-

[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:18.080]
See, you see, I'm glad that we brought this up today because what this points out is that-

[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.120]
This company wants to put the show on this radio station, but they don't want to carry it.

[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:23.260]
You see what I'm saying?

[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.360]
They want their ratings.

[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.300]
They want their revenue.

[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.780]
They want to be big shots, but they don't want to take the risk.

[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.780]
We'd like you wanted to go to Amsterdam, but you don't want to get on the plane.

[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:34.460]
Right.

[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.100]
I just- I don't understand it.

[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.720]
Maybe somebody can explain it to me.

[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.400]
Can you explain it?

[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:40.700]
Sure.

[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.000]
If we say that we have Howard on, even if we don't carry any of the show,

[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:44.600]
Right.

[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.640]
Almost as good.

[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.660]
And then we can run all those promos and we can-

[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:47.680]
Okay.

[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:48.740]
And the sales department, Carwapher,

[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.100]
Because they're used to line a lot anyway.

[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.360]
And they'll make up a bunch of crap.

[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:52.680]
Oh, we got the Howard Stern show.

[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.340]
We can say Howard Howard Howard, but really-

[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:58.000]
All we play is the chicken-loat-

[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:58.460]
...cocksing.

[01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.100]
...cocksing.

[01:21:59.100 --> 01:21:59.340]
...cocksing.

[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:01.580]
...cocksing.

[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.480]
Because we're too chicken-trip to a charity show.

[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:08.520]
See, I- I think this was a very, very fortuitous experience that happened with Mufflinzi

[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:11.080]
and Robert Greeper, where we had her Naples for a Myers last couple of days.

[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:14.280]
Because we're discovering that there's an awful lot of stuff on there

[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.500]
that they don't want to put on here, which leads to the question,

[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.180]
what do they put on here in Fort Myers?

[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:19.400]
They're carrying it over there.

[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.880]
They have been carrying it for a long time.

[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:21.720]
What the hell?

[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:23.220]
Because they're not going to be any different.

[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:26.060]
In other words, whatever the standards are, they've decided over there.

[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.220]
The Beasley standards, the Beasley-

[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:32.480]
...knows-ticking Van Joost-Rumming standards, it's going to be exactly the same on QAM.

[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:38.320]
And maybe even worse, Richard, because though all that Mufflinzi is about as nervous and Ellie as you can get,

[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.460]
about as Ellie as they come, I mean, what do you expect?

[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:42.580]
It's going to be even worse.

[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:46.500]
Because he admitted to me that none of that 40 minutes would have been on the air.

[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.100]
Now, how do you feel 40 minutes?

[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:50.660]
Huh?

[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:51.580]
There you go.

[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:58.700]
Excuse us, we're having technical difficulties.

[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:02.240]
Would I always turn people to me or will be resuming with a show?

[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:06.160]
It's as if the upper copy gets lost and they don't keep saying the end word anymore.

[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.400]
Right, we also have this.

[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:10.880]
Yeah, that's good.

[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:18.580]
Oh, man.

[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:26.960]
I really believe that we're going to have as many people tuning in the Hearstord on Monday as people tuning in to hear what's going to be going on.

[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:27.560]
Do you know what I mean?

[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:28.940]
Yeah, the alternative show.

[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:30.840]
Holy moly.

[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:34.440]
In other words, what is really going to get on the air and is Howard really saying anything?

[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.220]
Are we really carrying the Howard'sord and sure?

[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.140]
Are we just pretending that we're carrying the Stern Show?

[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.840]
WDQ and hello.

[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:41.360]
Hey, yes?

[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:42.520]
Yes, I am.

[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.320]
Oh, hey, I don't know if you've got to talk about this.

[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:54.520]
I want to talk about something that's really been bothering me about what they're doing with Bush campaign is doing with the sound by John Kerry.

[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:02.400]
When he was asked that a journalist convention about what he would have done, what he has sat there in that Kindergarten room.

[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:02.880]

[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:05.340]
And when kept reading, I thought that clip.

[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:06.840]
Yeah, you saw the clip.

[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.360]
You saw the clip of Kerry's answer, right?

[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:09.620]
Right.

[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.060]
But you did see the clip of the question.

[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:11.520]
No.

[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.900]
Everybody keeps on playing it, so Kerry was saying it in a speech.

[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.940]
You know, I wouldn't have done that.

[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.720]
And the media is doing that.

[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.280]
I mean, it's deliberately creating an issue with it really was not.

[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:26.400]
He did that indirectly after for questions.

[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:26.920]
Right.

[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:34.760]
I wanted to make that known in some public forum because I think most people, as just as you, had only seen that clip.

[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.560]
And they did not see the, you know, the whole thing that we were...

[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.920]
Well, let me remind you and everybody of one thing.

[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.420]
The media is sick and they drop the average.

[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.580]
Yeah, all the stuff that's gone down, just like that story I had about to watch them post.

[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.840]
Now, finally admitting that they were, they were bearing the stories about the WMDs and the excuses for going into a wreck.

[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.920]
The media verse about 80% of the responsibility, the way I've been seen it.

[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.680]
I've been seeing that the same way.

[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.460]
And, you know, I think we need a lot more response, more reporting.

[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.420]
And it's very hard to not find bias.

[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.240]
I mean, one side or the other.

[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.620]
Any way, there's no need to go reporting anymore.

[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:10.040]
Well, you have to go on the internet. That's all I can tell you.

[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.340]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.860]
And Neil, I miss you when you're not here. I wish you were there more.

[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:17.420]
I'm not real excited about Howard. I mean, he's not bad.

[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.460]
But are you going to be on still from 10 to 2?

[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.520]
From whenever he gets done till 2.

[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.200]
From... and that's it?

[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.320]
Oh, God. What are we going to do without you, man?

[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.740]
From 10, 30 or 10, 40. I mean, it's not like the end of the world.

[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:33.460]
I mean, you can get by with them and take another snooze or something.

[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:34.160]
I'll see you next time.

[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:37.860]
I've told you on several occasions you make my life bearable.

[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:39.480]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:40.560]
Take care. Bye-bye.

[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.200]
Yeah. From 21 to QAM.

[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.800]
And I am lost.

[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:47.040]
Because it's 4.20 o'clock 6.

[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:48.460]
QAM.

[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.700]
All right.

[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.820]
If you're all the lady, now you're not a useless lady.

[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:04.420]
Do the neophons and gobbels and control your friends.

[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.560]
Don't you have the fantasy now?

[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.000]
Nothing's right to be so bad.

[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:09.760]
Take care.

[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.740]
And get by the song in the back.

[01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.540]
You can appreciate anyone.

[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:16.560]
Well, you can't say that.

[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:22.600]
And you're not very ugly in all the questions.

[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.820]
And what you say on the air will be considered ugly.

[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.760]
No one's to present it now.

[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.940]
And your hands are on the floor.

[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.940]
The head's like the body comes back from my back.

[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.700]
You give up in killing one.

[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.820]
Girls, you can't say that.

[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.700]
Get a naked scream.

[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:47.800]
With reference to the Lord of stars,

[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.620]
hold it at your feet.

[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:56.740]
We'll find you a very, very natural life is a way for all.

[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:15.660]
And you can't say that.

[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.220]
Well, I like that.

[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.100]
That one's beautiful.

[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:26.860]
That's the lovely thing.

[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.300]
Want to be the biggest impact on how it's stirred on WQM

[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:33.340]
that's our poll question, you're Roger.com 558 votes.

[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.060]
He'll send the ratings way up 197, with it without the dumps.

[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.080]
I don't give a crap about stir 128.

[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.060]
He'll screw up, and he'll show 75.

[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.040]
He'll bring tons of people back to AM radio 53.

[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.720]
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds 43.

[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:47.600]
Thank the Lord.

[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.060]
Definitely you'll have another nervous breakdown 24.

[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.780]
He'll increase the crank calls big time 23.

[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.500]
Not much impact on Lee 15.

[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.840]
Marlon's baseball, baby. Cardinals at the mallens.

[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.120]
Get out the ores, the viscui.

[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:09.540]
Flywood.

[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:11.580]
Right?

[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:12.880]
This way.

[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.140]
That queen, that down the hatches.
