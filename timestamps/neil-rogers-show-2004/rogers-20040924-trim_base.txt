[00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.200]
And pass and preach like hell!

[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.180]
Call it inside waiting thought.

[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.500]
Why the youth breast is?

[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.260]
Push has the whole Arab world.

[00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.980]
Really mad, he's got the whole Arab world.

[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.700]
Really mad, he made the whole Arab world.

[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.220]
Really mad, he's got the whole Arab world.

[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.780]
So mad, those prisoners retreated.

[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.700]
Really bad, they made a strip they did for a photograph.

[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.900]
And all of those soldiers had a laugh that made the whole Arab world so mad.

[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.220]
I forgot the red face that are at the far right.

[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.660]
And our laugh, but now it's nothing.

[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.780]
But it's trapped, the George Bush and his cronies are.

[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.780]
For the crap he made the whole Arab world so mad.

[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.680]
Absolutely.

[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.520]
There's a bunch of grieving widows feeling sad and a lot of little children.

[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.480]
Have no death, this war has turned out.

[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.700]
Really bad, he made the whole Arab world so mad.

[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.680]
Oh, there's the suicide farmer.

[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.800]
Interact with a bunch of game-traces crap.

[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.540]
To his back, to get away the next soldier's honor.

[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.100]
That's 25 at 5.60 W.A.M.

[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.700]
Anyway, we got the numbers coming out.

[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.020]
The trends, the arbitrage from arbitrage at 11.30. Any interest?

[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.680]
No.

[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.600]
Oh, boy.

[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.760]
Look at what's like, huh?

[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.400]
We are.

[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.560]
We are what?

[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.680]
Interested family?

[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.560]
We are family.

[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.200]
Well, this is really mostly on your, uh, neural shoulders.

[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.860]
I'll take it back because it's the, let's say, June, July of August.

[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.760]
Yeah, is that correct?

[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.040]
I reckon.

[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.060]
Yeah, that's what it's going to be.

[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.200]
June, July of August, and we're dropping off a big May from the last trend.

[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.740]
I mean, a huge May when we had an eight point in men.

[00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.080]
Oh!

[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.000]
So that's going to disappear.

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.600]
So if we, if you did really well in August, you, me, and it's, um, if I did really well in August, what ever.

[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.100]
We'll see.

[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.040]
Well, I mean, they're not going to give you any credit if it's good and if it's all bad.

[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.120]
Oh, that little George was on.

[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.740]
He was talking about ass again.

[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.040]
Yeah.

[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.720]
The one you're up late for the other shows that did bad even though we were number one in the last.

[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.480]
But yeah, it was a spread.

[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.200]
It's like a disease.

[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.120]
You spread it around.

[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.000]
Even though we were the hurricanes are like a disease.

[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.880]
I'm not talking about the football team necessarily.

[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.760]
Although they have problem with little girl teams, but, uh, Hurricane Jean.

[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.920]
Now, here's the eight o'clock advisory and a lot of people are starting to get panicked and whipped up into a frenzy because the weather fairies are hyperventilating again.

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.080]
Baaay, name.

[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.720]
That's them.

[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.340]
The 8 a.m.

[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.280]
And there'll be a new one out at 11 a.m.

[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.700]
And we'll actually be able to put that on here.

[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.080]
See this today is just fine.

[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.140]
The way from where I'm sitting.

[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.060]
You know what I mean?

[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.960]
Mm-hmm.

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.600]
We have time to get in those two breaks in the last half hour without having to like put them on backside by each and we have time to do all the pointed rounds today.

[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.860]
Okay, here's the deal from the National Hurricane Center at 8 a.m.

[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.780]
A hurricane warning is in effect for the Northwestern Bahamas including the Abacos and Rosalind, very islands, Bimini,

[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.280]
and Luthorac, Grand Bahama Island, and new providence.

[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.740]
Hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are respected in the warning area within the next 24 hours.

[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.000]
A hurricane watch is in effect.

[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.580]
Well, by the way, you people in the lobby waiting for the staff to come in, forget about it.

[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.780]
A hurricane watch is in effect along the east coast of Florida, from Florida City to St. Augustine including Lake Okeechobee.

[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.440]
A hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions are possible in the watch area within the next 36 hours.

[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.020]
Don't panic unless you want to.

[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.280]
A tropical storm warning has been effect for the Central Bahamas including Cat, Steven's Island, the Exumis, Long Island, Rumkay and San Salvador.

[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.000]
Interest elsewhere in the Florida Peninsula should closely monitor the progress of Gene, the old dance and machine.

[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.920]
I guess we'll probably out of place this year, Gene later if we have time, but I doubt it.

[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.160]
Okay, because we got all the vocal brambets to play, and then we got to play Cat, Steven's again, we got the KJ stuff.

[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.400]
It also says here, this is from the National Hurricane Center, which I find most interesting.

[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.860]
We reminded that from sundown tonight until sundown Saturday is Jung Kippur.

[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.520]
Oi! A solemn Jewish holiday, Jung Kippur.

[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.080]
Your Jewish neighbors in the watch and warning areas observing Jung Kippur will not be listening to radios or watching TV.

[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.280]
Yeah, you should live so long. It may not be where the hurricane situation.

[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.900]
So the smart thing to do is like go and get a bag of cheeseburgers from Wendy's and go door to door among all your Jewish Orthodox Jewish neighbors counting on the door saying,

[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.240]
that her or Gene is coming in through the cheeseburgers, the bacon cheeseburgers right at them, and dare them to eat them.

[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.500]
Wait till I have to sundown them.

[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.920]
I don't guarantee you the lead them. Could you turn out a nice bacon cheeseburger? No way.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:43.540]
At 8 o'clock this morning, the center of Hurricane Gene was located in your latitude 26.1 north, longitude 72.0 west, or about 215 miles east of Great Abico Island in the northwestern Bahamas.

[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:55.780]
Gene is moving toward the west near 8 miles an hour, although for more I'm looking on the infrared radar on there in the loop, the loop, the loop, it looks like it's already starting a little bit of a west northwest even you said that.

[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.500]
Right. But we don't want to say that because the hurricane center don't agree.

[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.000]
They say it's moving toward the west near 8 miles an hour and this motion is expected to continue with some increasing forward speed during the next 24 hours.

[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.140]
This motion could bring the center of Gene near the northwestern Bahamas tomorrow.

[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.500]
Maximum sustained winds there are 100 miles an hour with higher gusts.

[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.740]
Some slow strengthening is possible during the next 24 hours, and otherwise right now it's a CAT 2.

[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.300]
They're saying by that time it makes landfall it might be a CAT tree.

[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.140]
Hurricane Force winds extend outward up to 45 miles an hour from the center to a total storm force winds extend outward up to 140 miles.

[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.100]
The estimated minimum central pressure, 969 millivars, which is not super great, but it's still dangerous.

[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.700]
So, let's up to you. The ball is in your court. Do whatever you want to govern yourselves accordingly.

[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.060]
And I'm not going to say it's going to do this. It's going to do that because we just don't know.

[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.540]
But at the present time it looks like the eye might, well I'm not going to say, right? Right, they'll say.

[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.700]
I'm not going to say it is a riddism because that's irresponsible.

[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.980]
And of course you're weather people, many of them are irresponsible. That's why we like good old Don.

[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.620]
No. Because he's rational, he's calm. He doesn't try to move it around with his hand and the hurricane either.

[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.040]
Okay, here's the poor result from yesterday. Who is most blamed for the dolphins? Sorry, ask team.

[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.980]
Now we didn't put the word ask in there because number one, Joyce would have been upset.

[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.340]
Number two, that would have been like a shot. And we don't want to pick on them while they're down. Do it here.

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.380]
1912 votes. Dave Wonstead. It is the Wonstead era. And obviously most of you are not too pleased with that. It's the Wonstead era.

[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.600]
Right. The Wonstead era is upon you. 647 votes. He wins hands down your pants. I don't give a shmit. Not 396.

[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.480]
They don't care about the freaking dolphins about the NFL, about football, about any of these things or maybe they're friends of another team.

[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.680]
H-2N hyzenge 294. The offensive line 145. I hate the dolphins 124.

[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.700]
Ricky Williams 102 who smoking the newspaper and I was straight at this morning.

[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.120]
Oh, how are David it? And by the way, speaking of Mo.

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.140]
Kind of like Pauling in the Godfather. I got a look for something else to do.

[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.220]
Well, when you think that there's a... Oh, Paulie won't see him no more.

[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.220]
Kind of something like that. Now he'll be helping me around. He's still going to be doing those great dolphin broadcasps for a girls team.

[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.920]
Let's see. We have a new update here. Oh, that's right. The big news. I don't want to do the little valid.

[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:22.100]
Okay, let me finish the pool. Know how it David 98. Rich Spillman. The Spillmites are the general manager who doesn't know a football from Mahalava in 98.

[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:30.360]
J. Feetler 16. He knows his Haleva but that's about it. And AJ touching Feetler the only five. They can't blame him because he's just a punk, you know. They're going to blame him.

[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.880]
Clarence says Hank will be on until 6.30 tonight. The Crow will be on 6.30 to 7.

[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:46.700]
Now, I'm looking at the schedule. We're getting the game... Well, I see. Because the pregame is at 7 o'clock. They're getting the marlins at the braves.

[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]
In fact, last night's loss to the Phillies was at 98. I believe Josh. That's right. Very sad. They're going out on a kind of a sour note here.

[00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:02.880]
But, you know, that was a good season again. There was no reason to be all that this made. And I've said it would be nice for them to make a wild card again for those people who care about baseball, which I don't. But nevertheless.

[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:18.940]
But they gave it a pretty good run and they just ran out of gas like Stevie Dan. And the marlins at the braves 7.30. So let me... Who cares about that? Anyway, Clarence, you know, the most important thing is the Humper's Back. The Humper's Back. Right up the down the streets, okay. And, Aerova, young Kipper, no less.

[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:31.200]
Oh, you know what? Well, it's still September. Some time is sundown. Well, I don't know. In other words, Hank, Hank's got to get out there safely. Otherwise he'll turn into like a pumpkin or something.

[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:44.240]
And we wouldn't want that to happen especially on the first day back. Now what a big pumpkin he could make. You know what? Man, there'd be a lot of honky pack and a whole staff. Anyway, we got very jackass rights of calm today. We got Jim Sarni, rights of calm.

[00:08:45.360 --> 00:09:00.820]
Here's today's poll. I did the poll, right? Yes. All right. Before we do that, we got Olga Cabrina on the Abedant Curtain today. I know a lot of you horny guys out there every day. That's the most important thing on our website, which is unfortunate because we do have some great articles on there. And maybe you might have somebody read them to you someday.

[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:22.380]
But we have Olga Cabrina with gigantic humongous pair and she's a model. She's a bikini model. She's a magazine model. She made no movie. She didn't do none. Although she maybe make some other kind of a reason. I'm sure that you'd like to get a hold of those. You pay this for what you see there. Right for having a big, big set. Anyway, here's the poll question.

[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:36.240]
What's your all time favorite Boca Brian comedy bit? We'll try to play as many of them as we can today, which will fill some great time. I think we think. Absolutely. Although I get some good calls too, like a one on line six WQ I am. Hello. Yeah, Niel Bley speaking.

[00:09:37.060 --> 00:10:03.240]
Niel, I love your show. I got a great story for you about your boy George George. The week before you came, the Monday you came back. You had a conversation with George about howard and how they kept stomping on his show. And you could just listen to the fuzz and you could hear it. Right. Right. And George, do you remember that conversation?

[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:31.660]
George over in kissing your here, your bottom and I called George the week before with the same stuff and George was totally backing the station. And we had was careful. We'll get fined and all that kind of stuff. Right. Well, we would be fine. He's right about that. But we're fine. Oh, we're fine. So let's suppose this like a spy report you're taddling on George grow up. Grow up.

[00:10:32.300 --> 00:11:01.640]
Okay, here's the poll question. What's your all time? Isn't that something to one call I pick up there? It's a guy who's still trying to act like a 10 year old. No, I just I can't. You were gone. George did this and his window that man over podcast over stole another bit from you guy. Yeah, a lot of all right. I bet you that cast and over being under as well. The man dog really quit. I don't think it was that beer thing at all. When you could have cast and over was a man. Can you imagine the stench? Anyway, what's your all time favorite vocal Brian comedy bit? Now I made a little

[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:10.420]
list to get started here. Now do you add the other ones on here also because I fact I get the whole list Josh there. Let me just take a look. We also put

[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:17.600]
poker Brian blows for those people with no sense of humor and no taste. Oh, you don't have all of them on there. At all. I'll get a

[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.760]
one. That's because the food showed up. Oh, I see the foods from how he's yes indeed. Thanks to how he's we loved him there on

[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:33.220]
441 somewhere. Yeah, I think we're going to say we're always reaching for the. I don't think you give them enough credit. I

[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.540]
know we've got all mighty they feed that for as long as I can remember now going back. I don't know. I don't think they

[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.600]
were around when the worst thing was there who used to bring the food all that's right. It was I ran what's his name. Yes,

[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.520]
from Atlantic City. Subzan Hollywood. Maybe to bring a tons of food in the morning and what's his name?

[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.320]
We don't want to see so how he's always brought food into them. But how is his broad and just tons of food and

[00:11:53.320 --> 00:12:00.040]
coarse fad Zach who's over with Joe Rose now on 790 on the ticket which very Jackson seems to be very fond of at

[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:06.800]
any rate. Zach used to just pay. Oh, I mean, unbelievable and the beast right and then Moved come out and get all indignant.

[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:12.680]
If some that's for me there. You shouldn't be touching that. That's for me. Get all men out of shape with poor Gilbert. What's

[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.760]
your all time favorite poker Brian comedy bit and there's so many because lately he's been so great. I figure

[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:24.020]
it's kind of like a little tribute to old chicken neck. Okay, but broker Brian blows for those of you who don't like him and just

[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.440]
those you know, we have nothing but contempt for you, but you got a chance because you're all negative. Those people

[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.080]
Marty Feldman eyes by by Geldy. Moe temple and Geldy Stevens president,

[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.180]
Dumb Schmidt speaking in tongues. We got him weapons of mass destruction, which is a classic for the ages. My

[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:44.560]
religion is better than your religion. Virgin Mary Nazi party. See you in the showers. Screw us again.

[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:52.300]
Evonus graduate. Car baby and Cecil's lament. That's a pretty good start. Don't you think? That's a day of good start.

[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:59.880]
I mean, and the newest that screw us again and see you in the showers. Those are just. They're so good that you just absolutely have to shake your head and amazement.

[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.340]
Say this man must be somewhere in the middle of that very bizarre appearance of his and underneath there above that chicken neck. There must be a brain somewhere.

[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.220]
I'm good to vote for secular humanist pig.

[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:15.500]
What the hell is that? That's my favorite book of Brian Beth. I don't even I never heard of such a fash. Sure, it's great.

[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.760]
Secular humanist pigs.

[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.320]
I did off it. Can we play it?

[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.000]
Let's find out.

[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.640]
Oh, I forgot all of my personal.

[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.740]
I don't find way for a fair man.

[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.520]
I don't propose my shoes.

[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:38.360]
I don't wrap the billet. That's from a passing to me.

[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:45.300]
Oh, and I don't care how good and good business you are.

[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.680]
I don't have this one.

[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.360]
I love you.

[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.160]
Secular humanist pig.

[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.260]
I love you.

[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.080]
Secular humanist pig.

[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.440]
I don't need.

[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.180]
I'll throw.

[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.320]
See, the thing that was almost let it go, and I did you dump it too?

[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:03.880]
Yeah, I dumped it.

[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.640]
I remember it because there was enough of a mild choice one.

[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.100]
I'm not sure if I'm wrong.

[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.160]
I'm going to shake you down to a big blue.

[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.700]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.760]
I've got a very, very Bear.

[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.100]
I'm gonna go to our eyes.

[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.160]

That's what we do.

[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.420]
That's what we do.

[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.300]
Travel, crawl, and tell a model.

[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.260]
That's not.

I'm a big, secular, human and spirit.

Oh my God.

[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:28.700]
You're right.

[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.760]
I can't just see that up over the weekend and get rid of that one GD that we've had jumped by there.

[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.600]
There should be all upset about that.

[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.980]
And for those of you who are external listeners, you missed some really fantastic farts there

[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.860]
toward the end of the show.

[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.120]
Oh yeah.

[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.640]
Needless to say you didn't hear them, but I get here.

[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.500]
I mean, we heard of the pre-delay and we all get Josh and George and now we get here all the

[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.820]
funding sounds that you have to get bleeped out or those of you who listen to it on the

[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.160]
station, which I can't say that well.

[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.720]

No bait and switch.

[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:53.320]
No phone.

[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.320]

It's a key.

[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.860]
It's lucidlety.

[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.040]
On 560-8AM.

[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.800]
Oh were you drugs-packing?

[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.520]
You're.

[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.400]
When we the tele-hazzy-nazzy, oh, you got the money from this daddy.

[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.740]
Oh, and if I said my little daddy, oh, hurry.

[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.100]
We've been in jettin' that scratchy.

[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.220]
Oh, well he's a tele-hazzy-nazzy.

[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.740]
No more tele-hazzy-nazzy.

[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.180]
Oh, he's a president, you son.

[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.700]
Who doesn't have to run?

[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.240]
No one else is gonna win.

[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.000]
He might as well just move right in.

[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:49.900]
Sing hard.

[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.520]
Sing hard.

[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.020]
Sing hard.

[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.900]
He has the coldest food.

[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.520]
He was born with nothing's ass.

[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.020]
So look out all you do.

[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.640]
Get ready for the gas.

[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.740]
He's a tele-hazzy-nazzy.

[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.780]
Oh, he'll give our people rights to Wendy.

[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.120]
Oh, why's he the tele-hazzy-nazzy?

[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.040]
Oh, go back to LA.

[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.060]
Well he's a very wealthy dude.

[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.220]
With very fast use, who never paid the suit?

[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.980]
My next year will all be screwed.

[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:21.820]
Sing hard.

[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.480]
Sing hard.

[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.020]
Sing hard.

[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.520]
Sing hard.

[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.440]
Any smart clue in that race against Buddy McCay?

[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.200]
Why do you think they call it Cooper?

[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.680]
Victoria, anyway, give it to our Latin-adventure.

[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.120]
You think they can't take his asses?

[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.160]
Yeah, he's a tele-hazzy-nazzy.

[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.420]
Double-dance-a-way.

[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.460]
Come on, let's do stuff.

[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.680]
Come on, let's go.

[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.800]
Got that under tele-hazzy-nazzy?

[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.920]
We got it under, right away.

[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.660]
Well, even just if it's a great bit,

[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.880]
but even if only just for that line,

[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.880]
why do you think they call it a dooburn-a-tory-one-way?

[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:03.840]
I mean, who else?

[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.720]
What other chicken echelonistic-erotica-rookies?

[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.000]
Oh my god, it's unbelievable.

[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.360]
Anyway, old Joy Hammer is back.

[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.760]
Now, that headline there, and I realize Jim Sarni

[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.700]
don't write the headlines, but that sounds almost sarcastic to me.

[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.640]
And I say I'm not sure the hopper, okay?

[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.440]
Jim Sarni writes today, Hank Goldberg went into an unhappy fan

[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.380]
on the street last week.

[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.020]
There's no Joy in the afternoon since Goldberg's suspension

[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.960]
to fan-thoedipopter sports soft show host.

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.160]
Sheerup says Sarni, it's time to smile and laugh again.

[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.200]
Goldberg's vacation finally ended yesterday.

[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.640]
The hopper will be back on the air for this afternoon.

[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.460]
Thank god, man. Thank you.

[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:37.820]

[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.620]
WQM came to its senses and looked at its foolish suspension.

[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.300]
Oh, I'm circling that.

[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.580]
I'm going to put this up on the wall.

[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.500]
I'm going to put it in tea rooms everywhere.

[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.160]
WQM came to its senses and looked at its foolish suspension.

[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.000]
I just want to work against head Goldberg,

[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.440]
who was suspended for remarks about Marlon's owner, Jeffrey Lourie,

[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.500]
as a marital situation, and its possible impact on the team's finances.

[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.500]
I enjoyed the eight-weeks-off with pay,

[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.260]
but I got a lot to talk about the hopper said.

[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.940]
Goldberg was the highest rated sports show in the market

[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.840]
at WQM's annual manager, Greg Reed,

[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.400]
discussed the situation yesterday.

[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.980]
I clarified for him that I was reporting a story

[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.580]
and I had no accident with anybody Goldberg said.

[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.640]
While Goldberg was gone, 790 ESPN radio,

[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.080]
they dude with Dan La Bastard in the afternoon drive slot,

[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.500]
a show that's hot-heavy with paid ESPN guests.

[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.320]
I'm sure we lost some audience,

[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.780]
but hopefully they'll come back Goldberg said, along with the fun.

[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.520]
My job is to bring back the joy, the hopper said.

[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.820]
And Barry Jackass writes in the anxious hero this morning,

[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.100]
where he's got, he varies it all over the place, man.

[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.400]
I bet he's got three brown bags today, you know what?

[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.040]
Hank Goldberg says the headline,

[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.500]
Goldberg returns to talk radio.

[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.840]
Hank Goldberg's eight-week hiatus is over the long time.

[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.180]
WQM talk show host said he'll be back on here today,

[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.200]
after being reinstated from suspension

[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.840]
during a Thursday lunch meeting with General Manager, Greg Reed.

[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.880]
I didn't know that the hopper ate soot, gee, did you?

[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.080]
We had a cordial conversation said Goldberg,

[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.520]
who was suspended August Tured for comments about Marlon's owner, Jeffrey Lourious,

[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.480]
Marital situation and his potential impact on a stadium deal.

[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.280]
Our understanding is I'm not going to talk about why I was suspended,

[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.060]
Reed wants to put it behind us.

[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.920]
I expressed to him I was disappointed with the length of the suspension

[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.520]
and not knowing what was going on.

[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.080]
I don't want to go back with hard feelings, said the hopper.

[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.020]
Goldberg was vindictive at a QM since 1992, said Reed will not try to restrict what he says,

[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.060]
he didn't ask me to sign anything.

[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.500]
Goldberg's contract expired, and I see we got some very bad information on this

[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.120]
from people around the station, they know something and don't know squat.

[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.400]
I tried to tell you a long time ago that his contract ran to the end of the year,

[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.480]
that's what I've heard, and I was for once in my life right,

[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.540]
his contract expired as December 31,

[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.840]
Reed told him he wants to get to that in a couple of weeks.

[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.760]
Asked if he wants to stay at WQM long term, Goldberg said he doesn't know,

[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.740]
we'll see how it goes, said the hopper.

[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.220]
He returns it for this afternoon, thank the lord.

[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.100]
He's been always on mothballs for the time being,

[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.160]
and preparing course for another disparate dolphin game this weekend.

[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.380]
790, very right, the ESPN radio has proved to be a formidable competitor in WQM.

[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.560]
Now how do we know that?

[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.960]
Have we kissed his head so?

[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:04.840]
Oh, I see.

[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.540]
The station has had numerous marquee guests including Jimmy's Johnson,

[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.640]
Gary Schiffield, Bud Sealigpat Riley,

[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.800]
Grand Hill and Mark Cuban all on the Dan LaBancher show,

[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.860]
and Dan Reno on Joe Rosas' program.

[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.840]
Miguel pointed out why he's kissing up to them.

[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.560]
And why is he on the Dan LaBancher show?

[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.980]
Oh, that's because Dan LaBancher, of course, is from the hero,

[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.440]
so that, you know, it's an incestuous thing there.

[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.920]
I guarantee you a very great way, I mean, he may cut you off pretty soon,

[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.700]
if he keeps sucking up to Dan LaBancher, all right.

[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:34.320]
Greg may be talking to Dim Sarni pretty soon, you may be out,

[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.820]
you may be, oh, how about that thing is, O-T-L.

[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.760]
Anyway, he also writes, which I find somewhat amusing,

[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.560]
Channel 10 Sports Stamp Live, which already was in need of major repairs,

[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.740]
received a huge blow this week, when Jim Maddett

[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.420]
resigned as an offshoot of beer gate.

[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.280]
If you missed it, President A. Beer, the sponsor of the program,

[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.620]
was offended, and managed to was drinking Hynac in after the show.

[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.620]
Oh, I thought for sure that we were in.

[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.220]
Hynac, yeah.

[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.600]
Channel 10 asked Maddett to appease the sponsor, and Maddett's quit.

[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.260]
He told him, up your nose with a glass hose.

[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.160]
WPLG very says, there's no business trying to influence what Maddett

[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.960]
does on his own time, and President A. Beer's petty about making an issue of it.

[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.300]
Mandate said he wasn't happy about the direction of the show,

[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.800]
and its overboard attempt to appeal to casual fans,

[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.040]
WPLG has subjected us to a few mindless segments, including a weekly feature,

[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.540]
in which the outcome of the Monday Night Football Game is predicted,

[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.280]
based on what food bull a dog runs to.

[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.600]
Oh, boy, and of course he didn't even mention the fact that

[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.120]
Casper and Overson here, which is not to make anybody barf,

[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.840]
including the dog.

[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.760]
So there's all the business.

[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.860]
Let's see, here's a fact that says Neil.

[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.720]
I fear you may lose some of your younger listeners earlier in your show,

[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.940]
if I'm like most often, we're listening to 103.1 to get the entire

[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.800]
Howard Stern show.

[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.020]
QA in Butcher's the show so much it's un-listenable.

[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.360]
He said it's un-listenable.

[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.440]
And as a double-rammy, 103.1 has a decent contemporary rock format,

[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.680]
better than any format in Miami.

[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.360]
Normally, are we missing your opening, we're hearing some good music.

[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.040]
Well, that's really a bitch, isn't it?

[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.240]
Yeah, well, well, you know what life pays on.

[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.380]
I get paid the same either way.

[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.780]
I appreciate your concern, et cetera, and so on.

[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.200]
But we'll give it ourselves accordingly.

[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.500]
How is the pull coming on the Vokobrium, bitch?

[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.320]
Well, I better get with it.

[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.040]
I got a whole bunch of them to play with you out three hours through.

[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:22.140]
There's John Kerry, which was not a terrorist haven before the invasion.

[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.980]
You tell him, John.

[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.280]
Anyway, here's the deal.

[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.260]
What's your all-time favorite Vokobrium, bitch?

[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.360]
President Dombstrom at 23, weapons of mass destruction,

[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.180]
which is just a brilliant piece that should be played

[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.080]
at a certain radio station in America, damn them.

[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.120]
Marty Feldman, eyes, eight, Ibonus graduate, seven, my religion,

[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.120]
seven motel of guilty, Stevens five.

[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.580]
Vokobrium blow is five idiots say that.

[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.240]
Five people would absolutely not taste.

[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.760]
Carbivy, V, heaven four.

[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.760]
Speaking in tongues three, bye-bye, goldies got three.

[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.480]
We got them two.

[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.320]
And one for telehassy, Nazi secular, who made his pigs about one.

[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.120]
Cecil's them at one.

[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:53.980]
Nazi party, one virgin, Mary one.

[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.720]
Scruis again and see when the showers don't have any yet their brain new,

[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.260]
and I guess they're kissing out of that.

[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.280]
Evie, we're both so far.

[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.640]
Now, do you think we, at least people are going to call in with other suggestions?

[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.780]
Because we can scroll through to the DCS.

[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.020]
They'll find out.

[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.040]
WQA, and hello.

[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.080]
Good morning, sir.

[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.380]
Is it allowed to put bits that you can no longer play?

[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:14.980]
Sure.

[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.100]
Absolutely.

[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.640]
How about the restitution song and condolese?

[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:20.820]
Okay.

[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:21.900]
No problem.

[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.600]
Okay.

[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.340]
He got the name.

[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.820]
Yeah, he got the name.

[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.280]
Well, this guy knows this stuff.

[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:55.860]
He's a real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real real

[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:01.360]
Republicans state Assemblyman Jim Tadisco recently told a crowd at a GOP cookout in Saratoga County

[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.920]
But using Heinz Ketchup would benefit Curie's presidential campaign

[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.820]
The Democratic Senator from Massachusetts is married to Teresa Heinz Curie

[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.140]
Whose late husband was an Assembly of the Continent Driant's founder as we all well know

[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.080]
The H.J. Heinz Company co-wind of Tadisco's comments and responded saying

[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.120]
It's Ketchup is a non-partisan kind of an enjoyed by Republicans Democrats and Independence alike

[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.760]
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.920]
Well, they don't want to wind up like French fries. It's got a political bent. They don't want to wind up like French fries and friends

[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.800]
They don't want to be toast

[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.260]
The company says Heinz Curie is involved with Heinz funded in Dalmatian foundations

[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:42.060]
But the company's ketchup not not the company's ketchup business never less to disco says he's a mustard man until the November election

[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.180]
How do you like that? Oh, I sure hope he's not using franches

[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.480]
Wouldn't that be bad

[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.060]
Like a silly

[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:56.860]
As-wipes. Oh, I thought you haven't got any memo from Joyce yet. So I guess ass wipe is okay

[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.320]
And probably a good idea to every now and then here's some bad news

[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.420]
Well, let's take a few more calls get some more names on a poll WQ. I'm hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.460]
Yeah, I agree is a shoot. Okay great WQ. I'm hello

How about a funky FD? Oh, I like that, but that's not him

[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.380]
Oh, it's that no that's a lot of words money Python

[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.480]
Oh, I think I'm okay

[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.700]
We have a couple of taxes

[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:30.200]
You know suggesting bits that aren't his also I mean, I mean we understand that they would not have no way of knowing for sure

[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.380]
What the deal is and saying what like which ones? Oh

[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.760]

[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.900]
I said that's sent you to small mizidium miles around

[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.180]
Even worse than some of those cruise ships Mickey Erison's running

[00:27:54.060 --> 00:28:00.240]
At least the arctic kitchen fire and I don't think anybody got raked it on it all of us in miracle with all the manuals on there one of each your sex

[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:01.820]
let's see

[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.000]
Gene aiming at Florida. Do we have the 11 o'clock and five? Yeah, there it is nice job. Thank you

[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:15.380]
Let's see hurricane warnings in effect for the Northwest in Bahamas including the Abacus and Rosalind

[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.440]
Very islands

[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.200]
Divinity elutra and the great Bahama Island and new providence

[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.180]
Hurricane watching effect long the east coast of Florida from Florida City to St. Augustine

[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.560]
Hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions possible in the watch area next to 36 hours

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.860]
Tropical storm warning and effect for the central Bahamas including cat island. They have zoomers long island

[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.000]
Rom-K and sans Salvador

[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.240]
Interest elsewhere in the Florida peninsula should closely monitor the process of gene

[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.880]
The dancing machine reminded also from some natural sundown a Saturday is a young Kippur

[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.780]
Salam Jewish holiday some of your Jewish neighbors in the watch and warning areas observing young Kippur will be

[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.880]
What well?

[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.580]
Listening to radios are watching TV and may not be aware of these situations. We're not gonna do an up-set them any a trace food

[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.000]
Oh, I can't eat anyway. At a little bit of clock this morning

[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.940]
Center of hurricane gene located in your landitude a lot of it landed to 26.2 north

[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.380]
Longitude 72.4 west or about

[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.840]
290 miles east of great abacoe island moving toward the west at nine miles an hour

[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.720]
Motion expected to continue with a slight increase in forward speed the next 24 hours

[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:25.740]
This motion could bring the center of gene your north western Bahamas on Saturday maximum sustained winds near 100 miles an hour with higher

[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.980]
Guts some slow strengthening possible during the next 24 hours

[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:35.100]
Hurricane force Windsor sent outward up to 45 miles from the center tropical storm force winds extend outward up to

[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.360]
250 miles an estimated minimum central pressure is

[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.240]
969 millibars got it got it and

[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.840]

No wonder round is for nothing's you

[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.800]
I don't know just a little who's you

[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.940]
Out of hell you're just more close to me than I am

[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.160]
I don't know why I tell you

[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.820]
I don't know why I tell you

[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.500]
I don't know why I tell you

[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.940]
I don't know why I tell you

[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.700]
I don't know why I tell you

I don't know why I tell you

I don't know why I tell you

[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.900]
You all have to be doing the double or triple shots here

[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.180]
I got some fantastic news

[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.840]
The hopper returns it for this afternoon

[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.280]
Till 630 because we don't want to turn them into a good one when the sun goes down

[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.120]
And number two, well I have some good news and bad news

[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:50.020]
The bad news is that I had a message on my answering machine last night on my voice mail when I came home

[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.020]
The rumors are into me

[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.100]
That's the bad news

[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.640]
The good news is I wasn't here

[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.820]
And that's a good news

[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.340]
Oh you know when we left off the pole

[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.000]
Which I'm shocked that you didn't remember this

[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.220]
Oh, focus on it

[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.040]
Get it on there, Johnny

[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.960]
What if you're a good one?

[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.480]
You didn't just call for focus on it

[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.120]
There's a lot of this place I know

[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.100]
Yeah, we know the wealthy people here

[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.680]
But it's where a royal people are

[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.520]
And that's what I like about Goka

[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.940]
But down there he goes on and has a small

[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.120]
And down where they say, how cool

[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.120]
And every corner has a wall

[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.060]
And that's where I like about Goka

[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.680]
And then 10 grand out of all the world's museums

[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.060]
And the day when George Baker is usually taking these delicacies

[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.340]
That's what I like about Goka

[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.740]
All the dreams and tools are out of control

[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:56.260]
Now BNW is a belief in pressure and being ruined

[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.940]
That's what I like about Goka

[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.320]
Who'd she built her own churches

[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.440]
When she was making some approaches

[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.640]
If you were clean, let you touch us

[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.240]
And that's what I like about Goka

[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.680]
We really don't care what you think

[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.900]
You see how a dude who doesn't stink

[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.940]
He doesn't stink at all

[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.740]
And that's what I like about Goka

[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.200]
Goka

[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.000]
You know what I think about Goka

[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.340]
The pulpit of the ocean

[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.380]
The ocean Brian's first to dry and hit you know what?

[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.040]
What of?

[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.240]
It certainly was

[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.520]
Oh and then we got to Rick Riley stole my briefcase

[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.260]
So that's on him though

[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:51.900]
That's his medkagey

[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.100]
A.J.

[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.340]
Get her in a belief

[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.060]
Get her in a way

[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.440]
One of them

[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:54.800]
One of them

[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.620]
One of those that are crazy people

[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.660]
Do we have a sit-in on a bench and a rail on here?

[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.660]
No we don't

[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.240]
Because that's so that was big for like a year

[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.380]
That would be huge yeah

[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.280]
We're going to be playing like two, three, four of these at a time

[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.160]
Don't forget, on the 30 we got those rating trends come up

[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.180]
Does anybody care at all?

[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:09.940]
No not really

[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:10.860]
Those irating trends

[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.780]
I don't think guys are going to be very good on this show

[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.500]
Because we're dropping off with all the difference to you

[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.020]
We're dropping off a huge mayor

[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.680]
So unless you had a gigantic one

[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.460]
Which is possible

[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.640]
You were kicking some serious butt

[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.500]
That's what my debilTool me

[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:24.840]
Yeah

[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.640]
President Bush speaking of butt has opened a slight lead over Senator John Kerry in Florida

[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.900]
But the race still remains within the margin of error 40 days before the election

[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.420]
According away

[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.280]
CNN USA did a gallup pull release yesterday

[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.520]
Keep in mind the gallup part

[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.720]
Where they like to interview a lot of Republicans and about two Democrats

[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:45.520]
The poll also found that Republicans in the sunshine state were more enthusiastic about voting this year than Democrats

[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.280]
Now that to me is just how is that possible?

[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.180]
How is that possible?

[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.040]
They screwed you over to first and they stole a freaking election

[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:58.040]
We've got all this insanity going on lies up the old Yin Yang and oh brother

[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:04.120]
But voters were overall less optimistic about economic conditions that they were in July before three hurricanes

[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.640]
Better the state and now a fourth

[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.260]
Yesterday's poll in Florida

[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.900]
With the fourth CNN USA did a gallup battleground state poll release this week

[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.640]
Bush also led another three states surveyed Iowa, Nevada and West Virginia

[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:20.920]
Also yesterday two other poll showed Bush opening a significantly another swing state with Wisconsin

[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.200]
Which went Democratic four years ago that is just shocking to me

[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:24.800]
Up the terrace

[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.320]
Yeah

[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.000]
Among likely voters surveyed

[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.740]
Among likely voters surveyed in Florida

[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:36.600]
49% that they supported Bush 46 Kerry and 2% still keep claying to that old cling on Ralph Nader

[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.160]
That is just amazing to me

[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.180]
And even your navel length is more vibrant than Ralph Nader

[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.560]
Among registered voters 47% show Bush 45 Nader

[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.000]
And two for a Nader that's in Florida

[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.000]
Emerging mirror plus or minus four points so it'll be as tight and of course

[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:59.860]
Unfortunately Nader will be on a ballot in Florida after the state supreme court last week turned out a challenge to his candidacy brought on by the Democrats

[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:04.660]
Another Florida poll that came out there is it conducted by Quinnipy Act University showed a larger lead for Bush

[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.500]
With registered voters 4941 with Nader at 5%

[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.560]
Oh my God

[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.180]
Wow

[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.520]
And of course it makes sense because I asked about their feelings about the Florida economy

[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.920]
41% of the respondents said it was excellent or good down from 51% in July

[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.880]
And the latest poll 57% of the economy was only fair compared with just 47% in July

[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.700]
So my sense that Bush is got a bigger lead not on it not as in

[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.220]
Blu blu blu

[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:28.520]
Da

[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.980]
As to say we're more enthusiastic than usual about voting this year

[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:32.900]
Here's the bizarre news

[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.940]
63% Republican said yes

[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.280]
Compared with just 56% of Democrats

[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.680]
I mean the Democrats it should have been 99 and 910% should be following it from up

[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.840]
It should be clawing at the door to get out to go vote

[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:52.340]
42% Democrats said they were not more enthusiastic than usual compared with 37% of Republicans who also felt that way

[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.780]
Yaudi yaudi yaudi

[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.880]
Bush is leading Iowa was out co-orcairied in 2000 marked an unwelcome shift for Kerry

[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:04.260]
The Hawkeye state was where the Massachusetts center revived his Foundering campaign during January's Democratic Christian caucuses

[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.380]
And it consists on that Bush and the polls until the convention in West Virginia Bush had a lead among likely voters

[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:14.360]
51 to 45 with native getting less than half a 1% among registered voters

[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:20.060]
It was a 51 for Bush 42 for Kerry and native with 2% and it just goes on in Nevada

[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.400]
Bush 52% of likely voters with Kerry 43 and native with one

[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.640]
Much closer among registered voters with Bush at 48, K-46 and native with two

[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.860]
So obviously there's a whole thing that's been a bit of a getting the hold off baby that's where it's at

[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:41.260]
And ABC in this poll was constant and Bush with 53, Kerry 43 and native 1% with likely voters

[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:46.500]
Among registered voters in Wisconsin ABC's poll 50% for Bush 44 and 2% for native

[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.980]
You better wake up there, scary Kerry

[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.240]
Wake up, somebody slap him on the back of the head, okay?

[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.320]
This is actually all common sense

[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.340]
Well, here you go

[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.200]
Oh man, does he tell the like it is or what?

[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.960]
God, that is pretty scary

[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.820]
Okay, so we're gonna play a lot of vocal Brian stuff today so far on the poll

[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.220]
Which it gives us a chance to, especially with all you people out there doing your hurricane stuff

[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.940]
And wondering around again with applied with the shutters

[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.900]
And it must be getting pretty ponderous and old

[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.580]
I'm looking out the window here and it's sunny, it's beautiful man

[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.280]
It is just lovely, they're in a cloud in the sky, there's no rain inside the forecast

[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:30.400]
Let's see, sunny and like pretty an Indian summer issue today, just like yesterday 29, what's everybody?

[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.900]
83, 84 something like that

[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:38.020]
sunny and 75 tomorrow, sunny on and 60 on Sunday and sunny and 73 in Toronto on Monday

[00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.920]
It looks beautiful, I know it can't stand over like this Toronto weather reports

[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.880]
Because I'm on a touch

[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.740]
Touch this poll, you idiot

[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.220]
And by the way, you're the real reason Mad Dog got off that she was embarrassed to be in the same platform with your fat ass

[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.660]
Anyway, what's your all time favorite vocal Brian comedy bit?

[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.120]
And nobody tell me about Hanks fat ass, mad dog is proud to be on the show with Hanks fat ass

[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.480]
Okay, then I would catch an over

[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.900]
President Amishman 45, Conn, Alisa 25, weapons of mass destruction 22, Ibonic Sgraduate 19

[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.940]
My religion is better near religion

[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:12.220]
18, Marty Feldman, IEyes, 15, Motable of Gildy Stevens 8, Vocabron blows 8

[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.020]
Eight people got the gall to say that

[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.460]
Pick it on old chicken neck

[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.740]
Bye bye Gildy 7, Tar Baby 5, Spicken and Tongues 4, Tallahatsi Nazi's got three

[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.340]
Sitting on a bench in Del Rey 2, we got him's got appear

[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.080]
One for the rest of the two songs, one for the secular humerus pig that was Georgia's vote

[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.360]
Cecil Vemette won, Nazi party won, the Virgin Mary's got one

[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.940]
The vocal song don't have any?

[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.700]
Oh my god, how we've lost an IOD audience, you know what?

[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.200]
Yeah, wow, and now I've just got one

[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.000]
What's this one on there?

[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.020]
And screw us again and see when the showers don't have any cause they're brand new

[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.040]
You better get with it 194 vote, 11th 13 at QAM

[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:51.440]
You will see the needle Roger, Sun, Correction, and the plastic begins to show 8am

[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.060]
My life took their card or the ball

[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.020]
He drives my viewer, get she's three feet tall

[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.800]
I went and right was on a no way

[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.260]
I said I'd give you their latest again

[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.960]
So I'm just sitting on a bench in Del Rey

[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.420]
Waiting for the only place to take me away

[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:30.960]
Or I'm just sitting on a bench in Del Rey

[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.740]
With my friend Tyne

[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.660]
The first time I did try to tell him I'm changing

[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.740]
Because the first is always day to day

[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.920]
All they're gonna do is get her tells me to do

[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.280]
The time in high life keep my skin stained

[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:58.260]
I'm just sitting in, resting my bones

[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:02.280]
When they ride my wife or me be alone

[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.600]
Or we've got it over and I never win

[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.600]
I just wind up slipping through the wall again

[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.560]
So I sit on a bench in Del Rey

[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.020]
Waiting for the only place to take me away

[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.760]
So I'm just sitting on a bench in Del Rey

[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.600]
With my friend Tyne

[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.520]
The first time I did try to tell him I'm changing

[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.200]
Because the first time I did try to tell him I'm changing

[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.600]
I just wind up slipping through the wall again

[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:46.600]

[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.460]
Here, roll, chop, and add a drink

[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:52.480]
That's you made it by the twingers at the GOP

[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.660]
Then if you made it this time no, then no

[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:00.420]
Thought you see a cross through us again

[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.940]
That's the cross, the earth, the world, the earth

[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.860]
That's gone, the power, the world, the doubts, got another map

[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.820]
If you vote for this time no, then no

[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.260]
That should be a punch through us again

[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.820]
Oh, come on, do a better shit

[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.460]
This is bad, this is bad, this is bad

[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.220]
We'll try to face him through the dark sea

[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.180]
We'll get it, let us set aside

[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.100]
We don't feel better

[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.440]
We'll get it, let us set aside

[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.660]
Let us treat white captain

[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.780]
Then those shy and the bush

[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.220]
With short of blood

[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.120]
And caught the snow

[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.180]
And my boys with a blue

[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.280]
We'll choose

[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.120]
To rise

[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:59.160]
The two must kill

[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.280]
I wish it was a part of the battle

[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.600]
Round back, round back, right

[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.080]
And when the same time

[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.200]
Enter your command round

[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.240]
And you're both a part of the round back

[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.760]
And take all the time

[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.280]
Both the same cause

[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.880]
And grab some where it won't matter who

[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.960]
Or when you go like a trick for push through

[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.520]
We did a last fight this time

[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.220]
Don't let up

[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.820]
That should be a punch through us again

[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.000]
Oh, come on, do a better shit

[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.240]
This is bad, this is bad, this is bad

[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.780]
We're gonna try to face him

[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.700]
Speaking of the last eastern round back

[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.460]
So yesterday that congressional lawmakers

[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.940]
Are close to the deal that would significantly raise the maximum

[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.380]
Fine the FCC may impose against broadcasters

[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.820]
And violates its indecency regulations

[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.160]
Oh my god

[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.580]
In particular, brown back said

[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.680]
An amendment offered by Senator Byron Dorgon

[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.400]
To reinstitute the FCC's old media ownership rules

[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.520]
Will likely be dropped

[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.880]
What is reports that legislators

[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.760]
Are now hoping to add the indecency legislation

[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.400]
When upcoming defense spending bill

[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.100]
Which could be signed by president push

[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.600]
Sometime before the end of this year

[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.400]
The Senate and June passed a bill that would

[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.560]
Increase funds as much as

[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.920]
275 grand for the first incident

[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.880]
With a per day maximum penalty of

[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.980]
Three million dollars

[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.760]
The House of Representatives approved

[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.880]
Legislation of raised funds for as much as 500,000 per violation

[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.420]
Both the House and Senate persons

[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.800]
Required the FCC to consider license revocation

[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.120]
For any station that violates the indecency rules three or more times

[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.340]
Three strikes in your out

[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.560]
How do you like that?

[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.180]
How about 80-present-yin dollars each time

[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.220]
How about each time you play a fart sound

[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.200]
45-podrillion dollars sounds reasonable to me

[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:41.780]
Right

[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.820]
Body of missing ceremony executive found fraud

[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.300]
And you know

[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.240]
This is so perfect

[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.960]
This story, well, that is amusing

[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.360]
I mean, I guess it wasn't to him

[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.600]
Well, the way he did his name

[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.600]
But, uh, it's certainly as famous for their fraud

[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.560]
And good reason some of the stuff is not to

[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.640]
Because nobody don't like ceremony

[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.400]
But I guess in this case they made an exception

[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.400]
There's always one exception

[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.140]
Steve or Severeville, Tennessee

[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.320]
I don't know how you say that

[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.220]
Some bizarre place

[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.540]
Of course, if it's in Tennessee it's got to be bizarre

[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:12.440]
A place every tired ceremony executive missing since he met with a couple about buying his SUV

[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.940]
Was found dead yesterday

[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.420]
Frozen in a rented storage unit

[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.100]
The couple was arrested much

[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.500]
Federal authorities believe was a bungled car-jacking

[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.360]
James Dale Cochman, 71 of Greenville, South Carolina

[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.100]
Had been missing since September 14

[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.980]
The day he was to meet David Wendell Aedons and Jennifer Annette Holloway

[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.680]
I miss that day

[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.640]
Authorities believe Cochman, there it is again, may have suffocated from duct tape

[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.280]
That Eden's 34 in Holloway 27 used to cover his mouth and autopsy will be performed

[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.640]
The interpretation I have right now is that his death was an accident

[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:48.160]
Ardrow Clark, special agent in charge of the FBI office in Knoxville for the news conference yesterday

[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.620]
Eden's in Holloway were taken into custody if they were all smoking out in the home in charge of car-jacking

[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:56.180]
They appeared in federal court yesterday in Knoxville being held by US Marshals

[00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:00.440]
Additional charges for kidnapping and possibly from murder were expected, Clark said

[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.500]
State kidnapping charges rather than South Carolina

[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:06.600]
Cochman was last seen buying a cup of coffee to convene in Stirner parking lot

[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.700]
Where he was supposed to meet a couple interested in his 1996 GMC Suburban

[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.700]
The Eden's in Holloway gave him a hundred dollar deposit to leave before and where to pay him

[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.880]
The remaining $8400 the next day

[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.360]
In a statement of authorities Holloway said she had Eden's met Cochman, 4th of the

[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.600]
Eden's Suburban, placed duct tape over his mouth and drove directly to their home

[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.660]
When they got there they realized their victim was dead, Clark said in the C.B.R. Bill

[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.820]
Mr. Eden's put him in deep presence of the body to a storage facility, let it be lifted there

[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:32.900]
We don't know why

[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:37.640]
Clark said the FBI was able to identify Holloway's cell phone number, track it to C.B.R. Bill

[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.980]
Authorities obtained a search warrant went to the couple's home

[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.920]
Clark said Eden's refused to talk to the authorities who recovered Cochman's Suburban at the home

[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.500]
Holloway had only Mr. Meen arrest for sharply enforced checks and repressed

[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.320]
Eden's criminal history was unknown

[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.880]
Cochman became chairman and chief executive of Cerely's P.Y.A. monarch division 85

[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:59.200]
Then became chairman of Cerely food service before retiring in 1992 and then moving to the deep freeze

[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.720]
All the other Cerely products, huh? Nobody don't like Cerely

[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.640]
No, it sounds like an accident to me, don't you think?

[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:07.900]
Must've been

[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.460]
He didn't want to kill him

[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.100]
He just wanted to muzzle up a little bit and then take this suburban

[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.300]
That's all and then of course he just happened to die on him, damn it

[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.860]
I hate when that hatched

[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.900]
He's been in the deep freeze for crying out loud, for Christ's sake

[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:26.820]
Can I say that? No

[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.540]
For, uh, f*** sake

[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.420]
President Dombchman, man, we're gonna have to play that after the break

[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.340]
And also the even companies that were talking the original one

[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.180]
Let's play that too, the original one, not

[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:43.020]
Reconz of master's destruction 24, favorite poker brine bit of all time

[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.020]
He bought his graduate 22, my religion is better than your religion 22

[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.400]
Sit on a bench until 18, Marty Feldman, I was 17

[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.500]
So many, I was just unbelievable

[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.280]
Unbelievable, but 251 and of course we got 10 smart answers out there

[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.660]
Bokeh brine blows

[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.680]
You wanna sing to me when you hold me in your watchers

[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.700]
And conclusively, I'm five to six

[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.340]
You're a fan

[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.980]
That my junior honey

[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:15.980]
So glad

[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.100]
All the heartburn

[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.440]
Every time I see

[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.980]
He's president of f***er

[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.820]
Repel the kids muscle in

[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.240]
And in our table in India

[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.380]
I don't know why

[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.180]
They wouldn't want to stop a 90s

[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.300]
He's just moved to the accordion

[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.740]
With president of f***er

[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.240]
He wants to help us f***er

[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:05.240]
Oh, what I did to him was not much more small

[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:10.260]
And get to window voted for

[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.860]
Oh, what I did to him was not much more small

[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:14.860]

[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.700]
He wants to help us

[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:21.780]
Don't talk about the kids drumming stupidly

[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.480]
Don't talk about the kids

[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.800]
Don't talk about the kids even

[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:29.840]
Don't talk about the kids

[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:29.840]

[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.620]
Who's a fan

[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.860]
Lover than me

[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:35.840]
He's president of f***er

[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.780]
He's all care wanted to

[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.760]
You got him here by hooker's looks

[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.420]
For the Christmas ride

[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:45.320]
No one else you would die for

[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.460]
Have no fear

[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.660]
We've got a great leader

[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:57.800]
With president of f***er

[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.500]
President of f***er

[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.500]
He wants to help us f***er

[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:10.160]
I'm lying on the edge of him

[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.800]
Oh, what I do

[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.020]
Oh, what I do

[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.280]
Oh, what I do

[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:27.780]
Oh, what I do

[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.640]
Oh, what I do

[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:39.940]
Oh, what I do

[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:43.220]
What I do

[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:47.580]
You're supposed to respect the leader

[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.400]
He's the never-streeter

[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.560]
You're supposed to be respected

[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:54.800]
Very much

[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.240]
Pretending to be

[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:29.040]
I'm focused on that.

[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.220]
My ability to beautify my ability and capture my desire

[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:30.220]

[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:59.760]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:29.360]
Let me turn it through if I have 60 WQM John Kerry just gave a simple, unbelieveable speech in Philadelphia standing ovation after standing ovation when he finished that, Joe Biden was gonna give a little deep throat action there was unbelievable it was rousing I thought he was gonna kiss him right on lips and a little tongue action as well Anyway, no really was and even Bill Schneider on CNN they certainly not see news network said that He didn't talk about his Vietnam service and about his war record would happen 30 years ago They finally found his voice and one of the great things he did was he said he would if he's a president

[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:40.360]
he's gonna hold these Saudis responsible for funding international terrorism and click a blame we're really belongs as opposed to the Bush moisture and his good buddy bandar Bush and all those schmutz and I do it there

[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:52.800]
He's just saying that because he's not on their payroll Now here's a fact that you just so I'll need to do the promo here look for the QM van that I'd 79 to hooters and Kendall 79 to night hooters and Kendall stop by to win

[00:54:52.800 --> 00:55:00.280]
crappy cheap prizes that's all we got and enjoy specials on president the imported beer that's in 79 to Kendall hooters and join George tomorrow

[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:07.060]
new to two of those titles Mitsubishi and Davie go by and see him especially if you're like one of the chronic selected guy with the eyes the fanny pack guy

[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:12.840]
stop by to win prizes and drink free food from a lighting city subs were our use to make the difference but we don't know who's there now but the food's great

[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:18.560]
get there early before the employees all hop up the free food and even if you're celebrating on Kippur tomorrow

[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:26.580]
well you know just think it in your bag in your sack like the pickles at the rest of us this fact you sent me is just so I'm using it so typical of

[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:34.320]
the soft loader Alex R in the Gable says I love the new line of a certain rush is what more can you ask for the top two

[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:40.260]
personalities on radio back to back can't beat beat so you think that Alex is a happy camper right well guess what

[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:49.220]
then he goes on to say something really ridiculous I think both shows can learn from each other I'm sure that I'm sure that

[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:54.600]
Stern is going to change the show dramatically probably starting on Monday so they can emulate see over the years I've heard

[00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:01.200]
there are these just a certain one of either there is so little relationship between the show and Howard Stern show that it's staggering

[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:08.180]
isn't pretty good crossover there thank goodness between listeners but but they're not at all the same show very different

[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:12.360]
which is great because who wants first of all I went to problem we had all sports on this station eighty

[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:19.040]
hours a day it's all the same thing Danny and Jimmy and Jimmy and Danny and all of this crap anyway

[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:24.740]
so he'll I think your stories are very informative but you should read them like Robin reads the news short and simple

[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:29.520]
give your audience the gist of the story and then discuss it this way you can get through more articles and keep us

[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.540]
interested at the same time this is a merit and don't forget about the average attention span of your listeners

[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:41.120]
let me just say this about that as somebody I know would say first of all I don't read the long long stories

[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:45.840]
that are four five six pages a lot of times I'll say to you I'll read a couple of paragraphs and then say that it's

[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:51.920]
a long story you'll find it on our website go read it read the whole thing number two I can't imagine like

[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:56.180]
Marine does column that I read the other day I can't imagine reading just a little part of that and then just

[00:56:56.180 --> 00:57:01.680]
leaving it hanging there well what's the point like a teaser right in it in addition to let me just say this to

[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:06.420]
you okay I do the show the way I want to do the show this is what makes this show unique there is not another

[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:11.160]
show in this country that's even anything at all like this show it's not another Howard Stern want to be

[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:16.400]
it's not another morning zoo show which are 80 million those shows it's a unique show and I am very happy with

[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.620]
the way I do the show I have no problem with what I enjoy it okay good we could copy a four-match is by

[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:25.340]
taking all the clocks out of the studio and evidently the audience don't seem to be having too much problem because we

[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:29.700]
continue kicking ass and since he starts out by saying the two top gaudiati can't be beat

[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:35.980]
then he says is if that isn't enough to make you just scratch your head that hole in your head he says I think you're the

[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:41.800]
star of the show near every time you play a canned comedy song it takes time away from you is there really need for

[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:47.940]
those terminal comma inducing I think you might mean coma Alex coma inducing some parties after each break again

[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:54.340]
likes to show what he likes about it I have no idea what he wants he wants me to be Robin Quivers well I'm not quite

[00:57:54.340 --> 00:58:01.320]
that I was going to say a little bit more bullshit about you know I'm doing the

[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:05.760]
Roger show not doing the Howard Stern want to be show I'm not doing a Robin Quivers show I'm not doing the

[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.840]
Alex and Coral Gables want to be show by the way something you want to be 12 plus numbers you want me to wait for

[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:16.780]
the men 18 plus I don't know you can wait for right you guys have already yeah I got the 12 plus how do they

[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:21.620]
look on paper I haven't actually looked at them I just got the stack why don't you take a little

[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.880]
look at them I mean either see the problem is every time you fax me something that when I print my

[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:31.120]
stories out I'm going to have to have my printer fix to get new one but every time you fax me something

[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.220]
I get a second blank page remember you used to happen there and when I print something out that

[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:40.800]
doesn't have an only one to get a fax so every page that you fax me is going to call I mean you

[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:47.320]
are can still save the paper but it's just going to be pinning yes the 12 plus overall the main

[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:53.440]
number is down to 10th of a point from a 2 4 to a 2 2 the 12 plus number the 12 plus number

[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:58.440]
well okay well let's see what that might be because we got this show had a gigantic May in the

[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.800]
afternoon I think had a pretty good May 2 now let me just take a peek the audience isn't interested in

[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.780]
all this technical stuff all mornings might be okay because mornings had a big July when a little

[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:11.600]
dog was still on and now we get a little just a little touch of the stern myster on there in the

[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:17.500]
mornings yes we were flat and he was not long enough to have an impact in this particular case

[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.420]
but afternoons are going to be dropping off a pretty damn good May and then we're going to have

[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:26.240]
all June and a July that you wouldn't wish on a till of a hunt but anyway we'll see yeah just

[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.880]
wait till the men the mail numbers coming in the rest of it later on hey mark says a lot of

[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:35.040]
bokeh all of hoke brides bits are great however Colonel Glenn still gives me goosebumps due to

[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:41.780]
content it may be unplayable good job as always yours is mark uh Colonel Glenn yeah it's about

[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:50.840]
uh him going up into space no but a lot of uh heart sounds in here maybe

[00:59:55.580 --> 01:00:01.060]
so we'll take your word for mark and say no one can hear you fart uh and space no one can hear

[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:08.240]
yeah well guess what Joyce can hear it if anybody can hear it it's her okay in space at your place

[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.760]
at the old uh crack house wherever Joyce can hear it or just a dual crack he can sniff it

[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.440]
she's like those cancer sniffing dogs why heard robin got that surround have it here but I heard

[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.940]
that it's because we do hear the very essence of the aster and show but that fast really just

[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:27.040]
amuses me because you can't win on the one hand oh you're just trying to be another Howard's

[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.880]
or you just do the same stuff he is which of course we don't never have or a number two will

[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.400]
gee if you just learn from him I don't want to do a he's show that's why we got he show on the

[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.800]
ear so you can enjoy 85 hours of it every day and we're here to do our little thing afterward okay

[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.000]
we're doing just the fine oh we're fine I'm not making a but I don't just get a life already we

[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:01.000]

[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.740]
bit schmuck pucks man why is it that all the crazy people seem to be in the game

[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:27.840]

[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:39.400]
I took a call for the finally this is a future be right for me now again get snow jobs

[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:46.780]
because I don't got no literacy I'm talking like an old me grow if I like thought they

[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:54.840]
how this way now I can't do nothing but here is it say that's okay change my name to

[01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:04.260]
chute roll drive a douche send the quarter any candlelight I remember when I was

[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.240]
oh well man I'm hanging out I've been developing their bonds

[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.420]
brand the blue ol balance

[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.540]
Lord, He will bar in the song.

[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:51.920]
If Onix makes me sound funny, Got nothing to do with literacy, now I've got to make more money.

[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.960]
They've a fool, sounds good to me.

[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.140]
I've got plenty of nothing.

[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.620]
If Onix ain't getting me anywhere, Maybe I'll mug an old white bitch,

[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.580]
Steal a purse and pull her hair.

[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.720]
Then I'm gonna take some money, by Ariel and the fridge today.

[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.960]
I remember when I was stealing, All the white man's dogs hanging outside,

[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.820]
The building their boss, found the blues, out of the teeth,

[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.420]
But there was got no job for me.

[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:31.820]
And I thought, if I could give my love a change now,

[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.460]
I'll have to go and sell more crack cocaine.

[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.740]
Crack cocaine.

[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:38.780]
Crack cocaine.

[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:42.640]
Crack cocaine.

[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.640]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded,

[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.100]
To dominate people too, with the gas that we sold him

[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:11.000]
First time a crescentation and the only one that's going

[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.380]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil going

[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.180]
Forget about Korea

[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.440]
There's no fair choice in that thus

[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.840]
Right, Queen is drilling it over and over

[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.500]
It's too hard hit

[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.960]
That iraq has some

[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:33.200]
Faces of mass destruction

[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.400]
3000 people killed

[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.020]
I'm now forgotten, let's exploit him instead

[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.460]
Hey, there's oil to be counted

[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.820]
Go and after some time too

[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.860]
Plankato Sama, there's no longer pension out

[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:03.060]
Contained in London, but no one seemed concerned all

[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.420]
From being complacent, believing every word

[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.780]
Of this cartel in administration

[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.720]
That controls my fear through the day

[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.660]
I'm an impulation and the

[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:18.180]
Right, Queen is drilling it over and over

[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.260]
It's too hard hit

[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.020]
That iraq has some

[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.500]
Faces of mass destruction

[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.180]
Oil

[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.700]
I'm dying on the ramps

[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:41.380]
The loss of civil rights is the rights that we're paying

[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.380]
We're all suspects now, not the ash drop in sand

[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.420]
I have nothing to hide

[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.740]
Cable partners all are saved

[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:53.500]
I know media and channel don't ask any reservations

[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.220]
Sounded from Oaxe's panelettes

[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.120]
World of Nile-Layche's

[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.700]
Old regime's must-mall

[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.660]
And hell of virgin and so

[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.000]
With no objection at all

[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.460]
Democracts don't have the ball, and the right

[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.220]
Queen is drilling it over and over

[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.060]
It's too hard, the rain was dead

[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.140]
I rack has some

[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.480]
Wampons of mass destruction

[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.220]
Only I rack has some

[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.660]
Wampons of mass destruction

[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.860]
1150-10-11-6012

[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.660]
Who can run against the mad dog?

[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.140]
I'm returning it for from a hiatus

[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.080]
From a hiatus road in plantation

[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.800]
It's the hopper, Hancock, Brigad 4

[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.440]
Phil 630 when we got the crow

[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.280]
Replay, just for half an hour

[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.300]
I'm sure he can get in all kinds of goofball stuff in a half an hour

[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.100]
Marlon's on deck at 7 and Marlon's at the bridge 735

[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.560]
And then we got Tom Jicca filling in for ready-k tonight

[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.200]
Isn't that appropriate that Hanck comes back today and Tom Jicca's on?

[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.820]
Acted in a Marlon game for ready-k

[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.320]
Don't you see a pearl all there?

[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.160]
No, I forgot to mention

[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.920]
I think that certain powers that be in that place

[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.880]
The ones who are showing up today because they're not putting an apply wood or propending to be

[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.940]
They had to come in and kiss your ass right now

[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.380]
Yeah, you have pulled your pants down to your knees and just bent over

[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.800]
That's how I can see what it feels like

[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.580]
Lips are a foot

[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:17.940]
I felt like a finger

[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.460]
Boy, I'm telling you they're out of kiss your ass

[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:23.380]
We're still number one in men and in the summer even though we dropped off their gigantic

[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.840]
We had a five-six, I extrapolated the month in men

[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.420]
I was like, man, don't cut up five to seven

[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.760]
So I'll take your word for it

[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.940]
What? Don't cut a five-seven, I'll take your word

[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.020]
He's wrong, he's wrong, duh

[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.100]
Anyway, but we'll take that, that sounds good

[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.320]
So we're still number one, just barely edged out

[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.700]
A radio mumbees, so

[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.220]
There's still number two, we dropped a little bit from a six-five and a

[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:47.740]
Keep in mind two things, number one we had a gigantic screen book, we had that big May and number two

[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.280]
This was mostly George in the summer book and it's quite a ball of gray grief and crappy

[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.980]
Gets from certain people in the building, I don't want to mention no names

[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.580]
But the fact that it matters, we were still again for the second year in a row, number one in men

[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.500]
And of course, this isn't before steering really even started, doesn't reflect in here much of anything

[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.540]
You didn't factually the three to seven men

[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.440]
For some bizarre reason, I don't know, back to what I'm getting

[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.600]
I'm bigger pern, I'm faxing what I'm getting

[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.440]
Well, how come they didn't bring you in the three to seven men?

[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.220]
I'm not even reading these things as they bring all my stuff in the machine

[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.580]
Well, somebody's really screwing up big time and I always try to get down

[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:23.580]
I'll try to get back there, huh?

[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.440]
And not only that, but if you didn't look at the 25th, they didn't come out here there

[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.020]
We can't even listen to that, no

[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.900]
Will you listen to me, please? Will you go to launch George?

[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:32.920]
Bye

[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:39.040]
The, um, supposedly, oh yeah, they 25 to 54 persons men and women

[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.940]
Which of course we have no women in our audience

[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:41.740]
That's third men

[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.440]
And it's mostly sports and their station

[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.340]
That will change with sternon, I'm pretty sure

[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.220]
But we had a 4.2 in the last round and this one a 4.1

[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.080]
So we basically were flattened out, which is a very good sign

[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.280]
Okay, indeed

[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.000]
So we had an okay obvious to look like, not bad at all

[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.080]
And then we get the big goose from the sternleister

[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.740]
We certainly hope and expect in when the September thing comes out

[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.580]
And it'll be the last month of the summer book

[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.320]
I'm a small and bonus money again, baby

[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.300]
Can you smell it?

[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:08.220]
I can smell it

[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:08.800]
Man

[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.320]
You, the vendor's parents hangin' out in the sales department, they are

[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.360]
It could be an off day

[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.760]
Yeah, we're sniffin' at the bonus money, baby

[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.020]
So I don't know, I could, I don't even know why have you sent me all of this stuff

[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:20.620]
Because it's all over the center

[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.500]
I don't know what I'm done with Warren

[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.440]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.480]
Now let me just take a look at the afternoon 2554

[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:39.700]
I'm sure Alex and the Gabel, oh the audience doesn't care about those rating numbers, Neal

[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.160]
We don't understand it, it's kind of an inside radio thing

[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.540]
You know, Alex, I'll go get your own show, pay puts

[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.180]
Man, is that just amazing to me?

[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.460]
Yeah, you could learn a lot, yeah, you could learn a lot too, okay, about being a human being, good of life

[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.420]
We don't take instruction on this show

[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.840]
3 to 7 p.m. person's 2554 power

[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.460]
Look at that oil, I'm sure

[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:57.460]

[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:57.460]

[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:01.440]
I bet you can Korean Greg our dancing in the hallway man, cheek to cheek

[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.740]
And I wouldn't be surprised if he won one of the beesleases that are picking a banjo while we're doing that dance

[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.180]
Can you see it?

[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:14.340]
7.1 share, I mean it had been number one all along, person's 25 to 54 and afternoon power 96

[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:18.680]
But now they're not from a 6 to 3 in a spring to a 6-1 in a life, a friend to a 7.1

[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.880]
They are kicking serious smelly ass, power 96

[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.960]
Top 105 is number two as they always art scenes

[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.600]
Love 94, moving up from 9, I have no idea why, can you tell me why?

[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.900]
Not me, I mean the question is

[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.380]
Why?

[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.980]
With anybody listening to that slush that so-called jazz cap on Glowberry Holocons

[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:43.780]
4.9, life is number four

[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.580]
They're drop in life, I guess the carpenter is kind of wearing off

[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.640]
The coast is number five, drop in, drop in, drop in, drop in

[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.160]
XDJ, you know what is that?

[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.680]
There's another no-specating lay station?

[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.080]
I'm sure it is

[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:59.120]
Radio Amlor, another no-specating lay station, they lose me gas station is moving back up again

[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.640]
Lot of Julios in the summer, well they can't afford to go anywhere

[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.340]
And they'd like to go to Cuba but we won't let them

[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.480]
A party radio, well party made a little bounce back, how do you like that?

[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:08.880]
Did you see that?

[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.080]
Party, yeah

[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.820]
They made a little bit of a move back up, maybe parties on a rebound

[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.500]
That's my opinion, I'm like Disney

[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.020]
Yeah, go have a drink, it lost

[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:25.700]
A party radio from 15th is tied for 7th in the afternoon

[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:29.580]
Big continues dropping since during the day

[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.660]
It will continue dropping all along, this is active now

[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.060]
I'm going to be interested to see about the morning if they continue reflecting a kiss

[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.500]
Kiss is a, they're kissing it

[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.260]
That's about it

[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:43.120]
W-I-O-D, look at that in the afternoon from a 3-2 to a 3-3 there about flat

[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.480]
Did I ever get to Q-I-M yet?

[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.660]
Oh there it is, 2-5-2-5 flat

[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.780]
Now that's not bad because they had to drop it off at Easter month and they had a horrible month so they must have been okay

[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.480]
Okay, in August

[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.100]
Okay

[01:11:55.660 --> 01:12:00.360]
And that's without the hump or no less so it's going to be when he rebonds when we get him back on here today

[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.120]
It's when things are looking up baby at 2am right?

[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.660]
What do I tell you, everything's just fine

[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.380]
Oh we're fine

[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.400]
You are listening to Neil Rogers, it's moving

[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.520]
Come and fight for me

[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.120]
So they got it

[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.120]
It's a state gold scene but you can call me Zelda

[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.360]
Whenever I'm in town I listen to, wait a minute I am in town

[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.220]
It's the 12th of 1 hour

[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.640]
So we're number one, do they make it?

[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.840]
Well you know too, we're about to leave

[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.080]
I've got Christie and the dream was fairy care

[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.360]
Or is that a America duty or what?

[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.380]
They can't see, it was not for me

[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.820]
So they held a big piece like it was

[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:46.740]
When I met the info of three

[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.940]
I had no idea what I was about to see

[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:54.280]
Or they were speaking in town

[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.420]
We were talking about the same thing

[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.300]
We were talking about the same thing

[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.580]
This kind of fun

[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.260]
We love to speak out of time

[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:06.580]
We love to speak in time

[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.920]
They got people in there

[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.580]
My tongue is bleeding from side to side

[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.200]
We love to talk to them

[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.580]
We love to talk to them

[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.040]
We love to talk to them

[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.580]
We love to talk to them

[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.900]
We love to talk to them

[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:26.360]
We love to talk to them

[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.200]
We love to talk to them

[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.840]
No, no, it will now embrace me

[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.520]
I thought I'd come to the beach

[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.000]
When I first heard her

[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.540]
I was telling her what ever I do

[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.820]
She'll forgive me

[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.980]
Who knows how I speak in time

[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.040]
But that makes me a believer

[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.060]
And I'm having fun

[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.460]
Staying around with my mouth

[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.200]
But I'm speaking in time

[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.560]
But I'm not going to let her go

[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.900]
But it was all about the first of us

[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.420]
We were talking about the last couple of years

[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.680]
Not so close

[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.080]
She's way, way, way, way, and out

[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.480]
Looks like the bigger rose guy

[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.320]
Smells like the body roll bowl

[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.120]
Copper bush and body bells

[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.560]
And I close the rice mouth out

[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.480]
It happened when she was alive

[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.920]
She raised more frivolous clouds

[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.960]
Copper bush and body bells and eyes

[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.900]
Did she miss me?

[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.880]
Hold and cry for me

[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.560]
Did she miss me?

[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.000]
Did she miss me?

[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.040]
Did she miss me?

[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.560]
Hold and cry for me?

[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.900]
So I think why?

[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.580]
No sense in what no boy

[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:03.140]
Was I keep carrying in a bowl with bowl between her thighs and eyes?

[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.960]
But it's down to nine

[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.980]
She doesn't need just four

[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:14.400]
As if she always cried

[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.600]
She's ready for when she's four

[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.860]
Copper bush and body bells and eyes

[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.200]
Three days before the launch

[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:32.800]
And she's more than a thousand years

[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.380]
Far from launch, she'll be reaching back

[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:40.240]
And she smells like the magic sauce

[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.680]
Not a thing like

[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:45.640]
Copper bush, we never saw this

[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.080]
But not a thing like

[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.680]
Body bells and eyes

[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.020]
Copper bush and body bells and eyes

[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:54.940]
Copper bush and body bells and eyes

[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.000]
I'm looking at these numbers now

[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.480]
What's the station that Lexon Luther and Deterian the J.X.

[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.660]
They're on Zeta

[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.900]
Now, because in the morning and men

[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.080]
Let's see, I'm trying to analyze this QI made a 4.0

[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:08.960]
Which wouldn't bad, although

[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.940]
That's what we took to hit

[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.580]
You want to know why?

[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.240]
What did I tell you?

[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.020]
When you change format, especially with no promotion

[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.100]
These sports people all disappeared

[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.380]
And the stern people were only like, you know, because this only includes maybe just a few days of stern beyond QI am

[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.920]
So they were just discovering it by word of mouth

[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.400]
And how many listeners did we have for stern at that point?

[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.180]
Not too many!

[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.280]
Nobody knew he was on here

[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.780]
So the sports people were vanishing

[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:34.340]
So we only had like a 3.3 share in men in August

[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.500]
I don't care what does tell you

[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.140]
My numbers are right, though, okay?

[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.300]
Trust me when I tell you, it's sweetheart

[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.560]
Why he's a little bit, by this time, the day his brains are fried anyway from all those of bleep season

[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.200]
Doing it in the morning

[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.300]
Now let's see, big one from a 3.4 in the book

[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.220]
To a 4.0, back down to a 3.9

[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.160]
That's Paul and Ron, that's about all they're going to do

[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.900]
And of course, that's before stern even when we didn't had any impact yet

[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.540]
So like I said, we'll be back to about a 2-share in the next one when the book comes out

[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.420]
Old Paul and ancient Ron

[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.480]
Now Zeta, are you sure that's still a call it is?

[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.060]
Oh my god, look at that!

[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:07.500]
Oh my god!

[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.000]

[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.340]
That's the Jacksonville Sudo-Cyco Babel

[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.420]
I've only encountered because they went from a 3.6 in the spring to a 3.0

[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:16.140]

[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.280]
And the last trend made June and July

[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.620]
And then in June July August trend, we just got here

[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.300]
Lex and Luther went to a 2.1

[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:26.600]
From 9th in a couple of months to 9th

[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.280]
With 100 of their sticky Howard David-sized numbers

[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.940]
Now why are you picking on Mo, man?

[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.440]
You're good buddy, just when you finally made up with him, huh?

[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.040]
Always the little bit, when it was Mojo, when it was Mo and Jo

[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.880]
Now why do you say that you never see him again?

[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.260]
I probably will never see him again

[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.540]
Ooh, what a great thing I thought

[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:47.980]
I'm no wonder I'm so good-noo

[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.320]
Man, I just trying to think of one that would be

[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.880]
I like what else was there going to look in here

[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.720]
There was something on, oh yeah, and about that era mirror

[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.420]
That's scary America, man, are they kicking ass?

[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.500]
I looked at their website here at america.com

[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.800]
Yeah, I looked at their website

[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:06.140]
Their rank like, what I said is 487,000

[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:10.920]
There's something, we're ranked number 71,000 in the daily thing here on Alexa

[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.420]
They change it every day

[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:16.120]
And this only one little show in one market

[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.580]
And we still do very well on there because we got a great website

[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.420]
Thanks Eric and Josh

[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:27.220]
But their numbers are, they went from the first money, first money, or they had this huge spike

[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.620]
And it was just from endless interest, and now they're like, no where

[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:34.320]
They don't even make a ripple, maybe drinking it, but they're not doing it

[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.420]
W-I-N-Z, see it goes to Shoei David Ross and PD Volger and Ronald Fink will think

[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.860]
That if you keep changing the call it is often enough and changing the format every two or three weeks

[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.300]
It's a real recipe for success in this business

[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.380]
Yeah, talk about consistency

[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:53.160]
Let's see, 6 to 10 a.m. and many team plus on scared america

[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:58.680]
They went from a point six in the spring, you weigh 0.5 and may June and July to weigh 0.5

[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.120]
At least they're consistent, but they went from time for 26 to time for 28th

[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.100]
I mean, they are a non-factor with the Randy tapes in the morning

[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:05.880]
W-I-N-Z!

[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.480]
And then in midday with the Randy tapes and Al Franken, let's see how they're doing there

[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.700]
I don't think I've even looked yet, so maybe I'm going to stick my foot weight on my throat

[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:19.400]
They went from a 1-5 down to a 1-4 and how long did they been on?

[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.040]
When did the scare america go on in Miami?

[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:22.320]
I don't know

[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.080]
A couple of months ago, right?

[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:24.580]
A couple of months

[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.360]
At least, that's how you exactly went on

[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.760]
So they've been on there for a while and they're making an impact man

[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.840]
I wish that on kind of a Kimler

[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.340]
And George W

[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:34.880]
That's pretty amazing

[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.400]
So we got some numbers there and ours were doing just fine

[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.440]
Anyway, in honor of Kipper

[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.220]
And we could have done a poll on this, which I'm sticking to out of that crap

[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:46.740]
Because that my own opinion is about this

[01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:50.920]
If somebody's paying you to do a job, don't start being a professional, a Catholic, professional Jew

[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.940]
I don't go for that

[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.760]
So Sean Green of the Dodgers, who does this air of the year

[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:58.900]
Yesterday, carved a middle road between his Jewish faith in this weekend's crucial series

[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.360]
The Dodgers and the Giants by announcing he will play the night

[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.380]
Let's sit out tomorrow to observe you on Kipper

[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.980]
Probably somebody ought to tell him

[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:08.040]
Well, see the problem is the game tonight starts at 7.15 p.m.

[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.920]
Oh, okay

[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.980]
Tomorrow's game is at 1.10 p.m.

[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:15.280]
So if he really wanted to be sufficiently Jewish, he'd pass on both

[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.360]
He'd pass over both

[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.080]
He'd pass with the logical question

[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.600]
But he only wants to be a little Jewish

[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.940]
Yes, well, he'd bring in hell probably

[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.740]
I heard he'd say they can cheat for going to be fighting while he's playing that game there

[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.760]
Yeah, in violation of the Kipper

[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.480]
Well, that's just like this, Hurricane looks like it's going to hit Palm Beach County yet

[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.240]
And I'm telling you, it's all Theresa LaCourse called

[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:37.040]
God is so pissed between Theresa LaPore and the people in cemetery village of Odor for practice

[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.300]
And I'm telling you, if you can, the Lord is really after you

[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:40.920]
So we're going to run for cover-man

[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.720]
That's why he keeps attacking Palm Beach County

[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.660]
And especially as a reminder

[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.840]
As a real strong reminder now

[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:49.500]
You know, he keeps trying and trying to get it right in the right spot

[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:52.660]
With the election coming up from just a few weeks

[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.240]
He missed with the first one, Robert Charlie

[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.500]
And then he missed with Francis

[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.260]
And then Ivan was all over the place

[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:02.180]
In fact, he was trying to harm with Ivan, he brought it back again

[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.740]
And he still missed because God occasionally has bad aim

[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.640]
You know? So now he's trying to hold Jean

[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.480]
And he had Jean spinning around there like a draital there in the Atlantic was going around in circles

[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.360]
And now, about a bang right at you again, back at you

[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.900]
So let's see, playing one of the two games is most consistent with my beliefs as a Jewish person

[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.320]
Mr. Green told the AP, Sean Green

[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.660]
As playing in San Diego before saying whatever

[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:28.420]
As to a library, he said, I'm not orthodox, I'm Jewish and respected custom

[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.540]
I feel this is the most consistent way to celebrate the holiday

[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.580]
I feel real good about my decision

[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:35.480]
And now we're the blinces, is what he said, which I thought was most amusing

[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:39.920]
I mean, only, you know, the great thing about being Jewish is the dietary stuff

[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.660]
The rest of it's all crap, like all of religions

[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.020]
It's all a bunch of crap

[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.620]
Oh, but it's young capurits, the most holy of holy days

[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.620]
Yeah, right

[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:50.120]
All of a bunch of crap, man made nonsense

[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:53.320]
Oh, in its tradition, yes, so it's killing people to do this in the name of religion

[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.160]
Which is what's going on over the world today

[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:59.420]
You'll love this story, Fox Hunt student voters

[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.960]
This is great from the nation, no less

[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:05.240]
I'll try to be real brief with this, by the way, I want to get Alice upset there

[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.300]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.740]
Julianna is a caro and Kelly Kraus stuff

[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.460]
They were exercising their civil rights and responsibilities on August 31

[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:16.300]
When his office is the network of feminist student activities

[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:21.760]
If University of Arizona and Tucson, they help set up a photo registration drive on the UA Mall, University of Arizona

[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.900]
Imagine a astonishment when the local Fox affiliate news team showed up and lit into the young women

[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:30.760]
The reporter asked if we knew that we were potentially signing students up to commit felonies

[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.100]
Julianna told me by registering out of state students to vote in Arizona

[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:39.840]
When Kelly then asserted that Arizona law requires only that those registering we resident in state 29 days before the election

[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:43.800]
Natalie Tejada, the Fox reporter, insisted it was illegal to register students

[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:47.420]
On the news that night, student voter registration was the crime du jour

[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:52.520]
Tejada, well many don't realize that legally students from out of state aren't eligible to vote in Arizona

[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.240]
Because they're considered temporary residents

[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.780]
Chris Rhodes, the Pima County Registrar's office

[01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:00.880]
If they're only here to attend school, their intentions to immediately return to where they came from when school is over

[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:04.480]
They're not residents to state Arizona for voting for persons and can't register to vote here

[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.900]
Tejada, those comments representing their residency can face a severe punishment

[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.120]
Rhodes, the former Arizona's in Appaldaven

[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.080]
It's a felony offense if you're lying on that forum

[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.280]
Tejada, so how easy is it to get caught?

[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:21.100]
While starting this past January, all voter applications are cross-checked with the motor vehicles department and social security administration

[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:23.820]
If they find you're falsifying your residency, you could be prosecuted

[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:28.560]
At this time we don't know if anybody's ever been indicted, Rhodes is one of the easiest things you can do is avoid all that

[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:33.040]
Simply go online or pick up the phone, card your home state selection office, ask for an absentee ballot

[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.540]
Anchor, better to be safe on that one, thanks Natalie

[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:39.500]
Miss guided youth are hardened criminals, they report you to side

[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:45.240]
When an urgent email from U.A. Professor Laura Briggs about the Fox broadcast flashed across my screen a few days later

[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:48.360]
I assume that such an egregious example of voter intimidation by proxy

[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:54.840]
When GOP TV standing in for well, the GOP would be all over the media by the time my next column deadline rolled around so I passed on it

[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:58.900]
Still, me, is I write three weeks later almost nothing has appeared outside the local press

[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:04.300]
The silence persisted even after the feminist majority which is spearheaded the students' drivers' front of its get out of her vote campaign

[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.520]
held a press conference to publicize the incident

[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:11.700]
In those three weeks how many stories have you read be moning the apathy of youth in particular the effectiveness of young women

[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:14.580]
Too busy shoe shopping and bar hopping to focus on the election

[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:22.740]
In fact, despite the 1979 Supreme Court ruling affirming their right to vote for the attend school, students often encountered difficulties when they try to exercise their right

[01:24:22.740 --> 01:24:26.560]
The whole story is on our website like I said is fairly long and I don't want to get out of self-sense

[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.760]
Sure, it seems in million Roger's school sessions

[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.680]
How about the same thing?

[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:36.520]
The story is going on

[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:44.580]

[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:51.780]
...

[01:24:55.060 --> 01:25:04.620]
Hey

[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:17.580]
Just go away, we'll all bet up.

[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.220]
Ellie and the Towers.

[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.400]
Why don't you go home?

[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.780]
Ellie and the Towers.

[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.900]
Go home and reach for someone home.

[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:31.740]
Maybe or leave me.

[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.080]
I don't want to go back.

[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.440]
I like shopping for free toys better.

[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.860]
I'm going to go home.

[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.480]
You've got your Pokemon t-shirt.

[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.320]
And you're making us here.

[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.800]
You've had your fun, I'll start packing.

[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.920]
So they can get you out of here.

[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.520]
It's at the point where we can stand in.

[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:05.780]
Everybody's at a job.

[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.780]
You're above all the Julio's and crackers.

[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.120]
The roof would take up if the bar is down.

[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.600]
Hey hey hey hey, the young comes down here.

[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.500]
Why don't you go home?

[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.960]
Ellie and the Towers.

[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.080]
Go home and reach for someone home.

[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:27.520]
Ellie and the Towers.

[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.020]
You have to reach green cards.

[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:29.940]
Can I have one?

[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:46.860]
Oh!

[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:47.780]
Oh!

[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:47.780]

[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:47.940]

[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:48.040]
Oh!

[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:48.040]

[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:48.040]

[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:48.040]

[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:48.040]

[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:49.660]
Oh!

[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:50.240]

[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:50.240]

[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:52.580]
Oh!

[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.940]
Ellie and the Towers are the most adventure you've ever had.

[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:57.580]
The powers you possess.

[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.480]
Since you saved his life,

[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.120]
your life is alive.

[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:05.820]
You've got to stop crying at your door.

[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:15.100]
Where's your brother?

[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.060]
You have a brand new style to.

[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.200]
We love the way you fuck your dudes

[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:28.260]
With the big D-Handler chest and the bruises I just

[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:31.500]
We'll make you known to our own brand

[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.260]
Who's with the seed of the sound?

[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.520]
Take the dice straight to hell

[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.240]
When building starts to blow, we kill the enemies that we know

[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.740]
You're crushing the glory with my hand on

[01:27:59.260 --> 01:27:59.300]
Oh!

[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:02.700]
Oh!

[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:02.700]

[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:02.860]

[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:02.900]

[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:02.900]

[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.640]
Oh!

[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:04.640]

[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:08.360]
Oh!

[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.460]
You have no forget to look for the QM Vant 7

[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.360]
And on a clock tonight at the Hooters in Kindle

[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.960]
Stuff out of when some of our embarrassingly cheap prizes

[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.400]
And enjoy great specials on the present day in Ported Beer

[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.540]
7 o'clock tonight at the Kindle Hooters

[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.600]
And going little George tomorrow and saying

[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.340]
Nice going in the summer, George, you never won

[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.320]
You did a kick ass

[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.060]
Well somebody's got to say it

[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:27.480]
Great hit

[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:28.820]
He did

[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:29.300]
He did

[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.080]
He came in and said nice going George

[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.340]
So he saw me in the house

[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.180]
And said good job

[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.480]
Did he really?

[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:36.160]
He really did

[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.660]
I am, I could just pee my pants right now

[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:41.020]
Because I want to remind you of one thing

[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:41.760]
Break H2

[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.320]
No

[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.200]
I think that this everything is going just fine

[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.120]
I think and of course we got the Stern thing coming

[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.000]
Which is going to send us, it's going to propel us

[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.500]
Now is there a guy on WSJ?

[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.060]
Did you tell me or was Miguel telling me?

[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.040]
Must have been somebody else

[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.800]
No, no, seriously he was telling us about some personality

[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.060]
And it's not in the morning at WSJ

[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:01.840]
Which is why all of a sudden went through the roof

[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:06.720]
Because they went from a 5-5 in the spring to a 6-8 in May June in Julio

[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:09.820]
So in his last train in A3 and number 1 in men in the morning

[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:11.840]
Whoever this guy is, he must be sensational

[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.700]
Or they got a lot of white diaries one or the other

[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.240]
Because the rest of the day they're like small potatoes

[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.840]
So who is that in the morning on WSJ?

[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:19.860]
I don't know

[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.820]
He inquires my smart little

[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.620]
Look at the facts from some Julio out there

[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.980]
Some most breathing raised guy

[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.180]
Anyway here's the poll so far, 422

[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.400]
We left off early on Park and early on Gonzalez

[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.780]
Or said just played the latter

[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.980]
Which will play early on Park later

[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:34.580]
Got it?

[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:35.900]
Early on Park, early on Gonzalez?

[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:37.360]
Okay, got those?

[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:37.880]
See

[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:41.100]
What's your all-time favorite polka-bron comedy bit?

[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.400]
I'm enjoying this, I don't know about you

[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.680]
But he's so good and it's so there's just so many great ones

[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.760]
He's an artist

[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.360]
He's a genius

[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.620]
He's a chicken-necked bald-heat artist

[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.260]
The genius

[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.560]
It's the noise that I got for

[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.340]
President Dumbestment 83, Condoleezza 74

[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:58.000]
Which unfortunately we had to play the censored version

[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.220]
But that's just the way the lay of the land is these days

[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.400]
You can't say too much

[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.540]
I was sitting out of bench in Delray 51

[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:04.960]
Ibanis graduate 36

[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.360]
Weapons have asked a mass destruction, sorry Joyce

[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.340]
Weapons have asked a destruction 35

[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:12.400]
My religion 34, Moe Temple and Gellie Stevens 20

[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.220]
There's so many of those Moe and Gellie bits

[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:15.340]
And I, you know

[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.460]
I guess we got to put some other ones on or two, huh?

[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:20.180]
Which should

[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.280]
Like the Moe and the Ginger reunion

[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.820]
I'm sure we can't play that anymore

[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.680]
I'm partial to poickle veins myself

[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.060]
Oh, we can play that, can we?

[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:29.420]
We can play that, can we?

[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:29.760]
We can play that?

[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.020]
Yeah, we can play that

[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:31.340]
It's the sharpened paper

[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.060]
I don't know what, well he gets raped at the end just cut it off

[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:34.840]
That's so annoying

[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.300]
Who said he can't get raped?

[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:37.680]
Joyce, I don't know

[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.560]
Since when?

[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:39.680]
She didn't tell me that

[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.800]
Okay, well he said he enjoyed it

[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.520]
Moe Temple and Gellie Stevens 20

[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.660]
Marty Feldmanized 20

[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.080]
Bokobrine Blow 16

[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.620]
Which is not the name of the bit by the way

[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.140]
It's just an opinion of a few people out there

[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:53.680]
Who just are sadly lacking

[01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:57.250]
In sense of humor, any kind of human, anything

[01:30:57.250 --> 01:31:01.430]
Bye bye Gellie 10, car baby 9, restitution song 7, rest in peace

[01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:05.070]
Palasi Nazi 6, speaking in tongue 6, focus on 5

[01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:07.050]
We got him for Virgin Mary 2

[01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:09.290]
Only Georgia's votes for secular human is picked

[01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:11.730]
Only one for Cecil's lament, which haven't played yet

[01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:13.750]
See you in the showers one, Nazi party one

[01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:15.710]
And Scrooze again has got the big, oh!

[01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:16.570]
You believe that?

[01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:21.370]
That was a classic before we ever even played it the first time

[01:31:21.370 --> 01:31:21.650]
Great

[01:31:22.670 --> 01:31:24.970]
You have got to be Volshmet and Meeman

[01:31:24.970 --> 01:31:27.790]
That is just some kind of coming this bunch of crap

[01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:29.970]
It's too new, they don't know it by heart yet

[01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:32.090]
I already played it this way, I'm going to have to play it again

[01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.730]
Yeah

[01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:34.090]
What?

[01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:36.070]
No, I really am

[01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:38.690]
Well we're going to just put on a whole pile of stuff here

[01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:41.770]
Underneath the ratings, well you don't want to hear about the ratings, it's a boring stuff

[01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:43.250]
It's only an inside job

[01:31:44.110 --> 01:31:44.490]
Okay

[01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:46.670]
But we're pretty pleased I would say right?

[01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:47.870]
We'll take it, number one

[01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:50.710]
And now that we got the stern thing going man

[01:31:50.710 --> 01:31:53.770]
We are going to end it, we got the Humper back down the camera to our house

[01:31:53.770 --> 01:31:56.350]
We just did a plan with you, okay?

[01:31:56.530 --> 01:31:57.630]
I'll last few months now

[01:31:57.630 --> 01:31:59.050]
We're really going to keep this thing in the gear

[01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:00.730]
And kick some serious stuff

[01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:01.830]
That goes, not only ass right?

[01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:02.570]
Right, you got it

[01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:03.490]
Everything's coming up roses

[01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:06.970]
Speaking of what you were just seeing, except for Joe who's over there on 790

[01:32:08.050 --> 01:32:09.890]
Robert Garmong, Capitol Hill Blue

[01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:10.830]
But that's a good website

[01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:12.350]
And it's not like liberal or conservative

[01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:13.590]
They ripped the hell out of the government

[01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:16.610]
More often know the right than the left because the right's in power right now

[01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:17.250]
In case you have noticed

[01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:19.770]
Government should not control the airwaves

[01:32:19.770 --> 01:32:23.430]
Well, the Super Bowl War draw mouth function is not just a scandal

[01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:26.510]
It's now been ruled a criminal act, the FCC is fined CBS

[01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:28.410]
I have made a dollars for the incident

[01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:30.690]
This is just the beginning of a crackdown

[01:32:30.690 --> 01:32:33.210]
The FCC now calls for the power to regulate cable TV

[01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:34.750]
In addition to broadcast media

[01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:37.350]
Congress is voted to increase by 10 fold the maximum

[01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:41.250]
Finally the FCC may impose from 275 to $275,000

[01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:44.530]
FCC Commissioner Michael Cops is about to be satisfied

[01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:47.930]
Until I see it said one or two pieces for a license revocation

[01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:51.470]
In this headlong rush to expand the government's authority over the media

[01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:55.070]
You know what is paused to consider whether the government should have such authority in a first place?

[01:32:55.350 --> 01:33:00.050]
You know what is noticed that the very existence of the FCC is a flagwin violation of the right to free speech

[01:33:00.890 --> 01:33:03.250]
Throughout history the norm was tyranny over the mind

[01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:05.530]
People were allowed to speak only by government imprimant

[01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:07.870]
To until the Americas first amendment established freedom of speech

[01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:09.650]
Is a central premise of our nation

[01:33:10.670 --> 01:33:13.270]
The first amendment declares the Congress shall make no law

[01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:14.950]
Aburging the freedom of speech or of the press

[01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:17.390]
This language could not be clear or more absolute

[01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:19.790]
No matter who disagrees with the or considers your speech offensive

[01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:22.070]
The government may not abrid your right to say it

[01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:26.290]
Free speech protects the rational mind and its literary intellectual and scientific products

[01:33:26.290 --> 01:33:28.930]
It means the absolute right to express one's views

[01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:31.050]
So long as one does not violate the rights of others

[01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:34.090]
Free speech means no Americans should fear the fate of Galileo

[01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:36.050]
Persecuted for their inner assert scientific truths

[01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:37.990]
That contradict the official church documents

[01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:40.550]
No the fate of Socrates put in it for offending the state

[01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:44.790]
Yet the FCC exists to dictate one can be what can be said on the year

[01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:51.670]
Since the early days of radio every broadcast station has been allowed only to exist if it applies to the FCC for permission to use the airwaves

[01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:55.470]
In exchange for their licenses broadcasts must promise to serve the public interest

[01:33:55.470 --> 01:34:01.330]
Stations that the FCC regards as having failed to do so can be fine or even shut down at the FCC sold expression

[01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:06.810]
The punitive justification for the FCC's regulation of broadcasts is that their ways are public property

[01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:11.730]
But just as the government does not own and so has no legitimate control over the presses of the New York Times

[01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:15.810]
So it has no business regulating what may be broadcast over the airwaves

[01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:20.370]
The airwaves which would be useless without the transmission that works created by radio and TV stations

[01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:22.970]
Along to the individuals and companies that developed them

[01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:27.150]
Broadcasters should not have to plead to authorities for annual licenses any more than a house owner

[01:34:27.150 --> 01:34:28.990]
Should have to get any license to use the property

[01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:32.030]
No other media in America are subjected to such persecution

[01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:36.150]
If the New York Times or Barnes and Noble Publishers content that some of the public disapproves of

[01:34:36.150 --> 01:34:40.090]
The government could not threaten them with fines rather than at least but let Howard Stern offendell is

[01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:42.490]
Nearing clear channels handed with more than a million dollars and fines

[01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:51.810]
So far only indecency has been targeted by the FCC crackdown but politicians on both sides of the aisle have begun whispering demands to censor PBS or the Fox New Channel

[01:34:51.810 --> 01:34:54.590]
On grounds that their alleged biases violate the public interest

[01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:59.030]
Both the liberals with their political correctness and the conservatives with their puritanical religious ethics

[01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:00.890]
claim to speak for the public interest

[01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:06.650]
Can it be long before the two sides begin the battle over which ideas and values Americans are allowed to see and hear expressed on air?

[01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:11.530]
As the FCC wields its club ever more fiercely, broadcasters are running scared

[01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:14.810]
No kidding. Clear channels cancelled a chock-chock programs

[01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:19.610]
Skettish station managers have bleaked out such words as Euroneid, Dam and Orgy from the Rush Limbaugh program

[01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:23.850]
Most ominous, the National Association of Broadcasters can be named some of the responsible program

[01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:26.450]
To define industry-wide standards of self-sensorship

[01:35:27.090 --> 01:35:32.490]
America responded on freedom of speech on the right responsibility of the individual to decide what to say and what to listen to

[01:35:32.490 --> 01:35:36.470]
It in the name of protecting ourselves from being offended and almost without noticing it

[01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:40.410]
We're well on the way to surrendering that crucial right to the control of the omnipotent states

[01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:42.210]
As sure as Lincoln, Neil Rogers

[01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:46.110]
And it's Christmas and the rest of the day AM

[01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:51.550]
It's day-all in Miami Town

[01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:56.110]
You've heard as 5-6-0 WQ-A-S

[01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:58.610]
All right

[01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:05.050]
Hey, stupid

[01:36:05.050 --> 01:36:09.430]
Thank you all for letting out your hot and useless friend

[01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:12.990]
Those in the opal's you've covered as people you're afraid

[01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:15.170]
So do the validity now

[01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:17.790]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:20.270]
Take this and get by the storm in the past

[01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:22.010]
You can't even touch anyone

[01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:27.030]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:31.170]
If you're not very close, it will be Christmas

[01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:35.050]
And what you say, I'll be able to consider a kid

[01:36:35.050 --> 01:36:37.330]
So what the credit is now

[01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:39.730]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:36:39.730 --> 01:36:42.690]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:36:42.690 --> 01:36:44.530]
If you think that's a good thing, we won't

[01:36:44.530 --> 01:36:47.470]
Tell us you can't say that

[01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:51.730]
Get a naked scream

[01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:56.430]
Which let princes ignore the storm

[01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:58.070]
For the FTC

[01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:02.730]
We fight you okay

[01:37:02.730 --> 01:37:04.910]
And take your life as a rainbow

[01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:08.050]
If that's all I know to be your birthday boy

[01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:11.910]
Or I could have my radio to be destroyed

[01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:14.010]
So just look so down

[01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:16.770]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:18.210]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:37:18.210 --> 01:37:18.690]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:37:18.690 --> 01:37:21.130]
You can't even touch anyone

[01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:35.030]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:38.250]
The worst police in all the fashion market

[01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:41.130]
The worst police in all the fashion market

[01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:45.330]
The worst police in all the fashion market

[01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:48.070]
The worst police in all the fashion market

[01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:49.050]
The worst police in all the fashion market

[01:37:49.050 --> 01:37:52.310]
So I think that's one, two, four,

[01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:55.210]
Scientists from all stone research

[01:37:55.210 --> 01:37:56.650]
You've got to watch

[01:37:56.650 --> 01:38:00.870]
One, you say you better or else

[01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:04.270]
You're a bad man, you're a bad man

[01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:07.130]
The worst police are monetization

[01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:09.910]
And they sell the same money

[01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:10.710]
So I'm a bad...

[01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:12.410]
I'm a bad man, I'm a bad man

[01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:19.710]
And I'm a bad man, I am a bad man

[01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:20.670]
And I'm a bad man

[01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:20.670]

[01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:20.670]

[01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:20.670]

[01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:21.990]
You cannot read this

[01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:28.030]
I hear my own units advanced

[01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:29.850]
And you can get tewartamos

[01:38:29.850 --> 01:38:30.490]
Vaccine wing

[01:38:30.490 --> 01:38:34.050]
By the power that's gonna be in our Lord God's words

[01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:36.090]
The federal business is amazing

[01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:38.430]
That's not wrong, that's not the power

[01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:41.430]
The land they want the best I know

[01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:45.070]
The land they want the best I know

[01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:47.830]
The land they want my single right

[01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:50.070]
And the land they want the best

[01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:53.810]
The land they want the best

[01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:54.670]
Oh, I think

[01:38:55.290 --> 01:39:00.470]
The land they want the best

[01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:02.070]
They say they want to say happy you're in Kipper

[01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:04.550]
It's the day of a tommons you want to fast and be

[01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:06.550]
If you're gonna fast you're gonna be unhappy right?

[01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:08.430]
I want to go out and eat daily

[01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:10.090]
But not kosher daily, whether we trade

[01:39:10.090 --> 01:39:10.770]
And I will

[01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:12.930]
Anyway some clearing omissions

[01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:14.850]
I'm scrolling up and down in the DCS here

[01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:16.570]
How about Queer Street?

[01:39:17.210 --> 01:39:17.230]
Oh

[01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:18.870]
Right or so

[01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:19.410]
Play that

[01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:20.970]
How about Ramadan?

[01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:22.550]
Yeah

[01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:23.890]
And how about the

[01:39:23.890 --> 01:39:24.750]
10 USA

[01:39:25.450 --> 01:39:25.950]
Right

[01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.970]
Or the God

[01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:29.010]
USA

[01:39:29.010 --> 01:39:30.370]
How about you look at it?

[01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:31.570]
It God bless US

[01:39:31.570 --> 01:39:32.070]
God bless

[01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.190]
God bless

[01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:35.330]
Let's get those on there right away if not sooner

[01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:38.430]
Jacksonville where a lot of strange things happen

[01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:40.610]
In fact that Hurricane Gene

[01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:42.930]
Looks like it's gonna come on shore like

[01:39:42.930 --> 01:39:44.310]
I don't know somewhere Palm Beach County

[01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:45.210]
Hopefully north of there

[01:39:45.210 --> 01:39:46.590]
I mean where nobody lives hopefully

[01:39:46.590 --> 01:39:47.310]
But that won't happen

[01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:50.210]
And then just zip right up to Jacksonville

[01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:52.490]
And then right along the coast up to the South Carolina

[01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:55.390]
You notice God keeps aiming at certain people

[01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:57.670]
And until he gets and they're gonna keep coming back at you

[01:39:57.670 --> 01:39:58.750]
I didn't I don't want you to nervous

[01:39:59.270 --> 01:40:01.150]
But he's got certain folks in mind

[01:40:01.150 --> 01:40:01.690]
Teresa

[01:40:02.890 --> 01:40:05.330]
Three students at Jacksonville University have been

[01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:07.010]
Punished for installing a stripper pole

[01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:08.270]
In an on-campus apartment

[01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:10.590]
And taking pictures as fully close women

[01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:12.070]
Performed on it at a party

[01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:13.670]
A female male student

[01:40:13.670 --> 01:40:15.590]
And what a dance contest was also disciplined

[01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:17.390]
About a dozen women competed

[01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:19.710]
For a $100 victorious secret gift certificate

[01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:20.650]
September 11th

[01:40:20.650 --> 01:40:21.430]
Say James Foster

[01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:22.810]
Oh on 9-11-11

[01:40:22.810 --> 01:40:23.910]
Less how unpaid periodic

[01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:26.110]
Say James Foster a 20-year-old

[01:40:26.110 --> 01:40:26.970]
Who hosted the party

[01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:28.150]
None of the women disrobed

[01:40:28.150 --> 01:40:29.970]
The men brought the steel

[01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:32.070]
They bought the pole from Home Depot

[01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:33.890]
Volta to the concrete ceiling

[01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:35.690]
An attached to bottom will reply would stage

[01:40:35.690 --> 01:40:36.650]
Covered in red felt

[01:40:36.650 --> 01:40:38.550]
And said hey girls can that be felt

[01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:42.550]
Honestly we just wanted to say we had a stripper pole Foster

[01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:44.730]
We never actually expected girls to dance on it

[01:40:45.710 --> 01:40:48.310]
And you guys out there expect girls to dance on your pole

[01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:49.610]
Well forget about that

[01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:52.610]
In University officials ordered the men to remove the pole

[01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:55.470]
They complied but not before building a huge party around it

[01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:57.230]
Signs meaning pole dancers wanted

[01:40:57.230 --> 01:40:58.270]
Were posted around campus

[01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:00.110]
And the men bought large quantities of beer

[01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:03.390]
Friends were listed to check IDs

[01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:04.750]
And manage security

[01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:07.750]
They charged five bucks for men women were let in for free

[01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:09.330]
Of course

[01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:11.730]
The party ended shortly after the beer ran out

[01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:12.690]
That's a surprise

[01:41:12.690 --> 01:41:13.810]
It's a jade

[01:41:13.810 --> 01:41:15.230]
John day and probably after the beer ran out

[01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:15.850]
The women too

[01:41:15.850 --> 01:41:17.310]
John David Jr.

[01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:18.650]
A school spokesman said

[01:41:18.650 --> 01:41:21.530]
The party's hosts may have violated the university's booze policy

[01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:23.370]
And broker rules against indecent behavior

[01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:26.130]
And the making of unapproved changes to university property

[01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:30.210]
Don't be a drill in your pole in the university floors

[01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:30.710]
Okay

[01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:34.610]
They said in school privacy rules without an ed by the students of the punishment they received

[01:41:34.610 --> 01:41:37.050]
But he said the university took this very seriously

[01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:38.350]
And the punishment was appropriate

[01:41:39.110 --> 01:41:41.950]
Well you can only imagine what they stuck that pole after they found that

[01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:45.530]
Punishment that the university can range from reprimanded

[01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:48.670]
This missile foster city was put on residential probation through November 9

[01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:50.410]
And it had to write a letter of apology

[01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:54.230]
They said he later learned the woman who won the dance contest

[01:41:54.230 --> 01:41:56.610]
Was also disciplined but wouldn't say what her punishment was

[01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:58.210]
There was no public nudity involved here

[01:41:58.210 --> 01:42:01.550]
He said residential advisor. Oh yeah, those pin the ass arrays

[01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:05.610]
Residential advisor Amber Davis said the party degraded women

[01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:08.190]
What an uptight bitch. How about you she knows Joyce

[01:42:09.150 --> 01:42:11.830]
There are other ways they can go out and get a girlfriend if that's what they want

[01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:15.990]
She said the men have taken down the pool convert the states to a ping pong table

[01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:22.510]
So they're back and involved back and forth with the course

[01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:24.250]
In the commenting and endormatory

[01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:26.090]
They do that at treasurer island all the time

[01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:27.810]
Is that what they do? Oh that's right

[01:42:27.810 --> 01:42:29.250]
That's not about Stephanie Evans

[01:42:29.250 --> 01:42:31.690]
What was it Linda Evans or day 11?

[01:42:32.410 --> 01:42:34.190]
Well, they'll use to like to horse ride a little bit

[01:42:34.190 --> 01:42:35.450]

God bless the USA baby

[01:44:42.370 --> 01:44:45.910]
Back in the day when someone done us wrong

[01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:49.110]
We didn't take their cry

[01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:53.210]
If Pearl Harbor or when the judge dropped their bombs

[01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:58.150]
We found them bad and now the Saudis

[01:44:58.150 --> 01:45:02.830]
They did us hide and on our cars are little flags waiting

[01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:09.390]
At that website loving reached our voice of bombers, the wrong way

[01:45:12.810 --> 01:45:14.070]
He

友

[01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:31.510]
To

[01:45:33.670 --> 01:45:41.930]
I don't want to be a tax-emarracant because USA

[01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:53.250]
What's a few thousand innocent lives? Stop living in the past

[01:45:53.830 --> 01:46:00.230]
If you want that SUV to dry, you're gonna need more gas

[01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:06.770]
It's the greatest country in the world, they train us to believe

[01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:14.230]
And anyone who says that obviously ends up for to be

[01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:24.650]
And I'm embarrassed to be an American where we pay three off, I think, least

[01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:31.010]
When the flag in what has with our hand in the sand, it blindly followed the powers that be

[01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:32.230]
And with that thing...

[01:46:32.230 --> 01:46:33.690]
And I thought the first was done!

[01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:37.870]
Washington State's run news on a 65-inch screen

[01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:42.050]
Sretcher B5, everything's okay

[01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:46.150]
In great USA

[01:46:46.150 --> 01:47:02.650]
Of India

[01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:46.130]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[01:47:50.510 --> 01:48:01.450]
oh my god, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm becoming like

[01:48:08.150 --> 01:48:16.110]
the icon of the vacuum cleaner and without all the space, I also change the colour extinction

[01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:39.870]
I broke in through a bedroom window, and I made them to get my wig.

[01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:49.370]
Now what I did after you was crippled, but I didn't know the new,

[01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:51.910]
as you play full the fish.

[01:48:55.190 --> 01:48:58.710]
I guess my girlfriend forgot to tell me,

[01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:05.050]
and the girl that makes one so bad else is wild.

[01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:12.170]
But so little of the wasp you, that killed him.

[01:49:12.190 --> 01:49:20.090]
And I found out, when he changed me with a knife, why didn't that be scary?

[01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:26.150]
I was too dark to see.

[01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:32.810]
She'd be in bed with her husband.

[01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:39.930]
And the skin of his probably will go down.

[01:49:39.930 --> 01:49:51.510]
And a American girl, an American guy who only listens to the message from the Uber,

[01:49:51.810 --> 01:49:57.270]
will have their tables offline, as the troops come home dead.

[01:49:57.750 --> 01:50:03.370]
They find the comfort of the knife hiding under the bed.

[01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:08.610]
I never served in the army, I'm too afraid to fight.

[01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:12.590]
So I sit right here near the DB far from the world,

[01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:17.030]
I, under the trovers you discover, I'm a big fish.

[01:50:17.330 --> 01:50:21.830]
Who would prefer to have some other view the fighting for play?

[01:50:22.410 --> 01:50:26.170]
Now this country I love is occupied in our back,

[01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:30.790]
and all the summers like me, whose necks are dreading the fact,

[01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:34.570]
have our tongues all placed firmly in bushes deep brown,

[01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:39.490]
I, the big mouth towers of the world, you gladly follow, fly.

[01:50:41.130 --> 01:50:45.250]
Hey young girl, shout out there was great, she's in fire and less,

[01:50:45.730 --> 01:50:49.690]
but you can count on me to watch TV and shake my fist,

[01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:54.250]
and my flag will fly from the back of my crotch.

[01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:57.890]
I can't idiotic, she'll know victory, I'll take it,

[01:50:57.890 --> 01:50:58.710]
I'll stop what I said.

[01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:04.030]
And my view of old rock work is what I see on block you.

[01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:12.770]
Yeah I'm an art fair warrior, you know it's better than you.

[01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:35.970]
I'm an hybrid jerk, who parrots anything they say,

[01:51:36.710 --> 01:51:41.290]
don't have the readerist or kids so much easier this way,

[01:51:41.690 --> 01:51:44.130]
if you watch TV or looking pictures,

[01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:51.910]
you wish it today, with my, I need kids to advertise this,

[01:51:52.050 --> 01:51:56.150]
and I jiggle my brain, and I go shout out to afraid,

[01:51:56.150 --> 01:52:02.570]
to battle in lists, but you can count on me to watch TV and shake my fist,

[01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:06.290]
and I go to my flight, so I can pull on my,

[01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:10.610]
as long as I use this, I may show the swathe the good that dude on my,

[01:52:10.650 --> 01:52:14.290]
that's the right, the sawdys are our best friends in the world,

[01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:16.530]
not those I racquet or cheers.

[01:52:18.230 --> 01:52:22.190]
I'm a government rich, yeah I'm an art fair warrior,

[01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:25.430]
you know it's better than you.

[01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:37.390]
Well 53 and 560, but I was quite admittedly there,

[01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:39.790]
but we got to get them all in right now, I have it here as we can.

[01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:42.350]
Armed care warrior, somebody reminded us for that right,

[01:52:42.570 --> 01:52:45.290]
get that on the pole right away, armed care warrior, got it?

[01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:48.010]
Yeah, it is brilliant, they're all brilliant.

[01:52:48.010 --> 01:52:50.910]
Sheriff Raid's home of Jackson personal assistant,

[01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:54.370]
authorities rated the home of Michael Jackson's personal assistant,

[01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:57.110]
September 15, a newly released court document reveals.

[01:52:57.650 --> 01:53:02.210]
The edited document shows that Jackson's defense team filed an emergency application with the court,

[01:53:02.670 --> 01:53:06.830]
seeking to have all the adamacies in the raid by Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Investigators placed under seal.

[01:53:08.670 --> 01:53:11.510]
Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Rodney S. Melville,

[01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:14.050]
no relation to Herman, granted the defense teams request.

[01:53:14.050 --> 01:53:17.450]
There was a second raid by prosecutors that the defenses protested.

[01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:23.170]
The raid indicated that investigators apparently remain active in their hunt for evidence in the Jackson Child Modestation case.

[01:53:24.610 --> 01:53:28.350]
The application to place the seized items under seal was filed with the court September 16,

[01:53:28.710 --> 01:53:31.790]
and was one of the matters heard by Melville during the defense only hearing the next day.

[01:53:31.930 --> 01:53:38.390]
In the document, Jackson defends it for the Robert Sanger described the pop stars' assistance being someone who maintains Mr. Jackson's

[01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:42.510]
personal papers and files, and probably underwears a bunch of other things too, right?

[01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:46.430]
Yeah, and keep it warm in all of these things.

[01:53:47.150 --> 01:53:49.330]
Anyway, that goes on. Let's get that over with.

[01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:51.190]
I'll move on to some more important things, right?

[01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:52.910]
Right, like Scott Lacey Peterson.

[01:53:53.290 --> 01:53:57.150]
There you go, like Nancy Gray said, how many more times do we have to see her this week?

[01:53:57.210 --> 01:54:00.550]
Oh my God, what is Spies Deathbitch? Man, she is just,

[01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:02.530]
how would you like to have to wake up next to that bitch?

[01:54:02.690 --> 01:54:04.410]
Oh, good, thank you. I'd rather have a tea with her.

[01:54:04.410 --> 01:54:08.790]
Man, I think you'd probably rather wake up next to Susan Smith in the car.

[01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:12.830]
Right. Bush rubs off bad poles on a rack outlook.

[01:54:13.050 --> 01:54:16.770]
Well, he's just got a nice outlook unlike you know it.

[01:54:17.890 --> 01:54:23.410]
President Bush yesterday shrubbed off poles that suggest most Iraqi-seam Americans as occupiers and not liberators.

[01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:28.470]
I saw a pole that said the right track wrong track in Iraq was better than here in America told reporters.

[01:54:28.770 --> 01:54:32.230]
It was pretty darn strong. Bush told a Rose Garden news conference within a room

[01:54:32.230 --> 01:54:36.270]
in a Iraqi-pronistor Iod al-Awa. I mean the people see a better future.

[01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:38.550]
You know, there's other ways to future.

[01:54:38.970 --> 01:54:39.650]
Push her nation.

[01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.610]
I see.

[01:54:41.370 --> 01:54:44.190]
The campaign of Bush's Democratic-raveled John Kerry was quick to respond.

[01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:46.630]
He said when he was saying did Bush really just say this?

[01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:50.750]
Kerry campaigned spokesman Joe Lockhart said Bush must be unhinged from reality.

[01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:56.850]
This sudden poles are gistening that there are more Iraqis who feel their countries on the right track than there are Americans who feel the same about the US.

[01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:59.630]
Bush didn't indicate what survey he was referring to,

[01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:08.430]
but White House aides headed to pole in Iraq conducted in late August that indicated that some 51% of Iraqis were surveyed felt their country was headed in the right direction up slightly from May and June.

[01:55:09.150 --> 01:55:13.150]
Bush had been asked earlier about poles, including one taken by coalition provisional authority.

[01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:16.730]
The US organized panel at oversaw the Iraqi government before last June's transfer of authority.

[01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:20.610]
That showed a majority of Iraqis were unhappy with US policy and one of the Americans to leave.

[01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:25.570]
Iraqi opinions have changed since the turnover because now they have got a Iraqi leadership.

[01:55:25.570 --> 01:55:29.610]
Prime Minister Allawi and his cabinet are making decisions on behalf of the Iraqi people Bush said.

[01:55:29.890 --> 01:55:31.590]
I guess he's talking about the ones who are still alive.

[01:55:32.190 --> 01:55:44.290]
Talk to the leader we said I'm not the expert on how the Iraqi people think because I live in America where it's nice and safe and secure, but I talk to this man Bush said there are lots of poles sometimes they show you up and sometimes they show you down as you might remember Bush said with a smile.

[01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:47.170]
Would they smirk or they'd a chimp like smirk.

[01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:58.130]
For the USA and new AP if so if pole showed 45% of those surveyed believe the country was on the right track 52% said this country is on the wrong track not Iraq this country on the wrong track.

[01:55:58.450 --> 01:56:06.190]
To loose like tracks those figures had been worse during the summer but after the UP convention everybody said oh yeah we're fine.

[01:56:06.190 --> 01:56:07.790]
I'm lately they're changing their mind again.

[01:56:08.150 --> 01:56:21.810]
Lockhart the carry spokesman derided Bush's comment he just basically said a country that's dissolving into potential civil war or terrorists that take it over large sex in the country where Americans can no longer secure for major cities that the people over there think better of their country than people here in the USA.

[01:56:22.330 --> 01:56:25.270]
Lockhart said that's what I call unhinged from reality.

[01:56:25.730 --> 01:56:27.910]
You will see some of you are not your business.

[01:56:28.330 --> 01:56:29.810]
Rest of the world is on fire 60.

[01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:31.470]
In the air.

[01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:35.230]
Stab on to two hour.

[01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:36.870]
Hi very.

[01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:37.850]
Hey.

[01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:45.370]
Oh, door, door, door.

[01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:48.470]
Oh, door, door.

[01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:50.590]
Oh, door, door.

[01:56:50.590 --> 01:56:51.250]
Oh, door, door.

[01:56:52.630 --> 01:56:54.690]
I don't know how it's going to be.

[01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:56.310]
It's expected and attention.

[01:56:56.810 --> 01:57:01.670]
All of my own people who will be responsible for a terrible white baby.

[01:57:02.190 --> 01:57:03.870]
All of my people is waiting.

[01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:06.630]
It won't be cause I thank you for what you've read.

[01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:08.030]
It's worth all of my money.

[01:57:08.710 --> 01:57:11.250]
On my arm like a random alley map of luck or what.

[01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:15.170]
I got things on my nose and nobody knows that under my nose I rip empty holes.

[01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:16.950]
But that no means that I'm gay.

[01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:19.010]
If you think my arms are bad you ought to see my legs.

[01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:23.070]
I might as well keep on smoothing shade and show a little blast in next time I'm raking in.

[01:57:23.230 --> 01:57:25.470]
I could go to a surgeon but that gives me the shivers.

[01:57:25.690 --> 01:57:27.590]
I would not want the walk I'm looking like Jones Rivers.

[01:57:28.570 --> 01:57:29.370]
Where am I?

[01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:34.410]
I might have the beats to pack little pre-identum of faith now again aboard the beach.

[01:57:34.530 --> 01:57:39.990]
The reason I dismissed that sleep and fat bastard because he wouldn't shut up and he can't play connoisseur.

[01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:42.190]
There's somebody going over there.

[01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:43.270]
Nobody talks when I rap.

[01:57:43.570 --> 01:57:44.510]
I rap and you talk.

[01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:45.830]
Look at me.

[01:57:46.090 --> 01:57:47.710]
I'm a big step higher than those square.

[01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:49.690]
I'm a big dumb daddy man.

[01:57:49.930 --> 01:57:50.690]
I'm really dead.

[01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:53.610]
I'm fire-ending what I want.

[01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:54.490]
I don't dare.

[01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:56.690]
But believe they make me flip my wig later.

[01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:57.530]
Smelly green hair.

[01:57:57.970 --> 01:58:00.610]
I get fired myself and even happens to the greens.

[01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:03.490]
Westwood once said you'll get out of here whilst we break your legs.

[01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:06.470]
So now I sit by the pool of life since good is in Kansas.

[01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:09.730]
With my paladin cocktail placing bets on the jeans.

[01:58:10.150 --> 01:58:10.550]
Paradise.

[01:58:11.170 --> 01:58:11.510]
Paradise.

[01:58:11.850 --> 01:58:13.370]
And I'm just company's ass in paradise.

[01:58:14.110 --> 01:58:14.750]
Go go go go.

[01:58:15.070 --> 01:58:17.210]
I'll be sure but not the screw gets the one I get the jeans.

[01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:19.330]
But the cleaners aren't ready with my line green pants.

[01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:20.330]
How long does it take?

[01:58:20.530 --> 01:58:21.350]
Kill the quad complete.

[01:58:21.670 --> 01:58:22.650]
It was just a little thought.

[01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:23.690]
So what I left this day.

[01:58:24.010 --> 01:58:26.130]
I think that's funny when I left the sandwich buddy.

[01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:27.230]
I can do what I want.

[01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:28.410]
But the man is with loves me.

[01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:30.590]
It is not a small something odd and odd.

[01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:32.850]
But the longest time I wanted you to be my dog.

[01:58:33.190 --> 01:58:33.830]
You are my title.

[01:58:34.150 --> 01:58:34.690]
Now answer it.

[01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:35.950]
How about you?

[01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.710]
What do you do?

[01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:38.170]
I'll take no for an answer to that.

[01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:39.690]
But it's not you.

[01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:40.670]
Get out of here.

[01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:41.590]
And I'll take change.

[01:58:42.090 --> 01:58:42.950]
Go go go go go.

[01:58:43.170 --> 01:58:43.870]
Get out.

[01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:44.450]
Go go go go.

[01:58:44.730 --> 01:58:45.730]
Go go go go go.

[01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.690]
Get out.

[01:58:46.690 --> 01:58:47.610]
Go go go go go.

[01:58:47.610 --> 01:58:48.730]
Go go go go go.

[01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:50.290]
Go go go go go.

[01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:51.770]
Go go go go go go.

[01:58:54.330 --> 01:58:54.770]
Alright.

[01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:00.450]
Everybody is everybody.

[01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:02.710]
Everybody is all the time.

[01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:08.230]
That's the way of life is always better.

[01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:09.650]
That's the way of life is always better.

[01:59:09.650 --> 01:59:13.650]
That's the only thing I would change in an answer.

[01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:16.730]
In my school.

[01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.470]

And that's free to walk in from top of no team

[02:00:28.670 --> 02:00:32.730]
105 at 562 W. That's got to be on there everybody hates everybody

[02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:39.310]
Yeah, and a whole bunch of mobs not just pointful veins are you writing these down?

[02:00:39.630 --> 02:00:42.530]
Josh, go ahead pointful veins. That's P-O-I-P-O

[02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:44.610]
Yeah, I'm gonna get this funny right? It's on here?

[02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:45.670]
Just now, that's right.

[02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:46.990]
Opian Anthony

[02:00:50.090 --> 02:00:51.330]
Got it? Yeah.

[02:00:51.850 --> 02:00:52.870]
Howard gets raped.

[02:00:54.810 --> 02:00:57.270]
A lot of these we can't play no more, which is unfortunate.

[02:00:58.410 --> 02:00:59.010]
Mo and Joe?

[02:01:00.690 --> 02:01:03.270]
How's Joe doing? Joe, what is on what is it? SM?

[02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:05.650]
Yes, that's whatever. One of those.

[02:01:06.570 --> 02:01:07.690]
Got Mo and Joe? Yeah.

[02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:09.330]
Watch your back, Zach.

[02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:13.710]
Can we still play that? I think we might be able to still play that.

[02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:16.850]
Or not. I think so.

[02:01:18.010 --> 02:01:19.250]
Well, let's give it a shot.

[02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:21.270]
Let's see that. Let's uh...

[02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:22.910]
Do you see all ratings for the last book?

[02:01:23.290 --> 02:01:24.970]
Yeah, I know it's from Toddie.

[02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:27.470]
Yeah, it's possible to be us.

[02:01:28.170 --> 02:01:29.090]
Watch your back.

[02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:42.430]
And don't forget the Aginger and Moguea Union, which we won't be playing, but got it?

[02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:43.450]
Ginger and Moguea Union?

[02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:46.350]
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got to think about it. I got it.

[02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:48.450]
Stop like getting raped. And then I told you that I'm not raped.

[02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:52.290]
So, yeah, I want to do it. I'm going to have to understand.

[02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:54.830]
I got to wake a little hotter on the gas tube.

[02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:55.210]
Oh, my god.

[02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:56.990]
The roasted guts that go.

[02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:59.290]
And a lot of Pepsi producers.

[02:01:59.830 --> 02:02:01.350]
Thanks Nicholas Zach!

[02:02:02.050 --> 02:02:04.150]
And you won't wait for low no, no.

[02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:05.570]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:02:08.050 --> 02:02:12.110]
Mike, come on, come on!

[02:02:12.210 --> 02:02:12.950]
Well bread, hold up.

[02:02:13.110 --> 02:02:15.230]
Kasut Rabda, I don't understand.

[02:02:15.230 --> 02:02:19.110]
And you can eat from a drop while you're in theке.

[02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:21.170]
Matt Dad made his schedule.

[02:02:21.170 --> 02:02:22.130]
You've got spine quicker than it's all you wish.

[02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:45.870]
And a straightly up badass house

[02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.870]

[02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.870]

[02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.870]

[02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.870]

[02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:46.430]
And a straightly up badass house

[02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.430]

[02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.430]

[02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:48.190]
And a straightly up badass house

[02:02:48.190 --> 02:02:48.930]
And a straightly up badass house

[02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:48.930]

[02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:48.930]

[02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:48.930]

[02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:51.710]
And a straightly up badass house

[02:02:52.670 --> 02:02:55.790]
And a straightly up badass house

[02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:56.010]
And a straightly up badass house

[02:02:56.010 --> 02:02:58.810]
And we actually found another bit we can still play that is amazing

[02:03:00.010 --> 02:03:01.330]
Wow, go right to the end

[02:03:01.330 --> 02:03:04.650]
Yeah, the only place. Put that on the list of how many can we still play it?

[02:03:04.650 --> 02:03:04.910]
Fobby!

[02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:11.990]
Oh, anyways, speaking of the great things that are happening in Iraq which is making the Iraqi people so grateful and very happy

[02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:18.050]
A violent, a virulent form of hepatitis that is especially lethal for pregnant women is broken out

[02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:22.430]
And two of our most troubled districts, Iraqi health ministry officials send interviews here this week

[02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:27.490]
And they warn that a collapse of water in sewage systems in the country is probably at the root of the illnesses

[02:03:27.970 --> 02:03:36.810]
The disease called hepatitis E, not to be confused with hepatitis A, is caused by a virus that is often spread by sewage contaminated drinking water

[02:03:36.810 --> 02:03:41.770]
The official said that their limited ability to test for the virus had already been overwhelmed by the hepatitis outbreak

[02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:45.230]
suggesting that only a fraction of the actual cases have been diagnosed

[02:03:45.230 --> 02:03:49.890]
But in Saudi city of Baghdad, slum that for months has been convulsed by gun battles between local

[02:03:49.890 --> 02:03:51.370]
And militia and American troops

[02:03:51.370 --> 02:03:54.470]
As many as 155 cases have turned up already

[02:03:55.670 --> 02:03:59.730]
And yet another endocasterly deteriorating safety of both water and food in Iraq

[02:03:59.730 --> 02:04:03.350]
The number of reported cases of typhoid fever is up sharply this year

[02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:07.970]
So Dr. Nima S. Abbey, the ministry's director general public health and primary health

[02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:11.930]
The hospitals across the country are also a full of children with severe forms of

[02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:13.950]
Do I dare say it or will Joyce get upset?

[02:04:14.530 --> 02:04:14.970]
Diarrhea!

[02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:17.810]
How do you like that?

[02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:20.790]
Everything's fine in Iraq, why do you keep lying?

[02:04:21.390 --> 02:04:26.910]
The immediate reason for the outbreak in Saudi city and the other city, mom Houddia, appears to be easy to pin down

[02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:31.550]
He said the lack of infrastructure induces families to tap into water means with improvised hoses

[02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:36.530]
He said, citing his own visits to the communities, they then use small electric pumps to bring water to their homes

[02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:41.050]
But in the same communities, sewage either seats from damaged pipes into the ground or runs free in the streets

[02:04:41.050 --> 02:04:47.870]
So through cracks and holes in people's hoses, sewage is sucked in too, becoming mixed with the drinking water and spreading the virus

[02:04:47.870 --> 02:04:53.310]
Sounds very sanitary to me, don't it? Sounds like a lovely place and I'm glad that the people are so proud and pleased

[02:04:54.130 --> 02:04:55.210]
Right? Right

[02:04:55.210 --> 02:04:59.150]
Good ones who are hearing about it on their radio and TV, the ones who still have electric, how many of those are there?

[02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:00.070]
About 30, man!

[02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:03.530]
Maybe we ought to take few calls here because we might be missing out some names for this poll

[02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:05.930]
This is a very strategic poll I would think

[02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:07.550]
Wouldn't you think?

[02:05:08.170 --> 02:05:08.710]
I don't think

[02:05:08.710 --> 02:05:09.710]
I like it

[02:05:11.250 --> 02:05:15.290]
5670560, pound 560 on the Verizon and singular wireless lines

[02:05:16.230 --> 02:05:16.950]
WDQA and hello

[02:05:18.210 --> 02:05:21.630]
Hi, so give me somebody already mentioned this, but how about prison bits?

[02:05:22.630 --> 02:05:23.850]
Not there, that's not a book of Brian

[02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:25.350]
Oh, it's not, I'm sorry

[02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:27.450]
Bob and Tom, sorry, thanks

[02:05:27.450 --> 02:05:29.030]
Okay, see you, Bob, I see you

[02:05:29.650 --> 02:05:33.250]
Prison bits, now let me, did we decide we can't play that anymore? I guess we can't

[02:05:33.250 --> 02:05:35.010]
I guess we can't

[02:05:35.010 --> 02:05:39.170]
Based on more to think, I mean it's four minutes, we've got to be something in there

[02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:40.450]
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[02:05:40.450 --> 02:05:42.310]
All right, well I'll wait a second

[02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:44.630]
They say I love this taboo

[02:05:44.630 --> 02:05:44.990]
Yeah

[02:05:46.710 --> 02:05:47.110]
What?

[02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:48.030]
He said boo

[02:05:48.710 --> 02:05:49.110]
Oh

[02:05:51.970 --> 02:05:53.030]
I'm sorry to get you

[02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:55.170]
They say I love this taboo

[02:05:55.170 --> 02:05:59.090]
He said what we're doing is wrong

[02:06:00.610 --> 02:06:03.030]
But I don't care what they say

[02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:06.770]
It's because my love is so strong

[02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:08.950]
Yeah, I'll listen to it over the weekend and decide

[02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:12.530]
I think it'll take that long to listen

[02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:15.070]
I don't think there's anything wrong with the old prison bits

[02:06:15.070 --> 02:06:15.330]
You?

[02:06:15.570 --> 02:06:16.530]
No, maybe

[02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:18.890]
No, nothing good

[02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:19.910]
There's a damn poll here

[02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:21.190]
Oh, Joyce is gonna be

[02:06:21.190 --> 02:06:25.930]
She's probably half-reventilating right now, don't you dare let them play that, that's the most disgusting idea

[02:06:26.690 --> 02:06:29.070]
Now that's what the Martha Stewart's probably thinking too

[02:06:29.650 --> 02:06:36.290]
Don't forget that QMVM at 7 and 9 tonight and then Hooters and Kendall stuff out of win prizes and enjoy great specials on President the imported beer

[02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:45.390]
Seven o'clock tonight at the Hooters' Kendall and join Little George tomorrow noon to two at Bill Siddler's Mitsubishi and Davy stuff out of win prizes and enjoy a few food from the 90 City subs

[02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:49.310]
And just a lot quick-called him Little George, he's bringing 90 Bell tomorrow to show what a big guy he is

[02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:55.410]
And the water Nazi to a reference right let me QA and Hooters and Neil yes sir

[02:06:55.410 --> 02:06:59.650]
I just have a question for you by man regarding your guidelines everything else

[02:06:59.650 --> 02:07:03.710]
More in terms of how you used to play some bit called a crevitation contest

[02:07:03.710 --> 02:07:05.670]
Right off, forget about that

[02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:08.450]
Wasn't it moving back in the 30s?

[02:07:08.590 --> 02:07:09.670]
Yes it was 1938

[02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:16.930]
Okay, now would that with that by the way the guidelines of the country are set and that's been played for what?

[02:07:16.930 --> 02:07:18.150]
60 years?

[02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:19.090]
You got it man

[02:07:20.810 --> 02:07:21.950]
That's real frightening

[02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:24.050]
Taking us back into the Stone Age

[02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.910]
Unbelievable, unbelievable

[02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:28.430]
Great day of life, hope to hear the Havillator

[02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:29.330]
Have a great day

[02:07:29.330 --> 02:07:31.890]
Now you too, don't forget each trade tomorrow whatever you do

[02:07:32.490 --> 02:07:34.170]
You're the king and Neil Roger

[02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:36.450]
Let's go to the last station

[02:07:37.530 --> 02:07:37.970]
QAM

[02:07:47.330 --> 02:07:50.890]
He lives on queer street

[02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:54.710]
Linkers round on queer street

[02:07:54.710 --> 02:07:58.550]
He has a house and garden

[02:07:58.550 --> 02:08:02.930]
I would love to see what happens

[02:08:09.650 --> 02:08:13.670]
Ain't this old and dead is monkey

[02:08:13.670 --> 02:08:17.390]
When in clothes they can look real funky

[02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:24.410]
He has a whiz whiz and knows what to do

[02:08:25.670 --> 02:08:31.490]
He wants to see me

[02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:33.610]
But you

[02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:40.410]
He lives on queer street

[02:08:40.410 --> 02:08:44.290]
Here at the floor we're all the creatures seen

[02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:48.690]
I wonder what they're doing there

[02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:51.730]
He said he likes a job spot

[02:08:54.450 --> 02:08:58.490]
You know you know what I know you

[02:08:59.550 --> 02:09:00.210]
QAM

[02:09:00.210 --> 02:09:01.250]
QAM

[02:09:07.170 --> 02:09:10.370]
He lives on queer street

[02:09:10.370 --> 02:09:13.970]
Linkers round on queer street

[02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:17.090]
He has a house and a house

[02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:21.510]
A ride

[02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:23.830]
Come on over there

[02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:25.390]
Don't look here man

[02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:26.770]
We gonna play a game

[02:09:26.770 --> 02:09:29.790]
She wants to be the living kids that ride

[02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:32.670]
And he finally can be the lead

[02:09:32.670 --> 02:09:35.590]
They take a bunch of two of them

[02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:38.530]
And it was the skills to make it right

[02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:39.870]
They got a bunch of you

[02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:41.270]
She got without the tickets

[02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:43.730]
But you know that you have this kind of job

[02:09:43.730 --> 02:09:44.810]
You know that

[02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:47.010]
She's a she's a pussy

[02:09:47.010 --> 02:09:48.450]
And the man is a pussy

[02:09:48.450 --> 02:09:48.810]
And the man is a pizza

[02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:54.490]
Let's see you hold it

[02:09:54.490 --> 02:09:55.330]
You can hold it

[02:09:55.330 --> 02:09:57.170]
And the man is a pussy

[02:09:57.170 --> 02:09:58.090]
And the guy is gonna fight

[02:09:59.170 --> 02:09:59.550]
Whoеспath

[02:09:59.550 --> 02:10:01.070]
She is a V1

[02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:04.310]
You gonna make a red

[02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:05.410]
And the guy will pamper

[02:10:05.410 --> 02:10:07.610]
And the guy will played

[02:10:07.610 --> 02:10:08.590]
Abb them

[02:10:08.590 --> 02:10:11.210]
Will they be slaves

[02:10:11.210 --> 02:10:11.210]

[02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:21.110]
That's what I do

[02:10:21.110 --> 02:10:21.170]
Cuz they're so hairy

[02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:24.850]
I think about this

[02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:26.290]
We've never been

[02:10:26.290 --> 02:10:29.050]
I try a real good book.

[02:10:29.130 --> 02:10:31.510]
I'm not a professional, I'm a professional.

[02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:33.270]
I can see it by the book.

[02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:34.610]
Book.

[02:10:36.850 --> 02:10:39.590]
Baby, I'm on a stage.

[02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:45.170]
Baby, I'm on a stage.

[02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:46.590]
Baby, I'm on a stage.

[02:10:53.650 --> 02:10:55.610]
Funny everyone is 560 every day.

[02:10:55.730 --> 02:10:57.730]
Gregory and Kross brings us, I don't know if you've noticed,

[02:10:57.970 --> 02:11:00.570]
but Brian North Cross's cone is different than the weather channel's cone.

[02:11:00.970 --> 02:11:02.810]
I don't know if I've ever seen Brian Cross's cone,

[02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:04.810]
nor do I really care to, to be honest with it.

[02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:07.310]
It says Brian's cone droops lower.

[02:11:08.090 --> 02:11:10.410]
To cover all of South Florida, while the weather channel's cone

[02:11:10.410 --> 02:11:13.770]
sweeps in a more northerly direction covering less of South Florida,

[02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:15.950]
can both cones be correct?

[02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:17.090]
Obviously not.

[02:11:17.770 --> 02:11:20.390]
But the weather theory is both Miss North Cross and Miss Kamala,

[02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:23.290]
their cone always seems to be drooping in a downward direction.

[02:11:24.070 --> 02:11:26.690]
It says, we'll history call this the Yom Kippur Hurricane.

[02:11:26.890 --> 02:11:27.690]
That's a big question.

[02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:29.170]
Maybe guys pissed off about that too,

[02:11:29.230 --> 02:11:31.870]
that some of the people are eating bacon cheeseburgers on Yom Kippur.

[02:11:32.550 --> 02:11:34.710]
And also, Gregory says, in any case, happy New Year.

[02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:36.370]
I guess, Greg didn't hear what I said.

[02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.670]
Nice week.

[02:11:37.670 --> 02:11:38.770]
I thought I'd hold business.

[02:11:39.190 --> 02:11:41.610]
I thought of, talk to me again on January 1st,

[02:11:41.650 --> 02:11:42.890]
okay, that's when I celebrate New Year.

[02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:44.930]
I'm a dietary jewel.

[02:11:45.090 --> 02:11:46.430]
If you give me some good cheese listed on,

[02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:47.690]
we're gonna get a little pork dock.

[02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:48.390]
Can I say pork?

[02:11:48.570 --> 02:11:48.730]
No.

[02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:49.050]
Sorry.

[02:11:49.690 --> 02:11:50.490]
I don't like pork dock.

[02:11:50.710 --> 02:11:52.070]
I've had many good pork types in a long time.

[02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:54.310]
How about, let's bring Yom Kippur all over to, um,

[02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:55.550]
Poio Tropical.

[02:11:56.210 --> 02:11:57.390]
You get a good pork sandwich.

[02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:57.910]
What do you say?

[02:11:58.170 --> 02:11:58.370]
All right.

[02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:59.690]
Don't get porky about it.

[02:12:00.170 --> 02:12:01.230]
All the way, don't have to go that far.

[02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:03.110]
I think maybe anything trait would be good.

[02:12:04.290 --> 02:12:04.790]
Mm, right.

[02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:06.750]
Bacon, she, a bacon mushroom cheeseburger.

[02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:08.290]
Oh, God, that's not good.

[02:12:08.450 --> 02:12:08.930]
From hearty.

[02:12:09.250 --> 02:12:11.450]
Well, what I started to say is I'm getting a little pork dock

[02:12:11.450 --> 02:12:12.990]
about the fact that screw is again.

[02:12:13.190 --> 02:12:14.610]
I don't care what anybody says.

[02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.950]
It has no votes.

[02:12:16.210 --> 02:12:17.650]
I don't think they know what it is yet.

[02:12:17.670 --> 02:12:18.130]
They don't.

[02:12:18.250 --> 02:12:20.030]
We go automatically.

[02:12:20.890 --> 02:12:23.090]
As you may be, I look to you.

[02:12:23.130 --> 02:12:24.450]
It's like a G-O-P.

[02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:28.610]
Then if you've had this time, don't step down.

[02:12:29.050 --> 02:12:32.210]
That keeps me up on screw with the game.

[02:12:34.110 --> 02:12:38.650]
The brother, the brother, that brought the caravan

[02:12:38.650 --> 02:12:43.810]
to the house, got another plan to get through both of this time

[02:12:43.810 --> 02:12:44.870]
of it, though.

[02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:46.870]
That's just the approach.

[02:12:47.230 --> 02:12:49.330]
Who would sit in the home?

[02:12:49.790 --> 02:12:53.950]
From this relationship, this relationship, this relationship,

[02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:57.090]
this relationship, this relationship, this relationship,

[02:12:57.090 --> 02:12:58.550]
this relationship, this relationship, this relationship,

[02:12:58.550 --> 02:13:01.170]
this relationship, this relationship, this relationship,

[02:13:01.610 --> 02:13:02.190]
this relationship, this relationship, this relationship,

[02:13:02.190 --> 02:13:06.390]
this relationship, this relationship, the white people

[02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.970]
next.

[02:13:09.190 --> 02:13:12.730]
Those children who got pushed win the blue

[02:13:14.190 --> 02:13:19.210]
and called their spouses pioneered with armed

[02:13:19.210 --> 02:13:25.830]
defeated war,어요 estabildoor.

[02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:26.970]
The tension is thrilled.

[02:13:26.970 --> 02:13:28.730]
You, I, someone abruptly rides out,

[02:13:51.970 --> 02:13:58.610]
The Jew was the hero, the cry was she's a poor little boy

[02:14:02.170 --> 02:14:07.630]
The Jew was the hero, the cry was she's a poor little boy

[02:14:07.630 --> 02:14:10.770]
The Jew was the hero, the cry was she's a poor little boy

[02:14:10.770 --> 02:14:13.610]
I don't want to get that too old, she got a pair of fingers don't know what it is

[02:14:13.610 --> 02:14:15.590]
I can't see her in the showers, I'll play like a boy

[02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:17.650]
It has yet to be a classic

[02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:20.650]
Now I'll give you one that we'll put on the pool, that we cannot play

[02:14:20.650 --> 02:14:22.590]
I can play like a little bit

[02:14:23.610 --> 02:14:25.010]
Yeah there you go, that's it

[02:14:26.210 --> 02:14:27.570]
Yes he is, yeah

[02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:30.870]
He used to be, now he's just kind of more whipped out

[02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:32.410]
We can't play that no more

[02:14:34.210 --> 02:14:36.510]
Maybe you want to explain the Josh, just as Zach moment

[02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:39.210]
He's got it right on the website, okay, it's got him in the same day

[02:14:40.270 --> 02:14:41.630]
Mother, yes he is

[02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:43.770]
That's it, that's as far as I'm going with that

[02:14:43.770 --> 02:14:45.910]
For the next five minutes we can still say it on the website

[02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:49.350]
Hey right, until they get to that too, don't forget

[02:14:50.210 --> 02:14:55.230]
The award police, the Nazis in chief, which includes Republicans and Democrats

[02:14:55.230 --> 02:15:00.290]
URCC, three Republicans, two Democrats, and the Democrats are just as rapid if not more so

[02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:04.650]
Then Adelstein guy and Michael Cops, they need very serious help, the word cops

[02:15:05.650 --> 02:15:10.590]
But they want the cable, they want the internet nice, they want to be able to censor every single word that you hear

[02:15:10.590 --> 02:15:14.150]
And everything you see, everything you smell, every fart you cut, everything you do

[02:15:14.150 --> 02:15:15.150]
They want a censor

[02:15:15.610 --> 02:15:21.250]
And if the fart happens to be, it's smell a little bit off the wrong flavor like a nasty raspberry egg fart

[02:15:23.150 --> 02:15:24.650]
Then you get reported to Joyce

[02:15:26.810 --> 02:15:32.250]
And then, then you'll see what really fear is all about, I bet she enjoys it

[02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:36.350]
She's a crazy person, study finds dogs can smell cancer

[02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:39.630]
Now Robin had that on the Stern show this morning, but it was a long time ago

[02:15:39.630 --> 02:15:41.430]
Plus who cares what they head on, right?

[02:15:43.190 --> 02:15:47.950]
We've always suspected that man's best friend has a special ability to sense when something is wrong with this

[02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:53.190]
But the first experiment to verify that scientifically is demonstrated that dogs are able to smell cancer

[02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:59.210]
Experts say it's unlikely that poochies will become practical partners in cancer detects anytime soon

[02:15:59.210 --> 02:16:02.410]
But that the results of the study by English scientists are promising

[02:16:03.390 --> 02:16:08.250]
They show that when you run from bladder cancer patient who are set out among samples from healthy people

[02:16:08.250 --> 02:16:14.390]
Or those with other diseases, the dogs, ordinary pets were able to identify the cancer you run almost three times more often

[02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:15.930]
And will be expected by chance alone

[02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:20.330]
The issue is now whether or not they can detect cancer because clearly they can

[02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:26.230]
The issue is whether you can set up a system or rather, now let me ask you this, I'm a little bit confused

[02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:31.670]
I mean, are they asking them? I mean, Skippy, which one of these has cancer?

[02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:34.010]
And then he goes running over, this is the one

[02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:39.790]
So I'm saying, yeah, the issue is whether you can set up a system whereby they can communicate

[02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:43.430]
With you, that requires further ingenuity since him, Kolei, professor of medical statistics

[02:16:43.430 --> 02:16:48.150]
And the Imperial College in London was not connected with research but as the owner of a Labrador Retriever

[02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:50.990]
Oh, there's a great dog, two barks means cold in cancer, for example

[02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:52.330]
Is that it? Yeah

[02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:56.350]
I love about cancer of the pro-state cancer three barks

[02:16:56.350 --> 02:16:59.050]
David Neal, a bladder and prostate cancer surgeon

[02:16:59.690 --> 02:17:03.570]
I came with you in the university and said it was plausible that dogs might be able to pick up the set of cancer

[02:17:03.570 --> 02:17:08.030]
Because people with a disease said unique abnormal proteins in their urine

[02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:09.790]
I bet you even Josh Beckett didn't know that

[02:17:10.710 --> 02:17:14.390]
I'm skeptical about whether it'll be implementable but scientifically it should be followed up

[02:17:14.390 --> 02:17:17.870]
So Neal, a spokesman for cancer research UK Britain's Cancer Society

[02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:22.170]
He said it might be that dogs are better than our current machines at picking up abnormal proteins in the urine

[02:17:22.170 --> 02:17:24.870]
One of the dogs picking up, can we get a machine that does the same?

[02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:32.110]
Yadi, all right, it is thought that a dog's sense of smell is generally 10 to 100,000 times better than the humans

[02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:38.610]
Neal, Roger, sense of smell is a pain in the end

[02:17:39.390 --> 02:17:42.090]
Try, you doggy

[02:17:42.890 --> 02:17:43.870]
I'm sorry

[02:17:51.690 --> 02:17:57.870]
Let me tell the sea that we're likely to go forth

[02:17:59.950 --> 02:18:05.610]
They probably have a cycle he knew by the snow

[02:18:07.550 --> 02:18:25.410]
He said, he said, is the one you get now they have only one big tail of life

[02:18:25.410 --> 02:18:33.970]
Don't call me a dog so dumb we got it now they were putting it safe we got it through

[02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:40.650]
We hold the taxes so long we got it where is most of our dreams?

[02:18:43.570 --> 02:18:50.250]
You say my 11 is what they got you to do to me

[02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:57.590]
Can't get any government or own party country to be

[02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:09.990]
You believe what they said is like a dog a dog a dog has been used

[02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:16.050]
A steady sense of the cold is true

[02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:25.250]
For the election of all we got it who should start his game with new dogs?

[02:19:25.570 --> 02:19:29.990]
Let them on your knees you got it

[02:19:36.350 --> 02:19:44.370]
We have a different point of view now we're interested in our lives are true

[02:19:44.370 --> 02:19:50.370]
Five of our kids so dumb, five of our so dumb

[02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:56.170]
Seen you in the snow

[02:19:58.650 --> 02:20:02.990]
Seen you but they get a bunch of you

[02:20:04.390 --> 02:20:12.510]
Here we are and you a soldier who free, where you in a jot

[02:20:14.170 --> 02:20:22.470]
When did they cover us by the sprouts who still feel alive?

[02:20:23.490 --> 02:20:28.150]
But we fail to learn their reputation

[02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:32.130]
You are the only human in what you see as a fossil year.

[02:20:33.810 --> 02:20:43.710]
Where I see you, the shower, you're the tip for you.

[02:20:44.650 --> 02:20:52.830]
You won't need a doubt for your early, simple sensors and key units.

[02:21:02.290 --> 02:21:06.170]
I'm not a fan of it.

[02:21:06.530 --> 02:21:09.870]
144-560-WQM, and the return to the Humber.

[02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:12.070]
A big bit of life Humber.

[02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:15.350]
Humber, Hanko, returns it for after a very bizarre couple of months away.

[02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:18.830]
Anyway, you're going to be embarrassed when I play one here that we forgot.

[02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:22.290]
You're going to say, how in hell could we forget?

[02:21:23.410 --> 02:21:24.790]
How the hell can I get?

[02:21:26.250 --> 02:21:26.770]
Instinct.

[02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:27.450]
How could you?

[02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:28.310]
Galby.

[02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:31.970]
Galby, talking on a sports show.

[02:21:32.910 --> 02:21:34.790]
Trying to be my show.

[02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:40.810]
Your voice sounds just like a sad thing year old girl.

[02:21:41.610 --> 02:21:43.630]
A little sports host, you.

[02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:47.030]
What else are you there for?

[02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:51.650]
Galby, Galby, talking like a baby.

[02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:54.410]
Who needs a little training?

[02:21:55.530 --> 02:21:57.710]
Life can feel un-understand.

[02:21:58.530 --> 02:22:00.670]
You don't sound like a fan.

[02:22:01.330 --> 02:22:06.250]
Remove the rubber bands that show your scrub.

[02:22:06.810 --> 02:22:10.690]
Galby, Galby, Galby.

[02:22:12.890 --> 02:22:17.010]
Galby, your lovely bandit with no money.

[02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:20.070]
Galby, Galby, Galby.

[02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:23.310]
You don't belong there on the air.

[02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:28.850]
And Galby, the sports can wait till your voice cracks.

[02:22:29.490 --> 02:22:34.370]
Because anyone who sounds like that, you're kind of another job.

[02:22:35.010 --> 02:22:40.070]
And they should only take you back when both your baby's dropped.

[02:22:40.690 --> 02:22:43.190]
Galby, Galby.

[02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:48.830]
When you don't grow up, you make us want to grow up.

[02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:54.190]
You feel these sweet people go to broadcasting school.

[02:22:55.010 --> 02:23:02.350]
Your free, you bastard voice makes you sound like a hot dog.

[02:23:02.350 --> 02:23:04.450]
You're a hot dog.

[02:23:05.010 --> 02:23:07.090]
You're a hot dog.

[02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.450]
Absolutely.

[02:23:08.770 --> 02:23:09.890]
I'm not that hot dog.

[02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:12.510]
Galby's waiting for a man who is in the empty stomach.

[02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:16.830]
Although he is for him, he's getting paid for nothing.

[02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:20.030]
He's going to get paid.

[02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:21.370]
He's got a little part of his deal.

[02:23:22.090 --> 02:23:23.370]
I wouldn't be a secret.

[02:23:23.710 --> 02:23:24.730]
He's got that in his contract.

[02:23:25.010 --> 02:23:26.370]
He gets paid a few bucks.

[02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:30.490]
During the season, he was broadcasting the games.

[02:23:30.690 --> 02:23:31.590]
There's no going to be any.

[02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:36.810]
I mean, that's not 100% definite.

[02:23:37.010 --> 02:23:39.530]
But it just stood over to promising for any hockey season this year.

[02:23:39.810 --> 02:23:41.670]
And though that most of South Dakota is really worried about that,

[02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:44.830]
what they are worried about, did we get that under guilty?

[02:23:45.490 --> 02:23:46.050]
Yes, South Dakota.

[02:23:46.170 --> 02:23:46.890]
I mean, Josh guilty.

[02:23:47.810 --> 02:23:49.910]
The hurricane, I guess we better do the hurricane stuff.

[02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:52.950]
Because after all, we are keeping our eye on it.

[02:23:53.010 --> 02:23:53.830]
At least you are anyway.

[02:23:54.010 --> 02:23:55.950]
I'm so sorry that I can't be there for this one.

[02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.850]
Like I was through franters.

[02:23:57.530 --> 02:24:00.270]
I'm feeling almost like a little bit like I'm missing something.

[02:24:00.450 --> 02:24:02.750]
Like it was, I don't know, like a tumor.

[02:24:03.970 --> 02:24:06.750]
Hurricane Jean continued its way through the North and Bahamas

[02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:10.210]
in a possible landfall and Florida after killing more than 1100 people in Haiti.

[02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:13.510]
Florida is bracing for what may be the fourth hurricane in the world's forecast

[02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:18.150]
is predicted Sunday morning landfall somewhere along the state's east coast.

[02:24:18.250 --> 02:24:19.290]
Oh my God.

[02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:22.650]
The National Hurricane Center said Jean is likely to strengthen into a powerful

[02:24:22.650 --> 02:24:25.570]
category three storm over the weekend, maybe later today.

[02:24:25.570 --> 02:24:28.530]
It's already left major destruction and its wake in Haiti.

[02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:33.010]
International relief workers trying to distribute supplies on Friday were mobbed

[02:24:33.010 --> 02:24:36.030]
by hungry desperate people, many whom said they had eaten since their homes

[02:24:36.030 --> 02:24:38.750]
were destroyed last weekend when Jean was still a proper storm.

[02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:43.750]
Some pro-150 people still are missing in Haiti six days after the storm hit

[02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:47.010]
and the death toll is expected to rise as recovering relief efforts continue.

[02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:51.570]
Jean looked more than 250,000 people homeless in Haiti's Northwest Province.

[02:24:51.970 --> 02:24:54.870]
The days since have been a desperate time of survival.

[02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:58.170]
Without ceremony, mass graves were being filled with both human and animal

[02:24:58.170 --> 02:25:02.410]
carcasses, survivors set up camp on house tops surrounded by contaminated

[02:25:02.410 --> 02:25:04.610]
waters and compromised food supplies.

[02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:08.950]
Getting back to old Jean, Hurricane Jean is now heading toward the Bahamas

[02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:12.130]
at 11 o'clock this morning. The center of the hurricane was 290 miles east

[02:25:12.130 --> 02:25:15.750]
of Great Epical Island Northwestern Bahamas, or Hurricane Warning is in effect.

[02:25:16.610 --> 02:25:20.390]
Jean's top winds held at 100 miles an hour with moving west near 9 miles an hour

[02:25:20.390 --> 02:25:23.190]
with some increase in forward speed expected during the next 24 hours.

[02:25:23.810 --> 02:25:26.150]
Hurricane Force Windsor Stunt Outward Up To Four. In other words,

[02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:28.590]
let's get ready for it again. Okay, I know you're getting tired of it,

[02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:31.130]
but I would be ready. I'd be prepared. Do you know what I'm saying? I'd be doing

[02:25:31.130 --> 02:25:34.190]
things today. And I'll wait until like tomorrow night or then getting up

[02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:38.090]
Sunday morning saying, oh crap. Hurricane Force Windsor Stunt Outward Up To

[02:25:38.090 --> 02:25:41.150]
45 miles from the center and Tropical Storm Force Windsor Stunt Outward Up

[02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:45.410]
to 150 miles, dangerous surf and rip currents caused by large swells

[02:25:45.410 --> 02:25:48.030]
from the hurricane possible along the south eastern Florida coast to center

[02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:51.430]
be seen. As the storm moves closer to Florida, Hurricane watches

[02:25:51.430 --> 02:25:54.590]
been issued along with coast from Florida City to stand Augustine,

[02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:58.050]
including Lake Oki Chobie. The hurricane center noted at sundown

[02:25:58.050 --> 02:26:01.550]
tonight till sundown tomorrow be yom kippur the solom- the Jewish holiday

[02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:04.990]
observance in the watch and warning areas will not be listing the radios

[02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:10.490]
are watching TV. Well, what about the, uh, who else? Who are the other ones that don't?

[02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:14.930]
The, um, other, uh, the amish. That's exactly what I have in mind, right?

[02:26:15.050 --> 02:26:17.910]
They never do. Anyway, right. And they may not be where the hurricane

[02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:22.190]
situations have you have like orthodox do is or amish. Uh, you better go knock on

[02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:25.010]
the door and feed them some cheeseburgers. Do you think the amish eat cheeseburgers?

[02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:28.090]
Uh, they don't have a problem with it. No. For the ones that eat that

[02:26:28.090 --> 02:26:31.510]
vegetarian stuff. Is that the Quakers? I don't know. They make that scrap

[02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:35.170]
old script. What about that stuff? That's head cheese. No, come on.

[02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:38.010]
Jean follows hurricane Charlie in Francis, which hits the Florida peninsula

[02:26:38.010 --> 02:26:41.190]
and Ivan which ponded what we already know that best. So Florida governor

[02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:44.190]
fat assed, he had bushwind in the states to take jeans seriously calling it

[02:26:44.190 --> 02:26:47.290]
a brutal storm. And he ought to know because he's a brutal governor.

[02:26:47.290 --> 02:26:50.230]
Here's people taking their neighbors as a way to help people move away from

[02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:54.170]
the coastline. Yes, we're tired and our sources are stretched. He said adding that

[02:26:54.170 --> 02:26:57.970]
the state has the initial complication of few available hotel rooms because so many

[02:26:57.970 --> 02:27:01.210]
are filled with relief workers. Although there are several tracks that might be

[02:27:01.210 --> 02:27:04.190]
taken by the hurricane currently in category two storm, most of the computer

[02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:07.050]
projection at least at this time have it continuing toward the Florida peninsula.

[02:27:07.570 --> 02:27:11.270]
Max headroom mayfield said the way it looks now. We will indeed have an impact in

[02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:14.730]
Florida. I don't see no way you know how to be getting around that.

[02:27:14.730 --> 02:27:19.170]
We will find a solution. We will ride your morning symbi-ditch and

[02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:21.910]
force a round of clock to fight.

[02:27:26.730 --> 02:27:29.330]
Talk about embarrassing and oversight.

[02:27:30.910 --> 02:27:39.870]
So many started out a regular guy who joined the rectory and made the ultimate

[02:27:39.870 --> 02:27:42.930]
sacrifice and grace in celebration.

[02:27:43.770 --> 02:27:46.310]
Fatherhood to amen.

[02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:50.230]
Funny, holy, and rude.

[02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:55.110]
Fatherhood to altering policy.

[02:27:55.610 --> 02:28:02.190]
As time went by his earthly means, compromise his choice.

[02:28:02.850 --> 02:28:08.170]
He found the way to get really by altering young boys.

[02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:10.870]
Fatherhood to amen.

[02:28:15.950 --> 02:28:19.610]
Fatherhood to altering policy.

[02:28:20.390 --> 02:28:27.070]
He was happy to get to he got caught by some title sale.

[02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:32.630]
Then the Vatican saved everyone off and he didn't have to go to jail.

[02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:35.470]
Fatherhood to amen.

[02:28:36.910 --> 02:28:40.090]
But only to alter.

[02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:44.190]
Fatherhood to altering policy.

[02:28:44.830 --> 02:28:44.990]
Amen.

[02:28:45.790 --> 02:28:51.170]
They sent him to a three-ster tree where they can you flecked and trade.

[02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:57.270]
If it was you or it was me, they'd lock us up and throw the keys away.

[02:28:57.790 --> 02:29:00.050]
Fatherhood to amen.

[02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:04.050]
But only to alter.

[02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:08.110]
Fatherhood to alter.

[02:29:08.890 --> 02:29:12.370]
Fatherhood to amen.

[02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:16.050]
But only to alter.

[02:29:18.310 --> 02:29:19.950]
Fatherhood to amen.

[02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:22.870]
Ooooo!

[02:29:28.210 --> 02:29:33.610]
Those awful youths in my abbey as Mark, they changed the name to Alien Heart.

[02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:37.510]
Explication is now, and two of five are marked.

[02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:42.290]
That's where the fuck's our angels and elves laugh a roll away.

[02:29:42.850 --> 02:29:48.530]
Until you see the human chain in giant water or rock, where you grab a jong or a wrap.

[02:29:49.530 --> 02:29:57.530]
I take a bucket up to a democracy, down, back south to the youth of town.

[02:29:57.870 --> 02:30:02.370]
Under water and ground and back around, to a corrupt city of town.

[02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:04.730]
The answer they just barked you, never seen.

[02:30:05.650 --> 02:30:08.970]
That people nature of the toilet could clean the sign and autograph.

[02:30:09.450 --> 02:30:11.410]
Like a big shot, maybe yes or?

[02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:13.630]
And then a park here, car.

[02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:16.370]
It's all about how important you feel.

[02:30:16.370 --> 02:30:20.510]
That the rest of the country takes its own baby before it passes your son.

[02:30:21.330 --> 02:30:22.810]
Go down to Alien Heart.

[02:30:26.570 --> 02:30:27.470]
Hey, it's Mark.

[02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.850]
Hey, it's Mark.

[02:30:38.250 --> 02:30:39.450]
Hey, it's Mark.

[02:30:39.450 --> 02:30:40.670]
Hey, it's Mark.

[02:30:40.750 --> 02:30:43.610]
Hey, it's Mark.

[02:30:48.670 --> 02:31:07.470]
The answer they just barked you, never seen.

[02:31:11.430 --> 02:31:13.590]
That's where the fuck's our angels and elves laugh.

[02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:21.790]
I think he was gonna be a second, we almost forgot this next one.

[02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.710]
Who?

[02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:25.730]
You're good personality, you're a pastella.

[02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:29.850]
Full of the overacto during Mark, known as overacto, is the best, I'm good serious.

[02:31:32.190 --> 02:31:32.450]
Yeah.

[02:31:33.010 --> 02:31:35.970]
Fagus, a poker-brown-biss of your pastella.

[02:31:39.650 --> 02:31:53.470]
She only was seven when she ordered, our true two more coverage before CNN, ignoring the weather and storms to avoid.

[02:31:54.050 --> 02:31:58.630]
Her white trash-footed mother said she died with joy.

[02:31:58.630 --> 02:32:15.310]
She only tried, our final pilot, our final pilot.

[02:32:15.310 --> 02:32:26.230]
He are too young to fly, your never gonna save night.

[02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:36.130]
Now the white trash-footed mother must live through her son, but he's that flying.

[02:32:36.130 --> 02:32:42.830]
Don't seem as much fun, still she says you have to do it for me.

[02:32:43.330 --> 02:32:47.530]
Now help me set up my new white screen TV.

[02:32:47.530 --> 02:33:04.110]
Child pilot, your child pilot.

[02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:12.950]
Your two young to fly, your never, never, never, never.

[02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:14.530]
Come and save night.

[02:33:15.930 --> 02:33:16.290]
No.

[02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:20.750]
What quickly won?

[02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:23.690]
What he is just a crazy chicken echo fool, man, he's unbelievable.

[02:33:24.450 --> 02:33:30.270]
Your favorite all-time poker-brown-bitt, president-dumishment 122 leading the pack, but Kamble-leases right on his ass.

[02:33:30.570 --> 02:33:30.990]
110.

[02:33:30.990 --> 02:33:32.810]
Yeah, name got something to say.

[02:33:33.010 --> 02:33:33.130]
Huh?

[02:33:33.770 --> 02:33:34.530]
That happens all the time.

[02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:39.650]
Sitting on a bench in Del Rey speaking of sitting on your ass 78, Ivana Srage, 154.

[02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:42.730]
Did we put Ivanax, uh, what's the other one?

[02:33:43.310 --> 02:33:43.870]
What I played?

[02:33:44.190 --> 02:33:45.030]
The Ivanax name game?

[02:33:45.350 --> 02:33:45.650]
Yeah.

[02:33:46.610 --> 02:33:47.370]
I don't think we did.

[02:33:47.630 --> 02:33:48.230]
Didn't put that on her.

[02:33:48.290 --> 02:33:48.970]
Let's get that on her.

[02:33:49.050 --> 02:33:49.550]
It's kinda cute.

[02:33:50.290 --> 02:33:51.510]
Ivana Srage, 154.

[02:33:51.630 --> 02:33:52.910]
Weapons of Massachusetts, 1352.

[02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:54.050]
My religion 49.

[02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:55.670]
Marty Feldman, I-28.

[02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:57.070]
Bokobrine Blow is 26.

[02:33:57.250 --> 02:33:57.850]
That's my favorite.

[02:33:58.670 --> 02:34:03.490]
Motable and Gully Stevens 22, Tar Baby 15, the restitution song, Rest in Peace 13.

[02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:04.770]
Bye-bye Gully.

[02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:06.310]
13.

[02:34:06.970 --> 02:34:13.550]
Speaking in Tongues 9, the Bokasong 7, Tell Hassy Nazi 7, the, uh, damn USA's got five.

[02:34:13.850 --> 02:34:16.110]
That's the God bless the USA.

[02:34:16.590 --> 02:34:16.730]
Right.

[02:34:16.930 --> 02:34:18.290]
Virgin Mary 5, then we got him five.

[02:34:18.390 --> 02:34:20.210]
And Scorris again finally got four and a half.

[02:34:20.210 --> 02:34:25.050]
And you're listening to new, new, new Roger's exclusive radio on 5th again.

[02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:29.150]
You can, say, plan.

[02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:33.430]
My religion better than your religion.

[02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:36.390]
My religion better than yours.

[02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:37.130]
Yes, sir.

[02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:41.010]
My religion, what you require, you avoid a lack of fire.

[02:34:41.230 --> 02:34:43.310]
My religion better than yours.

[02:34:44.530 --> 02:34:47.530]
My religion's better than your religion.

[02:34:47.530 --> 02:34:50.410]
My religion better than yours.

[02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:55.010]
My religion ever takes in your free and racial hate.

[02:34:55.310 --> 02:34:57.390]
My religion better than yours.

[02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:58.530]
All right.

[02:34:58.750 --> 02:35:01.310]
How do you get to get to better than your religion?

[02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:04.130]
My religion better than yours.

[02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:11.270]
What we like about the best type of boys is where the dress, my religion, is better than yours.

[02:35:12.470 --> 02:35:14.570]
But you're gonna get to better than what we're doing.

[02:35:15.790 --> 02:35:18.090]
But we're religion better than yours.

[02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:20.990]
We have a rule we've had before.

[02:35:21.170 --> 02:35:23.550]
We're in private time to best get to better than mine.

[02:35:23.770 --> 02:35:25.010]
We're religion better than yours.

[02:35:26.410 --> 02:35:28.510]
My religion better than yours.

[02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:32.170]
My religion better than yours.

[02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:34.830]
Super-Hopper us.

[02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:35.290]
We people.

[02:35:35.470 --> 02:35:36.710]
We slaughter pigs and dogs.

[02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:37.290]
We don't smoke.

[02:35:37.390 --> 02:35:39.310]
My religion better than yours.

[02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:42.830]
My religion better than yours.

[02:35:47.530 --> 02:35:48.170]
My religion better than yours.

[02:35:48.170 --> 02:35:49.730]
We were kings and they killed us.

[02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:51.270]
And they never ever had to kill.

[02:35:51.470 --> 02:35:53.570]
Private religion better than yours.

[02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:57.050]
My religion's better than yours.

[02:35:57.990 --> 02:36:00.290]
My religion's better than yours.

[02:36:01.230 --> 02:36:03.170]
We now endorse her father.

[02:36:03.330 --> 02:36:03.830]
You like overbrushes.

[02:36:04.730 --> 02:36:07.110]
You are just my religion's better than yours.

[02:36:08.730 --> 02:36:11.030]
My religion's better than yours.

[02:36:11.350 --> 02:36:11.890]
And you can listen.

[02:36:12.430 --> 02:36:14.310]
My religion's better than yours.

[02:36:15.570 --> 02:36:19.370]
We wear ties and ride our bikes and get some very lots of bikes.

[02:36:19.570 --> 02:36:21.470]
My religion's better than yours.

[02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:25.170]
My religion better than yours.

[02:36:26.410 --> 02:36:28.590]
My religion better than yours.

[02:36:29.930 --> 02:36:31.670]
We don't want to use our brains.

[02:36:31.810 --> 02:36:33.170]
We're mightless living, don't we?

[02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:35.770]
My religion better than yours.

[02:36:37.690 --> 02:36:39.010]
That's a good one.

[02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:43.870]
Don't forget the Hopper returns it for the sacriotone.

[02:36:44.430 --> 02:36:45.050]
Spread the word.

[02:36:46.490 --> 02:36:48.750]
I join the Natsip party.

[02:36:49.010 --> 02:36:49.490]
Spread the word.

[02:36:49.490 --> 02:36:51.770]
I face the college with G-O-T.

[02:36:52.110 --> 02:36:52.510]
Your legs.

[02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:55.930]
And I strongly agree with dragway policies.

[02:36:56.530 --> 02:36:57.110]
So did it.

[02:36:57.370 --> 02:36:58.710]
Won't be common for me.

[02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.530]
Bracum.

[02:36:59.970 --> 02:37:02.510]
So I went to the Natsip party.

[02:37:03.250 --> 02:37:05.770]
Invention held in the entire state.

[02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:10.130]
For 9-11 things decided to give their hands a shake.

[02:37:10.930 --> 02:37:13.630]
And dance on the grain of leaving.

[02:37:14.330 --> 02:37:16.130]
Mine comes now.

[02:37:17.390 --> 02:37:19.390]
But who's stuck in this will?

[02:37:20.410 --> 02:37:23.990]
You see you feeling very wounded.

[02:37:24.630 --> 02:37:26.190]
Can't think for yourself.

[02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:29.290]
What the fuck?

[02:37:29.930 --> 02:37:32.290]
What the fuck?

[02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:39.070]
The food of the food of the young boy.

[02:37:40.450 --> 02:37:46.990]
The entertainment at the Natsip party was appropriately Christian and wise.

[02:37:48.010 --> 02:37:51.930]
There was native youth and clear channel of fruitly greenwood.

[02:37:52.250 --> 02:37:53.790]
And to be green tea's keys.

[02:37:54.610 --> 02:37:57.290]
I'm watching whole writing now.

[02:37:58.530 --> 02:38:00.450]
And hand-culture as well.

[02:38:00.450 --> 02:38:07.430]
If you don't believe what she's the only one that you should die goes ahead.

[02:38:09.130 --> 02:38:09.690]
Bracum.

[02:38:10.650 --> 02:38:11.630]
Bye bye bye.

[02:38:11.890 --> 02:38:12.430]
Oh, stop.

[02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:14.090]
Show me your broadest hands.

[02:38:14.530 --> 02:38:15.090]
Show me your hands.

[02:38:15.810 --> 02:38:16.370]

Show me your hands.

[02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:19.110]
My hands are full of water.

[02:38:19.290 --> 02:38:20.370]
Let's go get drunk.

[02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:21.690]
