Viacom president and C. Oh, oh, oh, Mel Carmeson last out against the FCC's recent crackdown on broadcast in decency

[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.960]
During an interview session conducted by the New Yorker magazines Ken Allala Alueta Alaweta

[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.520]
Alaweta during an event titled a conversation with Mel Carmeson hosted by the SI new house school of

[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.600]
Public communications Carmeson said that Viacom doesn't broadcast in decency

[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.640]
Which he noted was defined by the FCC as a discussion of sex or expatory matter with a patently offensive manner

[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.020]
We're fighting in Iraq for freedom Carmeson pointed out if it doesn't appeal to you shut the radio off

[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.020]
Just because you don't like the words anal sex doesn't make it indecent

[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:42.140]
Noting that many journalists have not been supportive of the first amendment. He said we think this is a very slippery slope

[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.820]
That's right. Mel hang on because they we can all feel ourselves sliding right down it right now. Let go

[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.900]

Air america's flagship show a three-hour broadcast during comic and author al franken competes against big fat rush

[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.180]
Rush is a big fat liar just like al franken said walls told the Washington Post apparently

[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.700]
Rush saw a C-span show

[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.680]
I did where I said one of the reasons that right wing radio dominates radio so well is they have a lot of talent that rush is very good

[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.920]
A radio he's an entertainer not a pundit and now because I praise the right wing host. He says I'm getting

And now they've elected to pay the fine with 400,000 pennies donated by listeners at live broadcast

[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.720]
From a highly afferniture store hell the yesterday. This will allow listeners the chance

[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.060]

91.9 on your FM band

[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.940]
Concurrently the FCC said at $10,000 five to mommy resident Gary Feldman

[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:49.060]
Cut it out Gary for broadcasting without a license on the 91.9 frequency in date county

Green and Feldman each have about 30 days to be spotted the notices of apparent liability 10 grand apiece pay up or get out

[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.280]

There's no more joy right no money is left these open guys they stand me to death across the land

I can't feel a

[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.320]
10-18-5-60

[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.420]
I never thought that was gonna end you know what he just kept it once he got rolling man

[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.600]
What's about it to last an hour

[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.160]
Exactly we're an hour and 12 minutes would be good

[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.360]
That's how long we got to go to 11 30 till 11 members start per claim it duck sticker head in the door yet or what

[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.020]
No

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.660]
Well if he does just close it on real quick okay it'll read the pressure

[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:27.260]
Look for the Q-M band today noon till one it build usery motors located at 300 almyra avenue and curl gables

[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.640]
Almyria avenue. I'm sorry. So sorry almyria

[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:36.380]
Stop by to pick up a pair of tickets to see the marlins and the Dodgers next to the day courtesy the real yellow pages from bell south

[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.580]
That's the marlins who won again yesterday in Colorado no less one the series

[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:47.560]
And let's see we got another Marlin game this afternoon, but the bad news being for us that they don't search till a 405 pre game

[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:54.840]
It we got the mad dog at 2 to 3 30 for now and a half. He'll come in make his presence. Oh right 3 30 got Marlins on deck Marlins at the giants

[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.440]
They read match it last years of NCLS

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.660]
405 and then you got hurricane hotline 7 o'clock the big 8 to 10 2 hours. That's plenty and it eca after that

[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.880]
Police in Los Angeles issued an alert that a shopping center on the city's west side

[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.480]
Could be a target of a possible terrorist threat as early as today

[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.680]
Oh my god

[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.580]
The veracity of the threat and up and verified as of late last night

[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.260]
However the LAP needs said would have extra patrols on the streets

[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.560]
And urge the public to be aware of their surrounding especially in the upscale westwood area of LA

[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.920]
Presidents of the area were urged to be on the lookout for suspicious bands or rental trucks and for anyone who appeared to be cause

[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.520]
Uh, casing a potential target addressed in heavy clothing or carrying a heavy backpack or double bag

[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.100]
Or maybe like an umbrella remember the umbrella man and damas. Nope

[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.840]
1963. No, that ever read about that. I thought you're talking about the soap opera

[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.440]
West Los Angeles is a general term for sprawling here that includes landmarks like Beverly Hills the UCLA campus

[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.320]
Santa Monica the Museum of tolerance and Los Angeles International Airport. Oh my god

[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.900]
So there you go keep well. I'll keep you abreast of that situation. Can I say that?

[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.580]
No, good. Huh? No

[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:10.000]
There's a book got a couple of books that we just added onto our website there recommended reading. I think three of them to be exact

[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.580]
One of them is the John Dean bag a jean John Dean bag book

[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.900]
Uh worst in Watergate

[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.980]
Okay, your cartoon was the magnificent by the way the one we're changing their testifying in front of the 9-11 commission

[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.200]
And here's a big fat big chase sitting behind a desk and they're saying oh well

[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.760]
We have we actually have another chair for the president and

[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.900]
Can you say oh we're fine. We're fine. Oh, we're fine. His bush is like a little monkey in his jacket pocket

[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.140]
That's a taric. It'll be on the site. He's like a little monkey

[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.260]
A little munchkin in the old v-smirking chip pocket. Yeah, that's murking chip

[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.700]
That's him anyway in this book spinning on the axis of evil by Scott Taylor

[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:54.460]
Best selling author and award-winning journalist america's war against direct if I can just indulge a couple of minutes here

[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.320]
It'll kill some time

[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.400]
It won't take long at all just one and a little bit few paragraphs, okay? Okay

[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:07.080]
Never was the media truth more manipulated than during the staged statue toppling scene April 9th

[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.260]
It was meant to symbolize the end of Sodom's regime

[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.780]
Watching CNN senior correspondent Christiana Amampur give a live report on these supposedly spontaneous incident

[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.760]
I suspected this would be one of the US's largest staged news events

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.560]
What a coincidence for a monpour and recruit to be on hand in freddo square to capture on video

[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.120]
A mob of Iraqis that they try to bring down a large statue of Sodom

[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.080]
Unable to achieve this feat alone a detachment of US Marines just happened to be in the area to lend a hand

[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.220]
I listened incredulously as I'm on poor told CNN's viewers that this was

[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:42.740]
Baghdad central square and that this particular statue was deeply symbolic to the Iraqi people

[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.440]
As freddo square sits between the Sheraton and the Palestine hotels

[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.760]
I was very familiar with it

[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.580]
Conquerator her claims freddo square certainly was not in the center of Baghdad

[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.940]
The real city center revolution square was some two kilometers away

[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.560]
And was still very much out of the control of Sodom loyalists

[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:03.260]
Furthermore this particular statue was cast from a standard mold and identical copies could be found all over Iraq

[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:09.080]
In fact up until the previous October when the statue of interacted freddo squared to nothing more than an empty traffic circle

[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.540]
What other media outlets housed in the Palestine hotel began broadcasting images of the statues toppling

[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.660]
They actually provided a different perspective

[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.380]
I've pulling back from the action it became obvious that the Iraqi mob was in fact just a tiny crowd

[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.700]
American tanks completely surrounded the square so the Iraqis were operating inside a protected perimeter

[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.780]
Warner Raki who can't enough for the cameras by banging his shoe on the toppled Sodom was later recognized to be one of

[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.880]
Ahmed Shalabi's INC bodyguards

[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:42.020]
Two days earlier the same individual wearing the same shirt had appeared beside the Iraqi national Congress president when he returned to the town of Nasiria

[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.440]
As became clearly evident the incident at freddo square had been orchestrated by the US military in conjunction with CNN

[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.160]
What it would certainly not pull Iraq citizens it effectively convinced North American audiences that the war was over

[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.100]
Bring that evening's newscast global television anchor Kevin Newman interviewed

[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.620]
Corresponded Packard Graham one of the few Canadian reporters who would stuck it out in Baghdad

[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:08.120]
From the Palestine hotel's rooftop grammar explained how this particular incident had involved only a handful of Iraqis

[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.520]
He went on to say that in reality the Fedi'in Fedi'in fighter still controlled most of Baghdad

[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:19.240]
Nevertheless the following morning virtually every North American headline read Sodom toppled and CNN had switched its war in Iraq

[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:25.600]
The logo to a new Iraq rebuilds instead of waiting for the Iraqis to rise up on mass to celebrate their so-called liberation

[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.420]
The Bush administration had decided the time was right to start celebrating for them

[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.200]
I just mentioned that in passing

[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.960]
Spitting on the axis of evil America's war against Iraq by Scott Taylor. Call me lies

[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.980]
At any rate

[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.620]
Okay, here's today's poll where we got a lot of fish to fry the next hour in the six minutes, but who's counting?

[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.160]
That sounds good. Well, let's see we did the number on the gaze the Jews the air Cubans the blacks

[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.880]
Which person best fits the description the ultimate redneck

[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.240]
Array

[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.140]
Billy Ray Cyrus Toby Keith those are the two starters we got and then you can add on as you as you are

[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:05.140]
Proves Denise Krosby in her butch looked there behind a beard curtain today. They can pile on they can just pile right on

[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.120]
56705 60 pound five 60 on a 18 T and T and for rise in line

[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.260]
Marlins is near deal for a new ballpark and ain't got to cost me a dime all right

[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.120]
Date County in the city of Miami were close to financing a deal with the marlins early yesterday to build a new baseball

[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.240]
State him near the orange bull, but enough snacks had developed by later in the day to send them back to the negotiating table

[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.800]
They're close to a final deal but not quite they're on the verge a red on the edge

[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.160]
The remaining parts of discussion who will pay for the parking garage. Oh, George will take care of that

[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.920]
Yeah, I got it right here and how much money from the potential sale of the city on Miami arena would go toward the project

[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.820]
Still County manager George Burgess said and Miami Mayor Mani Diaz said

[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.760]
They were hopeful signs of reach agreement perhaps as soon as today and the best part of the deal is

[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.960]
Mani Diaz is if they come up a few a hundred thousand short his kid will print up the money

[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.220]
Diaz said we're very close. It's very fluid when all is said and done will have a working agreement

[00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:03.620]
It could be tomorrow could be a week from now, but it's very very soon city manager Joe Ariola see more pessimistic saying much of the proposal had to be

[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.860]
We negotiated because the marlins failed to secure a key part of funding Wednesday a 60 million dollar state sales tax rebate

[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.300]
Gaudi adi adi adi goes on and Sensen said this and lobbyist William McKinley said it William McKinley is the lobbyist

[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.720]
I don't like that. I thought that first shot

[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.180]
But I guess not, huh? He's still a lobby. Thanks

[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:27.060]
So we got just an hour to go baby tell those numbers start coming in then we'll see then we'll find out whose

[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:33.040]
What on whom you know the naughty who's been nice. That's correct. That is absolutely positively

[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:42.280]
26 after 10 at 560 WQM and a man is looking for some month and put on his head a dead animal is not a good idea

[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.220]
Moe, you know what I mean? Absolutely. I knew you would

[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.500]

I urge everyone to complain to this station that's my opinion I'm like Disney

[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.180]
All right

[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.200]
But now it's run by greedy corporate holes

[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.060]
Then we dare about the bottom by not you

[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.660]
They are all different

[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.540]
Different power has no end

[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.860]
In fantasy

[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.860]
Always had he pushes friends

[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.120]
And so what's been for you the weird day

[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.160]
Tell me all the tales

[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.860]
Your brain was wired up

[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.600]
Play me on the film

[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.940]
They come in and

[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.340]
They try to kill the lady of stars

[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.520]
They're going to be a crazy girl star

[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.860]
If they're going in and they're telling this gun

[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.280]
They don't say no matter where you are

[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.380]
The micro baby you want to take its place

[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.540]
They hold the center like the woman out in place

[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.900]
And find the way for thousands hours in the fan

[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.140]
And do my quick take it goes all the way to the end

[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.180]
Okay, oh yeah

[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.920]
Not in this full of friends

[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.720]
They're telling you the lady of stars

[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.280]
They're telling you the lady of stars

[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.660]
They're telling you the lady of stars

[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.900]
They're telling you the lady of stars

[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:33.780]
10.32 we got 58 minutes in count

[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.380]
Dennis Rodman is the ultimate redneck

[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.460]
I think maybe he's a little late

[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.080]
John and Columbia South Carolina are faxing fool

[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.040]
You fool man that was for yesterday's poll

[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.960]
You idiot

[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.440]
Anyway the ultimate redneck George W. Bush says this facts

[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.140]
They're bringing on

[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.560]
Yeah, I would certainly agree with that

[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.540]
And he'll win hands down

[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.120]
But that's all right

[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.800]
George W. Bush let's get him on there right away

[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.720]
I'll president say

[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.240]
Right Neckie

[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.740]
We're going to smoke him out of their holes

[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.240]
Jeff Foxworthy is a good one

[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.740]
And also the chairman of the NRA

[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.060]
Wayne Loth P. E. R. Jr

[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.620]
No relation to a John Mars Jr

[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.060]
Or Neil McCrann

[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.200]
Okay, Wayne I beg your pardon

[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.300]
Wayne Loth P. E. R.

[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.660]
And this is not spelled correctly

[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.000]
We left the eye out

[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.060]
But then again even Josh would know that

[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.040]
How to spell a lot

[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.680]
He left out the

[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.860]
They say two good ones

[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.620]
They're Jeff Foxworthy

[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.320]
We better start building this list

[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.880]
Because once we get sidetracked

[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.040]
And the funniest facts

[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.760]
The most amusing facts in the history of them

[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.440]
This puts such a smile on my purse when I saw this

[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.320]
You're walking the book Neil

[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.380]
Signed up

[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.920]
Are you ready for that?

[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.540]
No, I'm sorry

[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.340]
Can I translate this one?

[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.380]
What this means is

[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.040]
Please get a gigantic number

[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.080]
Because we're counting on your fat ass

[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.860]
To bail out the

[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.720]
Morning and the night

[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.320]
You know the afternoon I've got to do pretty good

[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.160]
Mad dog and the Humper

[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.880]
They'll do just fine

[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.220]
But the mornings and the nights

[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.180]
So please Neil please

[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.020]
We're counting on you again to go back to those big

[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:07.820]
gigantic numbers

[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.380]
And on your big fat old

[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.980]
Templiass bail our ass off

[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.260]
Please

[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.300]
Well, I'll do my best

[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.080]
WQAM

[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:14.360]
Hello

[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:16.780]
QAM

[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.640]
Not there

[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.320]
WQAM

[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:18.840]
Hello

[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.740]
Hey, Dylan

[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.540]
Pretty good

[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.480]
Big story tonight on the front line

[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.360]
You're going to want to say

[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.660]
Called the Jesus factor

[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.940]
It's about

[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.820]
How they made a conscious decision

[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.660]
The Republicans

[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.340]
Throughout since Reagan

[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.000]
And that they believe that they can win

[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.360]
The presidency just based on that vote alone

[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.780]
Even though it's only 20 million people

[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:42.760]
But

[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.280]
Well, that's good they can have all 20 million

[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.800]
Those are the rest of us vote for Kerry

[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.260]
Yeah, for sure

[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.320]
I don't think they can win it alone

[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.880]
But it's an interesting front line

[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.600]
You got to watch it

[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.020]
Okay

[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.000]
Thanks

[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.340]
Thanks

[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.360]
WQAM

[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:54.820]
Hello

[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.280]
Good old Billy Bop

[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.940]
Billy Bop thorns and good one

[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.600]
Thank you, pali

[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.020]
In fact wouldn't it be kind of a redneck

[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.680]
You think to say

[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.860]
Hi, how are you?

[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.300]
I can see that in a good old western

[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.280]
You know, hi, pali

[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.300]
I never thought of Jeff

[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.260]
Hi is a westerner myself

[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:11.780]
But nevertheless

[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.860]
Maybe he's like from West Buffalo

[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.100]
Sorry, walked like a cowboy

[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.320]
Like cheek to white

[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.060]
I never seen no cowboy walk like that

[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.380]
Oh, you mean kind of like side saddle

[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.300]
Right, waddling

[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.700]
He walks kind of like with that

[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.020]
Walk in the stick kind of like slide saddle

[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.400]
Bow like it

[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.500]
WQAM, hello

[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.380]
Yes, sir

[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.660]
I think I needed that

[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.760]
Nominate everyone in NASCAR

[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.640]
But specifically Dale

[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.440]
Earn hard to

[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.600]
Dale Earnhardt Jr

[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.600]
He is your

[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.680]
Thank you so much

[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.420]
You all come back now here

[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.240]
All right

[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.140]
You all come back now

[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:40.440]
You're here

[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.740]
You got to love it up here in Nashville

[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.860]
And there's two kind of folks there

[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.340]
Them folks from New York and them Jews

[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.960]
And then there's us folks here in Nashville

[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.940]
Oh man, what a place

[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.640]
Yeah, that month that I lived there

[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.180]
That seemed like about 45 years

[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.800]
That was just

[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.520]
No, seriously, I told you that story about the night that I left

[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.160]
I thought I was a dead man

[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.000]
Because I was at the time coming back to Miami

[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.260]
Although I was going to go to Philadelphia

[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.220]
I told you that story

[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.560]
My furniture was on a way to Philly

[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.440]
And Dick Casper talking to you coming back to Miami

[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.880]
Which is well whatever it was

[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.180]
And so I had moved out of my apartment

[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.100]
All and all my stuff

[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.580]
My furniture was on a way to Philly

[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.200]
And then had to be rerouted, rerouted

[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.880]
And so I stayed the last night in a hotel

[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.540]
And motel

[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.480]
So I'm walking from the

[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.160]
Just out of the radio station

[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.100]
I start crossing the street and a cop comes over

[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.180]
And Nashville cop and he says

[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.420]
You were working there?

[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.600]
W, what was the name of the station?

[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:32.860]
I don't know

[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.520]
WLS

[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.500]
No, W, oh my god, I can't believe I can't remember the name of that station

[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.380]
Big 50,000 watts

[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:40.420]
WLAC

[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.820]
I said yeah, I'm working there

[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.640]
He said you know where I can find that Neil Rogers

[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.760]
And all of a sudden at that moment my life was flashing me for my eyes

[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.340]
And then the rest of my army of Rogers

[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.180]
I don't know why I did it

[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.060]
Because he caught me off guard

[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.280]
And he went on

[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.520]
He couldn't get away from him for 10 minutes

[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.080]
Well my gosh since you came to town

[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.320]
I'm so

[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.760]
I've said that you're leaving

[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.880]
You've taught me all

[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.460]
Whole new attitudes about blacks

[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.240]
And gays and this and in life

[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.020]
And you know when you grow up here in this town

[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.140]
You have such periculitude

[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.360]
And this guy was great

[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.980]
I thought you were going to tell me how he chased you out of town

[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.800]
With banjo music chasing you all the way

[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.100]
No, that was the next guy down the block

[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.060]
He didn't get to me at all

[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.060]
No, that was the beastlies

[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.060]
5,670, 5,60

[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.760]
Let's see, I better vote for somebody here

[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.020]
I think

[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.540]
Well you know it's

[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.800]
W don't need my help

[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.280]
Jeff Fox, we're going to have Toby Keith

[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.880]
Okay, he's just too red-nucky for all of us

[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.020]
Did we get the Ironheart Jr yet?

[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.960]
Yeah, that'll be on your momentarily

Net that crowd

[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:35.780]
No comparison

[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:36.840]
With what?

[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.600]
Beverly Hillbillies is an outstanding show

[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.220]
It's a parody of all of us

[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:40.420]
Oh

[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.340]

[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.400]
Nero Wall Trip

[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.520]
Or Terry Bradshaw

[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.780]
I don't think Terry Bradshaw is

[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.420]
Well, yeah, he is

[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:50.880]
He's a redneck

[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.440]
He's a dumb

[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.400]
But he's a dumb redneck

[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:53.700]
Oh, I'm sorry to be

[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.420]
redundant

[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.820]
Daryl Wall Trip or Terry Bradshaw

[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:57.840]
Strom Thurman

[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.640]
It's a maybe dead

[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.720]
But his memory lives on as the ultimate redneck

[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.340]
P.S. Deadwood Marathon

[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:02.900]

[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.920]
I'm not going to be able to see it

[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.160]
But you will, I'm sure you'll be glued to it, right

[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.700]

[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.240]

I bet you'd enough is farting up a storm in here

[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.500]
In fact, he and Clarence are probably like

[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.700]
Sniff it across the hall each other, you know

[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.540]
Probably making sounds that we most definitely cannot

[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:24.980]
No

[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.780]
Play on the ear

[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.280]

Exactly, that kind

[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.820]
That guilty man, he's just

[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.040]
And I believe that went out

[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:32.700]

[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.020]
Sure why not it's got that hat

[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.940]
Sure why not Richard Petty because he just got mentioned that bit

[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.340]
Well I haven't played that in a long time

[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:43.900]
Right

[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.440]

Loss the feds this easier USA or foreign flag vessel after they kick you off it

[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.480]
If they think you're planning to travel to Cuba

[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.980]
This means a Canadian sailor anywhere in the US territorial waters

[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.580]
We're just losing their boat if the feds think you may sail to Cuba

[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.620]
Even though it's okay if you're Canadian to go to Cuba

[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:20.440]
It says it's crazy but it's really a person I'd like to which I would suggest don't go to Cuba right

[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:20.780]

[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.680]
It's just kind of let's sense you off the deep end

[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.820]

Let's investigate this because if Terry Bowden ate the ultimate redneck then I don't know who the hell is

He makes George W. Bush seem like Woodrow Wilson, okay? That's how redneck he Terry Bowden is

[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.680]
He is just out of this world

[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:53.500]
I think maybe we ought to get like a one-shear in this book just just to take the pressure off once and for all let's somebody else do it

[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.500]
You know let mode do it, huh?

I mean we have fractions at night poor Eddie Kay. How'd you like to have to follow a Panther game?

[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.040]
Okay, how'd you like to have to go to a Panther? Oh, I'm sorry

[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.540]
I'm sorry. I don't want to pick on the organization, but

[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.680]
Will be nice to compete for the playoffs once you know in somebody's lifetime. I would be good before the team moves on

[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.540]
Pretty QA and hello

[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.920]
Ha ha ha okay

[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.280]
That guy that made an head baby

[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.080]
I don't know what his name was. That's cute

[00:43:54.900 --> 00:44:00.320]
Clam you for how about time cadill hopper he was uh always on a red skeleton show that's right. He was red skeleton

[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:05.060]
God bless five six seven oh five sixty. I didn't like red skull to be honest with you

[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.580]
I watched it because in back in the day. I mean you watch whatever was on I don't have a lot of options

[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.620]
Didn't have a whole bunch of choices even I remember the old four channel days

[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:14.340]
Hmm

[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.120]
Whenever she don't remember the old one channel days no I do

[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.980]
As a matter of fact

[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.440]
Um, and I could be wrong maybe there were two in the beginning. I don't recall

[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:31.320]
But we didn't have our TV yet as little tiny kid and watch us in New York and the kid down the block

[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:38.220]
His appearance had a TV set so every afternoon at five thirty I believe it was I'd go down there. We watch howdy duty

[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:42.560]
Oh, I can't howdy the and uh

[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:49.080]
Well you laughing about all kids watch howdy duty sure of course you had to do your civic duty and watch howdy

[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:55.020]
Doody at any rate I think it was preceded by the test pattern there weren't like shows on all day like it is now

[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.660]
Or like it has been for a long time it wasn't 24 seven like our engineering department

[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.640]
My gifusesly gets on the air sometimes

[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.940]
But they were just shows that came on and and the test panel would be on you know the one with the Indian head on

[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.600]
We've been through all of that crap about the test planner

[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:15.140]
Yeah, and five thirty hey kids what time is it? That's howdy duty time and that would be a very exciting point in my day

You're just gonna see it stop

[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.260]
You're just gonna see it stop

[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.740]
You're put to throw the rainer

[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.940]
And hate to walk it back

[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.420]
You're kickin' out the business

[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.940]
Cause here's a right way back

[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.180]
You'll bring your onto pieces

[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.800]
But first you got to go through it

[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.120]
Cause I can use a gun and a gun

[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.540]
And get your mom to do it

[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.760]
Just gonna see it stop

[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.940]
You're just gonna see it stop

[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:49.100]
You're just gonna see it stop

[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.800]
Touchin' you

[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.200]
It's a dirty job

[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.720]
Touchin' you

[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.120]
It's a dirty job

[00:46:59.060 --> 00:46:59.960]
Touchin' you

[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:00.480]
It's a dirty job

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:00.480]

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.000]
It's a dirty job

[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.000]

[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.140]
It's a dirty job

[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.320]
And we're just gonna see how we do it

[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.200]
Touchin' you

[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.920]
Yeah, somebody says the umptiest Jesse Homes

[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.940]
That's the magnificent choice

[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:18.220]
Thank you very much. Thank you Pat. Jesse Homes get his ass on it right away. What a piece of dirt. In fact, we can thank Jesse Homes in large part. All of this uh... goody two shoes word police stuff

[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.280]
We got with the FCC. He's the one who really started that big time many back in the day

[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.200]
What he decided to get the FCC off her lazy ass

[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.280]
And start being the word police, you know

[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:34.140]
Doing stuff that nobody ever wanted them to do in the first place. Here's an excellent fact. Almost as good as Duff's

[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:41.240]
It says Terry Bowden almost got the perfect genetic code. He almost got brains almost got personality almost got height almost made human

[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.020]
He's not doin' that word yet. That's cause most of you must not know Terry Bowden like I do

[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:46.460]
Hope

[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:53.640]
Man to see him is to say holy moly. Shazam. Do we want to put Jim neighbors on here?

[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.860]
Uh, okay. So was he a real red neck or did he just play one on television?

[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:05.380]
I don't know. Old man river. I guess while we know he was a real. He was for real. Several of these polls.

[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:12.060]
Yeah, he's been on a different amount of polls. But anyway, that's another story. Back in the day we could talk about that

[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:22.220]
But we better not. James says, speaking of that, I might be a little behind but I was just reading a letter on your webpage about American Idol and Ellen John saying the voters are racist. What a crock of Schmitt man.

[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:37.920]
The only people who are racist are Paula and Randy. At this point in the game, they're all amazing singers. That night the three black girls in the bottom three and Randy and Paula nothing but complain that the country was voting on popularity instead of talent when they should be congratulating the other four who obviously did better.

[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:48.940]
If you ask me, none of the other four looked like they could even ever win a popularity contest any damn way. The whole show has been nothing more than Randy and Paula telling the black people how great they are and telling the white people that they're just all right.

[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:56.620]
That's who's the biggest display of racism I've ever seen and make me sick and oh yeah, Elton John can kiss my fat ass as James.

[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.540]
Right going James and maybe he'd like to.

[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:08.060]
26 minutes in county can we handle the pressure will we collapse will Duff fall right on the floor in the past prostate prostate.

[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:17.420]
Let's see Mike says is Galpah sport John daily there's a golfer for you John daily I never I've seen the drunk one.

[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:22.120]
Yeah, yeah, the drunk one with like 10x was.

[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.600]
I see John daily alright let's get him on.

[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:32.680]
Oh yeah Chris Collins worth man I despise him I don't just dislike him I hate him.

[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:42.600]
Hate him don't know who that is he's an extra since the netting ban gold mediocre defensive back who now of course is a big mouth on NFL under one of the pregame shows Chris.

[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.380]
I don't know actually he does color on the games now.

[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:53.760]
He is just nauseating Chris Collins worth and Matthew McConaughey I don't know who that is am I missing something John he's an actor.

[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.920]
He's got a draw like I said qualifies him as the biggest red neck ever.

[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.140]
Oh, he probably ain't really red neck though.

[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.320]
No, I don't think so.

[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.560]
No plus we don't want to have to worry about the spelling because I'm looking at this funny.

[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.740]
I don't I know Matthew McConaughey he's been in stuff.

[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.580]
He's been in stuff.

[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:16.780]
Yeah, stuff and such and also he was in things when you like to open up a store called stuff and such and things.

[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:29.320]
Yeah, stuff and things stuff and such or just stuff it 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 80 I got a lot of stuff here but I'm going to save it for like after all the waiting after we get to that hoopla because then the audience is gone anyway.

[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.700]
The only people listen very intently are the people in the business they're all listening right now.

[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:40.560]
Good morning Tom Jekka who's not in the business but you know probably write an article about this book because this is a the fighting point.

[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.820]
This is a demarcation point in the history of software radio.

[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:48.000]
In fact this whole last rating period has been a demarcation in the history of radio period.

[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:53.700]
But it's especially in like six markets where it's German off the air because let's face it like him or not.

[00:50:53.900 --> 00:51:01.040]
He had this huge this gigantic humongous male Q man huge gigantic.

[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.840]
You got it is it huge and they got to go somewhere.

[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.280]
The year after going the off position they got to go how about the Mo and Joe show.

[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.920]
Absolutely. How about Mojo Mojo radio here in Toronto.

[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.520]
By the way it's a it's a character knows is listening.

[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.500]
I'm sure he is waiting to hear the numbers because tea channel they're not going to tell him nothing right away.

[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.780]
Especially if they suck and he won't have any excuses now.

[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.380]
Mr. Castron over you want to have those excuses now in the morning no more Howard.

[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.500]
Where you at one hour but that's your annual competition.

[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:38.160]
20 degrees that means 68 the sun is shining and another cloud is going to be 75 that he managed the day of the year.

[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.180]
Much too nice I think what happens if the numbers come out pretty good for us.

[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:47.080]
As soon as I read the number I'm just going to throw the pages up in the year and just run outside and just love the sunshine.

[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.800]
Just kind of like frolic in the sun.

[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.800]
W.A.M. Hello.

[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:54.500]
Q.A.M.

[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.320]
Not there W.A.M. Hello.

[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:57.960]
Hi.

[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.040]
Yes sir.

[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.220]
Can I add a woman to the list?

[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:01.760]

[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.500]
How about Daly Park.

[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.040]
Daly Park is magnificent.

[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.280]
I'm sure I'll take this one.

[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.440]
I want you to order the beta curtain as well.

[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.160]
Okay.

[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.200]
We got any Daly Park and for the beta curtain or not.

[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.740]
No, I never showed them.

[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.360]
She's never shown those things.

[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.640]
Daly Park is a good choice though.

[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:19.980]
Let's see.

[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:24.260]
I'd like to be sent by previous vote for Toby and change it to Tommy Mama's boy of Bowden.

[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.540]
No, his name isn't Tommy.

[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.660]
It's Terry Bowden.

[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.800]
He'll even have the right name.

[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.260]
A potential suggestion for future polls is Bob.

[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.720]
If it's not already been run, who has the worst hair?

[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.400]
Oh, that's good.

[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.680]
We've done here.

[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.540]
Bob's up in Tennessee.

[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.720]
My apologies, Bob.

[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:38.860]
I'm so sorry for you.

[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.280]
Worst hair.

[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:40.620]
That's good.

[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.540]
We've done worst hair piece.

[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.200]
But we're talking about people with real hair.

[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:43.760]
Worst hair.

[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.740]
We got to cross Moa.

[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.540]
Well, we could make it all inclusive.

[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:47.520]
Just work there.

[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:48.700]
We don't want to leave Moa.

[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:49.220]
Do we know?

[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.180]
Absolutely not.

[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.660]
He's got Donald Trump, Don King, Kramer, Jimmy Johnson and Moa.

[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:54.840]
Okay.

[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.140]
Put that in my pool pile.

[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:56.940]
Maybe we'll do that tomorrow.

[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:57.520]
Okay.

[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:58.760]
Worst hair.

[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.680]
That will kill tomorrow's pool and then you're on your own.

[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:01.120]
Yeah.

[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:02.840]
What do you mean by that?

[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.740]
I got big plans for next week.

[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:06.360]
Which of these people?

[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.560]
That fits the description of the ultimate redneck.

[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.000]
George W. Bush 71.

[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.740]
We're going to smoke about their holes.

[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.920]
Then we're live.

[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:14.820]
We're going to get them.

[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.380]
Toby Keith 29.

[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:17.760]
Bring it on.

No relation to Walter Ross Jr.

[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:28.780]
Billy Bob Thorton 9.

[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.280]

[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:38.620]
Terry Bowden.

[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.520]
He's moving up a little bit.

[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.280]
And I got five.

[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.320]
Terry Bowden.

[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.440]

And he's drinking it right now.

[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.000]
And no votes yet out of 192 for Jimmy Johnson.

[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.480]
Bill Friss, Chris Collinsworth or Dolly Parton yet.

[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.040]
But they will.

[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:58.620]
They'll start moving up.

[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:00.160]
22 minutes to go, man.

[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.020]
The pressure is just burst in here.

[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:03.940]
Line 9.

[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:04.600]
WQAM.

[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:04.860]
Hello.

[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.360]
You got to put Jerry Glanville on there, man.

[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.140]
Jerry Glanville.

[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:08.920]
Good old black Jerry.

[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.440]
There we go.

[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.020]
And I blackened color, but blackened dress.

[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:11.260]
Good.

[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:12.140]
And he wears a black dress.

[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.840]
Former coach of the New Orleans Saints.

[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:15.720]

[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.380]
Yes, I am.

[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.380]
Am I correct, John?

[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.840]
Oh, it also be a matter of Falcones.

[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.660]
Jerry Glanville.

[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.360]
He's another commentator.

[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.060]
He's another one commentates now.

[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.220]
If you can't make his a coach as a player, commentate.

[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.040]
WQAM, hello.

[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.120]
I need one.

[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:33.500]
I like that.

[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:33.840]
I need one.

[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:34.720]
All right.

[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.440]
I'd like to put Jeremy Shaki and I got the black redneck.

[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:38.880]
Karl Malone.

[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.320]
Who's anything here last one?

[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:42.860]
Karl Malone.

[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:43.880]
Well, Karl Malone.

[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:44.180]
Okay.

[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:44.580]
Thank you.

[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:50.260]
Karl Malone, a black redneck that's Karl with a K and Jeremy Shaki.

[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.840]
Who says all him fags are going to, whatever they're going to do.

[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:54.200]
Yeah.

[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:54.800]
He's a real redneck.

[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:55.960]
I think Mo likes him a lot.

[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.320]
5670, 5660, pound, 5660.

[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.760]
And if he doesn't, I'll just make it up anyway.

[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:01.940]
WQAM, hello.

[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.020]
Hello, Neil.

[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:03.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.000]
How about Ted Nugent?

[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.040]
Ted Nugent, real redneck, you man.

[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.100]
Okay, thanks.

[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:09.020]
He probably is.

[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:09.520]
Hangs up.

[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.380]
What's that summer back in Taylor Michigan?

[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.360]
That's the summer of Detroit.

[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.780]
That's where a lot of rednecks are in Taylor Michigan.

[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:19.420]
They got that big, gigantic size, the economy size,

[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.000]
you're a vacillating on top of the TV.

[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.420]
I don't know what they're doing with it, but nevertheless,

[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.800]
you can guess for yourselves.

[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.720]
Back in the day, we might explore that area,

[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.840]
but I don't think we're going to do that right now.

[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:30.320]
It's takes.

[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:32.620]
5670, 5660.

[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:37.440]
I don't know what that was all about.

[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.580]
Did you see that we're sharing a big sheep on CNN?

[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.380]
They were sharing a sheep.

[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:43.000]
They were sharing a huge sheep.

[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:48.020]
The sheep said this was the second most fearful moment of his life.

[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.120]
WQAM, hello.

[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.000]
Hello.

[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:51.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.400]
Charlie Daniels.

[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.780]
Charlie Daniels is excellent.

[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.460]
A real redneck he got there, where was one?

[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.360]
And one little wish here.

[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.380]
May you have a good number and may it be a masculine one.

[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.540]
Thank you so much.

[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.160]
Oh, great.

[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.540]
Nothing like a good masculine number.

[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.120]
Just ask me.

[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:06.900]
I'll tell you.

[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:07.060]
Woo.

[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.040]
Man.

[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.240]
5670560.

[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.240]
Bottom 560 on the ATT.

[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:15.100]
What are we laughing about?

[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.460]
We know we haven't laughed for cry yet.

[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:17.140]
Whatever.

[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.920]
What about if it's just like flat?

[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.060]
You know, if there's nothing, well, maybe we can be.

[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.080]
We can be flat.

[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.800]
But there's something going to happen in the morning.

[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:30.740]
There's something that's going to be like a re-jigging of the whole deal here.

[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.800]
Unless, of course, it's like that previous couple of trends when all the no-speakening glaze

[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.200]
people get the diaries in which case, it won't make much difference.

[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:37.440]
Right.

[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:39.220]
WQAM, hello.

[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:40.360]
Hello.

[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:41.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:42.780]
Jimmy Buffay.

[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:46.160]
Jimmy Buffay, real redneck he can't get too much more redneck than him.

[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:46.460]
All right.

[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:46.960]
Thank you.

[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:48.620]
That whole Key West crowd, man.

[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.960]
I don't understand that, dude.

[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.920]
You know, all the fags down there in Key West and redneck.

[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.320]
Is that kind of a bizarre combination?

[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:55.420]
No, no.

[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:56.600]
When you think about it, think about it.

[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:57.900]
Oh, right, I'm cowboy.

[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.360]
Club in the Capitol at 5.60 QAM.

[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.920]
I'm a cowboy.

[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.020]
I'm a cowboy.

[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:05.400]
I'm a cowboy.

[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.120]
I'm a cowboy.

[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:07.700]
QAM.

[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.760]
The young is too young.

[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.260]
That's third, man.

[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:23.120]
Now all of us redneck sure of it, sir.

[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.360]
That's the moon.

[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:30.400]
The sex just ain't as good unless it's family.

[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:37.000]
Because all of us redneck practice insists.

[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.780]
Now I'm my only uncle and worries me.

[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:52.240]
My kid Hester took me with her back to her double wide.

[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:59.460]
What a deal ain't got no wheels and insights felt like something died.

[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.300]
She kissed my cheek and winked her eyes.

[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.180]
And said we're all alone in the house.

[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.900]
But I got a sick wish.

[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:10.480]
She gave me a kiss.

[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:14.160]
And two and two back go in her mouth.

[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.800]
Oh, let's redneck sure of it, sir.

[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:25.940]
The sex just ain't as good unless it's family.

[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:32.460]
Because all of us redneck practice insists.

[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.800]
So come meet my new wife.

[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.100]
She's my niece.

[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:47.680]
I just got me a farm with horses, chickens, cows and pigs.

[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:54.820]
A four by four that I adore with tires that are too damn big.

[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:59.200]
The rear window it has a gun rack.

[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.800]
That's where I keep my gun.

[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.760]
A rattle flag and a wife in the back.

[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.540]
My neck is red from too much sun.

[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:14.360]
All of us redneck sure of it, sir.

[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:21.520]
The sex just ain't as good unless it's family.

[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:28.000]
Because all of us redneck practice insists.

[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:35.080]
My sister is the one over there with the dirty knees.

[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.860]
Every union's hard to choose.

[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.460]
Who's got the nicest two?

[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.020]
And I don't like the way my daddy is watching me.

[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.280]
Oh my God.

[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:53.100]
Nobody thinks all the redneck's all the time.

[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.100]
Ross P. Rowley says that's a good choice.

[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.660]
Gotta roll up your sleeves and do do do.

[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.220]
Little redneck from Texas.

[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:00.420]
Wait till here.

[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.680]
I'm not going to read this now because we got them numbers coming up.

[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:03.380]
Maybe later on.

[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:03.980]
Don't let me forget.

[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:04.640]
Or maybe tomorrow.

[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.480]
From the UK Guardian, their beliefs are bonkers but they're at the heart of power.

[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.020]
US Christian fundamentalists are driving Bush's Middle East policy.

[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:20.620]
And the article, the crux of it is, the thrust of it is that a third of Republicans are believers in Armageddon.

[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:21.580]
Right.

[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:27.300]
And the story goes on with the whole song and a dance about Armageddon and it'd be coming and how it's going to happen.

[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.960]
And the anti-Christ is on the earth right now walking around.

[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.980]
And you will convert or die, Jubilee.

[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:32.460]
I beg your pardon?

[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.640]
You will convert or die.

[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:34.260]
Right.

[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.060]
But won't that be great?

[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.720]
Because the rapture's coming.

[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.380]
Don't tell John Astroft about it.

[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.220]
I got a rupture coming.

[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.120]
Maybe 11, 30.

[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.560]
Wtc way him.

[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:45.780]
Hello.

[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:46.820]
Neil.

[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:47.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.520]
I got somebody for your poll.

[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.160]
All right.

[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.500]
Hank Williams Jr.

[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.560]
Hank Williams Jr.

[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.580]
Man, he's picking it.

[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.060]
All right.

[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.520]
Thank you so much.

[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.440]
Hank Williams Jr.

[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:56.920]
You got it?

[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.000]
Hank Williams Jr.

[01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.120]
He's got a date right now.

[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.880]
He'll end cuppy singers.

[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.200]
They're all about your red necks.

[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.380]
All end of Hill, Billy.

[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.700]
See, the people in deep south probably ought to be very upset.

[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.200]
About this whole red necky thing.

[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.220]
And something to hop it right now.

[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:11.640]
No, sir.

[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:17.700]
I look at good times as to blacks as to like he hallowed no shows were to southerners.

[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:18.840]
Right.

[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.260]
See what I'm saying?

[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.860]
They create this ugly nasty stereotype.

[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.780]
Although in the case of southerners, it happens generally speaking to be true.

[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:27.460]
You know what I mean?

[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:28.660]
Yeah.

[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.220]
I don't, y'all come back now.

[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.780]
Y'all come back to two-ed.

[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.760]
Daniel Carver.

[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.600]
Who the hell is that?

[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:35.240]
No idea.

[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.020]
To Daniel Carver.

[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:37.720]
Do you know who that is?

[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.440]
Never heard of it.

[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.120]
I'm asking Josh now.

[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.180]
No, I don't.

[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.240]
Daniel Carver.

[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.460]
Maybe we'll have to look that.

[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.380]
I'll put it on there anyway.

[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.720]
Some of them must know who's watching.

[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.280]
Washington Carver.

[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.160]
It means Danny Glover.

[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.660]
All he knows seems to redneck you to me.

[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.420]
5670560.

[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.120]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:53.860]
We're 10 minutes away.

[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:58.080]
I think we've done magnificently well to like keep on an even Howard Kills so far.

[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.820]
Which of these people best fits the description the ultimate red neck?

[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.020]
George W. Bush 91.

[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.660]

Terry Bowton's moving up.

[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.180]
I told you he's moving up real slowly but deliberately.

[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.480]
Steve's Burr is also got eight.

Why do they always do that?

[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:37.300]
What was the deal with it?

[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:37.980]
That was his trademark.

[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.280]
Always dressed in black.

[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.420]

Yes, sir.

[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:18.440]
Hey, that Daniel Carver is the past president of a coup-clutch plan for a lot of time ago.

[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.100]
He's been on the Howard Stern as a regular for a while.

[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.580]
He's got a coup-clutch plan.

[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.220]
Oh, go ahead.

[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:24.820]
Yeah.

[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:25.820]
Next, I got one.

[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.660]
How about Billy Carter?

[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.440]
Billy Carter was good.

[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.720]
I don't forget.

[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:31.900]
Will it be ripped?

[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.640]
Billy Carter is good.

[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.760]
He was a real bastard.

[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.100]
I can't say that anymore.

[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.660]
It says Carver called in movie reviews on the Howard Stern Show.

[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:43.620]
Wow.

[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:50.180]
Eight minutes in counting, speaking of Howard Stern, speaking of the ratings coming out, speaking

[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.180]
of...

[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:56.980]
The pressure that's building on the self-loader radio market, or I should say what's left of

[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.100]
it.

[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.580]
After a clear channel of just his devastating, not just with a Stern dropping, but I mean,

[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.860]
they've dropped a big bomb, and even Mo never dropped a bomb quite like this.

[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.720]
Remember Mo dropping a bomb?

[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.620]
Better probably play that a few times today, okay.

[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.680]
And by the way, to the losers on Cloudy Channel?

[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:13.980]
Yeah.

[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.180]
Give it, didn't work.

[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:17.540]
Oh.

[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.000]
Anyway, it's not even worth listening to, you know.

[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.080]
But better watch it.

[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:21.900]
Payback's a bitch.

[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:22.580]
It's coming.

[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:23.440]
It's coming.

[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:23.940]
Right.

[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.560]
He had nothing to do with any of that, of course, but it's coming.

[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:27.640]
Of course.

[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:29.140]
WQM, hello.

[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.160]
I think the fundamentalist of all he found to figure no Sama been lied and to get things rolling.

[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:36.400]
Okay.

[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:38.780]
Anyway, that's it.

[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:39.700]
Okay, thanks.

[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:40.900]
Oshama Yamama.

[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.960]
Well, the article suggests maybe even Wal-Martinists, if that's the case, then they would agree.

[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:51.800]
Because it wants to radio-tag its stock, thereby exposing human-kindity mark of the beast.

[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.080]
Oh, this article is really good.

[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.740]
In fact, I might just have to go ahead and put it on our website for later on today or maybe tomorrow.

[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.120]
Whatever.

[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:58.960]
Don't let me forget.

[01:04:59.260 --> 01:04:59.380]
Okay.

[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:08.000]
Look for the QM van Noondil one today and build usury motors at 300 Almeria Avenue and Coral Gables.

[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:08.680]
You know where that is?

[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.020]
Never heard of it.

[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.000]
I never heard of it either.

[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.380]
Almeria Avenue and a Gable.

[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.520]
Stop by to pick up your parent tickets to see the Marlin and Dodger game next Tuesday.

[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.520]
courtesy of the real yellow pages from Bell Sol.

[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.680]
I bet you McGill will be there.

[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:20.780]
Okay.

[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:23.620]
Well, he don't need to be there today because you got muffin clearance both.

[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.280]
They're going to be racing in with the pages from the, oh, it's going to be quite a scene.

[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.060]
Get your gas mask on because I have a feeling either way no matter what happens.

[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.840]
There are going to be a lot of aromas in the year.

[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.300]
WQM, hello.

[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:40.760]
Hey, can you still play the Mickey Mouse thing with?

[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:41.520]
I know!

[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:42.580]
Yeah, sure.

[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:43.900]
You could play that?

[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:44.360]
Yeah.

[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.180]
Okay.

[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.140]
We can still play it.

[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:47.760]
WQM, hello.

[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.640]
That's not like a higher palli guy, didn't it?

[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.180]
WQM, hello.

[01:05:52.440 --> 01:06:01.140]
Neil, you said that guy took my, uh, the Billy Carter one, but Billy Carter, that's the first face that I saw when you said the typical redneck with Billy Carter.

[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.700]
Well, let me ask you this, how about Jimmy Carter?

[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.440]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:04.280]
He's pretty red, he's looking.

[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.580]
Yeah, I got a little bit.

[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:06.340]
Right.

[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:07.460]
How about Jerry Jones?

[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.560]
Jerry Jones is fabulous, boy.

[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.340]
Why hate his guts?

[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:11.460]
I hate him too.

[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.600]
Every time Dallas loses, I just squeeze myself.

[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.340]
I get so excited.

[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.200]
It's Sam Elliott's kind of redneck too.

[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.280]
A little bit.

[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.840]
All right, that's all I got, Neil.

[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.400]
Thanks, Pally.

[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.120]
Pull out your head.

[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:20.660]
See ya.

[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.340]
Sam Elliott, Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys.

[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.460]
That was Cowboys, man.

[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.360]
They're gonna really, they're gonna turn it around, man.

[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:27.840]
You know what?

[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.360]
They did kinda turn it around.

[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.380]
Turned water red.

[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:33.580]
Redcum.

[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.680]
That's of course after Trateman was safely gone from the team.

[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.940]
Pound 5, 60 on the 18 team for Ryzen Wireless Line.

[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.820]
I don't believe any of them rumors about Troy, do I?

[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:44.440]
Yes.

[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.700]
Oh, Troy Stratford.

[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:47.780]
WQM, hello.

[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:49.300]
Hello.

[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.180]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.280]
Hello.

[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:52.900]
Let me say it again.

[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:53.240]
Hello.

[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:54.820]
Hey, Neil, how are you doing?

[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:55.440]
All right.

[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.980]
I think the mad dog's a little redneck.

[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.860]
He's a little on the redneck, he's sad, but he's from Solon, Ohio.

[01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.100]
So what do you expect, you know?

[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:03.580]
We don't want to put the mad dog on there.

[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.260]
We don't want to trash the mad dog, do we?

[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:05.400]
No.

[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:05.860]
No way.

[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.060]
He tends to be on the redneck, he's sad.

[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.320]
That's just a act.

[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.740]
He's a real sophisticated city slicker.

[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:13.760]
Don't let him fool you for woman.

[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.780]
All that crap about the green lizards and all of the bull crap.

[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.280]
But, oh, yeah.

[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.500]
That's all just a joke thing.

[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.480]
Just like his supportive president Bush, don't believe that for one second.

[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.600]
26 past 11 at 560 WQM.

[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.680]
We are coming to that moment.

[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:32.880]
And in fact, my sphincter has just tightened ever so slightly.

[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.560]
I don't know if we can still say that.

[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.340]
I've mentioned that muffin clearance is they're squirming in their chairs right now.

[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.380]
They're squirming in their seats.

[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.840]
Their sphincters are tightening ever so gradually.

[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.280]
Don't you think?

[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:53.140]
And of course, in Duf's case, 26 after 11 at 560 WQM.

[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.220]
Mother's Day is right around the corner.

[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.900]
If you're looking for a really great gift for mom to show her just how creative and thoughtful you can be.

[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.200]
Santa Rape from Monteni Bear made just for her.

[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.760]
Like the mama's boy bear with heart-shaped mom tattoo.

[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.480]
Or the new mom for president bear.

[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.640]
A friendly bear, council's going to take your call right now at 1-800-829 Bear.

[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.380]
And help you tailor a bear just for your mom, your wife or grandma, or all of the above.

[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:18.460]
They've got over 100 bears, each handcrafted in Vermont, and guaranteed for life, delivered with free gourmet candy and a gift card.

[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.840]
Dad, it's your job to get a gift from the kids and the mother and cub set is a perfect idea.

[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.620]
Because you can choose any number of cubs and personalize each one with its own different name.

[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.900]
Sending a Vermont teddy bear is the creative alternative to sending flowers which are dead in just a matter of hours.

[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.620]
And you'll keep that little bear forever.

[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:37.740]
Call 1-800-829 Bear or shop online at VermontTeddyBare.com.

[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:42.080]
Be sure and tell him that Neo reported you call 1-800-829-V-E-A-R.

[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:48.100]
My, my, and local, here's sports video 560-C-A-M.

[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.060]
Comet Jeff Oxworthy has finally gotten a new act.

[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:57.640]
That's right, he's changed his name and has a brand new CD.

[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.400]
It's Jeff Arfoxworthy's, you might be an infidel.

[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:05.740]
We are doing it! You know where I live, we know how to spot an infidel.

[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.420]
If you're a car in your house, both have a roof.

[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.820]
You might be an infidel.

[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.840]
Jeff Arfoxworthy's, you might be an infidel.

[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:21.340]
It's taking middle eastern countries by storm with weapons of massively funny material.

[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:28.680]
If you've ever seen a woman's ankles in public, you might be an infidel.

[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.580]
He's more hilarious than the former Iraqi minister of information.

[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:33.920]
He's Jeff Arfoxworthy.

[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:42.400]
If newscasters don't have to practice pronouncing your name, you might be an infidel.

[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:50.980]
If you've never stolen a 5,000-year-old relic from a national newslead, you might be an infidel.

[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:52.480]
You might be an infidel.

[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.640]
The new comedy CD from Jeff Arfoxworthy.

[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.640]
Available at the 60-foot deep crater that used to be the Baghdad Best Buy.

[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.620]
I don't see any numbers coming over yet.

[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:05.940]
Nobody's coming right now.

[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.820]
Oh my god, you have to be kidding me.

[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:12.400]
What are we going to do now?

[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:12.700]
Wait.

[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:17.940]
Time's up.

[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.200]
Oh, look at that.

[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.960]
Do you think the US made a mistake getting involved with the war in Iraq?

[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.460]
24% in March said yes.

[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.800]
Now 48% in Adamistake 46.

[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.520]
In fact, see, and I had a poll on this morning.

[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.020]
I don't know the exact number.

[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.900]
I probably shouldn't say it, but it was astonishing.

[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.180]
Should the US withdraw all of its troops immediately?

[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.800]
I think it was like 57% said yes, and 36% said no.

[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.740]
How do you like that?

[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.260]
I hear something coming over the machine.

[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.300]
What? How do you know that?

[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:48.740]
I don't know.

[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.880]
What's the fact that I'm too direct?

[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.980]
Did you send it?

[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:51.340]
No.

[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.780]
Or I'll send it direct from another machine, huh?

[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.060]
Oh my god.

[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:57.520]
No.

[01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.220]
What is this?

[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.360]
Just swill.

[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.660]
How about a poll?

[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.860]
Oh, gee, that's bad.

[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.860]
Don't be doing that. Don't be giving me a false alarm.

[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:05.580]
Oh my god.

[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.520]
Let's try it again.

[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:11.860]
No.

[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:12.200]
Oh, no.

[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:13.560]
Damn it.

[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.680]
Okay, well, we'll just continue.

[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.860]
I just can't wait to see the 12 pluses what we get first,

[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:21.620]
which is like everybody who listens, little kids over the age of 12,

[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.500]
teenagers, people over the age of 100,

[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.740]
which nobody wants, you know, people like me.

[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.120]
But it's going to be really interesting to see WBGG.

[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.060]
And if there are other cheap channel stations too,

[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:34.660]
whether this, whether the South Florida people will really woke up

[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.340]
and made a statement,

[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.160]
and sure we'd like to benefit some from it.

[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.720]
We know we'd like to benefit a lot as much as we can,

[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.900]
but that's not the point.

[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.720]
The point is you've got a chance to make a statement,

[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.700]
and we'll see if they did or not.

[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.800]
The rest people I don't think will go anywhere.

[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.380]
It's like a religion.

[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.800]
Line 9 WQA.

[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:53.760]
Not there.

[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.960]
I thought Line 9 was like a religion they never hung up.

[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:56.720]
Did you think?

[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:57.960]
I thought so.

[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.120]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:00.400]
Yeah, I'm an Agen.

[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.220]
Pretty good, pal.

[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.000]
Hey, it is Channel 10.

[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.040]
We've got to get some extra, extra wide angle cameras.

[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.200]
I heard that Paul Castro homo is going to be doing sports jam live

[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.420]
with Mandage next year.

[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.520]
Oh, my God.

[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.000]
Wow.

[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.780]
I mean, this guy is the radio whore, gives a new mention.

[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.840]
I wonder who's material he's going to be using on that show.

[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.260]
Oh, yeah, he, I heard something guy called me the other day,

[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.520]
and he said, I come here using the old meals of Samoos back in the day.

[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.020]
Hey, Pally, all that stuff.

[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:27.940]
Anyhow, up on him.

[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.080]
Thanks for the Spirey-Poor Pally.

[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:31.580]
Good job.

[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.120]
Castor Nova.

[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.280]
Now that'll be, like I said, the monkey is off his fat back.

[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.800]
You know, I have no excuses no more.

[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.740]
You know, well, you're up against Howard Stern.

[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.100]
You know, well, that was, you know, that was a point.

[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:44.220]
Right.

[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.960]
Other than the fact that Paul and Old Ron, they're

[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.020]
show sucked and they used everybody else's material.

[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:52.140]
But now it's going to be interesting to see if Zeta goes zooming up there or not.

[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:52.820]
I'm waiting still.

[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.080]
Do you fact me something else?

[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:55.220]
Yeah, but nothing.

[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:56.500]
Why not?

[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.300]
Where are they?

[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.220]
I don't know.

[01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:58.840]
Oh, no.

[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.440]
She's stew says this crackdown on shows like yours is not about cleaning up anything.

[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.140]
It's politics.

[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.020]
Anyone that's been targeted by the Republicans know exactly what's going on.

[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.680]
They've cut overtime paying, neglected military pay off, fought the minimum wage,

[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.820]
and worth of all throwing good people into prison, example Tommy Chong.

[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:19.900]
Thank you, sirs stew.

[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.160]
Well, still, what can I tell you?

[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:23.960]
Thank you, stew.

[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.840]
What are we going to do without stew?

[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.140]
Just sit here and stew, huh?

[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.180]
In our own cases.

[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:31.860]
Right.

[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.

[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.480]
Let's take a look at that.

[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.880]
I'm a little bit here because usually when it gets to be that magic moment,

[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.120]
they come racing in with a whole pile, you know.

[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.320]
But maybe they're like falling all over each other, running into each other,

[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:47.180]
or maybe they have some kind of a technical glitch over there, you know.

[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.540]
That would be the first time.

[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.520]
That would be bad.

[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.820]
That would be really bad after this big buildup.

[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.420]
I don't think we could emotionally handle it.

[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.080]
We'd have to take off right now.

[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.480]
Just leave some dead air till two o'clock.

[01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:58.060]
There's stuff.

[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.720]
Is he smiling or frowning?

[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.980]
Is he got a big smile on his push?

[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.020]
He says, we look good.

[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.080]
We look good.

[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.140]
Well, we're not asking that.

[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:06.780]
We know it.

[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.140]
Jeez.

[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.300]
He said to Josh.

[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.960]
Josh, why were you like to slip out of there real quiet and just, you know,

[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.760]
the back gets it there.

[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.040]
I go right down to the stairs.

[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.120]
12 plus coming out yet.

[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.440]
12 plus is coming out.

[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:16.940]
We look good.

[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:17.800]
We look good.

[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.520]
How do you like that?

[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.180]
In fact, let me make a little bit of prediction right now.

[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:22.080]
I don't want to get carried away.

[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.320]
But we're number something.

[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.320]
All right.

[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.820]
We don't know what that's all it can.

[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:29.480]
Tell them what you just said.

[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:30.620]
Something.

[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.480]
The midday is how good.

[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.560]
The mid days look good.

[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:34.760]
Oh, the mid days look good.

[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.520]
Oh, well, I saw.

[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.180]
I mean, that's all we care about immediately.

[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.360]
We would like to see everybody on the station do great because we get extra bonus money.

[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.420]
Plus we like most of the people on the station.

[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.040]
Don't we?

[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:43.640]
Absolutely.

[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.740]
In fact, we like just about all of the people on the station.

[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.240]
We wish them nothing but the very best because we're team players.

[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:48.980]
We like to vote.

[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:49.500]
We vote.

[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.180]
We vote everybody.

[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:50.780]
I beg your pardon.

[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:51.800]
I said, we like mo.

[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:52.520]
Stub them.

[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.060]
Oh, that's bad.

[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:58.520]
And it.

[01:14:58.700 --> 01:14:59.060]
Yeah.

[01:14:59.340 --> 01:14:59.580]
Okay.

[01:14:59.660 --> 01:14:59.960]
We'll see.

[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.320]
You said it's coming by.

[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.640]
I hear like little squealing in my.

[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.200]
I got my fax machine there.

[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.400]
Man, it's all greased up.

[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.700]
And I got a ton of paper in here.

[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.740]
And I got that new thing in there.

[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.340]
What is it called?

[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.020]
The new drum.

[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.160]
I'm beating on it right now.

[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:13.780]
That new drum.

[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.500]
Just like Jean Cooper.

[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.780]
But I do feel a little bit out of the loop.

[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.220]
Well, this is a, he's a loop again.

[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.840]
Okay, let me take a caller to him.

[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.220]
Wait for this.

[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.840]
That way can't do it.

[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:26.840]
Can't do it.

[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:27.660]
Here we go.

[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.780]
I hear the first page starting to like.

[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:34.660]
All my, all my, all my, all my, all my, all my, all my, my, my, my, my.

[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:38.860]
Oh my God.

[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.640]
Oh my God.

[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:48.640]
Oh my God.

[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:48.640]

[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:48.640]

[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:48.640]

[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:48.760]
Oh my God.

[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:48.760]

[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:48.960]
Wait a minute.

[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:51.240]
Now let me just take a look back.

[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:51.540]
Okay.

[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.440]
12 plus, they actually went up a little CMQ FM.

[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:56.720]
Holy moly.

[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:57.340]
You know what this is?

[01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.620]
That's what it is.

[01:15:59.040 --> 01:15:59.720]
In the fall book.

[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.640]
Well, I know what they have in the fall book.

[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:03.320]
I don't go that far.

[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.060]
Yeah, I do right here.

[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:04.800]
A five point.

[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.180]
Oh, this is 12 plus.

[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.000]
And now in the winter book, they got a six point.

[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.020]
Oh, man.

[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:09.840]
All right.

[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.760]
Hoochie, Koochie stuff.

[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:13.200]
It's the CDA cruise factor coming home to Roost again.

[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:14.560]
Power.

[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.320]
Oh, they got to be the kick screw.

[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.000]
He's got to be jumping up and down in the hall, man.

[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.520]
He might attack off or the other way around.

[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:21.720]
Power.

[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:22.640]
4.6.

[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.500]
Number four in a fall.

[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.860]
They went up to 5.5.

[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:25.500]
They're number two.

[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:26.820]
We're number two at power.

[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.260]
This is 12 plus.

[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.540]
Keep in mind, we aren't going to be anywhere in the first couple of pages here.

[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.940]
But I will tell you this.

[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:34.540]
The number to beat.

[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.420]
The target is to beat a two one for the entire station.

[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.580]
I OD 282-3.

[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.880]
That's not a good thing to see.

[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:41.640]
Q-WAM.

[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.680]
Two six in a fall.

[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.520]
Two one in a winter.

[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.140]
That's bad.

[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.540]
That is not good to see at all.

[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.340]
That is not a good thing to see.

[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.000]
Two six to a two one.

[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:51.800]
Holy moly.

[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.320]
Well, we had a two one in the last trend.

[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.520]
Two said it means we're flat.

[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:59.460]
Somebody somewhere is not getting a job done on this radio station.

[01:16:59.700 --> 01:16:59.780]
Okay.

[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:00.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:01.780]
Could be us.

[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:02.420]
Could be.

[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:03.960]
Not according to dogs.

[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:05.260]
Well, what did dogs say?

[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.060]
He said we done good.

[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:06.820]
He said we look good.

[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:07.440]
Well, let's take a look.

[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:07.780]
Huh?

[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:10.180]
He said we look good by we.

[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:11.260]
He means this show.

[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:12.700]
Well, maybe he's talking in French.

[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.700]
Maybe he just said we we.

[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.780]
Which you can't say that anymore.

[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.920]
By the way, don't they say we we.

[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:17.880]
Hot 105.

[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:18.940]
Number one.

[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.860]
They were tied with radio on more last time.

[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.240]
But now they went from a 5-2 to a 6.6.

[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.160]
This is in the morning.

[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.680]
Persons 12 plus hot 105.

[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:27.960]
Radio Amour.

[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:28.820]
Grapen down.

[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.460]
Maybe they actually found some people who speak English.

[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.220]
But I don't think so.

[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:32.980]
Four five two to a four eight.

[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.700]
CMQ FM from a 3.5 in the morning to a 4.7.

[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.880]
From number 13 number three.

[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:39.900]
I want an investigation.

[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.200]
Don't you?

[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:42.820]
Sure.

[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:43.160]
Why not?

[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:43.880]
Don't you?

[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:47.500]
Now let's see if we can find 12 plus.

[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:48.680]
Who else do we care about?

[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.660]
Where is WBGG in the morning?

[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.280]
Where is WBGG?

[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.500]
From a 4.3 to a 2.7.

[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:56.460]
From 4 to 18.

[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:58.120]
That's not as bad as it should be.

[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:58.760]
You know what?

[01:17:58.940 --> 01:17:59.980]
No, I said one five.

[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.060]
Although we don't see we don't have the monthly's yet.

[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.700]
When we extrapolate the monthly's in a few days.

[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.280]
They will see what they did in March.

[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.300]
It's going to be a big point something.

[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.660]
It is going to be catastrophic.

[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.980]
I don't see a Zeta on here.

[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:14.460]
Do you?

[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:16.600]
Well, I mean, I really like how it is.

[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.640]
I don't see anything.

[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:20.920]
Oh, look at that.

[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:21.980]
Two eight to a two eight.

[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.580]
So I don't understand Paul and Old Ron.

[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.940]
How it's off for a month of this deal?

[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.080]
And you guys ain't going nowhere.

[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.900]
At least not in the overall.

[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.780]
What a pages are just piling up here.

[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.880]
Man, I got piles from looking at this.

[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.580]
I'm in a day.

[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.320]
So let's see.

[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.080]
Did we see what Mo had yet here in the morning?

[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.540]
Or did I not do that yet?

[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:43.840]
I don't think so.

[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.020]
Let's do this one here.

[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:45.920]
It's very embarrassing.

[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.800]
A two four to a one eight.

[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.320]
Oh, my God.

[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.060]
Oh, my God.

[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.300]
That morning's show just blows, man.

[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:53.120]
Wow.

[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:55.540]
Holy moly.

[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:57.180]
Midday.

[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:57.680]
Look at that.

[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.780]
12 plus IOT went from a three six to a four one from book to book.

[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:01.940]
They're moving on up.

[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.800]
So they're not punishing the clear channel state.

[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.380]
And that's obvious.

[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:05.300]
No chance.

[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.740]
CMQ FM 6th read was seven five in midday.

[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.180]
12 plus.

[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:08.960]
That's bad.

[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.040]
That is brutal.

[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.400]
QM 3 out of a three five.

[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.080]
And let's see in the last.

[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:17.180]
Well, I think good because we had in the last trend.

[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.020]
I think we had a three.

[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.660]
Oh, I don't know what we had.

[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.060]
What do we have George?

[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:21.500]
I don't know.

[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:22.980]
A three four.

[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.480]
So we'll see when that when I saw Shuffle's out.

[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.340]
Okay, where I'm shuffling all these pages right now.

[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.360]
We'll see what the afternoon did.

[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.540]
Then we'll get the real demographics.

[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.860]
The living and breathing people.

[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.300]
Not the Altecokers like me.

[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:33.980]
And then we'll see.

[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.580]
Then we'll see who's going to be on the ear.

[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.020]
And then we'll see.

[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:01.020]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:01.980]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:01.980]

[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:01.980]

[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:01.980]

[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:01.980]

[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:02.000]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:02.000]

[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:02.000]

[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:02.000]

[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:02.000]

[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:02.060]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:02.320]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:02.580]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:03.140]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:03.800]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.320]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:05.240]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:05.440]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:05.440]

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:05.440]

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:05.440]

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:05.440]

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:05.440]

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:05.440]

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:05.560]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:16.620]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:16.780]

[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:18.380]
And then we'll see.

[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:18.380]

[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.520]
And then we'll see這邊.

[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:19.520]

[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:28.980]
And then I'll see this tall building.

[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:33.540]
And then 저희가 will tell us who chose us.

[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:36.520]
And point like that!

[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.940]
Why you might wanna smack you?

[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.960]
Let's see, I know my sluts track you.

[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.840]
I know it.

[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.500]
But unlike that you,

[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:52.100]
You still got a job.

[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:58.940]
I feel just like that you are my kid brother.

[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.060]
And one year later.

[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.420]
That's why you are so unbind!

[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:07.580]
That's it!

[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:08.740]
That's it!

[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:16.240]
Okay, go, go, go, go!

[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.960]
Go, go, go, go!

[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.200]
Go, go, go, go!

[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:29.800]
I'm on a show, have fun with you!

[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.200]
In the Kewmai!

[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.340]
Absolutely!

[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.140]
It's wake till it's over!

[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.260]
Alright, that's enough!

[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.380]
It's 1147, look at this overall!

[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:45.140]
Then 2554 WQM number two, how do you like that?

[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.040]
Yeah, pretty impressive.

[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.300]
You sound very depressed.

[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.240]
No, no, it's more impressive than that.

[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.880]
Once we extrapolate it.

[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.340]
What does that mean?

[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:57.420]
Our midday number.

[01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.260]
2554?

[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.040]
Right, which isn't come across you.

[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:01.620]
Don't tell me.

[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.060]
It's on its way, I'm not going to tell you nothing.

[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.880]
That would be bad to spural it for me.

[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.660]
So obviously we didn't quite make CMQ FM, right?

[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.400]
Well, it's so intense.

[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.600]
It's very close, it's nippin' talk.

[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.080]
It's nose to nose.

[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.780]
I see that mole by the way blows.

[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.380]
I mean, can I say that?

[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:20.060]
Look at the mornings in men 25 to 54.

[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.680]
That's our key target demographic.

[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:26.820]
4.8 in the fall rating book and now a 4.2.

[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:28.320]
Hmm.

[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.060]
Giving new meaning to the word fall.

[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:32.620]
Oh, wait, no, we got it.

[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.600]
What are you talking about?

[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.120]
This is a miracle, are you crazy?

[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.360]
Are you out of your mind?

[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.140]
We got it, man.

[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:39.360]
This is a miracle.

[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:40.860]
I'll be here right now.

[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.960]
Yeah, I'll make the record.

[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.180]
This is one of the great miracles in the history of mankind.

[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.600]
We're number one, damn it.

[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.340]
Oh, you just played that.

[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:50.700]
I did do the break at 40 to 9.

[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:51.720]
Yeah.

[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.380]
Okay, I didn't cross it out because I've busy doing all this other stuff over here, you know?

[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.640]
With my crack staff, which I don't have.

[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:03.120]
WCMQFM in midday had a 7.9 share in astronomical number.

[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:08.000]
WQM midday 10 to 3 had a 7.8, which means from 10 to 2.

[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.520]
And of course that all depends on what we see with that number in the afternoon, right?

[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:11.400]
Right.

[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.380]
And since you already know what the number is in the afternoon, but you're just not telling me.

[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:16.760]
Don't you already know?

[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.660]
Well, look at that number one of the 6.1.

[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:24.200]
But it looks like, oh yeah, no sweat, right?

[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:24.960]
Right.

[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.480]
Well, I don't have a copy anymore, so I can't read along with you.

[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.180]
Well, then make a difference because all we need is like a fraction to, uh,

[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.200]
eke out a win over CMQFM.

[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:33.940]
Well, it was go up at least half a point.

[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:37.680]
I told you that we at least have a point in the extrapolation and the extrapolations.

[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.200]
That's right.

[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.340]
So I think it's safe to say we're number one, damn it.

[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.620]
IOD went from a 4.8 to a 6.4.

[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.100]
So anybody able to idea that they're punishing the tea channel stations.

[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.400]
I sure I told you they wouldn't.

[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.540]
They won't do it.

[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:58.780]
And although, of course, quite frankly, how much of a crossover is the between the people who listen to Howard Stern and IOD, for example?

[01:23:58.940 --> 01:23:59.480]
How many people?

[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.480]
About 30, man.

[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:02.900]
Hey, you want these 18 to 34s?

[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:03.780]
I'm factored over right now.

[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:04.980]
Sure, I want it all, man.

[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.200]
I want it all.

[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.280]
Or not my way.

[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.380]
I want my hands on it.

[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.520]
I'm just pretty darn shocked, and so should the Duffa to be running around squeezing, uh,

[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.500]
squeezing clearance as parts right about now.

[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.420]
And probably is.

[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.320]
Wouldn't you think?

[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.900]
Now what about the afternoon number one?

[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:21.680]
Right.

[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:23.940]
So number one in midday, number one in the afternoon.

[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.440]
Morning, though, number seven, dropping from a tie for fourth to number seven.

[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:28.280]
Percipetous drop.

[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:29.520]
Oh, boy.

[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.400]
Is all I can say.

[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.960]
Guess howard people didn't go there.

[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.720]
Yeah, we thought that some of the Howard people might go to our Howard.

[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.720]
Now, here's a guy that says a facture.

[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.960]
Could you please give us the most important rating number for nights on magic one or two points?

[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:41.240]
Seven.

[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:44.420]
Mr. Tom Kennedy was unsurprisingly, unsurmoniously blown out.

[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.280]
Hosed at the seven of midnight shift for 10 years.

[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.120]
I hope that the polls of Jefferson probably, Mr. Bob Hamilton, have the worst book and they

[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.380]
contact some filthy, painful jockeach for the treatment of Mr. Kennedy.

[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:55.100]
Thank you, sir.

[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:55.540]
You demand.

[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:57.620]
And of course, it's probably from time and sub, wouldn't you think?

[01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.640]
No, he was not that kind of guy.

[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:00.960]
You isn't?

[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:01.560]
No, he's not.

[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:01.880]
Well, that's right.

[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:02.640]
He used to work with us.

[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:03.340]
He's a friend of us.

[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:04.180]
He's a good guy.

[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:04.620]
Right.

[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:11.120]
So again, other reason to hate Bob Hamilton in those, uh, class holes over there at the magic one or two points seven.

[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:14.300]
We like our buddy, Ricky Tiki, Sean, for his sake, we hope he's okay.

[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:14.860]
You know what I mean?

[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.120]
But other than that, so nights, this guy wants your 2554.

[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:21.180]
That's their, uh, well, we got men.

[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:21.600]
Okay.

[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.560]
I don't know about persons.

[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.480]
Men 2554.

[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:25.220]
Magic.

[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:25.880]
Uh-oh.

[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.120]
Bad news from a 3.0.

[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.700]
Oh, 4.1.

[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.580]
From 15th to number eight.

[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.120]
I have no idea when Tom Kennedy got blown out over there.

[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:34.760]
What month it was.

[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.740]
It said we don't have the monkeys.

[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.840]
We won't have for a couple more days.

[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.000]
But they went up actually at night.

[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.640]
Magic one or two point seven.

[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:43.220]
How do you like that?

[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.960]
So we just do it the best we can.

[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.920]
I feel like we've pulled off a major miracle here, you know what?

[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.920]
The station, in spite of a precipitous drop in a morning show, rhymes with Mo and below.

[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:55.700]
Absolutely.

[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.960]
Uh, we still between the 10 a.m. and 7 p.m.

[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.440]
Do a magnificent job.

[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.980]
If you ask us, as we pet ourselves on the back and say,

[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:04.440]
we're number one.

[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.500]
We set the number one in after seven o'clock.

[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:07.740]
And that's the, uh, pantheon.

[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.240]
Oh, I never mentioned what the panthers had.

[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.000]
You don't want to know.

[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:10.780]
Well, I don't care.

[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.600]
I can tell you in 12 plus what they had already looked that up.

[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.480]
As I'm looking on a 85 page for this one, for this number.

[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:23.200]
We had a one from a 1.8 in the fall, which is also panthers to a 0.8 at night in 12 plus.

[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.040]
In other words, nobody listens to panther hockey on a radio.

[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:27.940]
Sorry about that.

[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:32.220]
Now, men 25 54, 3.5 in a fall, 2.3 at night.

[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:33.860]
So the night times took a dump.

[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:35.000]
The mornings took a dump.

[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.040]
10 a.m. to 7 p.m. were just fine.

[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.140]
We're fine.

[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.280]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:39.700]
Wow.

[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:40.200]
See?

[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.780]
Well, that's okay.

[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.160]
Now, let me see what about the thing here.

[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:45.400]
We got all carried away with us.

[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:46.840]
Look at that.

[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:47.920]
Big 106.

[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.920]
They were number one in the fall with a 10.1 share.

[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:52.580]
And now Howard's gone one month of this book.

[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:54.160]
And they're down to number two with a 6.1.

[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.800]
They dropped four full rating points.

[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:58.080]
And again, keep in mind, that's just with March out of this.

[01:26:58.300 --> 01:26:58.520]
Right.

[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:01.200]
When January and February disappear, so are they going to do the same thing.

[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.760]
Now, you think what's stirring a gone for a month?

[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.860]
You think Paul and the old Ron might pick up a little more.

[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.620]
And they picked up a little 4.8 tied for 4 to 5.1.

[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.320]
Number five in the morning.

[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.480]
Nothing that the right home about if he asked me.

[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.520]
I mean, we went from a four, what would we do?

[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.340]
I can't find it.

[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.260]
You stole it.

[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.820]
We went from a 5.8 to a 7.8.

[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.220]
I gave it that.

[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:26.640]
5.8 in the fall when we got really screwed badly to a 7.8 in the end of the fall.

[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:27.120]
25.54.

[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.640]
So where did the audience in the morning go?

[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.620]
CMQ FM when zooming up to number one.

[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:33.540]
Big took a big dump.

[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.720]
Hot 105552 with 6.0.

[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:36.880]
An audio ritmo.

[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:38.240]
4.2 to a 5.4.

[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:40.420]
WSDJ.

[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.700]
Is there anybody speaks English?

[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.060]
Of course.

[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:42.400]
Jesus.

[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:43.140]
K. Christ.

[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:44.280]
Magic in the morning.

[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:45.400]
3.4 to a 3.7.

[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:46.800]
WEDR.

[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.500]
3.837.

[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:48.180]
Flaat.

[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.080]
W.I.O.D. 3.1 to a 3.5.

[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.500]
Men in black.

[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.420]
2.7 to a 3.1.

[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.220]
So this whole business about, oh, we're going to go on a boycott the clear channel stations.

[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.120]
That is not happening at all.

[01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:58.680]
Who's we?

[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.000]
The audience.

[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:01.900]
The software to people who are pissed off.

[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.760]
They don't care if they like the music they like to show their listen.

[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.620]
RFX in the morning.

[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:07.720]
Fought sports.

[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.660]
0.7 to an 0.5.

[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.620]
Oh my god.

[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.080]
Wow.

[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.760]
Holy moly proving that half a point is better than none.

[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:14.700]
Oh, they can do better.

[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:15.620]
They can get a point three.

[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.580]
They're all saying half a loaf.

[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.840]
Half a point is better than none.

[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:19.960]
How much is this going to be more than half a loaf over there today?

[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:20.840]
But that's another story.

[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:24.460]
No, look at this midday 15 to a 2.7.

[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.160]
They're moving up big time in mid days.

[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.700]
That's where they're starting to really inch ahead.

[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.460]
Uh oh, we're in big trouble now.

[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:31.140]
You know what?

[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:31.840]
Yeah.

[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.860]
A big move on Fox sports in a midday.

[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.780]
It must be a Roemi.

[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.600]
All the homies listen to Roemi now.

[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:43.440]
And what about the Fox in the afternoon 0.5 to a 1 point?

[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:43.700]
Oh!

[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.140]
They're starting to make a little bit of a,

[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.220]
it's just enough to give Greg a little of the twitch in his bowels.

[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:48.440]
You know?

[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.280]
Just enough to make his anus start quick in a little bit.

[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:54.880]
Can we say that?

[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:55.740]
Oh, it wasn't on the list.

[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:57.360]
No, it anus.

[01:28:58.140 --> 01:28:59.880]
5 6 7 0 5 6 D.

[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.080]
See how we get totally thrown off our appointed grounds with this crap?

[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:04.640]
Yeah, but it's funny.

[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.920]
I know it's important to watch this what we live and die by in everybody else's industry too.

[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.180]
18 to 34.

[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.040]
Do they want to know this?

[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:11.740]
We sure don't.

[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:13.780]
6 a.m. to midnight.

[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.980]
Power from a 9 5 to a 12 to a 10.

[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.740]
Curry's got to be dancing in the halls right now.

[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:19.800]
Probably would pictures of anus squeaks the ass.

[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.360]
EDR 8 3 up to a 9 6.

[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:23.040]
They're number two.

[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.800]
M.I.V. men in black 7 9 to a 9 4.

[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:26.740]
There's the punishment of clear clear chair.

[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.740]
Oh, yeah, they should live so long.

[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.400]
The audience is so floated.

[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:31.380]
People have got no shame.

[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.700]
5 6 to a 5 8.

[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.360]
Y 100. That's another one went up.

[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.380]
All their stations went up.

[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:38.220]
How one 0 5 5 3 stayed flat.

[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.100]
That's a cock station.

[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.260]
Party radio 5 9 down to a 4 7.

[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:42.080]
Another cock station.

[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.180]
Radio Romance.

[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:43.940]
State flat.

[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.520]
The coast 4 2 to a 4 1.

[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.140]
A cock station.

[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.980]
Radio did mo 2 2 up to a 4.

[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.040]
Oh, does anybody speak English anymore?

[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:50.920]
In that town.

[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.560]
W.S.D.J.

[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.100]
3 7 up to a 4 point.

[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.920]
Oh, man.

[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:57.540]
Zeta.

[01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:58.500]
Look at this.

[01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.540]
18 to 34.

[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.300]
5 0 to a 3 7.

[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.100]
That's not really their demo.

[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.700]
It's their 25 50 fossil rockers.

[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:05.680]
How big a pardon?

[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:07.920]
They got more aided rockers.

[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:09.760]
More agent.

[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:10.080]
Yeah.

[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.760]
Well, okay.

[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:12.540]
So there's the deal.

[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:14.400]
Now what about 18 to 34 in the morning?

[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.200]
I guess we need to look at the big 106.

[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.760]
Because Howard had humongous numbers there.

[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.680]
18 to 34.

[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.780]
Let me see if I can fight it in the 6 to 10 a.m.

[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.080]
Before we do this break.

[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.200]
Power 96.

[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.420]
What do I want?

[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.360]
One to a 4 5.

[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.380]
Oh my God.

[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.260]
They went from number one to a tie for number eight.

[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.020]
And just one month of Howard being off the air.

[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:34.940]
8 1 to a 4 5.

[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.780]
But when the next trend comes up, big 106 is going to be a queen.

[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:39.600]
Queenie and Timon.

[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:39.980]
My.

[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:41.360]
And you call.

[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.520]
This is 4 3 0 5 60.

[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:44.840]
Way to.

[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:45.220]

[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:48.760]
I know.

[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:52.240]
I know.

[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.240]
But it's, I know what I'm talking about.

[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:15.200]
I'm them all so talking about, well, I am.

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.200]

[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:14.220]
grain.

[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.180]
I'm watering you to believe what I say today.

[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.760]
We got shots.

[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:20.580]
We got shots.

[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.280]
I'm about to get a push.

[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:23.300]
Got the job.

[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:25.060]
I'm about to get a push.

[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.060]
I got one.

[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.780]
I'm about to get a push.

[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:28.560]
I don't need one.

[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:29.920]
Change.

[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.240]
I don't need one.

[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.320]
I don't need one.

[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.060]
I don't need one.

[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:36.160]
I don't need one.

[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:36.240]
I don't need one.

[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.020]
Well, I don't have to read the paper,

[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.820]
since I control the news.

[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.620]
It's good to have a bad economy.

[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.920]
That's what the old man said to me.

[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.620]
Go to India and you'll find the job of straighting her high.

[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.460]
To the right of the world, something beats the stupid slow.

[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.780]
Who wants to point it out?

[01:31:59.220 --> 01:31:59.840]
Got the job.

Get him through you fool.

[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:13.780]

[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:21.200]

What is it?

[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:22.900]
Usury?

We got a correction on that.

[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.200]

Usury.

[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:27.840]

[01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:28.200]

[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:28.220]

[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:28.600]
Usury?

[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:29.880]

[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:30.000]
Usury?

[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:38.520]

10.2 share in March in men not too shabby a we'll take it and

[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:17.420]
still might not make number one if that's the mQ thing screws

[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:21.200]
this up the I think they should pay to full bonus just on the

[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:23.300]
principle no matter what the final number is just because

[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:27.640]

[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:30.360]

thanks to us right thanks to us and a mad dog in a

[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.340]
humper all the rest of you people might be setting off some

[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:39.020]

I came here many years ago and learned my ABCs

[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:36.740]

no but I speak English

[01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:52.580]
from 18 at 5.60 wqm so I think I made a mistake here I was adding the men 18

[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:56.340]
plus numbers together with 2554 see what I'm saying and extrapolating the wrong

[01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:00.480]
numbers okay sweeted good marsh but not like what I thought but at any rate

[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:03.960]

[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.660]
damn it and that cute little clearance there we're number two and he takes

[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.380]
all the credit who was gonna write another word in there but I told him we weren't

[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:18.720]
a lot to say it okay I'm sure he was here's I just want to give you this and

[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:21.400]
I'm this is not sour grapes we're delighted with where we are but the

[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.160]
wcm qfm okay speaking of nobody speaking English

[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.500]
they're Qm actually went down from the fall book their average quarter hours

[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:32.380]
there went from number one to six point six to number one to seven point

[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:36.220]
nine a precipitous increase and why you might ask because their length of

[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:39.960]
listenership went from seven hours and 15 minutes a week to nine hours and

[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.780]
50 minutes a week their number one and that which means it's become like a

[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:47.560]
religion ball that must place real good music and yet every time we've been

[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.760]
inquiring what are they play on wcm qfm well uh

[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.340]
latin oldies yeah but but what artist that well nobody seems to know it's the

[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:59.100]
biggest mystery in town like Francisco Arruca same thing nobody knows the

[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:03.000]
trouble we see so that length of listenership really just are kind of

[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.460]
scratch my head and my ass when I take a look at that but that's okay we'll see

[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:10.880]
how it plays out how it falls out it's going to be nip and tuck nose to nose

[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:15.760]
when the whole thing lays out I think we got it I just consulted my I don't

[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.420]
that's you consulted whom my astrologer I see

[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:20.900]

March what is dead I just got through saying that March shot is dead she died just recently

[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:10.840]

[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.300]
clear end of major combat and Iraq Americans have new doubts about the war and doubts about

[01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:44.740]
what the Bush administration said about it just 32% the lowest number ever say Iraq was a threat

[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:49.760]
that required immediate military action a year ago oh I know why the a man 18 plus wasn't so great

[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:55.700]
because 18 to 34 the whole station took a just die that what that was the deal I'm sorry to stick

[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:58.940]
that in there but it's just just don't I mean like a little light bulb to light up my head

[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.660]
less than half 47% now say the US did the right thing by taking military action in Iraq

[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:10.080]
lowest support recorded in CBS poll since the war began they're growing concerns about the long

[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:15.240]
term impact of the war now 41% think they were increased the threat of terrorism against the US 71

[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:19.540]
percent of the administration to say the administration policies abortion the US image in the

[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:25.180]
Arab world no shmit the continued intensity in the fighting in Iraq surprise many Americans and

[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:29.420]
Americans believe it also surprised the Bush administration 44% said that fighting there has

[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:34.040]
been harder than the person they expected 67% say it's been harder than the administration expected

[01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:38.460]
nearly half say the war in Iraq was a mistake a fighting similar to the public's

[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:42.760]
assessment of Vietnam wars measured by the Gallup pool in 1968 how do you like that

[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:48.540]
and that number is increasing every minute of every day the public's assessments of the

[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:53.540]
Bush administration decision making before and after the war are also negative 7 and 10

[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:57.440]
don't believe the administration claimed that the decision to war was made in March 2003

[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:03.080]
and say the Bush administration decided to go to war earlier than that 70% and 61% believe the

[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:07.120]
administration did not try hard enough to reach a diplomatic solution before going to war in Iraq a

[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:12.480]
reversal of the public belief last year during the war for now only 31% believe the administration

[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:17.000]
has a clear plan to turn over power in Iraq 32% say it has a clear plan to rebuild the country

[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:23.280]
in other words one third say that you turn and the rest are on to them now that sounds promising

[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:29.220]
I'll tell you what else sounds promising too well maybe what the congressional black caucus hopes

[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:33.160]

[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:58.440]
receive the request Nader's maintained that he will not withdraw his candidacy saying that he would

[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:03.260]
disappoint those voters he's asking for support but the good news is he has yet to qualify for

[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:16.400]

[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.220]
of the dolphins is the number one redneck of onoatement that's one and another one the number one

[01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:24.680]
of all time has to be baseball player Randy Johnson well we'll put him both on there is zak Thomas

[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.500]
he's real redneckie it says when defining a redneck you choose the person you can picture walking

[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:33.560]
around barefoot drinking a middle of high life out of the can and screaming at his wife from his

[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:38.820]

[01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:00.920]
everything that we do no it's important stuff man now i would say as i kind of like take a breath

[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:05.100]
here and that thing about the eighteen to thirty four men i hope that uh what i don't what do they know

[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:08.980]
that's the reason that that they really shouldn't panic so much about the many teen plus thing

[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:12.800]
we set only anything anyway but the eighteen to thirty four really distorts those numbers because we

[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:18.140]
we didn't guide the also uh they just vanished it's like eighteen to thirty four people just took

[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:23.960]
their a m radio isn't just the schmit can't it maybe they just followed my advice huh it's i've

[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:29.280]
been told them that and maybe they'll listen too carefully i don't know but we don't really

[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.420]
you know that's not the big deal as a matter of fact if that's the case if that's the case

[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:39.400]
in like thirty five to fifty four we must have gone through the roof we must have had a humongous

[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:45.400]
gigantic throbbing thirty five to fifty four number because eighteen to thirty four includes

[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:48.620]

[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:40.960]
George W. Bush 151 Toby Keith 45 there ain't no contest. It's the redneck and chief. Maybe that's what we got

[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:47.460]
Of course we had Jimmy Carter who was redneckie we had Lyndon Johnson. He was real redneckie. Also got us into a real bad war

[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:56.300]
One other redneckie prison swivel Harry Truman wasn't redneck. He was a farmer from Kansas. Right real plain spoken farmer

[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:57.700]
Give me hell Harry. Downhill

What's this fact here from Michelle FYI on Daniel Carver he was one of our oh he is one of Howard's Jones regulars

[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:33.040]
Especially as being the in the KKK. I think he's a grand ragged or something like that. You're called to keep him on

[02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:38.400]
Why? You're called to keep him on. Oh

[02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:43.960]
Well, why I don't know what that means. I mean what about here put him on air people want to vote for him

[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:47.220]
So free country okay a redneck in the KKK. I don't believe it

[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:50.220]
He's infiltrating. He's a spy

[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:51.180]
Right

[02:06:52.340 --> 02:07:00.820]

It's the underwater collar right? I love those my favorite. All right. The best hey

[02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:41.180]
And Roy Clark now we're Clark's good old boy

[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:46.260]
Right. Yeah, he's a good old boy. He ain't never still a free train good sense of humor

[02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:50.300]
Could have put Johnny Cash on there because he's dead and he can't fight back but

[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.140]
Huh? He don't qualify

[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:58.800]
I mean we put that I'm gonna put every country in western sing around here sure Marty Robbins just because he's dead

[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:01.960]
That means we can't put him on our end-of-the-pool position. What's wrong with you?

[02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:06.680]
Marty Robbins. I love that song. Columbia Records. The wine sports go to Pink Carnation

[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:08.660]
He's all dressed up for the dance

[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:13.800]
Probably the square dance. I'm here all but ain't the gay square dance. We play that anymore. No, I interviewed

[02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:17.360]
Not even we can play like a little bit

[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:17.840]
Huh?

[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.420]
That I tell you I interviewed him once Marty Robbins on tape

[02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:26.600]
We had these canned interviews when I was a DJ and we had to edit our own voices into the interview

[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:31.340]
Yeah, I interviewed him after he was dead. Got a lot of calls that day Marty Robbins. Yeah

[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:43.760]
I'll be dead

[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:45.180]
Round the long okay

[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:49.360]
Here's round the long that's what he said why can't we play that bit? That's enough

[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:52.420]
We can play that we just did play that kind of great big zipper

[02:08:52.420 --> 02:08:57.160]
That's as far as we're going and that's as far as you're going except maybe to that door that leads to the exit

[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:59.280]
If you don't cut the crap right now

[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:04.560]
There beliefs are blockers, but they're at the heart of power. This is just enough to make you gag

[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:10.540]
US christian fundamentalists are driving bushes middle east policy to understand what's happening in the middle east

[02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:15.500]
You must first understand what's happening in Texas speaking of rednecks to understand what's happening there

[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:19.500]
You should read the resolutions past it the states Republican Party conventions last month

[02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:23.540]
Take a look for example out the decisions made in Harris County, which covers much of Houston

[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.300]
The delegates began by nodding through a few uncontroversial matters

[02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:33.160]
Homosexualities captured to the truth are dain by God any mechanism to process license record register

[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:39.200]
Mod of the ownership of guns should be repealed income tax inheritance tax capital gain tax and corporation tax should be abolished

[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:43.480]
Immigrants should be deterred by electric fences thus fortify they turned to the real issue

[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:50.700]
The affairs of a small state 7,000 miles away. It was then according to a participant that the screaming and your fist fights began

[02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:53.740]
I don't know what the original motion said

[02:09:53.740 --> 02:10:01.060]
Was watered down significantly as result of the shouting match the motion they adopted stated that Israel has an undivided claim to Jerusalem in the West Bank

[02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:07.400]
That Arab states should be pressured to absorb refugees from Palestine and that Israel should do whatever it wishes and seeking to eliminate terrorism

[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:09.780]
Good to see that the extremists didn't prevail then

[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:15.840]
Well, why should all of this be such pressing interest to the people of the state which has seldom celebrated for its fascination with foreign affairs

[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:18.720]
The explanation is slowly becoming familiar to us

[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:23.280]
But we still have some difficulty in taking it seriously says the UK guardian George Monbiot

[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:25.900]
Monbiot whatever's name is some frog

[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:31.220]
In the United States several million people is succumbed to an extraordinary delusion

[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:39.000]
In the 19th century to immigrant preachers cobbled together a series of unrelated passages from the Bible to create what appears to be a consistent

[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:45.040]
Jesus will return to worth when certain preconditions have been met the first of these was the establishment of the state of Israel

[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:51.420]
The next involves Israel's occupation of the rest of its biblical lands most of the Middle East and the rebuilding of the third temple on the site

[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:54.440]
Now occupied by the dome of the rock and el oxa mosques

[02:10:54.880 --> 02:11:00.260]
The legions of the Antichrist will then be deployed against Israel and there will lead to a final showdown in the Valley of Armageddon

[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:04.500]
The Jews will either burn or convert to Christianity and the Messiah will return to earth

[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:10.940]
What makes this story so appealing to Christian fundamentalists is that before the big battle begins all true believers

[02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:16.800]
IE those who believe what they believe will be lifted out of their clothes and walked it up to heaven during an event called a rapture

[02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:21.780]
Not only did the word to get the sin at the right hand of God, but they'll be able to watch from the best seats

[02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:28.600]
Their political and religious opponents being devoured by boils, sores, locusts and frogs during the seven years of tribulation which follow

[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:32.680]
The true believers are now seeking to bring all of this about this means staggering

[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:35.440]
Confrontations at the old temple site in 2003

[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.000]
US Christians were deported to try to blow up the mosques there

[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:43.680]
Sponsorings US settlements in the occupied territories demanding ever more US support for Israel and seeking to promote a

[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:49.780]
Final battle with the Muslim world axis of evil United Nations European Union, France or whoever leads into the anti-Christ turn out to be

[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:53.880]
The believers are convinced that they'll soon be rewarded for their efforts

[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:59.700]
The anti-Christ is apparently walking among us in the guise of Kofi Annan, Javier Solana, Yasser, Erofet or more possibly

[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:05.640]
Sylvia, Velasconi the Walmart corporation is also a candidate in my view a very good one because it wants to radio

[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:09.020]
Tag its stock thereby exposing humankind to the mark of the beast

[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:14.920]
By clicking on RaptureReady.com you can discover how close you might be to flying out of your pajamas

[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:21.400]
The infantiles among us should take note that the Rapture index currently stands at 144 just one point below the critical threshold

[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:24.220]
Beyond which the sky will be filled with floating nudists

[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:29.080]
Beast government wild weather and Israel are all trading at the maximum five points

[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:32.720]
The EU is debating its constitution. There was a free hurricane in the South Atlantic

[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.960]
Hamas is sworn to avenge the killing of all its leaders

[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:41.980]
But the second coming is currently being laid by an unfortunate decline in drug abuse among teenagers and a week showing by the anti-Christ both of which were only two

[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:49.100]
We can laugh at these people but we should not dismiss them that their beliefs are bonkers

[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:50.900]
Does not mean that they're marginal

[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:57.840]
American pulses believe that 15 to 8 peat 10 percent of us voted belong to churches or movements which subscribe to these teachings

[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.500]
A survey in 1999 suggested that this figure included 33 percent of Republicans

[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:07.760]
The best son in contemporary books in the US are the 12 volumes of the left behind series

[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:11.440]
Which provided what is usually described as a fictionalized account of the Rapture

[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:16.280]
This apparently distinguishes it from the other one would plenty of dripping details about what will happen to the rest of us

[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:21.720]
The people who believe all this don't believe it just for a little for them. It's a matter of life eternal and death

[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:26.920]
And among them are some of the most powerful men in America John asked crop the attorney general is a true believer

[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:30.980]
So our several prominent senators in the how and the house majority leader Tom Delay

[02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:35.420]
Mr. Delay who's also the co-author of the marvelously named delay do little amendment

[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:42.540]
Postponing campaign financing reforms traveled to Israel last year to tell the knesset that there's no middle ground no moderate position worth taking

[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:50.140]
So here we have a major political constituency representing much of the current president's core vote in the most powerful nation on earth

[02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:52.520]
Which is actively seeking to provoke a new world war

[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:57.400]
It's members see the invasion of Iraq as a warm-up act as revelation maintains that four angels

[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:01.660]
Which are bound in the great river Euphrates will be released to slay the third part of men

[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:08.060]
They battered down the doors of the White House as soon as it support for Israel waivers when Bush asked Ariel Shirona pull his tanks out of gin in

[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:13.820]
2002 he received a hundred thousand angry emails from Christian fundamentalist and never mentioned the matter again

[02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:18.400]
The electoral or the electoral calculation craes these appears works like this

[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:22.840]
Government standard fall on domestic issues for 85% of the West electorate

[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:27.680]
The Middle East is a foreign issue and therefore a secondary interest when they enter the polling booth for 15%

[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:30.720]
The electorate the Middle East is not just a domestic matter. It's a personal one

[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:35.520]
If the president fails to start a conflagration there his core voters don't get to sit at the right hand of God

[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:39.560]
Bush another word stands to lose fewer votes by encouraging Israeli aggression

[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:44.520]
And he stands to lose by restraining it. He would be mad to listen to these people. He would also be mad not to

[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:46.640]

Well, how about just like pull off the decided road and kind of let things cool off the wild sounds good

[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:15.960]

[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.360]

[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:10.680]
His brain is a rental maybe he took it from

[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:11.160]

[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:26.820]

[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:33.100]

[02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:38.500]
He should be committed by this

[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:46.600]

At a morning press conference of turning general John ascrops as he believes the man is a member of the notorious al jibra movement

[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:21.940]
He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction

[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:27.080]
Al jibra is a first and cult ascrops said. They desire average solutions by means and extremes

[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:30.040]
They sometimes go off on tangents and search of an absolute value

[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:33.780]
They use secret codenames like x and y and refer to themselves as unknowns

[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:38.380]
But we've determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country

[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:42.980]

[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:59.400]
Good old I saw so least when I asked to come in on the arrest president bush said I've got to wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction

[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:01.340]
He would have given us more fingers and toes

[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:02.540]
Excellent not bad

[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:06.460]

Amber tisers in spanish have tended to assume that no one was watching and no one was doing anything said howard beels

[02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:38.720]
Oh no Howard who that's the guy's name B.E.L. E S

[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:46.600]
Howard beels the director of the ftc's bureau consumer protection. We're trying to change that assumption

[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:52.160]
He said recent frauds. He said include miraculous weight loss products to be true business opportunities

[02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:58.620]
Dietary supplements that cure aids another incredible deals offered by Spanish language magazines TV channels and newspapers

manual Machado

[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:16.320]
President of the Association of Hispanic advertising agencies based in Coral Gable said his association was aware of the problem

[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:20.240]
And that it makes sure its members refrain from using deceptive practices

[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.880]
Beels said that the ftc had levied seven complaints in recent months against deceptive

[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:29.860]
Spanish language ads for products such as weight loss pills and non-existent working home opportunities

[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:33.440]
One such federal court complaint was filed against American dream enterprises

[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:38.340]
The Miami company offers a weight loss dietary supplement called fatselcher

[02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:43.160]
Which when added to water produces bubbles? Oh you ever have fatselcher

[02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:45.120]
Let's give some to fat rich

[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:46.100]
Oh go get some

[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:52.420]
The effort resonating of mine with fatselcher's ingredients is supposedly department of weight loss without consumers having to exercise

[02:23:52.420 --> 02:23:57.580]
The ftc complaint which is pennies is American dreams claim is scientifically unfeasible

[02:23:57.580 --> 02:23:59.960]
You just got a bubble away your fat. Are you like that? Yeah

[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:02.500]
Another company latin hut

[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:07.760]
Of San Diego, California advertised the weight loss patch and a fat observer dietary supplement

[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:14.160]
Fossilic claiming equally magical result according to the ftc as part of a settlement a federal court ordered latin hut to pay

[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:17.020]
149 grand in fines amount of will go to latin hut customers

[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:23.840]
Well, thank god that his panic so the only ones that fall for fat way out for weight loss for right right likely story

[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:29.500]
California-based unisiber technology ink advertised a complete computer system for three payments of

[02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:32.780]
199 bucks instead of delivering the computer at the time of the first payment

[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:38.140]
Unisiber sent keyboards and parts that are useless without the computer itself says the ftc to get the complete

[02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:44.360]
Computer buyers had ascended more money and those who did so say the fc tc ended up with computers that didn't work

[02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:48.300]
And of course by the guy to that time they probably hit the border

[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:54.020]
Probably in teawana Donna and perfecto rod rigas enrichment Virginia perfecto

[02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:58.400]
So they ended up paying us every more than 700 bucks for what turned out to be a 13-inch monitor

[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:01.940]
The computer they finally received several months later lacked its motherboard

[02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:06.240]
Remember that dianna said that and never speaking of how a bill we hit the motherboard

[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:12.100]
We were frustrated because the computer was supposed to be a present for the children said Donna rod rigas a state home

[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:15.440]
Other was six of stock reproducing so much Donna. Tell her you man

[02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:30.680]
Okay, going for a lot of nail sense who gave Tommy the quailwood and heard the rights on the facts. I don't know

[02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:32.860]
But he's not cheering. Yeah, he sounds like he's not doggy

[02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:38.460]
And I won spot he's trying to butcher up real good like uh, huh? I think he had to stretch that spot out

[02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:41.980]
They're only giving three words to eat so he had to slow it down. Oh he's slow to wait down

[02:31:41.980 --> 02:31:45.460]
What he says? Have you just recently gained a thousand pounds?

[02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:48.480]
At Tommy's really butching up man

[02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:50.140]
Wait till you hear this

[02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:56.120]
The Bush administration is bracing itself for the latest memoir by former insider Joe Wilson former ambassador

[02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:59.720]
Well this week revealed the name of the government official who outed his wife

[02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:08.060]
Revealing her identity as a CIA operative and apparent revenge for his role and proving the White House made false claims about a rat's efforts to develop nuclear weapons or is that nuclear?

[02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:09.280]
work together

[02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:14.600]
But it was uh, you know the commissioners will speak for themselves. Oh yeah

[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:18.780]
But what is increasingly becoming the habit during mr. Bush's presidency mr

[02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:22.880]
Wilson will not make his claims on television at a press conference or even in a newspaper column

[02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:29.020]
But between the covers of a must read book his memoir the politics of truth inside the lies that led the war and betrayed my wife

[02:32:29.020 --> 02:32:31.340]
CIA identity is being published tomorrow

[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:37.260]
I just can't handle no more books. I just went out and bought two more yet three more yet. I can't deal with it

[02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:39.560]
I'll know what I'm getting for you for your birthday this year

[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:41.540]
book set real big bookcase

[02:32:42.360 --> 02:32:46.780]
Tomorrow's gonna be a busy day for mr. Wilson the former ambassador to several African countries and a member of president

[02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:48.360]
Clinton's national security council

[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:54.580]
For all the initial school pull appearance book if president is any guy the revelation will quickly be devoured by all other media

[02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:57.860]
And mr. Wilson will likely be filling their ways and broadcasts that day

[02:32:58.300 --> 02:33:01.540]
This is dependent of course on the scoop not being leaked in advance of publication

[02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:05.180]
mr. Wilson knows the score on this and yesterday he declined to spill the beans

[02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:11.620]
No, I can't do that. He said he did however reveal that the movie project of the book was not so far advanced that actors have been selected

[02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:16.340]
I will say that if this becomes a movie I'm happy with that he added. This is a story people should be told

[02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:19.180]
And amen to that it should be told

[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:26.920]
560560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line if you missed the ratings earlier in the show

[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:31.600]
We did just fine on QM from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mornings were very very weak

[02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:37.680]
We don't know yet if it's Mo and Joe or both Mojo and even things. It was a panther hockey just killed us a zero point a

[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:40.900]
That oh, I mean when you get less than a solid number on this radio station

[02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:46.320]
You have to be putting some real real crap on the air right right? Greg says good job

[02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:50.620]
Oh, thanks, Greg. Yeah, we couldn't have without you Greg and congrats

[02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:53.560]
Yeah, couldn't have done them without is he were there right now? Yeah

[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:56.860]
Says he was the billboards. We're discussing where the ratings party's gonna be

[02:33:56.860 --> 02:34:01.120]
Yeah, I love that one. It says listen that really that kind of peaceful promotion man

[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:04.180]
If we did just had that six years ago, we'd have 20 30s here by now

[02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:08.860]
Absolutely just take care of that CMQ FM. Okay, we got to get the take care of that deal

[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:13.500]
Just like not called power. Let's just do something subtle like knock their tower down something like that

[02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:18.020]
That's a pile of crap. Okay, what's the guy's name gear most shorts? Whatever's name is yes

[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:20.860]
Never heard of the guy either right and well

[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:23.760]
What if he's only on from noon to two? What does that explain the rest of the day? Huh?

[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:26.640]
Maybe they didn't they just think he's on all day

[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:31.980]
They want maybe the people maybe they're just wiring the diaries is what I'm trying to say yeah

[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:37.980]
Which seems to be a very very favorite kind of thing to do in certain communities. I don't want to say which ones you know

[02:34:37.980 --> 02:34:38.180]
I mean

[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:44.900]
Like WRHC rest in peace. They used to be a daytime station back in my days at WS news years ago

[02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:47.700]
What they used to do was take the when they would get the diaries

[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:52.380]
They would take it and fill it out WRHC and all across the time

[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:57.760]
Even even at night did oh did oh did oh the only problem is there were daytime are these to go off its sundown

[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:01.560]
That's how much they liked it so they would sign off the air like in 530 in the winter time

[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:05.160]
But at six o'clock at night eight o'clock at night 10 o'clock at night when there was no signal there

[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:07.060]
They were still writing down WRHC

[02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:12.220]
Uh to help with it out whatever the hell they were writing. Oh man. It's just it's uh, well, you know

[02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:15.720]
We're doing the best we can I think out of these circumstances right doing about as good as we can

[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:16.540]
Mind you mental

[02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:22.660]
Now a Greg isn't still air is he no he's not ah damn cuz you should now you should have reminded me

[02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:26.340]
You should have a pledge from him that because this is so close

[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:34.340]
That regardless of how the final number comes between CMQ FM and us that we could guarantee the number one bonus. Oh, we'll get it

[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:38.060]
But we'll get it no chance chance

[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:43.520]
Here's one it says I don't know if you talked about this but the beeslees and John Ross

[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:44.720]
GM of KLSX

[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:51.280]
96.1.4 Myers are enlisting their own brand of censorship as if today during the Howard show in the middle of Jenny MacArthur

[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:54.980]
Talking and Howard doing what he does the imposed a commercial in the middle of the conversation

[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:57.920]
Coming back when they felt it was okay when they felt it was okay

[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:03.960]
They did later uh and interview with an armless legless wrestler who was a great kid and we're talking about how he does certain things with no legs or arms

[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:06.380]
Pretty tame stuff as he talks they drop in a promo

[02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:09.500]
The reason this bothers me is obvious

[02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:14.600]
But the hypocrites run spots about stopping censorship and to call and tell you how they feel about the stern show and with this

[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:20.420]
Your bosses are on the warpath keep up the great shows. Hey just kiss the radio that you got a model with their okay if you enjoy he shows

[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:25.720]
Well, he's got some nerve facts in us over in this coast. Okay, what is the song to dance about there?

[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:28.460]
Just be glad you got any of it if you like the sperm show, okay?

[02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:33.480]
And let me say again big 106. Okay precipitous flop man

[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:37.920]
They just are falling off the face of the globe and nobody could be heavier than this

[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:40.320]
But I'll say it again. In fact, I want to take a look at the homepage

[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:47.540]
Okay, cuz I think maybe subliminally we're doing a reverse. We're promoting the maybe they think we're promoting those stations

[02:36:47.540 --> 02:36:48.300]
I don't know

[02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:53.800]
But a nice job Eric. He is the best. He got him off of there already didn't he? I don't think I

[02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:59.640]
Do believe this thing takes forever to download and he got those logos off and they're already there's old paddler in box

[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:01.660]
Just like magic. He just wiped him clean

[02:37:02.700 --> 02:37:07.880]
And if you're listening to any clear channel station. That's what you ought to do is get out some sherman and wipe your radio clean, okay?

[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:11.580]
Because that radio right now is full of something we can say

[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:16.720]
Do not be doing that that that would be my own deal. See of course. I would never listen to their stations anyway

[02:37:16.720 --> 02:37:19.780]
But I listen to iod fox no sports. No

[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:21.200]
What else they got?

[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:26.380]
Um, mizeta god forbid. Uh, what else man in black? No for me

[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:30.800]
What am I leaving out? I don't know I forgot the uh

[02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:36.080]
Well you're with there then they got that country thing and we've listened to anyway

[02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:44.360]
And of course big not so big no more they're gonna have to change the name of that station the whole the whole format's gonna have to be changed small 106

[02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:48.880]
Let's see you mentioned Francisco arruco earlier I can offer some info

[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:51.960]
It says he has two daily shows one in English and other in spanyol

[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:56.160]
The English show airs Monday through Friday on waxy 790 from 8 to 9 a.m

[02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:59.720]
He buys the airtime on Monday plays a left-wing show called alternative radio

[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:03.000]
Which features speakers like noam chomsky howard's in it service sounds great

[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:07.940]
The spanish ores Monday through Friday 1450 a.m. From 9 30 to 10 30. I don't listen to this one

[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:14.700]
Says hector you'll also be interested know that the website progress so weekly which features max castero is alruca's brain child

[02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:17.080]
I would say just based on reading this fact

[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:22.920]
He's probably the best in the market right Cisco. Arruca is the best radio show on him. I want what what time is he on?

He did the moon walk. Oh, thank you, Neil. You're welcome. No problem. Bless you my child

Think he's gonna be saying Jesus Christ a lot. I think a lot of it will be wrong

[02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:43.960]
But I don't think so I think he's gonna last too long. I think he'd be like a father

We put him on there very late to try to give some others a handy crap now

[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:47.560]
He ain't gonna catch El Presidente John rocker, but I have a feeling there he is. He's already got seven

[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:50.360]
He's only been on there like about two seconds right he moves fast

[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:52.680]
He's making a big move because he's a big guy

[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:54.900]
In fact, he's probably headed for the subway right now

[02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:56.520]

[02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:18.340]
Jim Foxworthy

[02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:20.720]
Nobody's mentioned Jeff Foxworthy

[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:23.600]
The one that says you're a redneck

[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:26.800]
Yeah, well

[02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:31.820]
That's what I was talking about. I mean, how could he have 28 votes if nobody mentioned him that oh

[02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:34.640]
Jeff Foxworthy's got 28 votes. See again

[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.800]
I realize we have people coming and going all this other crap which we can't permit anymore. We can't afford any downtime

[02:43:40.260 --> 02:43:40.660]
Okay

[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:45.540]
No, seriously now that we got Kiamo Schwartz on here on CMQ FM from noon to two, you know

[02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:52.280]
We could handle the what's his name rush right we handled him okay in his last and in fact pretty handling pull the way right

[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:56.780]
But a guy that tells dirty jokes in Spanish. We can't compete but a guy that tells all kinds of crap in Esponio

[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:00.960]
Oh man, how do you compete with that in South Florida, huh? You're nobody speaking English no mo

[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:06.300]
All right, I tell you one thing though Kiamo you better watch your ass because once we start playing them

[02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:09.340]
Celia cruise records then they will fear us okay

[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:13.840]
We just been holding back we've been giving like a little handy crap. I had started to kind of catch up

[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:20.540]
But once we start with that crap then you're finished finito bonito, you know what I mean

[02:44:20.540 --> 02:44:26.780]
Kiamo Schwartz. I mean what kind of garbage is it this is simulation baloney man the biggest lie and of course the hero

[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:29.260]
That's another one of their lies. We ripped them in ass yesterday well deserved

[02:44:29.260 --> 02:44:34.640]
That's another phony baloney bunch of crap they've been promoting years and years and years well the assimilation process

[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:39.860]
Right if they keep reading your piece of crap rag which they don't but if they did it would never happen and probably won't

[02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:46.760]
I think what we need to do once we take care of the election here we get a real present and they're in there final way to get us out of this mess

[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:49.200]
I think the next in fact

[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:52.780]
I'd have been a hell of a lot happier if they wanted to invade somebody invade Cuba sure

[02:44:53.860 --> 02:44:58.280]
That caused me get that bearded bastard that they could do it like over a weekend okay over one weekend

[02:44:58.940 --> 02:45:03.240]
And then we'll see who's going where okay, then we'll see all the big talk. Yeah

[02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:04.800]
Well that crap

[02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:11.860]
I remember so vividly back during the ugly alien days somebody darkest nastiest ugly as days in South Florida

[02:45:12.380 --> 02:45:16.960]
I remember all those young people getting sucked into that madness to the Elga to whipped up into what see by their elders

[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:21.700]
Who convinced them that this was some kind of an ethnic thing as opposed to just another child custody case

[02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:23.560]
Which it was oh?

[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:27.960]
No, he was the symbol poor little alienito and his happy me earlier. Yeah, he was the baby Jesus

[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:34.000]
He was the baby Jesus what everybody knows and then of course when he got the dragged into the closet then they really started getting nervous

[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:34.420]
you know

[02:45:35.380 --> 02:45:39.760]
Because when you start looking into the closet and the Cuban family well got only knows who might be hiding in there

[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:43.280]

About the rapture right and they say something about about floating nudity people

[02:46:35.020 --> 02:46:37.680]
Isn't that the Hall of Rebeach? That's the place

[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:44.120]
No, they said the rapture not the rupture man get it right. Have a great thing. He must have been there. Yeah, they had a rupture on Hall of Rebeach

[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:45.960]

What we can still say leak did you see leak on that list? I don't think so okay

[02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:22.580]
Last time I checked leak was a vegetable is it not that's right

[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:27.720]
Leak is like an onion I do believe in that what they hear the briches that a lot a lot of leaks

[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:29.700]
I thought it was a kind of potato

[02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:36.540]
Is it a potato leak no idea really? I really don't know in fact. I've seen leaks soup. Yeah. I think I've eaten leaks soup

Potato leak now back in the day. Yeah, you're right. It's it's a potato thing back in the day

[02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:45.300]

Senator Christopher jade died Democratic Connecticut. No, the differences he had with neck reponding with the diplomat was invested into a hundred

[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:04.340]
years in the 1980s

[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:10.040]
Those different system largely from a lack of candor about what the US was and wasn't doing in central america and the conflict of that time

[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:16.080]
Dodd said and although I intend to support and strongly support this nomination when it comes to a vote in this committee and later on the senate floor

[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:22.500]
I want to make one point especially clear that same issue candor in my view is going to be critical with respect to continued support for

[02:49:22.500 --> 02:49:23.600]
U.S. policies in Iraq

[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:29.600]
Dodd told negropondy that if the administrations policies are not working it'll be your duty to the american people to say so

[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:35.880]
and it's a so very clearly without any hesitation so that we can make course correction before it's too late that quote from Fox News

[02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:43.180]
John Ashton writes this is a real moment of danger for america the bush limbaugh republicans are the 1930 Nazis period

[02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:50.240]
And these unites that make up the democratic party these battered wives will come up with any excuse to allow these Nazis to continue doing what they're doing

[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:52.500]
Means that america will go the way of nazi germany

[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:58.660]
I mean look at who this negropondy isn't what his record is and then it's got a link to click on to and then look at Dodd's words

[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:05.740]
Dodd knew all about this when it was occurring the horrible human rights abuses that occurred on agropondy's watch and which negropondy covered up for

[02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:13.540]
Dodd knows that who that's who negropondy isn't what he has done and he made an issue of it when negropondy was nominated for ambassador to the when just three years ago

[02:50:14.100 --> 02:50:22.440]
And as he says plainly he knows it is exactly the same issue candor which is going to be critical for the post negropondy is being assigned to the ambassador to Iraq

[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:27.520]
In other words Dodd knows negropondy lied i.e. the issue of candor last time nation gave him its trust

[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:31.500]
oversaw illegal operations covered up horrible butchered human rights abuses

[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:36.960]
And he knows president pushes now nominating him as our ambassador to Iraq putting him in exactly the position to cover up horrible

[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:43.060]
abuses once again in fact it seems the only reason president push would have taken negropondy away from his you and post to put him there

[02:50:43.060 --> 02:50:44.700]
But Dodd won't hold him accountable

[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:49.080]
All we can say to this man who has shown his horrible nature I'll let you get away with all of that

[02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:51.040]
Oh and by the way don't do it this time please

[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:58.980]
As always when the democrats initially stood up for the nomination of negropondy as you and ambassador the bush lumballians rather than cave in fire back twice

[02:50:58.980 --> 02:51:02.320]
His heart and the response is always the worst democrats caving in

[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:07.340]
Here Dodd knows what he's faced with with a situation similar to the one in the 19ies in Honduras

[02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:12.760]
Dodd knows negropondy's record but not only won't he oppose the nomination as anyone who cares about america or human rights would

[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:18.280]
But he will strongly support it again in his words. I intend to support and strongly support this nomination

[02:51:18.920 --> 02:51:22.180]
It worth enough for him to even support this horrible man who he stood up against before

[02:51:22.180 --> 02:51:27.080]
But is a true gutless coward now he wants to make sure he says he will strongly support him

[02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:33.600]
Make no mistake americans in a lot of trouble a lot the bush lumballians even if defeated this election won't go away

[02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:41.640]
And will continue to fester and fester into a parallel version of imperial terrorists all of the Nazis Napoleon or the other countless other examples of this occurring throughout history

[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:44.000]
That is this will happen unless you stand up

[02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:50.460]
We can't come to leadership of the future because certainly the mortality free republicans nor the ball free democrats will

[02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:54.860]
It is up to the moderate independence to boldly strongly stand up now in defense of our nation

[02:51:54.860 --> 02:52:01.020]
Not by stupid useless protesting nor by stupid violence but by getting involved the SU in the political processes candidates

[02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:08.080]
Is there anyone with both balls and accountions living in america who's willing to put down their remote control and stand up in defensive their nation

[02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:09.960]
What a good column from the moderate independent?

[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:12.520]
John Ashton inspiring it embarrassing

[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:16.840]

[02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:18.660]

sunny box is good. Yeah, okay

[02:53:19.260 --> 02:53:19.660]
Oh

[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:25.000]
In fact, we never did get a hold of sunny to recut that promo that he's got there

[02:53:26.060 --> 02:53:30.360]
You know the one where he says hi, this is sunny box. I listen to your Rogers because I can hear the word yeah

[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:32.980]
Not anymore. You can't not no more you can't sunny

[02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:36.400]
So I guess you probably ain't listening no more

[02:53:37.380 --> 02:53:45.800]
Look abuse of Iraqi prisoners probed a few weeks ago the US Army announced that 17 soldiers in Iraq have been removed from duty and six of them were facing court

[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:53.220]
Marshall for mistreating Iraqi prisoners that Abu Ghraib the infamous prison where Saddam Hussein and his henchmen tortured and executed Iraqis for decades

[02:53:54.060 --> 02:54:00.140]
60 minutes to has obtained photographs of what was happening at Abu Ghraib the photo show American soldiers mistreating Iraqi prisoners

[02:54:00.140 --> 02:54:07.000]
In his Wednesday morning briefing Jim a Brigadier general Mark kimit said the photos maybe showing in Danny Rathers report on 60 minutes to that was last

[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.420]
I did you see it I didn't they'll

[02:54:09.420 --> 02:54:10.220]
I go and CBS

[02:54:10.220 --> 02:54:12.960]
To discover the photographs by the army landed in investigation

[02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:18.040]
Which concluded that there were problems at the prison from the general in charge of the prison to the military police guard in the prisoners

[02:54:18.820 --> 02:54:23.600]
An investigation into abuse claims started in January after US soldier came forward with allegations of abuse

[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:28.600]
Kim and an interview conducted by satellite satellite from Baghdad told Dan Rather were appalled

[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:32.340]
These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people who work with every day they represent us

[02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:35.220]
They were the same uniform as us and they let their fellow soldiers down

[02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:41.280]
We expect our soldiers to be treated well by the adversary by the enemy if we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity

[02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:45.700]
Respect we can't ask that our other nations do the same to ourselves. Just mention that in passing

[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:49.820]
As part of the insanity that we've voiced it

[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:54.380]
Of course remember there are all them terrorists that used to be over there or that's right there. They're now Africa

[02:54:54.860 --> 02:54:56.080]
They were in bed together

[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:01.980]
Also, no matter give you any reason to have cost for alarm the FBI is over at law enforcement agencies nationwide

[02:55:01.980 --> 02:55:06.900]
The danger that terrorists could be using stolen passports to move freely across borders and enter the US away

[02:55:07.620 --> 02:55:11.520]
A recent classified FBI bulletin warns that stolen French passports

[02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:18.340]
Our particular concern because France is one of 27 countries whose citizens do not need visas to enter the US

[02:55:18.340 --> 02:55:19.720]
Revisits of nine days or less

[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:23.860]
French citizens need only show their ill passaporto to get into the US airport

[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:29.620]
Thousands of French passports in order to have been stolen past year on July 22nd of last year

[02:55:29.620 --> 02:55:34.640]
Two government hijacked a vany or marseille in southern France and stole five thousand black passports

[02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:39.700]
Almost two months later on September 10 hundreds more blind passports were stolen from a courier service near Leon

[02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:45.500]
And two months ago and two more robberies in France thieves stole 93 hundred passports and burned a van apparently destroy the evidence

[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:50.480]
I think we got a solution for that. Let's just stop letting people from France come in. What are you saying? Okay

[02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:52.060]
Stop the weiner domain
