[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.860]
u.s soldier and marine killed in whistleblower the white house wants to

[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.180]
silence speaks to the independent

[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.540]
a former translator for the fby with top secret security clearance as she is

[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.560]
provided information to the panel investigating the eleven september attacks

[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.380]
which proves that senior officials new of al-Qaeda's plans to attack the u.s.

[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.560]
with aircraft months before it happened

[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.560]
she said the claim by national security adviser condolese or rice that there was

[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.180]
no such information was an outrageous lie

[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.180]
civil edmund said she spent more than three hours in a closed session with

[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.260]
the commission's investigators providing information that was circulating

[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.680]
within the fby in the spring and summer of two thousand one

[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.660]
suggesting that an attack using aircraft with just months away and that the

[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.500]
terrorists were in place the bush administration meanwhile as sought to

[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.420]
silence her and is obtained a gag order from a court by setting the rarely used

[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.820]
state secrets privilege

[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.160]
she told the independent yesterday i gave the commission details of specific

[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.240]
investigation files the specific date specific target information specific

[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.940]
managers in charging investigation

[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.780]
i gave them everything so they could go back and follow up this is not here say

[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.340]
these are things that are documented these things can be established very easily

[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.420]
she had a there was general information about the time frame and about methods

[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.540]
to be used but not specifically about how they would be used and about people

[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.900]
being in place and who was ordering these sorts of a terror attacks there were

[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.760]
other cities that were mentioned major cities with skyscrapers

[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.560]
the accusations from his admins thirty three a Turkish American who speaks

[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.060]
Azerbaijani farcey Turkish and English will reignite the controversy over the

[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.740]
administration door warnings about al-Qaeda

[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.520]
the issue of what the administration knew and when is central to the

[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.100]
investigation by the nine eleven commission

[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.800]
misses admins thirty three say she gave a reference to the commission in a

[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.760]
specially constructed secure room at its offices in Washington on 11th of

[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.520]
February she was hired as a translator for the FBI's Washington field office

[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.640]
September 13 2001 just two days after the al-Qaeda attacks her jobs were

[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.040]
her job was to translate documents and recordings from the FBI wiretabs

[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.320]
she said it was clear that there was sufficient information during the spring

[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.680]
and summer 2001 to indicate that terrorists were planning an attack

[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.820]
most of what i told the commission at ninety percent of it related to the

[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.780]
investigation that i was involved in or just from working in the department she

[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.900]
said two hundred translators side by side you get to see and hear a lot of

[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.380]
other things as well president push that they had no specific specific

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.640]
information about nine eleven and then is accurate but only because he said

[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.020]
nine eleven she said there was however general information about the use of

[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.040]
airplanes and then the attack was just months away

[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.340]
to try to refute mr. Clark's accusations miss rice said the administration

[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.960]
did take steps to counter al-Qaeda but in an opinion piece the Washington post on

[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.720]
march 22nd miss rice wrote despite what some of suggested we received no

[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.560]
intelligence that terrorists were preparing to attack the home line using

[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.660]
airplanes as missiles those some analysts speculated that terrorists might

[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.220]
hijack planes to try and free usl terrorists miss edmund says by that you but

[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.280]
that by using the word we miss rice told an outrageous lie

[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.700]
she said rice says we not i that would include all people from the FBI the

[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.720]
the d.i. the defense intelligence agency and she says that's impossible

[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.260]
it is impossible at this stage to verify miss edmund's claims however some

[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.960]
senior u.s. senators testified to her quid abl in 2002 which he went public

[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.140]
with separate allegations relating to alleged incompetence and corruption within

[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.880]
the FBI's translation department how do you like that kind of leaves a big

[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.760]

[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.300]

american then it would be really nice you know instead of listening to uh ooyoshi ho ** ago

[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.420]
see even on our friend called yesterday he never really told us any of the artists that that

[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.380]
there planning i said are they paying see their crews no uh well who are they way but they didn't

[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:17.180]
state it didn't tell us i said louise McGell no i'm seedy screaming I'm dead now but now remember when

[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:22.300]
time was a light i was loosing what's visible to me when you went in to flour no no no no no no no no no no

[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.280]
it's fact what a built tanner marked fully and charlie crisps huh having a comment i

[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.480]
I think that's our poll question today.

[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.100]
I'm serious.

[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:37.120]
I mean, Bill Tanner's right in there killing us with his advocacy for those no speaking

[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.280]
English stations because he's got a vested interest.

[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.800]
There's see, I look at that whole deal.

[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.260]
I see a conflict of interest, don't you?

[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.940]
He's the consultant for QAM, which is an English language station in South Florida.

[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.460]
It's his real rarity these days if he acts me.

[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.900]
And he's also consultant for a whole chain of Spanish language radio stations.

[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.440]
And he's always running to Arbitron.

[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.420]
Oh, we'll see the Spanish stations are getting under a sample.

[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.560]
Yeah, right.

[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.520]
WDQAM Line 9.

[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:00.860]
Hello.

[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.440]
Whoa, another poll today.

[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.160]
That was sensational.

[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.620]
Oh, no, he's starting to call.

[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.420]
Oh, that was a beautiful thing.

[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.420]
5'6'7".

[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.840]
Oh, 5'60".

[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.020]
Man.

[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.020]
WQAM.

[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:21.220]
Hello.

[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:22.920]
Not there on Line 8.

[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:23.920]
WDQAM.

[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.320]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:25.880]
Pretty good.

[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.300]
Good.

[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:26.940]
George, how you doing, man?

[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:27.640]
Pee-ching.

[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.760]
I got a question about your phone numbers.

[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.600]
You only give up the 5'6'7".

[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.900]
The area code doesn't matter or is it wherever you're at.

[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.580]
Data-broward.

[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.560]
Oh, OK, it does work.

[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.620]
Because I tried 9'5'4".

[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.180]
Never get in there.

[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.840]
End of calling 3'5".

[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.160]
I didn't listen to Randy yesterday, but the first day of our five-hour, we're out.

[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.100]
She had on Ralph Nader.

[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.220]
Yeah, he hung up on her.

[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.600]
I got the story here a little later on.

[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.180]
Yeah, but not until after she ripped them big time.

[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:51.960]
Right.

[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.660]
Tell him that the basic radio's number crisis could be the fourth guy.

[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.300]
Right.

[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.040]
So, I mean, she put up a hell of a fight.

[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.280]
Yeah, well, she made Katrina Van Inhuvel from the nation.

[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:02.860]
OK.

[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.660]
She made her column.

[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.860]
She got a nice mention in there.

[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.320]
In fact, I'll get to it eventually if I can find in my pile here.

[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:08.820]
I'll get to it.

[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:09.240]
Oh, here it is.

[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.480]
She's the only one that really knows radio for what it is.

[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:13.720]
Radio.

[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.100]
The other people are all actors, comedians, or whatnot.

[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.340]
Yeah, it's going to take a little while just to leave all of that palm beach,

[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.040]
your cemetery village crowd behind her.

[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.260]
And just get on to what doing what it is that she's done with.

[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.580]
Yeah, I think she'll work that, but she really got hot way in the end of the news.

[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.360]
You go, girl.

[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:27.920]
All right.

[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.380]
Take it easy.

[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:28.920]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.180]
Hi.

[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.480]
Randy, the goddess.

[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.120]
She's doing it.

[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.380]
Wow.

[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.060]
Like I said, we wish you're nothing but the best.

[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.120]
And of course, you know, Georgia's just got a personal grudge.

[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.280]
What you talking about?

[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.360]
What is it?

[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.420]
I think it has to do with Anna Maria.

[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.620]
Then he's 34.

[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.600]
The worst sit down chain in America.

[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.360]
No drive-through.

[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.120]
Then he's 34.

[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.880]
I'll see people who say, well, you can sit down and McDonald's here,

[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.680]
but they got a drive-through.

[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.340]
See, that's why I put that in her because it differentiates.

[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.320]
Then he's 34.

[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.180]
I hop 11.

[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.460]
I hop right out of that place.

[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.960]
In fact, I did spots for them once upon a time under great duress.

[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.140]
I'm sorry, I did them.

[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.560]
Applebee's 10.

[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:05.960]
Olive Garden's 7.

[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.200]
All right.

[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.620]
We just put it on her to Olive Garden.

[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.560]
So I already got 7.

[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:09.940]
Oh, thank heaven.

[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.740]
Chili's in God's 6.

[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.760]
I like chili's pretty good.

[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.420]
So for what it is, they got good soup, right?

[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.380]
I mean, it's got a fancy, fancy place.

[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.440]
It's so chicken fingers.

[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.900]
Forkinspancake has 5.

[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.500]
Shame on you.

[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.420]
Multipod 5.

[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.580]
Pick it up, let's cap it, everyone.

[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.480]
And a rascal, how's it going to have any yet?

[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.800]
My life is pretty long.

[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.820]
Here's the horse we need to fight since it's not QAM.

[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.980]
Tonight, my Uncle Tony joined my wife and kids at the Olive Tree restaurant.

[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.520]
Now, my Uncle Tony, he's in the Talignin cuisine connoisseur.

[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.940]
If it ain't perfect, he's not happy.

[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.480]
Now, I couldn't believe it when he said the chicken parmesan was the best it ever tasted.

[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.480]
Plus, he kept raven about the free breadsticks and all the salad you could eat.

[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.680]
My Uncle Tony recommends you come down to the Olive Tree because when you're here, you're family.

[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.340]
And by that, I mean, you know, in the family.

[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.740]
Like last night, this couple was done eating, right?

[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.160]
And they were walking out and my Uncle says, what are you going?

[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.180]
And they say, we're heading out to see a movie.

[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.120]
And Tony says, huh, huh, not until you head down to the 4A club and put a head on a f***er, cobo moroni.

[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.040]
And these people freaked out, right?

[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.720]
They started laughing because they didn't realize my Uncle was serious.

[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.760]
And then, once you eat at the Olive Tree, you're in the family, right?

[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.560]
So Tony stands up and he says, what's so funny?

[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.000]
Do I am news you? Am I some kind of clown or something?

[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.740]
Then he takes a steak knife, right?

[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.800]
And he starts sticking this guy and he's sticking him and sticking him, right?

[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.400]
Well, anyway, the meal was f***ing great.

[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.260]
The Olive Tree restaurant when you're here, your family.

[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.020]
For ever.

[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.380]
Good bleep center, thank God.

[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.360]
Oh, I was a bad bleep.

[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.560]
That one was bad?

[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.320]
I don't know.

[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.580]
I thought it was very good.

[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.460]
I thought it was excellent.

[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:42.720]
I'm the bleep judge, by the way.

[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.800]
I thought it was fine.

[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.440]
Maybe we'll find it a little bit.

[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.280]
Just calm down.

[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.780]
Somebody says pizza hut.

[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:48.620]
Yeah.

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.600]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.460]
Somebody says waffle house.

[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.660]
I don't think I've ever eaten it to waffle house, at least not in 80 million years.

[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.920]
It's like a, it's like a, some more you eat on the road like chonies.

[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:05.800]
Yeah.

[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.040]
And what about chonies?

[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.160]
You want to put chonies on there?

[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:08.740]
We could.

[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:09.480]
We could.

[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.900]
Now, who was saying chonies is terrible?

[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.500]
Did you say that?

[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.160]
It wasn't me.

[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.420]
It was somebody else in here this morning.

[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:14.560]
Oh, somebody arrow.

[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.680]
Josh, dear.

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.800]
What is taste is, oh, I don't want to tell you where his taste is.

[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.660]
We can't.

[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.560]
I think you got a pretty good, well, be said, go something.

[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.400]
At any rate, chonies, waffle house, pizza, there's some good ones.

[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:35.320]
The worst pizza you write is just, although it was really good back on Zayn today's, but that's because they used to make special stuff for us.

[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.960]
What day's to buy it somewhere else?

[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:38.540]
Probably.

[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.480]
It's the pickup.

[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.400]
They certainly didn't get it.

[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.660]
Oh, and I got another good one for you.

[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.260]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.660]
Sit down restaurant.

[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.360]
Domino's don't have no sit down restaurant.

[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.480]
Just to deliver you joy, right?

[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:47.880]
Correct.

[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.340]
Oh, damn it.

[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:57.960]
Anyway, after a cent set a petition opposing indecency legislation, the union yesterday set a collective nearly 1500 letters and signatures.

[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:06.700]
It's collective expressing opposition to Senate's broadcast, DECENSEE enforcement act, which would, among other things, increase the fines the FCC can impose against artists and other non-FCC licenses.

[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:12.600]
After assistant national executive director and public policy and strategic planning, Rebecca Ryan, what a title.

[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:22.440]
Rebecca Ryan says this initial response, overwhelming for such a short period of time, confirms that serious concerns exist among performers about finding individuals for corporate decisions.

[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:29.340]
She continues the focused ought to be and how media consolidation creates fewer choices for the public and fewer outlets for diverse programming.

[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:36.100]
It is clear that a half a million dollar fine will result in a chilling effect on artistic freedom and she is absolutely correct.

[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.680]
Exactly.

[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.660]
Rebecca, how do you like that?

[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.700]
So they had 1500 letters and signatures which they collected in a short time.

[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:55.940]
Scott there on at stopfcc.com, he's got 144,000 plus signatures, which he's managed to collect with quite frankly a very little organized help, which is pretty sad.

[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:03.620]
But that's why we're trying to raise that money on stopfcc.us so we can take out a national ad in USA today and millions of people all over the country will see it.

[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:13.100]
Who are not in favor of children of speech, who are not in favor of censorship, who are not in favor of Schmidt, Kennedy, a first amendment and the freedom of speech, and we're going to be pissed off enough to sign a petition.

[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.560]
We hope, right? We hope.

[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.540]
In fact, this might inspire you a little bit along the same lines.

[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.420]
Soapop, where has it become a potential target in the FCC crackdown on broadcast and decency?

[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:26.920]
Oh my God.

[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.600]
According to a key official who said the program might be too steamy for daytime TV.

[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.540]
Michael J. Cops, the FCC commissioner, has led the agency's campaign against adult-oriented radio programs.

[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.220]
Told reporters yesterday that the FCC should review whether soap operas violate the agency's indecency prohibitions.

[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.820]
According to TV, we can industry trade publication.

[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:57.440]
Mr. Cops, one of the two out Democrats on the five member FCC panel, said he stumbled across a racie soap opera scene while channel surfing recently.

[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.620]
It was pretty steamy stuff for the middle of the afternoon, Mr. Cops said.

[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:12.360]
Under FCC rules over the RTV and radio stations cannot broadcast material involving sexual and expatory functions between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. when children might tune in.

[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.780]
The FCC does not regulate content that airs on cable and satellite television.

[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.360]
Yet, Mr. Cops made his remarks after an NAB summit on responsible programming.

[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.780]
The day long meeting was closed to the press.

[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.880]
Although Mr. Cops won several FCC officials attended, met with reporters up afterward.

[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.220]
Mr. Cops could not be reached yesterday because he was traveling.

[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.800]
The commissioners remarked that not necessarily mean he'll seek an investigation into soap operas or daytime TV in general.

[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.780]
FCC chairman Michael Powell declined comment when he was asked at the summit about Mr. Cops remarks.

[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:51.420]
Representatives for other FCC commissioners and ABC, CBS and NBC all over here soap operas didn't return phone calls or decline comment.

[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.060]
Legislation that would dramatically raise fines against broadcasters is moving through Congress.

[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.160]
Soap operas have largely escaped public criticism, although the programs have started to show more skin in recent years.

[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:03.740]
All right.

[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:13.560]
CBS representatives have denied published reports that the recent firing of guiding light producer John Conboy was linked to new sensitivities about indecency.

[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:21.640]
Mr. Conboy was dismissed in February about a week after the show aired a scene in which a character pulled down her boyfriend's underpants, revealing his bare bottom.

[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.100]
The amount of sex featured on daytime serials has usually blown out of proportion.

[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:34.080]
According to Lynn Leahy, editor of the director of soap operas digested soap operas weekly, the industry's leading publications.

[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.560]
Most viewers watched the programs because their interest in the stories about romance and family relationships, she said.

[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.380]
The bottom line is these shows are about romance, not sex.

[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.940]
It's always been that way and it's always going to be that way.

[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.580]
How do you like that?

[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.540]
The nine day time drama is drawing on how many people I give up how many million about 30 million viewers a week,

[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.380]
but ratings have fallen steadily the past two decades.

[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:58.860]
There's more women, the traditional audience for soap operas have entered the workforce and of course a lot of Marvel so much and jury's

[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.820]
Springer and are watching Jenny Jones and are watching what's your name at the spick one?

[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:04.860]
Christina.

[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:05.660]
Christina.

[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.820]
No speaking English, Christina.

[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.400]
And things like that.

[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.180]
All of these things.

[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.420]
Montel, etc.

[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.640]
Oh, here's one from Bill and four Lauderdale for our list.

[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.780]
For the pool, how could you forget the sizzler?

[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.160]
Right, I don't know if I have right there.

[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.280]
I guess they're probably still around.

[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.240]
They want?

[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:24.940]
Not anymore, no.

[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:25.760]
They're gone?

[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.360]
Yeah, I thought they were gone.

[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.900]
Okay, so I don't put it on there.

[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.020]
If the sizzler's gone, maybe it fills a little bit behind the time.

[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.960]
Maybe he just don't know how to get in the right meat.

[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.320]
I mean, if you want all, you can eat shrimp.

[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:36.060]
It was great.

[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.060]
Are you eating?

[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:37.380]
I can eat one?

[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.040]
See them.

[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.740]
Denny's 48.

[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.580]
The worst sit down restaurant in America.

[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.920]
Not drive through.

[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.080]
Restaurant chain now.

[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.080]
It's got to be a chain.

[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.380]
Not one of you will arrive here tonight.

[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.220]
Denny's 48.

[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.080]
Applebee's 18.

[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.340]
I have 16.

[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.920]
The olivigardans zooming up there with 15.

[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.440]
It blows.

[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:57.700]
Chili's 10.

[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.500]
Melting pot 8.

[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.780]
Piquetville cafeteria 6.

[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.360]
What about speaking of cafeteria's?

[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.400]
Is Morrison still in business?

[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.580]
I reckon.

[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:05.740]
I don't know.

[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.240]
It's got to be.

[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.280]
It's got to be.

[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.340]
Morrison.

[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.080]
Oi!

[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.880]
Or you got to bring your own teeth in a glass.

[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.220]
I bet you have.

[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.080]
Let's put Morrison's on.

[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.000]
I'm sure it's still in business.

[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:15.500]
It's got to be.

[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.000]
Or is that the same as Piquetville cafeteria day by the mountain?

[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:19.760]
I don't know.

[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.420]
Put it on there.

[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.560]
I think Morrison's is still around.

[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.920]
Twenty before 11 at 5.

[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.460]
Sixty W.

[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.460]
Who have the mad dog at 2?

[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.520]
Joseph Gackie at 4.

[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.260]
Exactly.

[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.060]
Marlins on deck at 6.

[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:29.680]
Fifty five.

[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.140]
We've got pre-season baseball.

[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.360]
Marlins at the Metz and Port St.

[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.640]
Loosely at the 7.

[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:33.880]
10.

[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.360]
Any K after the baseball catch.

[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:37.780]
I'm more.

[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.060]
This is Sports Radio Feist.

[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.640]
You way up.

[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.120]
I just did Larry King and they don't come.

[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.800]
Any better than Neil Roger.

[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.420]
Starting next week on 5.

[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.400]
60 W.

[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.000]
Q.A.

[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.680]
It's my free sport hold.

[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.840]
Starting Greg Reed as Uncle Greg.

[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.400]
Oh, how are David?

[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.520]
Gildy Gilders leaves and gay carlo.

[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.000]
Thank you.

[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.020]
Thank you.

[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.380]
Thank you.

[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:10.020]

[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:10.300]
Thank you.

[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.640]
Princess E.

[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.240]
Why are you doing?

[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.380]
What's going on here?

[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.160]
They're achieving me, Uncle Greg.

[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.520]
And I have a big day tonight.

[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:18.820]
Good.

[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.420]
All right, both of you.

[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.300]
Cut that out.

[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.920]
I want all you kids out of my kids.

[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:24.700]
Oh, right.

[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.200]
Yo, Mo.

[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.000]
Yeah, boss.

[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.600]
Would you give me a haircut?

[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.160]
Sure.

[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.340]
Thanks for the right time.

[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:36.380]
Yeah, I'm delivering this $50 million check to Mark Rocky Rackickel

[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.660]
who has helped put us out of business, you see.

[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.500]
What's out of business?

[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.940]
That don't make sense.

[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.500]
Well, life gets boring.

[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.320]
You'll never mind.

[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.760]
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.640]
Now cut my hair.

[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.200]
Okay, boss.

[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.200]
And what's that noise?

[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.360]
Well, that's Gildy and crowning in a bowl of soup.

[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.020]
Well, can't he swim?

[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.040]
I let him die.

[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.140]
Hello.

[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.580]
What's this sticking out the side of my head?

[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.800]
That's your ear.

[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.880]
I could cut that off too, if you like.

[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.220]
Oh, yeah, that's it.

[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.560]
Yo, cut that out.

[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.620]
What have you say, pal?

[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.040]
No, that's it.

[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:12.600]
That's it.

[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.240]
My green sport bowl.

[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.360]
Only on 560 W-Q-A-F.

[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.700]
Your community might.

[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.740]
It's sports or how?

[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.520]
Yeah, I'm going to tell you how stupid they are.

[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.200]
If they had any brains at all, you know how cheap they could get both a brine

[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.540]
like to do a little part of that morning deal.

[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.660]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.360]
Doin' a mo voice and a Gildy voice and throne an occasional guest appearance by Greg Wede, aka Jack Benny.

[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.100]
And it would get a 30 share.

[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:38.840]
I'm telling you right now.

[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.160]
Yeah, what?

[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.080]
But anyway.

[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.260]
They're showing on CNN the Amish are vacationing in Sarisota.

[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:44.640]
Are they?

[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.000]
Which Amrily Shockers, they show them at the beach and there's all those nearly naked people running around around them.

[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.280]
I think they probably have to like, I don't know, cover up their eyes.

[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.100]
Maybe.

[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.840]
Well, the youngsters are allowed to, you know, cut loose.

[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.160]
They are?

[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:57.780]
Yeah, they are.

[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.000]
They want the Amish nut because I got that book now.

[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.920]
The Amish will only want sincere Amish joining up.

[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.960]
So when you're a youngster, a teenager, and a young adult, you're allowed to do what?

[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.460]
Run out there and do whatever you want.

[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:09.300]
Not watch TV.

[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.600]
No, you can go out and radio.

[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.800]
Certainly not watch Baywatch.

[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:13.640]
Do anything you want.

[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.700]
And if you want to come back at that point, they will, you know, you swear the old days.

[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:19.960]
So it's like a test run.

[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:20.320]
Right.

[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.240]
And if you're up to their standards and you come back and live on a farm.

[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:23.780]
Right.

[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:29.420]
But they want to see your true life with no electric, no radio, no TV, no motor cars, not a single luxury.

[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:29.980]
Right.

[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.000]
No electric razors, things like that.

[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:32.420]
No.

[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.080]
Bush council called 911 panelists before Clark testified.

[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.000]
This is very disturbing.

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.300]
I got 80 million stories here and I will drop them in because this is important crap.

[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.940]
Even though a lot of people don't care.

[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:51.360]
But then again, President Bush's top lawyer placed a telephone call to release one of the Republican members of 911 commission when the panel was gathered in Washington, March 24th, the testimony of Dick Clark.

[00:36:51.880 --> 00:37:00.200]
According to people with direct knowledge of the calls of the Washington Post, White House council Alberto Gonzalez called Commissioner Fred Fielding, one of the five Republican members of the body.

[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:10.200]
According to one observer also called Republican commission chamber, a member Jim Thompson, who's just obnoxious, representative Henry Waxman, the American Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee.

[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.380]
Wrote to Gonzalez yesterday asking to confirm and describe the conversations.

[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.560]
Waxman said it would be unusual of such as part a contact occurred during the hearing.

[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:26.600]
He didn't let anything would be illegal in such phone calls, but suggested that such contacts would be improper because the conduct of the White House is one of the key issues being investigated by the commission.

[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:33.800]
White House spokesman were unable to get a response from Gonzalez. How do you like that? I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.380]
But the good news is Condoleezza, our favorite.

[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:41.720]
Our favorite get tooth lie in bitch is going to testify on April 8th.

[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.480]
Ready for that? That sounds like next Thursday to me.

[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.960]
Responding the heavy political pressure from both Republicans and Democrats, the White House made an abrupt about face on Tuesday.

[00:37:50.960 --> 00:38:00.360]
Agreed to allow rights to testify publicly and under oath after insisting she only speaking the panel privately, but because it was a political nightmare for them, they said, okay, whatever you say, looks bad.

[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.260]
Right. I mean, talk about transparent and obvious. No, no, he thinks it's a good idea now.

[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.560]
Oh, man. Oh, you love this story.

[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:20.660]
This is from the Guardian UK. See, if you want to read good news, meaningful news, most American newspapers are pure crap. Okay. He just get propaganda.

[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:36.460]
Oh, and that thing about the pictures. I got a story on that later on, but I just I didn't talk about that yesterday. All this argument about, well, whether, whether they want to show those graphic images of the dead soldiers and the way that they trashed their body, of course, we want to see those pictures because that's the same thing that happened in Vietnam.

[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:42.220]
The American public needs to know this isn't some kind of a cakewalk in a park and they're not being handed flowers and candy.

[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.720]
That American kids are being butchered over there every day.

[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:57.120]
So this business about, well, it's just insensitive to put those pictures on the front page. They ought to be forced to look at those pictures every American so they understand what this is all about.

[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.140]
All this butchery that's going on over there.

[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:08.960]
Insanity. Oh, and speaking of that during one of the very likely breaks we have the thing. I got to grab that Richard Clark book. I almost forgot because I got just a couple of pages that I want to read too.

[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:25.480]
Oh, good. Yeah. Anyway, the Israeli government is written to the BBC accusing its Middle East correspondent or a guillotine of anti-Semitism and total identification with the goals and methods of the Palestinian terror groups over a report on a 16-year-old who will be suicide bomber last week.

[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:35.320]
Nathan Sharansky, Israel's minister for diaspora affairs, complained that Giron had portrayed the army's handling of the rest of Hassan Abdul who was captured with explosives, grabbed his chest.

[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.880]
As cynical manipulation of a Palestinian youngster for propaganda purposes, he said this revealed a deep-seated bias against Israel.

[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:48.700]
The BBC said it was looking into the complaint to first buy the Israeli government since late last year when it lifted a boycott of the corporation of the

[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.840]
corporation imposed in protest at a documentary on the Jewish state's weapon of mass destruction.

[00:39:54.700 --> 00:40:05.080]
But the letter comes as several foreign news organizations, complaint of increasing government pressure to curtail critical coverage or to report stories, Israel believes helped identify the Palestinian conflict with global Islamist terrorism.

[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:14.180]
Officials have presented editors with dossiers and individual reporters and single-hour organizations such as Sky News for allegedly having an anti-Israel agenda.

[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.500]
I could read the whole thing but I'm not going to do it. I just want to give to that one part.

[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:31.580]
Last month, the Israeli Foreign Minister Silvam Shalom pulled out of an interview on Sky's Sunday with Anna Bolton after the show refused to cancel an appearance by the Palestinian representative in London.

[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:42.880]
CNN sources say the network is about a considerable pressure on its editors. Israeli officials boast they now have only to call the number at the network's headquarters in Atlanta that CNN to pull any story they do not like.

[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:56.880]
I should probably read that paragraph again. Yeah, I didn't understand that it was English. CNN sources say the network is about the considerable pressure on its editors. Israeli officials boast that all they have to do is call the number at the network's headquarters in Atlanta to pull any story they do not like.

[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.140]
Oh, I just mentioned that in passing. I think you're not getting the real news of course.

[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:12.400]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 60 on the ATO speaking of Andy. I got to read this one now. Katrina Van Den Hovel in the nation, which she's great.

[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.880]
Conservatives for NATO are not a large group.

[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:24.440]
Ralph Nader continues to fantasize that his candidacy will succeed in peeling as many Republican and independent votes away from Bush as progressive votes from Kerry.

[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:31.720]
But as Comic John Stewart quips, Conservatives for NATO are not a large group about the same size as retarded death row Texans for Bush.

[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:42.060]
The problem is as Micah Cipri writes in his smart web log, all the polls show Nader drawing anywhere between 3 and 7% of the vote with the internal skewing heavily to the left.

[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:52.760]
Sure, some people will vote for Nader, what otherwise not have voted for all at all, but it's clear that most of the Nader's support, whether he tops his 2000 showing of 2.7% or not, will come from any who would otherwise vote for John Kerry.

[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:03.460]
This does not decure Nader, and her front page story yesterday is New York Times, and in a live honor appearance on the brand new Liberal Radio Network, Air America, he seemed to relish tweaking friends and former allies.

[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:15.360]
He even hung up the phone in the live honor interview with one of America's hottest radio host Randy Rhodes, who was challenging him about why he felt the need to campaign in swing states among other key issues.

[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:21.260]
The click came after the two engaged in a bitter discussion about progressive values and political strategy in this election beyond.

[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.100]
Nice going, Randy, I told you she was going to be great if there was a Palm Beach, a Yenthal's believe her alone.

[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:35.560]
So anyway, Katrina says, let's hope Nader has a more productive dialogue with Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry when they meet sometime this month in a meeting before he requested by Nader.

[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.040]
As for my position, I need to ask you to zoom.

[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.760]
We already had that on our website, the previous one, open letter.

[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.040]
Get lost Ralph, okay, go away with that big fat ego you resume because sick.

[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.660]
So I do like that. There's a nice, you know, Randy was complaining she's not getting any recognition.

[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.460]
There you go, girl.

[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.840]
You go girl Katrina Van Dyth, who will know less than the editor of the nation, gives you a nice plug there.

[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.980]
Okay, and she got Nader so what? See, nobody told us the other day.

[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.240]
They told us that she grilled him real good. Nobody told us that he got so flustered that he hung up on her.

[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.960]
Nice going, Randy.

[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:14.160]
And the, and Maria still says no, 34 E3 by the way. What is it? 34 83.

[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.880]
34 83 34 83 bucks for stop FCC. Well, it's creeping along there.

[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.800]
Our goal today is to get the what the 5,000 by the end of the show.

[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.660]
What? I beg your pardon? Okay.

[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.760]
Like I said, our goal today is to get to 4,000 by the end of the show.

[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.900]
Listen, 1900 that money in there is yours in mine.

[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:38.920]
Okay. See, one anytime I get behind a cross, I put my money where my mouth is.

[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.700]
And I make a few bucks, but I got 1800 bucks in there already.

[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.860]
Oh, you have a big mouth. So you have to match it with your big mouth.

[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.000]
And I'm going to say it again with a little peep out like you.

[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.380]
I don't think we can say piss pot in there.

[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:53.760]
Or peep out like you can put 100 bucks in there who's got two kids in a wife to support and a dog.

[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.940]
Right. Several mistresses. Right.

[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.240]
And still, and I didn't, I want the audience to know this.

[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.640]
I didn't expect you to put in anything.

[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.260]
This just came out of nowhere. Yes, they were discussing with Eric and trying to get this thing going.

[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.640]
So we can get it functional and all these people that are just itching to help us out with his cause supposedly.

[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.620]
And George said, I'll put in 100. I know what?

[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.740]
It's important. It's hugely important.

[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.940]
But it realizes that.

[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.800]
Well, no, it's only freedom of speech. It's only our ability to do the show.

[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.620]
It's only everybody's ability to stay on the year.

[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:27.360]
It's only the ability of people out there to still watch what shows they want to see on cable and satellite and on TV and over the radio, etc.

[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:31.920]
And read what books they want to read. This is just the beginning and you'll notice how fast they're moving.

[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.420]
Man, it's like a gigantic snowball rolling downhill.

[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.920]
Without freedom of speech, we won't be able to complain when they stuff us into box cars.

[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:39.540]
Shut up.

[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.340]
So anyway, George put it in his hundreds so we go about 34 something.

[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.540]
Let's get to 4000 by the end of the show today.

[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.040]
Okay. A thousand a day keeps the old pain in the ass of Kajara away.

[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.180]
Okay. Keep me off your ass. Right.

[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.380]
Right. Because our goal is to get to about 30 grand.

[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.540]
Now, maybe that's totally unrealistic. We've never done this before on this station.

[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:05.620]
I did it on I and Z. No problem at all. We raised, I don't know what it was. I don't know how many grand, but we, you know, we can't see grand in like a year.

[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.600]
Why? We can get to 30 grand this time next year.

[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.960]
Oh, not any year. Not any year.

[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.000]
We don't have a year to jittle around with us. Okay.

[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.740]
My deadline would have to be like at the end of May, like around the first of June.

[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:22.480]
Because after very shortly after the first of June, everybody takes off with the kids and they vanish for the summertime.

[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:28.800]
So by the first of June, it's the very latest. I'd like to see that at an area in USA today and get this thing going stop FCC.us.

[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:39.540]
And what seemed to me since we got thousands of people to sign a petition from Florida, from South Florida, stop FCC.com, that if each one of those people would donate like even just the two bucks we'd have,

[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:43.080]
uh, allow a lot more than we could put a half page full page ad in there.

[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:48.100]
We can get five million signatures. They're just slap them signatures up to their armpits.

[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.380]
But we'll see if these people are going to put their money where their mouth is.

[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.640]
And you know the three dollar and a five dollar donations they're fine. They add up.

[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.180]
But where are the people out there with a hundred and a 200 and a 500? Where are those people?

[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.800]
They're out there. We're waiting on you.

[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:06.900]
Talk is cheap, man. Everybody talks to go to the end. Well, we're just waiting. We're going to help you out.

[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:11.440]
Okay. Go for it. WQA and hello. Not there. WQM. Hello.

[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.080]
Yes. How are you doing? You?

[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:13.740]
Pretty good.

[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.400]
Uh-huh.

[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:21.900]
You were talking about maricies before. I think overticked by Piccadilly, at least down here in Hollywood.

[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:26.600]
Oh, is that it? Yeah. Uh, and unfortunately I can't vote until later on.

[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.520]
And I will be voting for Denny.

[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:33.140]
But with all of the other thing, with all of them crazy, the religious stuff going on.

[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.040]
I was wondering if you guys can still play the bit my religion is better than your religion.

[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.940]
Yes, we can, sir. We'll write it at the top of the hour just in honor of you.

[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.580]
All right. Thank you. Okay.

[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.020]
5.670560. You see that's in code one. We start talking to you. This we're talking code. Oh my God.

[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.140]
I don't know if you do. You just sounded Jewish to me. What?

[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.800]
Now you know what the sticks are. By the way, happy pay saw and happy Easter.

[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:59.300]
And happy, uh, ass Wednesday. We already had ass Wednesday, right? Everyone's days.

[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.760]
We had no ass Wednesday was when the movie came out. By the way, Mel Gibson.

[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.840]
Boy, you talk about the suckers born every minute.

[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:10.900]
All that baloney about his faith and about his fanatical Catholicism and about his Nazi father.

[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:15.860]
Oh man. Talk about the whole world gets sucked in. He's running the bank with $250 million.

[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.980]
Hey, now Lona's 30 grand. Okay.

[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:18.520]
For the ad.

[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.820]
My mind and local. We're sports radio 5.6. You and you.

[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:24.680]
A.M.

[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.340]
That the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.660]
My religion is better than your religion.

[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.480]
My religion is better than your.

[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.480]
You are and mine believe Him twice with choir.

[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.760]
You avoid a land to fire by religion's better than yours.

[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.780]
My religion is better than your religion.

[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.600]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:54.220]
My religion indicates a Bay-Saint Brecher fast with TC, and racial hate.

[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.600]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.580]
My religion is better than your religion.

[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.400]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.600]
But we like to bow to best, I found no voice in where we dress by religion's better than yours.

[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.820]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.160]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.580]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.280]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.760]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:26.760]

[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:26.760]

[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.600]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.340]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.580]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:33.380]
By religion's better than what religion?

[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.500]
By how for us will people?

[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.340]
We slider-picking dogs and goats.

[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.520]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.140]
By religion's better than yours.

[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.540]
By religion's better than yours.

[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.480]
We will be decent people, we will never ever pay we tail.

[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.640]
By religion's better than yours.

[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.300]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.540]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.340]
We knock on doors to father, you like for a brush, you argue.

[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.360]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.200]
By religion's better than yours.

[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.500]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.600]
We wear ties and white our bikes and get to Mary lots of wives.

[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:20.700]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:21.900]
That's a looping.

[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.500]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.840]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.120]
Are you sure?

[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.700]
We don't want to use our rain for mind with slimmings on the rain.

[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.120]
By religion's better than yours.

[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.940]
Look at that, Denny's is off to the races, baby.

[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.340]
What is the worst sit down restaurant in America with no drive-through?

[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.700]
Denny's 68, Applebee's 29, Olive Garden 25.

[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.020]
I'm telling you Olive Garden might eventually give my run for their money.

[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:52.880]
They're moving up fast.

[00:49:52.880 --> 00:50:00.320]
I hop hop on it 22, Chili's 14, Meltingpod 12, Waffle House 12, Picket-O-Lock, cafeteria 10,

[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.900]
Shownies 10, Pizza Hut 9, Morrison's 8.

[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:11.020]
I think there must be still some of Morrison's's Red Lobster 5 and Rascal House 3 out of 233 votes.

[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:16.200]
Mike says the Red Lobster is mobbed mostly with African-Americans ordering...

[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.460]
Mike, see him.

[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.500]
And the place sucks as Mike, I know I worked there. He used to work there.

[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:22.800]
At the Red Lobster.

[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.240]
See, Josh knows that Applebee sucks because he used to work there.

[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.600]
Denny, do you get to eat there when you will work there or not?

[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.620]
Yeah, I get to eat. I didn't take advantage too much, but...

[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.860]
In other words, who would want to is what you really try to say. Try to be diplomatic.

[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:40.820]
Basically.

[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.440]
How long did you work there?

[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.240]
About six months.

[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.640]
Oh, that was enough.

[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:47.180]
Yeah.

[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.740]
Applebee's blows. It's a nice second-place spot.

[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.200]
Now, somebody says, what about Fudruckers or Salvatorees? I don't know what Salvatorees is.

[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:57.700]
No, me either.

[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.280]
Now, Fudruckers, do they have a draft here or not?

[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.860]
Because there's one right there in a corner of Sunrise University or Pine Island.

[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.340]
It's the rule that I've seen that they don't...

[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.620]
Yeah, I don't think they do.

[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.140]
No, no, a draft here.

[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.240]
So, Fudruckers counts.

[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.580]
And again, the only problem I have, I like their food.

[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.060]
The only problem is they butter the bun.

[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.380]
Unless you tell them, don't butter the bun.

[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.220]
And when they butter the bun, you have...

[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.280]
I can't make those sounds anymore, but...

[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.400]
What was that?

[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.160]
It was just a little...

[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.820]
A little grueling sound.

[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.740]
You know, when you get to be the soli, you start making rattling and grueling sounds.

[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.420]
So, that's all that was.

[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.420]
Anyway, Fudruckers, we can put that on there.

[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.220]
Although, I don't know. You don't like the food there, have you ever eaten it?

[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:34.500]
Are you talking to me?

[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.160]
Anybody, you job?

[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.260]
I think it's good, actually.

[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.020]
Yeah, I think the food's pretty good.

[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.320]
And what I like is that they have...

[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.260]
They have like the melted cheese that you can glove on.

[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.540]
You need to get your burger and you wait, you wait, you wait.

[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.920]
That's the only thing I don't like is you have to wait.

[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.820]
They cook at the order, which is okay, but you wait.

[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.100]
And then, you have like the fixin' thing there.

[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.340]
And you put all that, they have like the melted cheddar cheese.

[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.540]
And they have like a sweet pickle relish.

[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.480]
I mean, you're really good green.

[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:00.620]
And all of these things, yeah?

[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.680]
All of these things.

[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.280]
So, I don't know why we're putting it on there.

[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.420]
But somebody else will vote for it just to be a jerk, you know?

[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.400]
Just to show it there, ask to the one on.

[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.180]
Bomb found on Spanish rail line in Madrid.

[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.780]
An explosive device has been found along a high-speed railway serving Madrid and Saville.

[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:26.580]
The bomb contained 10 to 12 kilograms that's 22 to 24 pounds of dynamite connected to a detonator

[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:30.740]
by 131 meter cable, that's 430 feet for those who are into the...

[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:31.620]
Not into the metric crap.

[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.480]
Trains online were halted today after railway employees discovered a suspicious package

[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.560]
along the tracks near the town of Villaseca de la Sagra.

[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.500]
Well, I like the way that sounds.

[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:42.720]
Villaseca de la Sagra.

[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.540]
Intelito Province, South of Madrid.

[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:47.240]
A spokesman for the Civil Guard National Headquarters of Madrid told CNN,

[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.860]
are we going to get a list of the songs that they're playing on WCMQFM so we can compete?

[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:53.800]
So, we're going to start playing.

[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.680]
No, seriously, I mean, that call we had yesterday from our good Pizon there.

[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.840]
I mean, that was humorous, but as usual.

[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.620]
But it didn't really give us any information.

[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.880]
I realized it's just a flash and that sooner or later,

[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.460]
even the Julios will calm down and say,

[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.360]
oh, we heard that song 85 times already.

[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.040]
It's just like magic. We're tired of it, you know.

[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.580]
After they hear Bill Meop, Buttercup and Esponiole the first 4,000 times.

[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.860]
I mean, I don't know what they could be playing.

[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.700]
I said, are they playing the Celia Cruz? No, are they playing Luis Miguel? No.

[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.400]
Are they playing...

[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.600]
Maybe they're playing like a bunch of Julio Degrecius records.

[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:22.580]
Who does?

[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.600]
No, we'll find out.

[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.700]
Somebody must know.

[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.740]
Unless, of course, they just made that all up about CMQFM.

[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:30.340]
If nobody's really, really listening to him at all.

[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:32.820]
WQM, hello.

[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.320]
Nobody online, 9WQM, hello.

[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.160]
How about Cracker Bell, I'm a barrel man.

[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.180]
Cracker Bell, never ate there.

[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:41.640]
Oh, I can't get this.

[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:43.060]
That will be better.

[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:46.580]
That will give me the instant Hershey's.

[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.320]
Okay, thanks. Oh, don't say that.

[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.780]
Oh, you hear what he said, and stuff.

[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.880]
Cracker Bell. He said Hershey's fine, by the way.

[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.740]
I beg your pardon? Cracker Bell's fine.

[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.660]
Is it? Well, he knows where the Cracker is.

[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.760]
He's a Cracker that don't like the Cracker Bell.

[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.780]
Okay, that's his taste. You think it's fine.

[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.720]
I've seen it in various malls and stuff.

[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.880]
I mean, I didn't even realize the Cracker Bell had like a sit-down thing.

[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:06.940]
Isn't that just like a mall?

[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.280]
It's a gift shop with a restaurant or a restaurant with a gift shop.

[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:10.440]
Oh, I got a good one.

[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.080]
What's that?

[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.340]
Stukies.

[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:13.200]
Okay.

[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.920]
Yeah. They don't have any drive-through.

[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:15.560]
Are they still around?

[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:16.400]
Sure.

[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.040]
They are on the highway.

[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:19.120]
Well, there you go.

[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.740]
See, he said something about Hershey highway,

[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.720]
and you're talking about just then your general I-95.

[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:23.300]
Where does that be?

[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.360]
The high highway. Right.

[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.040]
Stukies, STU-C-K-E-Y-S, man.

[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:28.780]
I love that peanut butterloat.

[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.080]
The only problem is if you go in here and you buy a box,

[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.440]
it might have been sitting there for about 18-20 years.

[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:36.700]
No. I mean, they really put the brittle in peanut brittle.

[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:37.440]
Spossilized.

[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.760]
So if you want your teeth just to like crumble in the first bite,

[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.060]
that's always a good place to do it.

[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:42.100]
Stukies.

[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.900]
Mm-mm. I haven't eaten there in, oh, I don't know how many years.

[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:45.880]
About 30, man.

[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.740]
Long time. And hopefully never will again.

[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.080]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.100]
Hi, Neil. I have one for your poll.

[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:51.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:53.140]
The Golden Carousel.

[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.060]
Never heard of it.

[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.020]
Oh, it's a chain of about three or four restaurants.

[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.280]
The food was called over price.

[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.520]
And wine was waiting to get in.

[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.520]
It was unbelievable.

[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.040]
That figures if the food sucks and over price

[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.240]
then there's a lot of waiting to get in.

[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:07.540]
You better.

[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.180]
Okay, I'll see you in more, Neil.

[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.380]
I'll see if you allow me your guard.

[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:10.760]
Now, right.

[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.040]
See it in Mohawk.

[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.200]
Okay, Mohawk's racing right now.

[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.720]
Let's get some race stuff on it.

[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:16.700]
We're especially if we need him the most, you know what?

[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:17.100]
Huh?

[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.500]
Getting a little possum back there in a second.

[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.060]
They let Metropolis clear to the lead.

[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:22.960]
And then they blew right on by,

[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.180]
and the stretches Metropolis started to get very, very tired

[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.460]
on the front end.

[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.420]
And Maryl makes a...

[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.980]
Maryl by Arjan down the street.

[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.900]
I think they kicked him out of Pompeno Park years ago.

[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:32.380]
I do recall.

[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.580]
But anyway, let's talk some harness racing.

[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.140]
No, no.

[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.520]
Oh, five, six, seven, oh five.

[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.060]
I told you it was going to be a great day today.

[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.880]
There's just something I don't know what it is.

[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.720]
The ratings came out yesterday.

[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.040]
The station did pretty darn good.

[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.580]
We're making a nice comeback now after they couldn't find

[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.620]
our audience for a couple of months.

[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.960]
And even the moment, we'll give him his do, you know.

[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:53.560]
Absolutely.

[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.140]
We didn't do spectacular, but I think he enjoyed it pretty decent, right?

[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:58.000]

[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.420]
Not that I'm trying to suck up to the moment,

[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:01.560]
because he makes me want to vomit.

[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.820]
But nevertheless, I mean, look, we all eat out of the same trough,

[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:05.840]
if you catch my grip.

[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:07.880]
WDQA and hello.

[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:08.640]
Good morning.

[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:09.700]
Good morning, is this?

[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.620]
Uh, Norma Kent needs to be euthanized immediately if not sooner, okay?

[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:14.420]
Why is that?

[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:18.480]
Because America without the prestigious meal Rogers is a joke, man.

[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.120]
It is crazy.

[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:20.580]
I agree with that.

[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:21.560]
Well, it's...

[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:27.020]
You want to know the best part of the whole deal is they're saying that they don't want to just do the boring,

[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.040]
like liberal talk, like what Maria Cuomo was on.

[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.580]
They want people with personality and people with humor.

[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.820]
I mean, I can't think of anybody more appropriate than yours to lead to beyond.

[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:36.820]
It was a little bit of width, even if it's a half-day.

[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:37.560]
They don't have free personality.

[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.060]
They could rub together in that whole network.

[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:40.240]
No, we can even say that.

[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:40.900]
No.

[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.020]
Hey, it's your boy guy.

[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:43.920]
I have a pleasant day, Polly.

[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.620]
Yeah, back to it.

[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.020]
By the way, Norma just got out of the hospital.

[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.420]
He spent three days in the hospital with some kind of a coronary thing,

[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.420]
and they had like open up his tubes, et cetera.

[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.720]
But he's okay.

[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.880]
But I guess he emailed me that the other day.

[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.760]
I guess looking for sympathy or the fact that Randy's under now, and I'm not...

[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.260]
And again, you know, you can say all you want that I'm jealous.

[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.400]
I would like to be on air.

[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.640]
I don't begrudge her anything, but nevertheless, you know,

[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.440]
she's probably got the better connections that I got.

[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:09.760]
I got Norma look what she's got.

[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:10.900]
See what I'm saying?

[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:11.640]
I say it.

[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.620]
Maybe she had Jim.

[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.140]
No.

[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.420]
I think she dumped his ass a long time.

[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:20.220]
I think that was the beginning of her road to success was dumping at Jim.

[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.400]
Oh my God.

[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:21.920]
Hi.

[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.420]
This is Jim.

[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:25.440]
Love your show, Neil.

[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:26.660]
Love you.

[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.020]
Love you.

[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:32.020]
See, she almost derailed her own career before it got really off the tracks,

[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.500]
because she got hooked up with that clown.

[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.100]
And that's all she ever talked about.

[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.400]
Oh my Jimmy, he's so wonderful.

[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.340]
He said to Jean, he's my Jimmy, and he just kept coming around the station

[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:40.840]
and hanging around.

[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:41.760]
He didn't do anything there.

[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.480]
But that was a bad, bad mistake, and believe me, the management hated him like...

[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.260]
And that was one of the reasons that Bob Green and others there were at IOD.

[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:52.980]
He really turned on her because, oh my Jimmy, you know, when you try to push somebody

[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:54.680]
who doesn't work there down her throat, you know?

[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.680]
Yeah, like Bokobrine.

[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.600]
What does that mean?

[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.300]
Are you saying that they hate Bokobrine at QA?

[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.240]
Is that what you're trying to say?

[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:02.920]
They hate Bokobrine.

[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:03.920]
And it spies Bokobrine.

[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.320]
You know that because he caused them money.

[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:06.980]
And makes fun of them.

[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.560]
And he makes fun of them.

[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.220]
Well, you know something but everything he says is true.

[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.100]
Oh, let's see.

[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.500]
Bobby Robino's, or if not Tony Romas.

[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.460]
Well, I had a lunch at Tony Romas in Berlin.

[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.160]
How do you like that?

[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.760]
Write that down on your wrist.

[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.340]
I had a... Tony... it was pretty good.

[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.080]
Tony Romas in Berlin.

[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.120]
I couldn't believe what I saw.

[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.060]
It was sitting right there.

[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:26.700]
It was a big, beautiful, new, a place.

[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.300]
Tony Romas.

[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.240]
And they had like American menus and American everything.

[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.480]
And Berlin, no less.

[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.300]
I'm not sure those crowds of thing or two.

[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.580]
Bobby Robino's, and it says, are they still open?

[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:37.260]
I know he died.

[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.320]
Now, are they still open?

[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:38.940]
Is he still in business?

[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:40.560]
I guess.

[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.360]
I would think so.

[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:42.360]
I'm pretty sure they might be.

[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:42.860]
What would they do?

[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:43.440]
That's the business.

[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.660]
So Bobby Robino's, they don't have a drive-through.

[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:47.400]
Tony Romas again.

[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.200]
That's the distinction.

[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.140]
But as a drive-through, that makes it a fast food joint.

[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:51.520]
And we've done the fast food polls.

[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.360]
Millions of them.

[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.360]
We're tired of those fast food polls, man.

[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.260]
Even I'm tired of that.

[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:55.760]
You know?

[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.280]
Because we know McDonald's sucks.

[00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.640]
They just had a piece on CNN here a little bit.

[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.280]
Go about McDonald's coming up with these gourmet sandwiches.

[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:03.920]
Oh my god.

[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.940]
That's going to be a real winner.

[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.040]
Gourmet sandwiches.

[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:09.600]
I'm going to go and get some delicious gourmet food at McDonald's.

[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:10.240]
Yeah.

[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.420]
I'm going to go out and get a fully cheese steak at McDonald's.

[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:16.960]
French dip.

[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.000]
Yeah.

[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.340]
And like this guy, I beg your pardon.

[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.840]
You call names again.

[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.940]
I'm talking about the knees pop band again.

[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:23.680]
French dip.

[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:24.960]
He's the original French dip.

[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:25.760]
That's what I hear.

[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.720]
I can't tell you who told me that.

[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:29.220]
What about the age of youth?

[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.700]
By the way, the Panthers lost again last night.

[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.220]
They're playing some pretty exciting games lately.

[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:34.600]
But then they always wind up losing them.

[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.340]
That's a problem because other teams are highly motivated.

[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.620]
And the Panthers are going to wind up about 14 to 16 points out of a playoff spot.

[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:42.280]
So unlike what Geldie is trying to pedal a propaganda there,

[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.340]
it has been not a successful season.

[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.640]
It's been very, very disappointing.

[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.220]
And if not for the unbelievable play of Bobby LaWango,

[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.580]
they wouldn't have won like 15 games this season.

[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:52.000]
So I mean, they can thank him.

[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.240]
They ought to be kissing his ass, everybody on that team,

[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:55.580]
including the organization.

[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.040]
They better sign him up for the rest of his life.

[00:59:58.960 --> 00:59:59.940]
So what do we got here?

[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.780]
We got Denny's 77.

[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.480]
Got a Denny's real close by my house.

[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.240]
Have I ever been there?

[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:04.480]
No.

[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.200]
I can't imagine under any circumstances going in there anymore.

[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.300]
I mean, I've been in Denny's many times in my life,

[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.120]
as I'm sure you have.

[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.060]
But here's the circumstance.

[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.180]
You have your buddies around and you're all really trashed

[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.340]
and hungry and it's four in the morning.

[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:18.760]
Right.

[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.300]
You go in for breakfast or at lunch.

[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:20.800]
Right.

[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.260]
Right.

[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.620]
That's why you go to Denny's.

[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.100]
I see.

[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.260]
Well, I don't get drunk and I don't drive around

[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.320]
or four in the morning with my buddies.

[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.240]
So what can I tell you?

[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:30.800]
Denny's 77.

[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.860]
Applebee's, in fact, about that time I'm getting my emptying out my

[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:35.080]
costumey bag at four in the morning.

[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:36.840]
Denny's 77.

[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:37.900]
Applebee's 35.

[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.660]
The Olive Garden 35.

[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.920]
Payless in your life and man, I know.

[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.240]
Georgia's been calling me the old man for how many years?

[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:45.960]
Five about thirty.

[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:46.320]
Yeah.

[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.680]
And now I finally have reached the point where you're right.

[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.460]
I give up.

[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.000]
I give in.

[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:50.980]
I no longer resent it.

[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:51.780]
I'm old.

[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.380]
I'm old.

[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:52.720]
Sorry.

[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:53.820]
Josh calls me old man.

[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.000]
I'm sure he does.

[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:55.660]
Punk.

[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.160]
Denny's 77.

[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.280]
Applebee's 35.

[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.520]
Olive Garden 35.

[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.820]
The I have 29.

[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.700]
Waffle House 20.

[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.740]
Pizza Hut 15.

[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:05.700]
Chili's 15.

[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.800]
I like this pool, by the way.

[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.080]
I love it.

[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:07.620]
Pick it up.

[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:08.540]
I like cafeteria 14.

[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.600]
Chonies 13.

[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.740]
I like their strawberry pie.

[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.240]
But see, some of these places when you have it in them for years and years, I mean, Chonies

[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.120]
Big Boy in Detroit was very, very big.

[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.600]
All of them Michigan, especially in Detroit.

[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:19.980]
Chonies Big Boy.

[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.580]
And that what they, they still call it Big Boy.

[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.620]
There was a live spreaders Big Boy in Chonies Big Boy.

[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.820]
And I just see Chonies just show.

[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.720]
I've seen a Big Boy.

[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:28.960]
Oh, let's see.

[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:29.480]
Pick it up.

[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.340]
Pick it up.

[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.240]
I'm a cafeteria 14.

[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.320]
Melty Pop 13.

[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.180]
The Red Lobster 9.

[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:33.760]
I hear it.

[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.040]
I haven't been in one of those in many, many years.

[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:36.740]
And I heard.

[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.360]
Huh?

[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.740]
I haven't been there in many, many years.

[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:39.360]
We got them here.

[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.540]
There's red lobsters in Toronto, but no thanks.

[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.520]
Borsen's cafeteria.

[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.860]
I know they're still around 9.

[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.220]
Perkins Pancake House 8.

[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.800]
The Rasca Lousies got 5.

[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.100]
Sorry, Hebrew Hammer.

[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.420]
Golden Coral 3.

[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.760]
Fodruckers 2.

[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.180]
Be very careful what you say that.

[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.000]
Stukies which is spelled very, very incorrectly there.

[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.540]
How do you spell it?

[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.020]
I thought that's how you told me.

[01:01:59.020 --> 01:01:59.280]
That's how you told me.

[01:01:59.300 --> 01:01:59.300]

[01:01:59.300 --> 01:01:59.300]

[01:01:59.300 --> 01:01:59.300]

[01:01:59.300 --> 01:01:59.820]
You CK.

[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:00.540]
EY.

[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.700]
Yeah, it's got a Y in it.

[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.340]
I mean, you're close for you.

[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:05.980]
Let's go out the...

[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:06.420]
Why?

[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.920]
Cracker Barrel, Bobby Rabinos and Tony Romaji's just told him

[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.120]
they don't have any, but they will out of the first year of 2012.

[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:13.540]
My...

[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.560]
And look all this is Fort Real by Sixty.

[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.460]
Way, way...

[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:18.700]
Oh my...

[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.820]
Are you bastard?

[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.360]
Red hamster.

[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.260]
Hey there, rodent lovers.

[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.820]
March is all you can eat.

[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.540]
Weasel month and red hamster.

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.620]
Red hamster for the road.

[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.140]
With three tasty new rodent flatters.

[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:37.040]
There's Deep Fried Field Mice, Peel and Eat Muscrab.

[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.800]
And of course our world famous hamster melts.

[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.880]
They can double cheese wheeze and hold the hair.

[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.000]
And our flatters are always fresh.

[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.080]
Not like those other rodent places,

[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.180]
because we keep them stealing on the wheel

[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.900]
right up until they hit the fat.

[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.120]
Try our tasty roadside pizza.

[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.000]
Fresh from the highway to your table in minutes.

[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:57.800]
It's...

[01:02:58.620 --> 01:02:58.720]
Good.

[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.360]
And don't forget to serve.

[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.780]
Come eat hot some chocolate chip on cookies.

[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.080]
Yeah, and I'm gonna have a hot apple pie.

[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:05.980]
I will mold.

[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.360]
I'm gonna...

[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.880]
Red hamster for the road and rubber.

[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.760]
Red hamster on Main Street at Cosm Turbo K.

[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.420]
1117 to 560.

[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.260]
Now I know where Mo got that piece.

[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.660]
Piece of what?

[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:20.660]
Crap.

[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.540]
So I'm looking at the ratings again.

[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.720]
Just briefly, I don't want to get in that,

[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.180]
because the kids' audience just glazed over.

[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:26.700]
Comatose.

[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.580]
But I see Mr. Ego.

[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.080]
Now this is another reason that we didn't put him on the...

[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.240]
on the poll yesterday for Best Hock Show host Steve King.

[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.160]
First of all, if you had to buy your way on the air,

[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.800]
that's probably not a really good sign

[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.060]
in terms of competing being a real talk show host.

[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.460]
And number two, of the 35 stations that are listed in the Miami Hollywood

[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.120]
Fort Lauderdale market by Arbitron,

[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.120]
35 are listed, 12 plus ratings.

[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.580]
In other words, the whole audience...

[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.840]
I give them the benefit of the doubt,

[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.680]
because that includes even people over the age of 100,

[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.560]
which is probably most of what little audience he's got.

[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.280]
Out of 35 audience,

[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.120]
the stations listed, where do you think he came in?

[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:00.840]
35th?

[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:01.880]
Yes, good guess.

[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.060]
I think I told you before.

[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.160]
Just tell me what your problem is.

[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.700]
Down from a 0.3 in the November, December,

[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:15.040]
January ratings to December, January, February from a 0.3 down to a 0.2,

[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.900]
average quarter hours of 1600 people listening to the Ego Meister.

[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:22.360]
So I don't consider him to be like a real talk show.

[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.680]
It's quite frankly a number of hands-bid.

[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.280]
Even when he was on real radio,

[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.420]
so he's accepted that one book when I first went to IOD,

[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.460]
and he was getting the slap over in the afternoon,

[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.700]
and after they listened to the same contract controversy

[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.600]
over and over again, that was the end of that.

[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.300]
And then he went to New York for about what?

[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:35.800]
How many days?

[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:36.840]
3rd man!

[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.420]
And the history tells the tale of that.

[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.340]
So just another pretender is what he is.

[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.380]
Let's see, Ethan says,

[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.040]
how about Fridays or Benagans?

[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.340]
I'm not sure which one I hate worse.

[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.040]
Dude, there's a Fridays out there by me now.

[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.600]
In fact, I don't know.

[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.320]
Fridays I thought was pretty good, wasn't it?

[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:52.600]
Or not.

[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.240]
It was fine.

[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.420]
We'll stick them both on there.

[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:54.980]
Yeah.

[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.000]
We'll put them on there.

[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.040]
And Benagans always like Benagans.

[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:58.320]
Mm-hmm.

[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:00.880]
You don't think?

[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.460]
No, I like Benagans just fine also.

[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.120]
Where do we have Benagans in shops?

[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.120]
In Shostix or something there.

[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.200]
Oh, they're all over the place.

[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.280]
They got an incandle.

[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.020]
They're over here and now.

[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.220]
Like, how on deal has it beenagans?

[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.060]
Oy!

[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:10.540]
Really?

[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:10.920]
Yeah.

[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.140]
And how on deal one of the guy like an extra soft food menu

[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.040]
they can like come?

[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.440]
They have a blender at every table.

[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.040]
Alright.

[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.040]
That's a good idea.

[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:18.880]
Just blend the food in.

[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.200]
We can just drink it down.

[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.180]
I'll have a fillet at East State.

[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.560]
Be sure and put in the blend the first.

[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.480]
I'll just drink it.

[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:25.860]
Yeah.

[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.080]
That's unscrupulous.

[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.780]
Kerry can challenges Bush to debates.

[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.780]
Saying it's time to raise the level of dialogue.

[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:36.080]
Senator John Kerry's presidential campaign called

[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.240]
Brown President Bush's Relection campaign yesterday

[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.820]
to create a six debates in key battleground states.

[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.200]
And you know what they said so far?

[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:42.460]
No.

[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:42.760]
Oh.

[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:43.480]
Good guess.

[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.780]
Democrats in Pennsylvania, Arizona,

[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.620]
Washington, Ohio, Missouri, and Florida.

[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:50.580]
Planned-of-holed press conferences over the next several days

[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:54.420]
to highlight the importance of a substantive discussion on issues affecting all Americans,

[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.840]
national security, homeland security, veterans issues, education,

[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:01.660]
environment, energy policies, the economy, health care, equal opportunity for all.

[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.940]
Last month Kerry called the for issue-oriented debates,

[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:08.560]
but the Bush campaign hasn't respotted the Kerry campaign statement said.

[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.400]
Bush campaign spokesman Taylor Griffin told CNN yesterday.

[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.960]
I wonder if he or she has related the bow-gripping.

[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.040]
Of the bow-and-joe show.

[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:22.600]
Told CNN yesterday the Bush-chainee campaign looks for a vigorous debate at the appropriate time.

[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.840]
A vigorous debate.

[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.580]
But John Kerry should finish the debate with himself first being on both sides of each issue.

[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:28.220]
Cute.

[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.360]
Kerry has repeatedly rejected charges of changing his mind on issues.

[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.300]
So Kerry wants six debates with Bush and the Bush people are saying,

[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.560]
we look forward to a meaningful debate which sounded like a singular to me.

[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.380]
It would be wrong, but that's what it sounded like to me.

[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.660]
So anyway, yes.

[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.840]
Even though we're not set up the check.

[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.040]
We got $10,000 already.

[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:45.480]
That's close.

[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:48.780]
We're getting closer because I just got a check even though we're not set up to receive them,

[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:49.940]
I'm going to send it to Eric personally.

[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:50.340]
Right.

[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.720]
Someone just came in and gave us a check for $500 for the co-os.

[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:54.460]
Who did that?

[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:54.960]
Greg.

[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.860]
Greg, thanks a lot.

[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.340]
He's always been my favorite.

[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.400]
Haven't I always said to you that there's nothing like Greg Reed,

[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.360]
the biggest booster and supporter of me.

[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.060]
Man, man, Greg, ladies and gentlemen, I hear this guy,

[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.900]
and you want to know why I really commend him on this.

[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.140]
I can't, I'm emotional.

[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.440]
I might just sit here and cry.

[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.500]
You want to know why?

[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:10.800]
Why?

[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.320]
Because he understands that this is our business.

[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.640]
This is the life we have chosen.

[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.960]
And he said so when he was writing out the check.

[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:17.540]
Right.

[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.020]
I mean, this is something that everybody in a business ought to really care about,

[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.320]
which is why it kind of pains me that my colleagues at this radio station

[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.380]
were obsessed with their ball games, which, you know,

[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.960]
they got plenty of time to talk ball games.

[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.880]
It about, you know, J. Feeler and Misty are feeling goody,

[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.020]
whatever that quarterback's name is,

[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.220]
and how Wayne is called, and up Mullen, Rip and Manass.

[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.740]
But in the meantime, you know, where do we stop this?

[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.260]
I mean, they just open up the flood gates of the censorship,

[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.120]
and it's like they're on some kind of a drunken trip now that just gone nuts.

[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.080]
His exact quote.

[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.100]
Yes, let's stop these guys.

[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.760]
All right. Nice going, Greg.

[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.940]
You know, something there is probably the best GM in the history of radio.

[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:52.680]
Greg Reed.

[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.480]
Hope for the future.

[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:53.920]
Believe me.

[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:56.520]
No, I'm Tony. He's finally, he's catching on.

[01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.120]
And I'll tell you one other thing I noticed,

[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.140]
and that is that these clowns appreciate the fact that,

[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.900]
at least on the show, we're trying to make an effort to like, you know,

[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:06.840]
as opposed to some other people in the building.

[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.320]
Oh, my God.

[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.920]
I don't want to say that anything about muffin clearance,

[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.840]
because they're, you know, they're operating within their limited mental capacity.

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:15.720]
You follow what I'm saying?

[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.800]
Mental and emotional capacity.

[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.420]
I think in Clarence's case, underline the mental part,

[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.460]
and in dust case, the emotional part.

[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.040]
See what I'm saying?

[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.180]
There are some bricks missing in both cases.

[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.940]
And of course, in Greg's case, well, that's an other story.

[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.340]
Thanks a lot, Grav. You're the best, baby.

[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.700]
See what a great relationship he and I have my long distance.

[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:35.860]
Right.

[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:37.760]
As long as we don't see each other or talk to each other.

[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:38.260]
Downright.

[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.120]
It can worsen up great.

[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.500]
So 500 bucks more from Greg Reed.

[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.640]
That's a beautiful thing.

[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.020]
Now, how's Eric going to be able to do that?

[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.500]
I'm mailing it. I had, you know, Greg made a check out.

[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.100]
Do you have a little intercourse with Eric to make sure we know how we're going to do this?

[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:53.380]
No, I'm just going to mail Eric the track I had it written out to his company there.

[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.660]
Oh, good. Then, well, then he can help figure out a way.

[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.280]
Eric's a pretty shady.

[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.800]
All those internet people, pretty shady.

[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.320]
So what's our total now, then?

[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.520]
Oh, then, is that going to set up to four grand right there?

[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.440]
What's 30 cents?

[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.000]
What do we have?

[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.840]
37, 38th.

[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.740]
I assume plus this.

[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.080]
42, 38.

[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.020]
So, like, you see, you laughed when I said I want to get to five.

[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.140]
Now, you always want to be the underachiever.

[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:18.980]
Why do you want to do that?

[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.060]
I'll just be a hard-to-create.

[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.380]
I strive for greatness.

[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.680]
You strive for mediocrity.

[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.920]
And that's just because you work at QIM.

[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:24.460]
I'm just being honest.

[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.860]
Don't strive for mediocrity anymore.

[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:26.960]
Strive for greatness.

[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.900]
This summer when you do your fill in this summer.

[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.860]
Don't strive for like the good numbers you had the last couple of summer.

[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.500]
Anyway, forget the other one.

[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:34.820]
Strive for greatness.

[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.660]
Do a 10 share.

[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.200]
Okay.

[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.140]
I'll do a 10 share.

[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:37.740]
Do a 20.

[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.540]
I'm strive for greatness, man.

[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.600]
Although you won't be able to talk about eating fuck but nevertheless.

[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.180]
No.

[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.780]
Maybe Dwight Luttery will come on as a guest.

[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.140]
I got a new religion on pitching.

[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.080]
What is that?

[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:47.660]
Assism.

[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.360]
See, there he goes again.

[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.280]
When surprised me, Maddie Bell is running down the hall.

[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:52.580]
Great.

[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.360]
Kesselhead, check.

[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:53.620]
Great.

[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.440]
You hear what he just said?

[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.320]
He said, ass again.

[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.360]
Maddie Bell.

[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.580]
You're a big number one fan.

[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.220]
Of course you have so many in it building.

[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:00.700]
I know.

[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.660]
And of course, even though he just gave you that $500 check, one thing, even the audience knows.

[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.300]
Break it, too.

[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.180]
But that's beside the point.

[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.380]
I've decided to determine a true drug reggaer.

[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.340]
It's because you lied to me.

[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.320]
Anyway, that's an episode.

[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.400]
It's water over the bridge.

[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.500]
It's another modial.

[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.720]
The other one was already said that he's out of control and just can't help himself.

[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:20.980]
He's just a major ass.

[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.140]
Oh, he can say ass wipe.

[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.140]
Are you sure?

[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:24.720]
All right.

[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.200]
Yeah, don't ask.

[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:26.880]
Just tell.

[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.740]
Okay, don't start asking anymore questions.

[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.660]
I won't ask.

[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.620]
He's a major ass wipe.

[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.860]
Oh, see how you fall into this?

[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.580]
Into a bucket of f***.

[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.820]
So thanks again, Greg.

[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:37.960]
That just made my day.

[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.980]
So we got $4,200.

[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.740]
We'll get $5,000 by the end of the day.

[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.240]
We got two and a half hours to go yet.

[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.520]
Damn it.

[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.200]
WQAM.

[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:44.460]
Hello.

[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.780]
Neil, how are you?

[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:46.540]
Pretty good.

[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.760]
Listen, Dave, I came 100 bucks this morning.

[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:53.320]
And I'm going actually to get some shirts made right now.

[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.240]
Trying to spread the message.

[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.640]
And I just wanted to double check off the top of my head.

[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.240]
The website is definitely stopfccus.com.

[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:06.780]
Stopfcc.us.

[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:12.980]
Stopfccus.com.

[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.860]
Stopfccus.com.

[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.960]
Stopfccus.com.

[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:17.260]
Right.

[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.220]
And the other one is the position one was stopfcc.com.

[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.760]
Stopfcc.com.

[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:22.760]

[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:22.880]
Yeah.

[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:29.180]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:37.260]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.380]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.380]

[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:38.440]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:38.440]

[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:38.440]

[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:38.920]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:39.880]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.300]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.160]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.580]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:49.920]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:50.760]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.860]
That's a good thing.

[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.320]
See, we got some people out there that care.

[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:57.760]
I mean, if even Georgian Greg Reed can come through for us,

[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.560]
all the rest of you bikers out there.

[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.100]
That's bikers with a pee, by the way.

[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.420]
Don't start with that juice stuff.

[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.080]
That's right.

[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.580]
Especially so close to the paysoft.

[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.480]
By the way, do you ever have stale matsu?

[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:10.240]
No, it's always been fun.

[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.760]
Don't ever have stale matsu.

[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:12.080]

[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.140]
That whole paysoft thing, I don't know what I'm going to do about that.

[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.860]
I guess I'm going to have to go get some matsu ball soup.

[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.580]
Make me feel real Jewish for paysoft.

[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.120]
Or you could just let it pass over.

[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.740]
I could let it pass over.

[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.840]
And of course, one of my all time, which I played at the other day,

[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.540]
but only at this time of the year, does it really have the impact that I love.

[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.620]
There's lady and some boy.

[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.900]
She's another dark Jew.

[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.120]
And she needs to buy bread that is unleavened.

[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:48.960]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.860]
And the bread is heaven, he leavened.

[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:59.120]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.660]
And the bread is wonder.

[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.800]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.540]
And the bread is wonder.

[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.400]
Ooh, ooh, and the bread is really wonder.

[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.380]
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.100]
This is 435 City.

[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.920]
You ain't no way.

[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:29.940]
Oh Mr. Raid, there's a gentleman in the very sexy uniform out here wants to see you.

[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.240]
Oh, it must be our friend from the RNC.

[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:32.940]
Send them in.

[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:37.300]
I am here to collect your valentine donation to the Republic in Pasi of George Bush.

[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.020]
Oh sure!

[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.020]
Sure, here.

[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.680]
A will $500 million do?

[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:42.940]
That is acceptable.

[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:43.600]
You'll find.

[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:44.300]

[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.860]
Oh thank goodness we cut back $50 on that pain in the ass, Bokobrata.

[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:49.960]
Here you are.

[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.660]
In the IEC on behalf of the Zleac acquisition you are doing a fine job.

[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.480]
Rati Rakoko will be pleased to hear that.

[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:03.720]
And I can safely assume any programming brought into question will be overlooked.

[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:07.420]
I am afraid I must now ask you to handle the over-adcasting license.

[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.040]
What?

[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.300]
But I just gave you.

[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.720]
Is this about Neil?

[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.720]
Because that can be taken care of.

[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:14.380]
Boolean!

[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.100]
He is no longer in this country.

[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.040]
There is nothing we can do for now.

[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.140]
So what seems to be the problem?

[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.180]
We understand your sports station.

[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:22.720]
Yes.

[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.180]
All American family fun.

[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:25.880]
That's quite.

[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.820]
With every touchdown score.

[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:31.840]
With every basket made, your announcer's do not say,

[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:33.700]
raise your busch out of God.

[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.540]
Well, sports based.

[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.420]
There are sport holes after all.

[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.580]
But they'll understand.

[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:41.640]
I'll tell them.

[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:42.400]
There is no time.

[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.800]
Your license is revolved.

[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.720]
Won't you remove your pants?

[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.000]
Super by pants!

[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.040]
Stack-ah!

[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.000]
No more now, clear channel hooking.

[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.520]
But he moves his pants at once.

[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.060]
So what?

[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.100]
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.720]
We cannot afford to have you leaving your office at the moment.

[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.360]
I thought we had a deal.

[01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.700]
Be great for your life.

[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:00.300]
Goodbye.

[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.100]
Well, he took my pants.

[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:03.960]
Hmm.

[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.900]
I'm sitting here in my armani briefs.

[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.540]
And it's time for my five hour lunch.

[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.780]
And I want my sushi!

[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.100]
I'm a pretty two of five sixty WQ.

[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.420]
I'm on a great opportunity to play Greg's Dohn.

[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:18.860]
I just want to kind of cute one that time.

[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.360]
I wasn't it.

[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.840]
This fact you just sent me.

[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.720]
This one here was one of the great things in history of mankind.

[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.500]
From George Edmanhand and Transfer.

[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:27.780]
Thank you, George.

[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.600]
We'll be in touch.

[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:29.740]
Did you read this?

[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.000]
And it's like in this internee?

[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:34.580]
So thank you for the efforts to support stop at CC.com.

[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.960]
The censorship issue was struck a resident court inside me.

[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.500]
And I want to help.

[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:39.480]
I'm one of the owners of Manhattan Transfer.

[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.740]
I made production post-production company here in South Florida.

[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.880]
I'm volunteering our stages, camera crews, and post-production suites

[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.940]
to a coordinated effort that fights the censorship trend we're experiencing.

[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:53.380]
Our studios and staff and post-sweets are first-rate can produce outstanding products.

[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:58.340]
We still need to find a few components like script writers and the right creative to get the message across.

[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:01.560]
If you're interested in pursuing a media campaign with our help, please contact me.

[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:02.100]
It's got a phone number.

[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:02.880]
We can begin the process.

[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:04.220]
Thank you, George. We'll do it.

[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.880]
In fact, you ought to go out before you go on vacation.

[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.140]
You ought to give this information to Boca-Brine.

[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:09.740]
I will.

[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:10.560]
And Miguel.

[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.100]
I will.

[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.080]
And whoever else, all of these things.

[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:15.620]
All of these things.

[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.360]
Great. Thank you, George. That's fabulous.

[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.480]
Well, you can be sure of the G.

[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.740]
Cable commercial or something.

[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.620]
Yeah, we can do all kinds of stuff.

[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.580]
That's a good idea.

[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.540]
Sid says Romano's macaroni grill.

[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:30.340]
Fae is what Sid says.

[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.020]
Now, I happen to like the macaroni grill.

[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.060]
I'm not the pasta so much, but all the other good stuff.

[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:34.300]
What?

[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.600]
We do like our fine sponsored.

[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.880]
Right. It's one of our fine sponsors, and we like it a lot.

[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.620]
And we've had much of their food and been there many, many times actually paid.

[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:41.440]
But nevertheless, right?

[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.620]
But the Sid is like, he says, Fae.

[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.760]
So we'll put it on there.

[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:46.960]
You know, if it's one of our sponsors, they can handle it.

[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.860]
Not everybody's going to like everything, see?

[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:51.540]
How does it check?

[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.520]
Not Cohen to him, by the way.

[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:53.840]
Huh?

[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.500]
Where's that Motsapizza?

[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:02.340]
Since Skippy was in there this morning, it sure would be nice to Skippy would let me know what's going on with our friend Jeff Cohen to ponytail.

[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.120]
And that Motsapizza that didn't pizza these days, every year at the pay-soft time for the last how many years now.

[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.060]
Motsapizza, the man.

[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:08.380]
Yeah.

[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:11.420]
Now, I'm just shocked that we're like seem to have lost touch with him.

[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.840]
And that's got to be a Skippy thing, you know?

[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.100]
You kind of like Skipped over it.

[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.800]
This is a great fact.

[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:16.980]
TGI Fridays.

[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:22.980]
It says noisy cheese covered, grizzly, stale, perky, contrab, yummy want to be slugged.

[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.360]
This is the greatest.

[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.980]
Yuppie want to be slugged.

[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.960]
I can't even read it.

[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.600]
Slug pit of the spare.

[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:35.320]
Oh, what a line.

[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.820]
The slug pit of the spare.

[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:39.680]
Woo!

[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:46.960]
The gripsing and farting after the meal is the only consolation after dropping 40 bucks from the meal.

[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:52.560]
For two plus tip to leave some button covered piece of crap punk who smiles right through your face.

[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.120]
A phase, what it's said.

[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.080]
A slug pit of the spare.

[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.860]
Why that just hit my funny bone, huh?

[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:02.320]
Wow.

[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.120]
Oh, God.

[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:05.720]
What a line.

[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.440]
Son of a t-don't like it, huh?

[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:12.520]
What is the worst sit down restaurant chain in America, no drive-through?

[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.460]
That's what separates the men from the go-am.

[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.960]
Denny's 91, the out of the garden, I told you, is moving up there 50.

[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.720]
Fae is the operative word.

[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.040]
Applebee's 43.

[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:23.960]
IHOP 35.

[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.640]
Waffle House 32, Pizza 18, Chili's 18.

[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.040]
Piggatella Campanira's 17, Showney's 17.

[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.880]
Shownoff, Morrison's 15.

[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.320]
The Meltingpod 14.

[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:36.200]
Now you had a bad experience that I want to North Miami Beach, that's no longer there.

[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:36.780]
Right.

[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.280]
The Meltingpod I always thought was pretty good.

[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.560]
But you don't like it.

[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:44.040]
Maybe if they actually paid attention to you, acknowledge your presence, gave you some food.

[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.800]
When you had that service, okay?

[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.800]
That's when you hated it.

[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:47.400]
That's your health.

[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:52.680]
The Red Lobster, which give you teeny tiny portions and just rip you off like crazy is what I'm told.

[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:53.460]
But what do I know?

[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:54.260]
13.

[01:18:54.680 --> 01:19:01.560]
Perkins Pancake House 8, Raskel House 7, floodruckers 5, the Cracker Barrel 4, Golden Carrel 4, Fridays has got a pair.

[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.860]
Two for Benagans, one for Stukies, and none yet for Bobby Rubino's Tony Romas and the Macaroni Grill 405.

[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.560]
That's what we got so far.

[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.000]
In fact, Reagan inspired me.

[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.980]
Now I don't want to like lean on all the people they're in the building.

[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:18.560]
But it would seem to me since everybody in the business in this market listens to this show religiously.

[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:19.900]
Oh God!

[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.480]
That since this is your livelihood that we're talking about and even those of you who work for a cheap channel who may be listening right now.

[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.040]
You can see where I'm going with this.

[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.180]
Where are you going?

[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.840]
That they ought to be on a bandwagon and since they can't be doing it publicly,

[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.180]
and since we of course keep confidential names of anybody and everybody who doughnates,

[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.340]
they could participate in this and help us to very surreptitiously behind the scenes.

[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:46.880]
By getting out the whipping out their visa, American Express or Mastercard and going to stop FCC.us.

[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:50.160]
Right?

[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:51.160]
Right.

[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.080]
And don't need 50 or 100 or whatever they want to do.

[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:58.600]
In fact, I think a lot of people sitting in that building right there by you ought to be doing it right now instead of hyperventilating,

[01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.560]
well, what are we going to do?

[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.340]
I think they ought to be taking the lead from Greg Reed, don't you?

[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.080]
I mean, you're making the big bucks like Greg.

[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:09.020]
They ought to be getting out their credit card and sticking 100 on there or a couple of 100.

[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.600]
I think that would be a magnificent idea.

[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:15.540]
We'll get up to five grand today by the end of the day with it and just like falling off the log and here when I said that,

[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.220]
you just laughed me right off my seat.

[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.740]
They're all going to laugh at you!

[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:19.300]
Exactly.

[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:25.600]
Then thing I could do, just like every time we try to get the goose up the number right at petition drive on stop FCC.com.

[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.220]
Oh, we're never going to do that.

[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.940]
Of course, then you started playing psychology, but you didn't think we could get to 5,000.

[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.700]
Well, no, you couldn't have predicted the Greg Reed principle.

[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.260]
No.

[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:40.240]
No, but I knew that if I keep banging away sooner or later I'll embarrass some people that are getting in on this.

[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.780]
It's not just a neo-rodger thing.

[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.640]
It sure is how it ain't just a Howard Stern thing.

[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.320]
It's not a Mohawar David thing.

[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:45.720]
Absolutely.

[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:46.640]
You have to remember damn sure.

[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:47.840]
3833.

[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.520]
No, no, that's not correct.

[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:51.660]
That's...

[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:52.360]
Plus the 500.

[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:53.880]
Plus the 500.

[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.060]
I'm just reading the figure that coming across.

[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.320]
Well, he's not excluding the 500.

[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.980]
Obviously, he couldn't be because we started out with like 36.

[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:00.380]
Correct.

[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.360]
So it's 4333, so we need 667.

[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:07.360]
Oh, it's a good thing we didn't need 666.

[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:08.400]
That would be really bad.

[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.740]
667 by 2 o'clock.

[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.360]
We can do it.

[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.560]
A couple of 50s here in here, maybe somebody with a hundred, maybe with a couple of hundred.

[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.400]
Maybe somebody with 500 like Greg.

[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:22.320]
Maybe some people inside the building are going to log onto what right now and donate 100 very seroplicious thing quietly.

[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.320]
Like Duff and Clarence.

[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.840]
And Kib Skurvy, who's a good guy, huh?

[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.240]
Anybody in a radio business ought to be involved in this.

[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.480]
See, like I said before, like this thing about the NAB conference.

[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:34.880]
And they're going to have a code of conduct.

[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.220]
Screw the NAB, okay?

[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.940]
National Association of Broadcasts.

[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.180]
You're the biggest bunch of pansies that ever came down to pike.

[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:40.900]
You're tragic.

[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:44.120]
I'm embarrassed that I'm even in a business because of you people.

[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.100]
Every time the FCC says, rule over.

[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.980]
You say, oh, how many times, sir?

[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:49.640]
How many times?

[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.680]
They say, jump.

[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.920]
How high can I do it, you know?

[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.760]
Just a big bunch of nothings.

[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:56.620]
No backbone.

[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.400]
And if Stern really wanted to see, this is what it just aggravates.

[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.860]
I don't know why I keep repeating this, but it just bugs the hell out of me.

[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.180]
Guys, making 30 million a year.

[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:11.340]
And instead of making a martyr out of himself and you know, how would Stern on the cross like Jesus and all this?

[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:14.980]
Why not really take the bull by the horns and then lead the way, okay?

[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:20.560]
With all the millions of people he's got listening every day, those 36 or 37 markets, but he's not doing it.

[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.580]
Because if he were, you'd see a reflection on there on those petitions.

[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.660]
So you just know that the people who are in a position to really be leading the way aren't doing it.

[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.000]
But like I said, got all these people in the business sitting out there, the Davy Gravy lines of the world.

[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:39.300]
All these other people, I got a few bucks, you know, I just, I don't know where his name came from, just popped into my mind, you know?

[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:41.260]
Right?

[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:41.840]
Right.

[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:48.420]
The Paul Castronov is the world who work for Chief Channel, but I'm sure behind the scenes hate them like poison because they're always looking for another job.

[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:49.420]
Oh, sorry.

[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.680]
The William Tanner's of the world who are helping the Spanish language stations, but stabbing us in a back.

[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.980]
Even though I know he did sign that petition.

[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:03.580]
21 till noon, I get a little whipped up today.

[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.120]
Oh right.

[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.520]
Absolutely, positively.

[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:06.980]
Oh!

[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:08.080]
About freaking time.

[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.440]
I'm finding a local PCC 560.

[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:13.300]
The radio is on your side.

[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.260]
You am.

[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.040]
Come everybody.

[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:20.500]
Here.

[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.540]
Here.

[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:33.640]
We now woke up this morning.

[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.660]
A year no star was there, the zoning.

[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:39.140]
Not just.

[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.960]
As the guard would happen to me.

[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.180]
He said that from now on you be.

[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.500]
Join in our guests.

[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.920]
I took a break train to the shower.

[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.360]
Oi!

[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.180]
I took a break train to the shower.

[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:13.840]
Box calls will with men with boys and girls.

[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.260]
Say hello, Muriana.

[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.300]
In the previous nation, in the world.

[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.880]
You know I never paid it much attention.

[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:32.960]
How much things would change?

[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.160]
If thought we were set on automatic.

[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.340]
If I've never had anything.

[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.100]
That it could happen here.

[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.580]
Got my ride in the box called.

[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:53.120]
Cos my boat is called.

[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.980]
It's all the wrong side.

[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.620]
Made it night, it's hard to sleep.

[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:07.120]
With all the decent, grass and squeeze.

[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:09.380]
As they pass.

[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:11.400]
Woohoo!

[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:17.620]
I took a break train to the shower.

[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:24.820]
Baby I took a break train to the shower.

[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:31.020]
Box calls will with men with boys and girls.

[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:35.980]
In the previous nation.

[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.780]
I took a break train to the shower.

[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.280]
I'm 45, 15 till noon.

[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.140]
I'm going to get a free bar of soap too when we go.

[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:47.760]
Don't drop it.

[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.180]
Nice to meet you.

[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:52.500]
I was told he was okay in his own way.

[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.200]
How about Clarence?

[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:57.280]
I don't know.

[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:58.500]
The hump is not there today.

[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.440]
He's probably on vacation.

[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:05.680]
We need your cash.

[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.260]
What about the mad dog?

[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:10.320]
Let's go.

[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:12.540]
Let's turn loose with cash.

[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.520]
We're part one of the visas and register cards.

[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.000]
Stop FCC.us.

[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.380]
Probably shouldn't be saying US because I think maybe there's like a period in there.

[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.380]
Stop FCC.us.

[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.760]
The Son of Orange County, chairman of the Thorn County, Florida, Orlando.

[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:35.600]
Rich Crowdy is getting nationwide attention after being featured on David Letterman's late show.

[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.820]
Yawning, twitting, and falling asleep at rally for president W.

[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.720]
He was tape standing behind the president checking his watch, stretching and basically dead on his feet.

[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.060]
The late show skid ended some of the funnier moments from the video into the bit.

[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:55.480]
Chairman Crowdy to a local TV6 news in Orlando Thursday that he was afraid that Letterman's skip would hurt his son's feelings.

[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.000]
But the boy thought it was hysterical.

[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.340]
It was the best.

[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:03.180]
What we had was a few yawns, a few looking at the watches over a 45 minute period.

[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.860]
And Letterman had that edited down to a 30 second piece and frankly it was hysterical.

[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:07.400]
How many seconds?

[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.540]
About 30, man.

[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.580]
Crowdy said his son was tired during the rally because he was so excited to see the president.

[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.560]
So in other words, it was for real except they just edited it down.

[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.900]
It happened over a longer period of time.

[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.140]
A little bit for effect.

[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:21.000]
Nice going, air Dave.

[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.460]
Good job.

[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.780]
How about Letterman putting in about 50 grand on this, huh?

[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.940]
He's making 30 million a year.

[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.080]
Here's a radio accident report from a Fort Lauderdale liberal atheist against Bush.

[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.260]
Radio accident report.

[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:38.380]
I turned on WIOD when you had to stop your show so the Marlins game could be broadcast.

[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.740]
Occasionally switch to that channel, see what kind of B. S.T.R.R. wing is spouting.

[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:42.560]
Don't do it again.

[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.100]
What do I hear during a commercial spot for some kind of calcium product?

[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.960]
Not other than Phil Henry.

[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:50.680]
Are you sure?

[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.920]
The kicker is that he begins this spot by saying how much he likes Rush.

[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.800]
And how much Rush is taught him about radio broadcasting.

[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.100]
Maybe that's what all those bottles were that he was leaving around at the IOD.

[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:02.700]
Rush?

[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:04.240]
Maybe it was Rush.

[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.940]
How much Rush is taught him about, oh that was Mr. Ego, about radio broadcasting.

[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.540]
What a sell out bull it says here.

[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.600]
And you're absolutely correct, out-ragic.

[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.580]
That's why I'm at Pulley took yesterday.

[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:17.900]
That's nostalgia.

[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.360]
People saying, oh Phil Henry is the best talk host in America.

[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:21.740]
But you're in a totally opinion.

[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.320]
Once upon a time I would have said, hey, no problem to argument with that.

[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:25.740]
He's great.

[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.720]
But he has totally sold out all of his principles.

[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.980]
He's become a right-wing parrot for Chief Channel and the abushmised are in it to disgrace.

[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:39.680]
See one good thing about it for him I guess though is because his act being a whole phony deal anyway with the phony voices,

[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.000]
it never depended on having any credibility.

[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:42.980]
He never had any.

[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:47.480]
So the idea that politically he's gone way off the deep end of the deep right.

[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.180]
I guess he doesn't care because he had no credibility anyway.

[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:54.340]
Gay students settled Settles Lesbian Barbie case.

[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:06.340]
An openly gay teenager in New York received a $30,000 settlement from the city over her suspension for wearing a Barbie as a Lesbian t-shirt to school her attorney out here.

[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.100]
Remember that story?

[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:07.540]
Yes.

[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:14.000]
Natalie Young, now 15 in the high school wore the shirt to middle school in April of 2002,

[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.260]
leading school officials to center home for the day despite the absence of any official dress code.

[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.200]
They saw the t-shirt go home.

[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:20.720]
Bye.

[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.340]
The teen said the settlement should make life easier on other openly gay schools.

[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.700]
So I think they should feel more comfortable about who they are.

[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:32.680]
Young was pulled from class by the school principal in order to sit in an office until she changed the shirt.

[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.620]
When she refused, she was suspended for the day.

[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:42.380]
Young's lawyer Ron Kuby filed a federal suit last year and leds him the incident with part of a series of discriminatory incidents.

[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:47.080]
Resolving the suit without litigation was the appropriate decision city attorney Donna and Kazbaum said

[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:51.500]
the city department of education agreed to establish a policy on student dress as part of the deal.

[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:58.240]
So while you guys out there be sure where the right dress when you go to school and school and hop into pool.

[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:03.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, we're looking for chains man for good chains.

[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:04.940]
Yeah.

[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:09.400]
Anybody call about the CMQ thing and nobody's going to give us any information about that.

[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.240]
Well why are you laughing?

[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:13.020]
I don't think we have a lot of crossover just that one guy.

[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.080]
We got some cross-dressers.

[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.080]
Well.

[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.680]
Especially your people.

[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.060]
Oh look at that speaking of that.

[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.560]
Well you last month at the fastest pace in nearly four years.

[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:27.080]
The Bush Channing Campaign says the number show, the president's pro-gross policies are working.

[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.760]
And that's John Kerrywood derail America.

[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:30.200]
Right.

[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:30.720]
There you go.

[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:31.040]
Sure.

[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:36.340]
We won't talk about the fact unemployment went back up to 5.7% because so many people have given up looking for jobs.

[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.320]
We don't want to talk about that.

[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:37.540]
No.

[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:38.040]

[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.060]
Just pick the stats for many one month that looks really really good in the studies.

[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.420]
Hey, look at this great job we're doing.

[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:47.060]
Anyway, what is the worst sit down restaurant chain in America?

[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.420]
No drive-through.

[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:49.400]
That's going to be the prerequisite.

[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.680]
That separates the non-qualifiers from the good ones.

[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.540]
Denny's 101.

[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:55.940]
Olive Garden's 63.

[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:57.420]
Look at the moves that they're making.

[01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.180]
Didn't I predict that?

[01:30:59.040 --> 01:30:59.820]
Yes you did.

[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:03.020]
Applebee's 47 and Josh says deservedly so.

[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:04.920]
Waffle House 41.

[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.180]
IHOP 39.

[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:08.900]
YouHOP is a gun on you.

[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.480]
Pizza Hut 21.

[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:14.600]
Show me these 19.

[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.220]
Oh, whatever happened to the ranch house.

[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.220]
Bring it back.

[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:20.440]

[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:30.080]
Fud Rutgers 6.

[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:31.420]
You know what I said?

[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.480]
I heard it.

[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:34.620]
Friday's 5.

[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:35.600]
Beriggins 2.

[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:36.480]
Beriggins?

[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:36.860]
Vendigan.

[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:37.500]
Daniel Beriggins.

[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.380]
Never Father Beriggins?

[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:38.500]
No.

[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:39.820]

Macaroni Grillsga 1.

[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.180]
Bobby Reno's done a 464 vote.

[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:51.220]
And I'm sure there's like zillions of other chains that we don't even have thought of yet.

[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.020]
Human chains.

[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.500]
Like that black amus.

[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.700]
They're probably not still in business anymore.

[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:55.200]
No, not.

[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:56.500]
Well, good for them.

[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.260]
That's another one where they used to have like cheese on the seat.

[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.220]
Somebody, I think it was cheese.

[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:02.020]
Somebody QA and hello.

[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:02.440]
Not there.

[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:03.080]
Line 1, man.

[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:05.740]
It's just, I apologize to all the people that try to call a line 1.

[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.440]
Don't do that anymore.

[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:08.200]
WQA and hello.

[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:09.780]
Hello.

[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:10.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.720]
Is this Neil or George?

[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:13.540]
Neil.

[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:14.320]
Last time I checked.

[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:14.800]

[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:16.220]
You just picked it up.

[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.200]
I've never happened before.

[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.140]
Neil, you just picked up.

[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:19.180]
I pick up cold.

[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:19.400]

[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.040]
Hey, how about the hops?

[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.700]
You never put hops on there?

[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:23.860]
Is hops still around?

[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.060]
I think so.

[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:25.940]
Yeah, you never.

[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:26.120]
Yeah, you never.

[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.040]
Another former sponsor, mine.

[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:28.940]
I say with great shame.

[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:30.000]
Oh, they were.

[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.900]
I got twice their terrible.

[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:34.020]
In fact, I think they knew Mata was winning doubt.

[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:34.820]
Hop right out.

[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.180]
Neil, I'm going to hide.

[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:41.400]
I don't know if I'm going to get in trouble for this, but I'm a sales rep that CMQ.

[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:42.400]
Really?

[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:43.000]
Yeah.

[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:43.800]
Are you serious?

[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.380]
Yeah, I'm totally serious.

[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:52.040]
We play classic Spanish from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the more 70s and 80s.

[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.420]
And then we have a show on in the afternoon.

[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.420]
I just go for the F-stack.

[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.560]
English, disco from five to six.

[01:32:58.940 --> 01:32:59.460]
Inc and A.

[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.300]
But so the station's doing well.

[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:02.080]
Thank you.

[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.300]
How do you explain the sudden surge?

[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:08.220]
I mean, you guys came from almost nowhere and you're just kicking everybody's ass.

[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:08.620]
I know.

[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:11.120]
It's been well for the last guy.

[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.560]
I'd saved up the last, you know, four books.

[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:18.300]
And this one we got, we got the trends yesterday from our directors and it's amazing.

[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:22.920]
Do a lot of Spanish people down here as you know?

[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.360]
A very perspicacious observation on your part.

[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.100]
Thank you.

[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:28.680]
That's why I'm a.

[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.600]
Who are some of the artists that you're, I mean, he'd give me dates, but like who are some of the artists that you're playing?

[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.580]
I'm the one who's going to go in the building.

[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:36.980]
I don't know who the artist is.

[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:38.780]
Excellent.

[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:40.020]
All right.

[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:41.480]
Keep up the good work, Kelly.

[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:42.760]
Thank you. Have a good weekend, you two.

[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.300]
Thanks, Mike.

[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.200]
And now that was great.

[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:44.600]
I got it.

[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:45.680]
And I see I like that.

[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.960]
There's a guy that's got a sense of humor.

[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.020]
He's a sales hole over there.

[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.800]
He doesn't know from any of those artists.

[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.000]
He's speaking in English, but he's selling the stuff.

[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.660]
You know, look, you don't have to eat the hamburgers to sell them.

[01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:55.140]
You know what I mean?

[01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:57.340]
He's still, we still haven't answered that.

[01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:58.620]
About what?

[01:33:58.900 --> 01:33:59.960]
About what kind of music?

[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:00.840]
About who the artist is.

[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.340]
I don't, I have no idea.

[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:06.200]
I mean, if I knew I'd go Russian right out this weekend and buy some Russian music, I mean,

[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:08.340]
buy some, you were always the expert on Spanish music.

[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.080]
I sure hope that I'm playing a Ricky Martin.

[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:14.440]
Well, no, he said it's older than that, right?

[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.900]
He said 5070s, mostly.

[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:18.600]
Yeah.

[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:19.660]
Pre-Ricky Martin.

[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:23.100]
Well, Ricky Martin was in Manudo when all the pedophiles were chasing him.

[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:26.340]
Well, they were playing Manudo in like old Luis Miguel from when he was a Manudo.

[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:27.800]
I see.

[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.200]
But Luis Miguel was not in Manudo.

[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:30.740]
I thought he was.

[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:31.600]
No, he was not.

[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.360]
He was just a punk in that movie about to run around naked.

[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:36.960]
5670560, pound 560.

[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:41.600]
And I always got that huge, but he got rid of huge pain in the butt and that was Mariah Carey.

[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:43.660]
He said, man, you think John Carey is scary.

[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:45.200]
Just take a look at Mariah Carey.

[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:45.900]
Wow.

[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:50.660]
With that one gigantic boob right there in the middle of her, where her naval is supposed to be.

[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.200]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:53.940]
Yeah, I'll speak to Neil.

[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:54.540]
Speaking.

[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:55.840]
Neil.

[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:56.440]
Yeah.

[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.020]
Well, I spoke to you several times.

[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.820]
I used to work in Project Reconnaissance Chicago and stuff like that.

[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:02.860]
Oh, and I was a radio.

[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:09.500]
But I got the perfect campaign for the campaign you're going to start against Bush.

[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:10.040]
Right.

[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.140]
What if you show a split screen?

[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:13.160]
Campaign.

[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:19.240]
I'm talking in that campaign speech that scenes are all right with Clinton, but they're going to get better with me.

[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:25.440]
Have up there a statistical fact of how many kids from all of these Republicans are.

[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:33.060]
In the war in Iran and so how many regular Americans have got killed while they are all out here.

[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:39.560]
They're going to all these political affairs while the average American is over there struggling for money.

[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:44.000]
And his kids over and being not are not being offered in the Iran being killed.

[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.760]
But he says he's taking care of us.

[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.740]
Well, listen, say how did Jack Rickhouse, okay?

[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.860]
Tell my thought his work was just horrible.

[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8 pound fire.

[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.400]
What do you think of that idea?

[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:57.760]
Iran, but I didn't run fast enough again.

[01:35:58.860 --> 01:35:59.160]
No.

[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:01.420]
Olive Garden, I think, makes hitched innings.

[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:02.200]
This is going to be exciting.

[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.240]
104 to 68, which sounds like a big gap.

[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:05.440]
Now, what have we got there on the screen?

[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:06.900]
What says Eric giving any new numbers?

[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.560]
Because I think we're going to make the 5 grand today.

[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:10.580]
No, 38, 33 was lost.

[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:11.960]
And that's it.

[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:13.600]
I mean, I'm sure there's more by now.

[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:14.660]
43, 33, 33.

[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:15.660]
I'm sure there's other trickling.

[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:17.860]
Not that we want to start again after that thing he had yesterday.

[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:18.780]
Poor Eric up there.

[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:19.760]
Whoa, man.

[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:21.140]
It was a rough day.

[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.100]
And if you don't believe me, just ask him, he'll tell you.

[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.540]
Let me find an English language article, but I think I'm writing you wrong for once.

[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:27.500]
About what?

[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.840]
Luis Miguel was in Manudo.

[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.680]
I'm going to tell you right now, I'll bet Josh Cortes' life on it that Luis Miguel was not in Manudo.

[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.220]
How about 100 bucks instead?

[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:37.900]
No.

[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:38.540]
All right.

[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:40.200]
You already got your washer dryers.

[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.580]
Don't push your luck.

[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:42.780]
Smart ass.

[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:44.960]
Now, where are you getting that from?

[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.020]
Well, I'm finding all these articles and that's fine.

[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:47.600]
You'll about it.

[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.560]
I'm trying to find one in English.

[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:50.660]
I did that single one time ago.

[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.060]
That thing.

[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:51.580]
Are you saying what?

[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:52.380]
That he was in Manudo?

[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:53.700]
Yeah, the first generation.

[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.500]
Good luck finding one in English.

[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.340]
I just typed it in and it nothing happened.

[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:06.280]
One moment, please folks.

[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:09.060]
There you go.

[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:11.960]
A little Hootie Cootie would be up to a 40 share by a 12-30.

[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.460]
I guarantee you that I'll find this because this is brand new baby.

[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:16.480]
I'll ride it.

[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.080]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:17.660]
Oh.

[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.280]
La Casa de Luis Miguel.

[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.640]
Here you'll find everything you'll know about Luis, how big his ass is,

[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.040]
why he dumped that bitch, Mariah Carey, how many guys he's been doing lately.

[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:28.900]
Here he is.

[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:29.580]
There's a big picture.

[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.660]
Well, he still looks pretty good.

[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:32.600]
But where's the biography?

[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:33.320]
Here we go.

[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.220]
I bet you I get to it before you do it because it's in English.

[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:35.220]

[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:35.540]
Sure.

[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:36.700]
Well, it's in English.

[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.940]
After 20 years of career, Luis Miguel has obtained practically all the prizes.

[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:41.960]
Yadi, yadi, yadi.

[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.700]
Honour is honors and this and quality and et cetera.

[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.240]
Well, what is that?

[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.380]
Well, what does that say?

[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.020]
I don't understand what that says.

[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.620]
This is the worst frickin' website.

[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:55.980]
That's a nice picture, though, there.

[01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:57.080]
Luis still looks pretty human.

[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.000]
I was missing old pictures.

[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:59.720]
I don't know what this is.

[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:00.820]
I can't find it.

[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:03.040]
I got an idea.

[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:04.000]
Why don't you look up the Nudo?

[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:05.340]
That's what I did.

[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:06.320]
And what did it say?

[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.280]
Luis Miguel was in the Nudo.

[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.300]
I'm really in the articles in Spanish.

[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:08.580]

[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.640]
And they say Luis Miguel?

[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:11.040]
Yes, Juan Pesor.

[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.700]
It's in a little, a little minuto.

[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.020]
Does it say Luis Miguel was in the Nudo or not?

[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:16.980]
Yes.

[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:17.540]

[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:18.560]
God.

[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.780]
I think that's more of a propaganda.

[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:24.140]
Don't forget, by the way, in South Florida, he's Mexican and Italian.

[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.780]
Okay, so forget about him.

[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:32.020]
We're sports radio five CC, QAM.

[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:35.500]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:38.340]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:38:38.340 --> 01:39:08.320]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.780]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:24.760]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:30.260]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:31.060]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:31.060]

[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:31.060]

[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:31.140]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:32.340]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:36.760]

[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.320]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:39:38.320 --> 01:40:08.280]
The 12 to 1 hour on QAM.

[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.740]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:13.040]
her cold neck, her cold feet.

[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.960]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.600]
her driver's disc, her daughter likes her G.

[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.400]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:30.040]
she goes in and goes through the horrors of the moon.

[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.580]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:37.500]
her cold feet.

[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:47.200]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:49.020]
her cold feet.

[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:55.760]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:56.220]
her cold feet.

[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:25.800]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.200]
her cold feet.

[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:26.200]

[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:26.200]

[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:26.200]

[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:26.200]

[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:37.700]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:41.840]
her cold feet.

[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:41.840]

[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:41.840]

[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:53.780]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.260]
her cold feet.

[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:20.800]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.720]
her cold feet.

[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.240]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:23.400]
her cold feet.

[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:25.240]
She's the one who tests the fire,

[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:29.160]
who's just a squeezing, where's my good buddy Troy de Bois with a bald head huh?

[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:33.560]
Old Troy Stratford there. He's still a stiffened as old Jacques Strat back in the sales department

[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:40.140]
screw in. Let's go you guys, let's hop on it okay. Stop FCC.us. Can you spell US?

[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:49.160]
Go spell it out for him okay? Write it on his forehead. Now what is that direct, see

[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:54.740]
I've screwed up my whole computer now with that crap. I can't get back on my home page

[01:42:54.740 --> 01:43:02.940]
here. Oh I see because the first, how did that get to be my home, my home page? Uh-oh.

[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.400]
You know what I mean? How did that happen?

[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:13.000]
Spyware. What do you mean by that? You think? That's what does that. Oh my God. Now I'm

[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.500]
not a security page. I don't want to see Jerry Hallowell. I don't want to see that.

[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:24.720]
Oh look at there she is. There's like six of them there. Six for the price of one. I

[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.760]
mean that lovely spice girl. So what the hell do I do now? I'm all worried about during

[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.500]
the break. But how can that happen? I don't know. Do you think that was really spyware?

[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:41.580]
Did I like to cover my other thing? Yes. It was Spanish spyware. See the SP? 560560

[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:45.660]
pound 560. In fact, maybe we wouldn't, wouldn't SP for this performance. I don't think so.

[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:52.340]
Ask Romi. WQA and hello. Yes sir. Hey, I think they're one of your sponsors, but

[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:57.400]
is anyone sent out back? The outback? The outback doesn't have any drive through. That's

[01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:02.560]
a good choice. So overrated. Yeah, I know a lot of people that are just nauseous from

[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.300]
the outback. Okay, we'll put them on there, Pally. Thank you. Okay, let me just see something

[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:18.060]
here. Okay, let me just try. I got to get my look at that. This page cannot be displayed.

[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:26.100]
Oh my God. My whole computer. My whole life is just gone. How is this possible? I've

[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:35.060]
punched in Neil God. Oh, yeah. What is that? Neil God? Oh, wrong website. No, no, but seriously,

[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:43.400]
how did how did something come up there? I don't know. Why are I do? And this is our year

[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:50.560]
fall, by the way, Mr. Julio, I planned another Spanish plot. We have this. I guess you

[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:56.940]
do invading my computer. Shame on you. There's stop FCC.us. Looks really good. What do we

[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:01.680]
got? 4528? Well, I 5,000 by the end of the show. If I have to stick around and write

[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:07.280]
to check myself 522 votes on the pool. Thank God, at least I can get back on this. What

[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:12.740]
is the worst sit down restaurant in America? Chain. Now the drive through. Denny's 108.

[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:20.540]
Olive Garden 74. Making a big move. Applebee's 52. Waffle loss 46. I hop 41. Show

[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:27.820]
me his 22. Pizza of 21. Chili's got 20. Pick it up. A cafeteria 20. Read lobster 19. Morrison's

[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:32.960]
17. Melting pub 15. Cracker Braille doesn't. Rascal loss 11. The golden corral 9. I still

[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:38.340]
know what that is. Is that like that picking chicken place? It's like a big buffet. Oh, is

[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:42.200]
it really? Yeah, I think it's good. Actually, they got cut meat and mashed potatoes and

[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:48.900]
whatever. Mashed taters. Sounds like really for goyum. That's why Josh goes there. Perkins

[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:54.140]
pancake. I say fun. Rucker six. Stukies five. Fridays five. Benagans five. Macaroni

[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:59.340]
Grills got four. That I'm speechless. Tony Rome is one. Hops is one. And none yet for

[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:02.920]
the outback or Bobby Romino's. But the outback just went on to they'll get some. There

[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:07.740]
are people who are like they either like that place a lot or they're hostile. Hostile.

[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:13.140]
They don't like their meat. WQ and hello. Yes, the snail Roger sounds like me. Yes. Okay,

[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:19.900]
Neil. You should get a copy of the theme song from the TV show. The Flintstones. So

[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:24.240]
before you talk about either the Bush administration or the Republican party, you could play that

[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.660]
theme song first. Let's fit right in the Flintstones. The Flintstones, right? If you don't

[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:33.220]
have an action, I must be missing something. If you listen to the song, you'll see what

[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:37.860]
I mean. Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Let's listen to the Flintstones. What do you

[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:50.240]
say? Okay. I bet I got it. Yeah. Gay old time. Is that what he's talking about? I just

[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:57.060]
had to run back here and get my TV themes. You got it? No cartoons. Let's say there's

[01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:07.320]
a pop-eye, the Jetsons. What is that crap that you're playing by? It's new. It's classic

[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:13.880]
meets Cuba. Sounds like crap to me. Now what's the one that he said I should find? The Flintstones.

[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:43.800]
I think we got what I'm talking about. Okay. Great. Good job, Pally. Fight

[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.980]
away. George says whatever you've got, he'd like to get some of it too. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:53.700]
pound 5, 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. So sad. I made the effort. Hey, listen, I'm

[01:47:53.700 --> 01:48:00.260]
easily had no problem. That's what I've heard. Yeah. Prosecutors are said to have expanded

[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:05.160]
inquiry into League of C.I. officers name. Prosecutors investigating whether someone in the

[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.760]
Bush administration improperly disclosed the identity of a C.I. officer have expanded

[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:13.020]
their inquiry to examine whether White House officials lied to investigators or mishandled

[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.080]
or classified information related to the case lawyers involved in the case and government

[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:20.440]
officials say in looking at violations beyond the original focus of the inquiry would

[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:24.220]
sit it on a rarely used statue that makes it a felony to disclose the identity of an undercover

[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:28.520]
intelligence officer intentionally. Prosecutors have widened the range of conduct under scrutiny

[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:33.200]
and for the first time raised the possibility of bringing charges peripheral to the League

[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:40.720]
itself. Can we say League? No. Peripheral to the itself. And you're like that. 5, 6, 7,

[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:45.400]
0, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. I'm so distraught in my

[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:50.920]
whole over a minute when Luis Miguel and my computers like all on the blog screwed up.

[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:58.300]
It is during the break I would do this long commercial race we got to take a moment or two

[01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:04.560]
and try to put the pieces back together again. Everybody QAAM? Hello? Yeah. How about the

[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:11.600]
Alhouse for the survey? The Alhouse? The Alhouse. Right. The Rale Alhouse. The Coral Springs

[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.240]
Alhouse. Food there is terrible. Okay. You got it, man. Thank you. Thanks. No further

[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:21.320]
again. I don't think I ever heard of the Alhouse. Did you? Sure. Go there often. You do?

[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:26.740]
Yeah. Often enough. You like it? It's fine. What do they got besides Al? I don't know.

[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:33.280]
Beer obviously. Lots of beer and probably beer. You know, things like that. I think it's

[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:38.920]
good for what ails you. It's got funky burgers like mushrooms, Swiss burgers. I like that.

[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:43.260]
They got pasta. They got seafood. Yeah. But it's, you know, it's middle of the road

[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.800]
fair. It ain't fancy. You can go there and go there. In other words, it's for shleppers

[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:50.540]
like you. Right. Well, so what's not to like? It's fine most of the time. Okay. But we'll

[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:53.960]
put it on there because whatever they say, it's their taste. It's not our taste. If

[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:57.820]
we like it, maybe we just got bad taste. Who knows? Taste this. If one of this past

[01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:59.980]
note at 560 QA, let me fix that thing.

[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:06.420]
I'm in love. This is sports radio by city. You way. Yeah.

[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:13.700]
The Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority, Neil God. Coming up tonight,

[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:19.060]
on Inside the Behind the True Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story. He was one

[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:24.260]
half of a hugely successful 80-singuing duo. And even though both of them are out of

[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:33.160]
the world now, it just seemed like more fun to pick on John Oatts. Nobody remembers me

[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:37.700]
because I wasn't the pretty one like Darryl Hall. Let's face it, I look like a cross between

[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:42.820]
Freddie Mercury and Billy Bob Thornton. John Oatts, Unrelenting Bitterness and Tragic

[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:48.960]
Loser Status provide exactly the kind of demeaning, sphincter tightening awkwardness. We love

[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:53.400]
here at Inside the Behind. Well, I'm here to tell the world that I'm back with an all-new

[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:59.080]
show I simply call an Oatts. I'm sorry? An Oatts featuring all the parts of the

[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:03.380]
Holland Oatts songs that I made famous. Parts you made famous. I'm not sure I understand

[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:09.120]
it. Like KISS on my list. Because you're KISS. Because you're KISS. I get that. I see that.

[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:14.940]
Because you're KISS. Oh my god. Or Man-eater. Whoa, here she comes. Right, guy. Whoa, here

[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:23.300]
she comes. Sure. Yep. Whoa, here. We stop. Rich girl. Rich girl. Rich girl. Rich girl.

[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:30.900]
Rich girl. Rich girl. Rich girl. Rich girl. Yeah. Oh, Mr. Oatts. Oh, Mr. Oatts. Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:36.440]
Is he singing just the backup again? Oh, it's so tragic and embarrassing. But that's what

[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:43.840]
you guys like, right? John Oatts, if they gave an award for a second banana. Hey, FCC, I said

[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:50.420]
banana. Go ahead. Find me. It's a big juicy shopping went. Look at your business tonight.

[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:54.360]
Uninside the behind. Well, I forgot to mention this before because we got so much

[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:57.360]
crap going on with my computer getting dittled around which thanked the goodness for my

[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:02.460]
technical expertise. I got it all straight and out again. You know, that broad that was supposedly

[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:05.980]
missing and they had the big man hunt. They used all of that. The meeting got everybody whipped

[01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:11.160]
up into a frenzy. Yeah, what about it? She made it up. Oh, she just wanted to be alone.

[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:17.460]
I can relate. Miss Prowl on the Tyco case. One of the jurors. I wonder if it was the jury that

[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:21.780]
kept giving the okay sign. You know, that's the great-haired bitch. Miss Prowl on the Tyco case

[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:25.140]
and then the broad that supposedly was missing and they found her and, yeah, her kidnap.

[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:30.220]
She wasn't kidnapped at all. She just made it up. Was it Greta Garbo or Marlene DeTrick or who

[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:37.140]
was it? I want to be alone. Somebody like it. She wanted to be alone. It'll tell me who was it?

[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:43.320]
May West. Was it? No. May West said why don't you come up and see me sometime or some?

[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:47.980]
I think you're right with Greta Garbo. She wanted to be alone. Anyway, Nacio Comorismo

[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:56.200]
Gel Gallego Basteri, on December 10th, 1970, in Puerto Rico. I'm not going to push my luck.

[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:01.880]
I can read this pretty good, you know. Yeah, not bad.

[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:09.020]
Debuto in la musica con tan solo dos años y poco después revisio y si o su primer grame.

[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:13.020]
So, anyway, he was a manudo as what it says here. He was a, he was a

[01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:17.660]
a integrante del grupo adolescent emmenudo took many showers with Ricky Martin as what that means.

[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:24.480]
Luis Miguel fue el colegio Boston de Pedagral donde Cristo ha hasta quinto grado

[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:30.020]
el el resto lo hizo con profesores particulares. You must begin somebody a heart attack right now.

[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:37.660]
Why? You have that sound so filthy. What are you talking about? Oh, those filthy foreign words. Oh, you

[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:44.120]
mean, oh, you mean, you have a muffin air. Well, too bad. Dato kilos comprenomiso,

[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:53.040]
musicales, no le permitian, as se te arreglamente. What? It just sounds so filthy. All right,

[01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:57.880]
it sounds filthy. What sounds filthy? I haven't read one word here. That sounds

[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:05.300]
so filthy. That's a bio. 1983 con quista perro Rico en Plano, Aguida Menudo. Oh, there you go.

[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:13.300]
What does that mean? I have a little ague. Huh? I don't know. What? I don't know. You don't know.

[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:18.500]
You're the resident's pick and you don't know. He's the he's two years before the week go

[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:29.220]
in Plano, Aguida Menudo. Now, what does that mean? I don't know. I think we got a fake

[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:35.440]
spick is what I think. I think he's portagase. Ricks says last night, channel 17 WL. This is

[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:40.460]
depressing WLRN and Miami played a Nova episode entitled Life and Death in the War Zone. It followed

[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:44.980]
an army mobile hospital in lives of soldiers in the unit. In one scene, they shoot a 14-year-old

[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:48.660]
girl who was burned in the hands and faced due to US unexploded bomb. They said the only

[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:52.220]
reason they helped this girl is because the guards at the front took pity on her. This is

[01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:56.000]
total BS. We caused a range reason broke her country and now we don't want to fix it,

[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.940]
says Rick. What really got me was a nine-year-old girl burned over 15% of her body from US rocket

[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:04.400]
attack. The parents couldn't get out of the house to get food or water due to the constant

[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.560]
barrage of missiles and fighting. Finally, they got to the army hospital with the girl severely

[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:13.340]
male nourished and dehydrated. She was only skin and bones. They were going to fly her to a US

[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:17.840]
hospital for treatment, but she didn't make it. One of the nurses just broke down and said she

[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:22.120]
couldn't take watching all the children mutilated and harmed. Neil, when is this man that's going

[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:27.860]
to stop? I'm sorry to bum you out. I needed to vent the DVDs on sale at pbs.org. If anyone agrees

[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:32.020]
with this war, pull out a picture of one of these children whose lives will be destroyed forever

[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:35.580]
because of a senseless war. But you know that little kid whose picture we had on our website

[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:40.040]
for a long, long time there, right? Lucky Ali. The good, yeah. He got all his, he got all his

[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:44.760]
artificial limbs and at the great, yeah. What a tragedy. How pathetic.

[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:50.460]
And anyway, so at least when I was in Minuto like I tried telling you before you got my computer

[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:55.740]
all screwed up, God, you're a hard ass. Who doesn't speak no Spanish? You wanted to fix H.A.

[01:55:56.180 --> 01:56:01.360]
Hey, they can spot a phone in a million miles away. What is the worst sit down restaurant,

[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.100]
chain in America? No drive through. That's the, that's the definitive deal. Does that mean

[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:12.160]
I have to use my real name now? That is, yeah, Eddie. That is 119 Olive Garden Eddie Rodriguez.

[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:18.940]
Olive Garden 81, Apple B's 54, Wapalos 47, I have 46 and every after that small potatoes.

[01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:25.160]
Although I see a tie between Red Lobster and Pizza 24. 567, I'm sure we've left many,

[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:33.300]
many thousands off here. WQAM, hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I gotta tell you, I don't know if you've

[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:38.160]
mentioned this on the area yet, but the story about about the White House, the Bush White House,

[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:43.340]
concealing the records from the Clinton White House. Right. Now it is, I mean, that just

[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:49.040]
that just showed you what people these guys are. And also, uh, well, I want you to keep

[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:53.900]
several things in mind. Number one, they didn't want this 9-11 community. They fought it like crazy

[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:58.740]
tooth and nail. Number two, they helped put a bunch of studious on it. Number three,

[01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:03.220]
they wanted the deadline to be like, uh, already over with. They didn't want to send the deadline.

[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.080]
So they fought this airy inch of the way. They didn't want to tell the American public the truth.

[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.820]
How can anybody with any brain cells buy what's the situation?

[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.360]
Beep, Pizza, how are they?

[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.080]
A scan, don't let it slip.

[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:17.820]
And you know something, I'm convinced, I'm convinced more than ever that what I've been saying for

[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:21.860]
months now is true. If Bush came on television at 9 o'clock tonight, held a national,

[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:26.220]
national speech and said, we've lied through our teeth about all of this. We were going to go

[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:29.720]
to a rack in the first place, Richard Clark is right. And so was Paul O'Neill and everybody else.

[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.940]
And we went in there because we wanted the oil and because of the fact that the Anneocons had

[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:38.100]
this game plan of domination in the Middle East and world domination. If he came on air and told

[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:41.340]
it through, they still would say, oh, well, we support President Bush. He's a great leader.

[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:47.080]
They wouldn't care. And by the way, I don't know how this air America could have overlooked

[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:53.660]
somebody as air you died. As you would speak. So eloquently on this topic that could really fight

[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:58.080]
and as a real radio guy, I mean, they really should take a closer look at this.

[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:00.780]
Well, they can't afford me. I think that's a problem. Have a rate day.

[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.300]
Of course you're all well with 20 years off.

[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:08.740]
See you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:11.760]
Oh, yeah, I would have been liked to have been on that thing. But of course, normally he's busy

[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:15.920]
getting sick and dying and all these other things. You know, see, I probably shouldn't say that

[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:19.240]
because then maybe you'll have no, like that and I'll put him over the edge. Ooh, sometimes

[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:25.640]
for you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60. Now how are we doing with that cash? Are we getting

[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:30.320]
the updates? Yeah, we're getting updates. It hasn't gotten anywhere. What do you mean by the

[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:39.700]
40, 28, so 45, 28? Well, does that reflect the duffs? Yes. I don't think, I think these people

[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:43.020]
are busy looking at those three pictures in Jerry Hallowell. I think that's what they're looking at

[01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:46.480]
knows us that six pack they got on there. But other than that, I don't think they're paying any

[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:52.500]
attention to stop FCC dot us, US. And donating, we've got to get to five grand by two o'clock

[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:57.880]
today or I'm going to tell you right now, George is going on vacation next week. Oh, that was a

[01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:04.360]
bad idea. No, we got to get to five grand by two o'clock or George cancels his vacation next week.

[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:10.420]
How do you like that? That will scare him. That'll motivate him highly with about their credit cards.

[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:16.240]
When in doubt, whip it out. Get with it. Visa, master card American Express. Let's go.

[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:26.560]
Manor these people cheap WQA and hello. Yes, sir. How are you, sir? Okay. I've got to push

[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:32.320]
the 40 other day and I talked to him a couple months ago and they just love him. And I said,

[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:37.740]
now a couple months gone by and you see all the things he's lying about. He stood up and wrote for him

[01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:42.680]
and he said, you're out stuffing that any other person that hasn't done in the past. There you go.

[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:48.080]
Uh-huh. So no matter what you tell them, they just love the guy. Yeah, see, he lied. He

[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:52.260]
lied about having sex, which of course was a big deal to Republicans. And this guy's lying about

[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:57.020]
Iraq having weapons of mass destruction and having to do with Al Qaeda and terrorism having to do with

[01:59:57.020 --> 02:00:02.340]
9-11 and all these people are dying. I see a great correlation there. Not exactly. That's what I know

[02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:08.300]
the person and they just have blinded. I want you to keep one. I want you to keep one thing in mind.

[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:12.700]
Okay. Okay. There's an old saying that sums it up where there's no sense. There's no feeling.

[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:19.440]
Yeah, I can't believe it. You know, there's so much in their face and they still believe it. I just

[02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:25.440]
can't believe it. I want to vote for Black Lobster. Okay.

[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:25.520]
Okay.

[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:34.660]
The evil lobster. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I just stayed there. I think once in my life and everybody

[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:39.940]
had warned me to give you really small portions and the prices are ridiculously high and the food

[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:44.760]
is just marginal at best. And it's it. I ate it twice the second time because we got some

[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:48.620]
certificates and you know what? Still wasn't worth it. Even for free, it wasn't any good.

[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:55.120]
Now you know, that's that's a good deal. A good for a pool. Even for free, a restaurant that you

[02:00:55.120 --> 02:00:58.580]
wouldn't need that. Maybe we'll do that one day, one of these days. Okay. Keep it in mind. Keep

[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:04.200]
it in your head. Store it away. Okay. How many QA and hello? Not there on line four,

[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:07.160]
shame on you. That was probably going to be our first lady color of the day, wouldn't you think?

[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:14.620]
Since we haven't had no ladies today. How many QA and hello? Hello. Oh my god. I can't believe I

[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:20.440]
did this. My psychic powers even scared me some time. Yes, ma'am. This is Jill Lynn, the hockey girl.

[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:27.040]
Jill Lynn, are you kidding me? No, it's me. Where have you been all this time? Nashville, Tennessee.

[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:32.860]
I'm right. What a horrible place. Yeah, it's pretty bad. But you know, I'm hanging in there. I got

[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:44.600]
my preg. So I'm okay. You also you also recorded. That's me. That's me.

[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:50.960]
That's you, Jill Lynn. How you been? That's me, me, you god. I miss you so much. So where are you now?

[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:56.100]
You're in Florida? I am on singer Island on the beach. It's a glorious day.

[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:02.060]
Hi, singer Island. I remember it well. Yeah, it's you know, it's a very nice beach. So we're

[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.380]
laying out and enjoying the sun and I go back to Nashville tomorrow. Well, how are you listening

[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:12.720]
to us if you're on singer Island? Well, on Kenya, on 560 here. Yeah, it's a little. Oh my god.

[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:18.640]
That's a little baby. Well, it comes in and out a little bit, but I can catch most of it. Uh-huh.

[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:25.040]
And I was just thrilled that I could. So it's good to talk to you. How are things going here in South Florida?

[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:32.520]
Things are fantastic. I'm not in South Florida. I'm in Toronto. Are you over? Right. I do. I do. Yeah, I am. I'm in Toronto.

[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:37.140]
And you know, I do most of the stuff right for my show for my apartment. I got a nice little studio in my apartment.

[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:41.380]
And I'm here most of the time. There you go. So you went to Canada in summer in Florida.

[02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:47.360]
No, I live in Canada and I spent a few weeks in Florida, not any more than I have to.

[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:53.060]
I hear you. Well, I'm sorry that the Panthers didn't make the playoffs this year, but I know that it looks like the

[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:57.740]
plaids are going to. Yeah, it looks like they might get into. They won last night. They beat the black cars. They

[02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:01.780]
needed that came real bad. I hope they do for their sake, you know, because that very gives me the trots. He's been

[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:05.420]
there a long time. He's really done a good job this year. That Stevie Sullivan.

[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:10.240]
I love Stevie Sullivan, man. One of the great mistakes the Leaf Organization never made. We're letting Stevie

[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:16.280]
Sullivan go away. One of my favorites. He's a great player. I agree with you wholeheartedly. I need to hear from you, Jolene. Take care of yourself.

[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:23.020]
You too, Neil. I'll talk to you soon. See you. How do you like that? That is a shocker. And I said it's the prize.

[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:27.280]
I said, maybe that would have been our first lady of the day and I punched it up. There's Jolene.

[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:39.940]
What am I doing here, man? Seriously, I'm going to the track right now. I'm going to go over to Mohawk and this scope off the

[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:40.440]
video.

[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:44.680]
Hi there, Eau Beste.

[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:10.780]
That's real.

[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:12.880]

[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:22.960]
Not anymore, they don't.

[02:04:40.940 --> 02:05:08.000]
In the airport those building...

[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:08.000]

[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:11.500]
I'm happy anniversary.

[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:14.240]
You always love your show.

[02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:18.360]
That's the ultimate diamond when Joel says she's been in Nashville all this time.

[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:20.200]
She likes it there as opposed to soft food.

[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:20.960]
What does that tell you?

[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:21.500]
Yeah.

[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:24.880]
And he's in Singer Island over there on a West Coast over in the St.

[02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:25.580]
Sarisota.

[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:27.060]
Maybe she's over there with the Amish.

[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:28.480]
That's right.

[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:28.980]
Amish faith.

[02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:29.280]
You think?

[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:31.520]
Wait a minute.

[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:34.420]
Singer Island over there is like a which which one is singer Island?

[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:35.280]
I thought it was over here.

[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:36.880]
Does that one up in Palm Beach?

[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:37.800]
I don't know.

[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:38.720]
By Jupiter?

[02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:39.720]
I don't know.

[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:41.500]
I'm thinking of City Island.

[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.600]
No singer Island is up there by a Jupiter or by West Palm Island.

[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:45.160]
How it is?

[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:48.840]
Some readers complain about Iraq images.

[02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:51.140]
This is from the Guardian UK.

[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:55.200]
Groose in front page photo showing the charred remains of US citizen

[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.860]
skilled in the ambush in Iraq prompted complaints from some readers

[02:05:57.860 --> 02:05:59.620]
that the images were too graphic.

[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:03.220]
The New York Times, Miami-Herald and USA today, A,

[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:06.420]
said they received a moderate number complaints from I rate or offended readers

[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:07.820]
about the prominent use of the photos.

[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:10.160]
What island am I thinking of over there on a West Coast?

[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:10.480]
Did everybody?

[02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:11.620]
Oh, no.

[02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:13.520]
No, no.

[02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:13.780]

[02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:15.380]
No, not Marko Island.

[02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:17.640]
Whatever the hell it is.

[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:19.240]
I don't know why I'm thinking of the one by Sarisota.

[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:22.740]
At any rate, she's just up there in Palm Beach and I'm thinking,

[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:23.460]
what is it?

[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:23.940]
Catalina.

[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:24.680]
No.

[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:27.420]
Santa Catalina though 26 miles.

[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:30.800]
The New York Times ran a large photo on its front page showing the bodies

[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:33.140]
of Americans of Indian singing from a bridge while USA today,

[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:34.900]
the largest circulation daily in the country,

[02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:37.860]
ran a somewhat less graphic photo on its front page showing Iraqis

[02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:39.560]
beating the remains of American workers with shoes.

[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:41.080]
USA today spoke some,

[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:45.380]
Heidi Henderson said the paper received 20 emails and a dozen phone calls

[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:47.400]
that were largely critical to decision use the photo.

[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:48.720]
They got 20 emails, wow.

[02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:50.820]
And by the way, Clarence, you were a liar.

[02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:53.320]
You got a lot more response than you want to mark the humidity or a liar.

[02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:56.000]
She said the newspaper planned to print some of the responses

[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.600]
and letters to the editor in today's paper.

[02:06:57.640 --> 02:06:58.340]
They're in there, I'm sure.

[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:00.680]
The Herald front page editor lies a gross,

[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:02.760]
a what a perfect name for the Herald, gross,

[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.780]
said executive editor Tom Feeder,

[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:07.860]
what is our French code plan to write a column for Sunday's paper,

[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:10.920]
explaining the process that editors go through and making such decisions.

[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:11.500]
Santa Bel.

[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:13.320]
Santa Bel, that's the one.

[02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:14.160]
See if he begins with an answer.

[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:14.740]
Thank you, Roland.

[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:15.480]
Stay around.

[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:16.680]
It is right up the road there, man.

[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:17.920]
It's right up by Palm Beach.

[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:20.180]
I haven't heard many of the time when it used to be some white people there.

[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:20.980]
Oh, sorry, Jolene.

[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:23.860]
We've been saying that these decisions were not made lightly

[02:07:23.860 --> 02:07:25.600]
and we've discarded many more gruesome photos,

[02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:28.560]
but our responsibilities to present the facts as the art gross said.

[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:31.520]
She's the front page editor of the anxious Miami Herald.

[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:32.800]
John X Miller.

[02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:36.020]
John X Miller work.

[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:37.080]
Oh, I guess it could be.

[02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:38.500]
Javier, right?

[02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:40.680]
I guess, but not if his name is John Miller.

[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:41.780]
What were the X stand for?

[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:42.180]
Xavier.

[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.380]
That's what I just said.

[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:47.700]
What else could it possibly stand for?

[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:48.560]
Is that a phone?

[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:52.020]
Okay, John's out of phone Miller public editor to the Detroit free press.

[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:54.200]
The newspaper received a substantial number of complaints.

[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:58.240]
About a hundred from readers upset about a front page photo showing the bodies hanging from the bridge.

[02:07:58.240 --> 02:07:59.240]
And I'm going to say it again.

[02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:00.080]
All new people out there.

[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:00.740]
You pansy.

[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:02.420]
They want to be shielded from the truth.

[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:03.740]
It's really important.

[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:09.180]
They just like it Vietnam that the work in public see the brutal grotesque truth and not be shielded from it.

[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:11.880]
Oh, this administration would love to see happen.

[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.780]
Oh, yeah, let's see the public from those grotesque gruesome images because it's the truth.

[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:21.280]
This is really what's going on as opposed to this glorious operation.

[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:22.080]
Iraqi freedom.

[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:22.960]
Right.

[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:24.840]
This BS that they're feeding.

[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:26.920]
What a crocker crap.

[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:34.120]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in horizon wireless line.

[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:37.120]
I thought all of garden make a bigger dead, but nobody can't touch no denies.

[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:40.060]
I guess they never had none of them mother Humper pies.

[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:42.460]
German chocolate.

[02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:45.020]
Which I'm not really that big of fan of German chocolate.

[02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:46.080]
I like chocolate cream pie.

[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:47.120]
German chocolate.

[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:48.200]
They had a great mother Humper.

[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:51.480]
But you know what they still got that I don't.

[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:57.160]
Well, I'm sure we'll discover we'll get the answer that right after we get the answer about the artist that they're playing on WCMQF.

[02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:57.880]
Family, those big numbers.

[02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:00.300]
WCM Hello.

[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:00.760]

[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:02.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:05.020]
Yeah, I just wanted to mention.

[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:08.860]
You know, Bush is now going to appear in front of the 9 11 commission.

[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:15.200]
It's really quite funny when you think about it that you know, first of all, he's appearing behind closed doors.

[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.260]
And he's got to be company by chain.

[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:19.220]
I mean, one of his mommy and daddy.

[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:21.200]
He's going to be sitting on Chinese knee.

[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:25.760]
In fact, do we put the card to it on a website where it's got Charlie McCarthy's got the puppet on his knee changer?

[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:26.160]
Sure we have.

[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:27.000]
It's high quality.

[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:32.100]
You know, like every couple of minutes, he's going to be looking all like, like, hey, all the product Mr. Cheney on this one.

[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:35.980]
And why not have his mommy and daddy accompany him while they're at it?

[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:39.500]
Maybe they will because daddy's pretty emotional now.

[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:41.180]
He's getting rid of so quick picking on my kid.

[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:46.160]
Probably knows more about what's happening than then then then then it's not anyway while we're at it.

[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:47.380]
No question about that.

[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:48.300]
He's on the inside.

[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:49.740]
He's such a wolf.

[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:53.520]
How anybody can see he's a strong leader now with when you see this.

[02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:59.180]
And again, you know, we're dealing with the American population which you know, pretty stupid for the most part.

[02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:02.040]
And by the way, I'm a way home now to log on.

[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:04.080]
I'm going to be sending some up to stop at C.C.

[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:05.080]
Thanks a lot, man.

[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:07.000]
It's a great cause and keep up the great work.

[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:07.580]
Thank you.

[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:08.020]
Take care.

[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:10.280]
My kid isn't going to put some money in there.

[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:11.180]
Now what's that latest total?

[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:12.400]
Same.

[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:14.100]
What do you mean by that?

[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:16.000]
He's not changing or nobody's putting any money in.

[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:18.600]
He's putting it up periodically and it hasn't changed.

[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:23.660]
So in other words, it's still $4,528 more $472 away from the 5,000.

[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:25.900]
I guarantee we'd have by two o'clock today.

[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:26.260]
Correct.

[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:35.360]
Stop by FCC.us and that newspaper at any USA today with the largest daily circulation so that millions and millions of people can see it and hopefully go on line and sign that petition.

[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:38.160]
What is wrong with this town?

[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:40.900]
What is wrong with people in broadcasting like I said before?

[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.720]
That's certainly a motivated duck.

[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:44.500]
But nobody else.

[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:46.020]
Greg came in with an ice check.

[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:47.420]
Duff got on there which we appreciate.

[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:49.140]
Anybody else in the building?

[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.240]
Not that we know of.

[02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:53.700]
Anybody else in the marketplace who would cough up 50 or 100 bucks?

[02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:53.880]
No.

[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:54.700]
Chief bastards.

[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:56.800]
Just unbelievable.

[02:10:57.340 --> 02:10:57.700]
Unconscious.

[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:01.880]
And this is what I was up against the first time we went through this back in 86.

[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:02.200]
Ready.

[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:05.740]
Seven whatever the hell was that I and Z the same thing when it came down with all this censorship.

[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:06.120]
Yes.

[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:07.580]
And nobody stood up against it then.

[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:12.440]
And here we are 18 years later when they're still more and more and they never have enough.

[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:13.400]
Never take away enough.

[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:14.740]
Just keep.

[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:16.960]
Knocking down a first amendment.

[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:18.440]
We just make it up as we go along.

[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:21.460]
You'll say whatever we tell you you're allowed to say and you'll listen to it.

[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:24.360]
And let me say it again the most important thing to keep in mind.

[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:29.480]
Whether you like this show Howard Stern, Bob and Tom, Bob and love Spongebob.

[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:32.240]
Whoever you like to listen to or whatever you like to watch on TV.

[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:33.820]
This is just the beginning.

[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:38.820]
Cable satellite are next and once they're done with that it's the Internet baby.

[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:40.700]
My life and love.

[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:43.020]
This is for trail by 60.

[02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:45.240]
We can weigh in.

[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:07.180]
Here.

[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:09.560]
ruine you like booze.

[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:12.680]
I like booze.

[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:16.220]
Get in like booze like booze like Booze.

[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:19.460]
Just be boy, keep down the locker room with all that noise

[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:20.740]
Shake it, shake it, shake it, you like it, good to learn

[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:22.920]
You gotta like, good to learn, good to learn

[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:24.160]
You gotta like, good to learn, good to learn

[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:25.000]
Feel your way, you jackalat

[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:25.960]
Yes, I'm up for jackalat

[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:27.140]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:28.100]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.200]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.320]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:32.200]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:32.340]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:32.660]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.340]
Got the good ball, good ball, good to feel

[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:35.820]
Get everything, tell what it is

[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:36.420]
Get everything, tell what it is

[02:12:36.420 --> 02:12:36.880]
Show you, you jackalat

[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:37.560]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:38.640]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:39.640]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:40.720]
Got you, you jackalat

[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:54.280]
Get everything in there

[02:12:54.280 --> 02:13:03.320]
Good game

[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:06.540]
Good game

[02:13:06.540 --> 02:13:07.760]
CAST

[02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:10.700]
I feel like a lot

[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:40.640]
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I

[02:13:53.640 --> 02:14:09.780]
the wrong laugh to win something and shine away and I can't do that again, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie,

[02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:14.240]
They're big and proud, they're all out.

[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:18.520]
What does Winsk Hatch then follow with their brand new,

[02:14:18.580 --> 02:14:20.420]
a fancy, fancy paper to improve?

[02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:22.300]
Says the Hillary Siddite.

[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:33.560]
The front page story in this Winsk Hatch

[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:39.120]
is the usual big tease on the front page.

[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:40.900]
And then nothing surprising.

[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:44.260]
Although I didn't notice the Attorney General

[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:45.760]
said a Florida's name in there anywhere.

[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:47.420]
Or Mark Foley.

[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:49.440]
Yeah, you?

[02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:49.980]
No.

[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:52.540]
And anyway, I had a blurb about Hillary.

[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:53.780]
I had her pictures matter fact.

[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.040]
And Bill Clinton is evidently told Jennifer Flowers,

[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:57.200]
at least that's what she wrote in her book,

[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:00.220]
that he's sure that Hillary has had a lot more women than he ever had.

[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.140]
That was his quote, says Jennifer.

[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:03.740]
Yeah, that's what he said.

[02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:07.940]
So anyway, what would be wrong with having the ice princess bull-like

[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:08.800]
is something.

[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:11.320]
Oh, speaking of bitches, this, I mean,

[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:13.300]
she's kind of cute, see this Audrey Siler.

[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:14.980]
She's an ice-a young college girl,

[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:18.180]
but I say put her ass in jail for a long time.

[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:20.060]
Or maybe in a rubber room somewhere.

[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:23.020]
University of Wisconsin, honors students,

[02:15:23.180 --> 02:15:25.460]
said she was abducted at a ninth point from outside her apartment,

[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:27.080]
has changed her account of the incident.

[02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:30.160]
Assistant Police Chief Noble raised it a news conference today,

[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:30.800]
a little while ago.

[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:34.260]
Ray said police asked Audrey Siler about apparent inconsistencies

[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:37.140]
among the physical evidence her statements to the police,

[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:38.080]
and those of other witnesses,

[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:40.660]
Siler then said the abduction had taken place

[02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:42.220]
in a different location according to Ray.

[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.040]
The 20-year-old student was found Wednesday.

[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:48.940]
She was last seen leaving her apartment at 230th Saturday morning.

[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:51.820]
She told police she was abducted at a ninth point by a white male

[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:54.360]
in his late 20s or early 30s about 6v tall

[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:57.340]
and last seen wearing black sweatshirt, black hat, and jeans.

[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:04.020]
And it goes, oh, this is from the CNN website?

[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:06.360]
This isn't even off today.

[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.240]
Their website sucks, okay?

[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:09.580]
Their website blows.

[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:12.180]
Can you believe this?

[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:13.580]
Stingles changes abduction.

[02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:15.000]
I thought this was the very latest thing,

[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:16.160]
but this was not an hour ago.

[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:18.680]
Then now she says she wasn't abducted at all.

[02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:19.660]
She just wanted to be alone.

[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:22.020]
And they got this crap on there, and I'm sitting here reading it.

[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:24.160]
Like some kind of morons, I'm kind of a moron.

[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:26.040]
Because I think that CNN is up today with something.

[02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:28.560]
It's like those two American kids that got killed over there today

[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:29.740]
and yesterday in Iraq.

[02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:34.080]
Finally, they got like an afterthought.

[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:36.060]
If you look at the crawl on the bottom of somebody's

[02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:39.080]
talking head channels, or if you look way down in the middle

[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:40.420]
on their website, among the headlines,

[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.760]
you'll find, oh, you had two more Americans dead in Iraq.

[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:45.340]
It's really pathetic.

[02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:46.660]
Talk about managing the news.

[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:49.320]
And that line we had before, can I say that story about that

[02:16:49.700 --> 02:16:50.380]
Israeli thing?

[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:51.500]
I sure hope I did.

[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:52.920]
I guess I didn't.

[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:53.960]
We could play that pathetic?

[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:55.060]
Yeah.

[02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:58.400]
That they've got a phone number that they can call it in Atlanta,

[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:00.500]
and that if CNN runs a story that they don't like,

[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:03.240]
they all they got to do is make one a phone call to kill a story.

[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:03.740]
Beautiful.

[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:05.480]
Think it just wire them up with the dump button.

[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:06.860]
There you go.

[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:07.700]
That's a good idea.

[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:10.360]
I bet you the FCC would like that.

[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:14.220]
Just every now and then, just when you feel like it just dumps them.

[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:16.760]
Oh, man.

[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:19.220]
Anyway, I guess I have a Schmidt-Kandit.

[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:19.600]
Too bad.

[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:24.440]
What is the worst sit down restaurant chain in America?

[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:25.680]
That's our pool question today.

[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:26.960]
Another pool that they dammit.

[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:29.180]
Not a drive-through.

[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:30.420]
That's the qualification.

[02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:31.320]
It's got a drive-through.

[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:32.120]
Can we put it on there?

[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:32.420]
No.

[02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:32.660]
No.

[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:34.520]
Denny is 127.

[02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:37.060]
The Olibee Garden 87.

[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:39.040]
Waffle Loss 56.

[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:40.240]
Applebee's 55.

[02:17:40.680 --> 02:17:41.540]
I have 53.

[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:42.980]
Pizza Hut's got...

[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:43.920]
About 30, man.

[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:45.140]
Red Loss 29.

[02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:46.280]
Till he's 26.

[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:47.960]
Piccadilly Cafeteria 25.

[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:49.000]
Show knees 25.

[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:50.560]
And down from there.

[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:52.880]
Golden Coral's got 18.

[02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:53.540]
I never heard of it.

[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:54.700]
Is that a new chain?

[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:55.420]
A new, uh...

[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:57.820]
I guess we got gift certificates here.

[02:17:58.460 --> 02:17:58.920]
We really?

[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:01.740]
Yeah, but they're down in Miami, so somebody else is going to get them.

[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.260]
Oh, I don't think a load of Miami, do you?

[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:03.640]
Am I not?

[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:03.960]
No.

[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:09.560]
WB, who's just an out of control chronic facts, who says it just blows me away when I see the reaction

[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:11.220]
by the public to the brutalities of war.

[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:14.680]
Prior to Vietnam, it was a punishable crime to send graphic pictures, so I'm a little

[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:15.300]
and publish them.

[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:18.820]
Maybe if the media continues to publish the gruesome graphic realities of war for the next

[02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:23.080]
200 years, the sheltered war supporters will finally decide war is not such a great idea.

[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:27.300]
And can somebody please explain to me how mutilating American bodies is so much different

[02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:30.740]
than bombing a country to help out casually selecting targets that will break the will of

[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:34.860]
innocent people until they hate the invaders so much they can only retaliate by such acts of heinous

[02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:35.280]
behavior.

[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:39.140]
If they invaded my country, I'd be in the streets also, we said that's my 50 bucks worth,

[02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:42.320]
but I'd contribute to the downward-of-fastest communication drive, etc.

[02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:46.120]
Thanks WB, he contributed, and that number still ain't changing.

[02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:48.260]
Maybe Eric has been eaten once, is there something, yeah?

[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:49.780]
No.

[02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:50.900]
What?

[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:54.360]
No, because he keeps putting the same number up there so I know he's checking.

[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:57.720]
Oh, so in other words, there's not another dime that's coming on there, and I'm sitting here

[02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:59.560]
thinking everything is going along just fine.

[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:03.540]
I'm going to go on strike, I'm going to tell you right now until we get to 5 grand.

[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:07.740]
I mean, we couldn't have made it today without Greg's 500, you know, 4 grand would have been nice.

[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:12.800]
But thanks to Greg Reed coming in with that $500 check, we got $4,528 bucks.

[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:16.120]
I mean, if it's going to stall out right now, what's the chance we're going to get to...

[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:17.040]
About 30 men!

[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:18.160]
What chances are that?

[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.140]
All these hot shots out there that talk a big game.

[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:23.560]
Oh yeah, you just let us know, Neil, we're right behind you.

[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:26.020]
Like I said yesterday, you turn around and look over your shoulder.

[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:26.980]
They're behind you all, right?

[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:30.100]
About 14 miles back up the road and they're running like hell the other way.

[02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:32.240]
Because he's asking for our money.

[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:33.140]
5 bucks?

[02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:34.520]
2 bucks?

[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:38.600]
How much does it cost for a pack of faggot these days?

[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:39.520]
About $500?

[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:42.380]
No, seriously, how much does it cost for a pack of cigarettes?

[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:43.400]
Three-ish.

[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.140]
Two, like high-tos?

[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:46.060]
Low-three's.

[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:47.060]
Yeah, three bucks.

[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:54.240]
So just, I'd say right now, just probably keep your life for another extra few hours, doing your Pubit service.

[02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:02.640]
The doctor will go that next pack of faggot that you would buy and instead take the three bucks and put it on your credit card and whip it in there to stop FCC.us.

[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:06.200]
Get with it.

[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.020]
See, I was on such a euphoric high.

[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:14.180]
You know, when Greg came over to that check and then Duff helped out and I thought, man, we're going to really get some momentum going.

[02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:15.640]
Just like always, same old crap.

[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:20.260]
It's the same people always who come through and the rest of the people are all talk.

[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:23.800]
And like I said, the people of Canada, 40 and 50 said, we are, we are understand.

[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:24.700]
We appreciate that.

[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:27.500]
We appreciate their predicament, especially Josh and George.

[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:28.380]
They appreciate it.

[02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:29.720]
And even George put in a hundred.

[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:37.140]
That's the thing that really is an indictment of the rest of the public out there when a little schmuck like George with a little piker like him.

[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:38.160]
I'm going to die in debt.

[02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:44.900]
Put in a hundred bucks who hasn't got three nickels to rub together who's treated and abused and used in that place like you wouldn't believe.

[02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:50.720]
And still cares enough about something to put in a hundred bucks and the rest of you, like that.

[02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:58.740]
You know, it's a hard time that some people wake up and waked up and woked up and sniff the dandruff of the deals.

[02:20:58.820 --> 02:20:59.500]
I'm certain to get emotional.

[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:00.500]
I'm getting wild.

[02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:06.720]
Just like our fundraiser, no matter what the cause is, always an excuse.

[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:08.260]
Let's auction off some crap.

[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:08.620]
Okay.

[02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:09.980]
Let's auction off Todd Red.

[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:11.280]
How many cents can we get for him?

[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:11.900]
About 30.

[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:13.000]
There you go.

[02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:13.700]
We'll take it.

[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:16.160]
We'll take it.

[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:19.660]
Oh, look at this community and other state and local officials.

[02:21:19.660 --> 02:21:29.800]
And it says that as you said, Department of Homeland and FBI have received uncorroborated reporting on an alleged plot against major US city.

[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:35.540]
We all might have some of the same sort of 2004 that targets commercial transportation.

[02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:42.740]
Both those agencies, Homeland and FBI have assessed that buses and railways could be targeted.

[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:56.500]
But I bring your attention to the word uncorroborated, which basically means that this is a sole piece of intelligence that has come in to the intelligence community that we're not able to be matched by another course.

[02:21:56.500 --> 02:22:04.960]
This is the type of information that would not be widely disseminated to the public because of that because it is uncorroborated.

[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:10.060]
But instead would be very specifically targeted toward those who need to know.

[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:10.720]
There you go.

[02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:10.960]
Okay.

[02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:11.980]
Well, it's it's Friday, right?

[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:13.020]
Just relax.

[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:15.980]
Terrorists may or may not try to bomb major US cities.

[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.920]
Buses, trains, just stay home and hide under the bed.

[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:19.580]
That's a good idea.

[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:24.360]
560560, pound 560 on the AT&T and for Rise the Line.

[02:22:24.940 --> 02:22:26.760]
We got 9.1, just we got what?

[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:28.200]
Another 20 bucks.

[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:29.140]
And that's it.

[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:31.520]
This ain't got to cut it.

[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:32.640]
4548.

[02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:35.420]
We're still $452 short of the 5 grand.

[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:43.420]
See, at this point, now, you know, yesterday I was like run on the edge.

[02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:44.940]
Like, should we proceed with this or not?

[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:48.940]
Because I don't want to like have to give a whole bunch of money back to people.

[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:50.720]
Yeah.

[02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:54.140]
But if we aren't going to raise like even 10 grand, for example, what's the point?

[02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:56.500]
I mean, what kind of an ad you take out for five grand for?

[02:22:56.600 --> 02:22:57.780]
And we can't even get to five grand.

[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:05.440]
I got that thing you sent me yesterday from USA today that the rate sheet.

[02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:05.800]
Yeah.

[02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:08.020]
Here's the actual rate sheet.

[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:13.160]
Let's see, the minimum, the smallest data, 16th of a page is 10,600.

[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:16.580]
16th of a page.

[02:23:16.580 --> 02:23:18.340]
You know how small it is, but the size of your thumb.

[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:24.540]
I mean, to me, the smallest and eighth of a page is 18,300.

[02:23:25.260 --> 02:23:27.780]
For the 31,600, we get a quarter of a page.

[02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:29.700]
That's what we really need to get people's attention.

[02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:32.580]
Although an eighth of a page, 18,300.

[02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:34.680]
We'll just continue pressing on.

[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:37.480]
And by the year 25, 25, maybe we can get to a few people out there.

[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:40.180]
This is, like I said before, we're not giving anything on return.

[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:40.780]
That's a problem.

[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:41.800]
Oh, no, we get a CD.

[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:42.820]
No, we get no.

[02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:43.180]
No.

[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:44.280]
Don't we get like a key chain?

[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:44.600]

[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:45.800]
You might not be freedom.

[02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:47.020]
You get our thanks.

[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:48.320]
You get our thanks.

[02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:52.680]
Two or three bucks and they won't do it.

[02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:56.140]
The cheapest lowdown, it's just astonishing to me.

[02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:56.800]
Another one.

[02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:58.620]
Like $2.120.

[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:00.300]
No, $4168, though.

[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:03.200]
$4668.

[02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:07.260]
You see, I have to admit, I don't like bitching people out and chewing a knife like sign a petition.

[02:24:07.620 --> 02:24:08.780]
How much effort does it take?

[02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:12.880]
How much effort you're all sitting there watching porn or on your internet?

[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:13.740]
You're not fooling me.

[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:14.660]
That's right.

[02:24:14.700 --> 02:24:15.040]
They're busy.

[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:20.500]
They're looking at Jerry Hallowell's boobies on air for a couple of minutes and they go into their favorite porn sites on the computers.

[02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:21.920]
They're not fooling me for a second.

[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:24.400]
This isn't their pretendant of work like our sales holes back there.

[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:27.280]
If our sales people were working, what kind of a log we had yesterday and today?

[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:29.580]
It's like a going out of business log here at QAM.

[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:33.860]
Maybe Greg ought to rethink giving that 500 bucks or not the way things are going in this joint.

[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:38.320]
Maybe they took in a good, you know, some good money on that phony option the other day.

[02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:40.160]
Oh, maybe that's what we need to do.

[02:24:40.860 --> 02:24:41.880]
Let's auction off most.

[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:42.160]
Peace.

[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:42.740]
What do you say?

[02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:43.220]
Absolutely.

[02:24:43.220 --> 02:24:45.840]
You know, he's got a whole bunch of spares anyway.

[02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:50.340]
How about you manage this old jockstrap from those the Super Bowl championship years?

[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:50.720]
What do you say?

[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:51.240]
Oh, right.

[02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:59.600]
They have to sit here in big and plead and squeeze and cajole and just practically terrorize people.

[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.060]
Almost like stealing, reaching into your wallet and trying to squeeze three or four or five bucks out of you.

[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:09.740]
Just pretend you dropped the five dollar bill at the Astur while you were buying your fagots or your milk or whatever your soda's.

[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:10.720]
Huh?

[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:12.920]
Just pretend you dropped the five on the ground.

[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:15.480]
Somebody QAM, hello?

[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:16.620]
Hey, Neil.

[02:25:17.140 --> 02:25:17.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:18.580]
Yeah, I was curious.

[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:21.340]
You were always talking about how many votes you guys need.

[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:25.920]
There's about a million, a million for uh, FFCC.com.

[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:26.660]
Signatures, yeah.

[02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:28.180]
That's what's going to happen.

[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:28.300]

[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:28.600]
Okay.

[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:33.780]
I find it and I'm just curious, if a million come, what will you, what will happen?

[02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:35.880]
What exactly will happen?

[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:37.540]
The world will stop spinning around.

[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:41.120]
What will the FCC do with a million signatures?

[02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:41.640]
Well, how?

[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.700]
That's just a question about the FCC is going to do.

[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:47.940]
It's a question of whether Congress, I mean the Senate still hasn't passed that uh, in decency bill.

[02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:52.280]
And then the point is that it passed so easily in a house because nobody was saying anything about it.

[02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:53.820]
It passed 391 to 22.

[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.820]
There were only 22 people out of 435 and a House of Representatives voted against it.

[02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.640]
And that's because nobody was screaming and yelling.

[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:01.420]
And that's what you have to do in front of the Senate.

[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.860]
So the, in fact, on that website, you can click on there and you can audit.

[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:09.000]
And he will automatically generate a letter from you to both your U.S. Senators.

[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:10.600]
Right. I heard you said that yesterday.

[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.140]
So we, I mean, you don't think in an election year that they're going to pay attention if they get a million people signing a petition?

[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:16.180]
Right, right.

[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:18.200]
They're going to start peeing in their pants, man.

[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:19.680]
And I got one more question.

[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:22.120]
Like some of those bits that you can't play anymore.

[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:22.660]
Yeah.

[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:26.920]
Why can't you just belief out what you can't hear and still play the bit?

[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:29.380]
Yeah. Well, I worked on that one and it took me forever.

[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.160]
But it's a good idea.

[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:31.140]
Well, we're going to work on it.

[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:31.960]
Okay.

[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:32.840]
Thanks, Holly.

[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:33.780]
Thanks for your help.

[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:34.720]
4191.

[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.940]
See, 42, 4191.

[02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:37.980]
4691.

[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:39.780]
4700 bucks.

[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:40.620]
And 13 cents.

[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:41.800]
What?

[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:43.000]
And 13 cents.

[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:43.720]
13 cents.

[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:44.700]
That's a lucky 13 cents.

[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:46.120]
That might be what puts us over the top.

[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:46.800]
Absolutely.

[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:48.220]
Am I doing it?

[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:54.160]
Boy, what an unbelievable effort.

[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:54.780]
What I am.

[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:56.120]
But, you know, we keep plugging along.

[02:26:56.380 --> 02:26:56.720]
That's me.

[02:26:57.180 --> 02:26:59.260]
I refuse to take for an answer.

[02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:00.380]
I'm just stubborn.

[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:01.280]
A stubborn old cunt.

[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:05.280]
I think we got a few stubborn old cunts in his joint.

[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:06.720]
All the crap you can unwrap.

[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:06.980]
Right.

[02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:09.480]
You know, by the way, Wayne hates you, Moe.

[02:27:09.540 --> 02:27:10.480]
I just thought I mentioned it again.

[02:27:10.580 --> 02:27:11.260]
It's just for the hell of it.

[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:12.040]
Not any special reason.

[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:18.100]
From 57 at 560 WQM, if you want to spring into savings right now and save a ton of cash on a great new car truck,

[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:20.880]
you can do it at Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead.

[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:23.880]
They run US-1 only 20 minutes south of the 836.

[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:27.580]
Armstrong's Toyota homesteads worth the drive because they're going to save you so much.

[02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:30.760]
A whole pile of thousands of dollars on great new Toyota speaking of cash.

[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:32.320]
Check out these great leases.

An O4 camera or a 4-winter for just 269 bucks a month for 48 months.

[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:39.460]
How about an O4 high under just 309 a month?

[02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:39.960]
Need a truck?

[02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:42.380]
How about an O4 Toyota Tundra.

[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:43.560]
It's the safest truck in America.

[02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:46.380]
You pay just 179 bucks a month for 48 months.

[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:51.480]
And these are just a few of the great savings waiting for you right now at Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead.

[02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:54.780]
And when those nasty toll increases on people using cash on the turnpike,

[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:58.420]
Armstrong's will give you a free sun pass when you buy a new car truck there.

[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:04.780]
General manager David Richon is tire staff will do whatever it takes to make you a deal and put you in a great new Toyota two day.

[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:07.900]
So experience for yourself the Armstrong Toyota homestead difference.

[02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:11.360]
Locally owned and operated are committed to 100% customer satisfaction too.

[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:16.360]
Their service departments even open late to late week nights to make sure they get all your service work done and done right.

[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:18.900]
You'll find them at US-1 and 2.93rd in Homestead.

[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:22.980]
It's only 20 easy minutes south of the 836 so jump on down.

[02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:29.120]
Don't waste your time at those mega dealers or car giants who overpromise and under deliver and then get some their dealership under some fully pretense.

you let the sky go when he makes it way go.

[02:29:21.140 --> 02:29:25.500]
Monika is not the kind you can do in the

[02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:31.020]
a cigar and her you don't mind.

[02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:36.360]
Well, he don't know where a stove he goes.

[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:41.200]
I can see how there was some confusion between human and human.

[02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:51.520]
And then I can saw the turnseater and saw her naked.

[02:29:52.460 --> 02:29:56.360]
Stars report can lead to go in blind.

[02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:04.700]
Now, Clinton, he was working hard late nights in the overrear

[02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:09.640]
office working on a practical joke.

[02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:16.140]
He took him back a new door, put an explode in,

[02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:21.980]
loaded for Monika with glowing rings a smoke.

[02:30:24.700 --> 02:30:26.980]
Build the cars in Monika.

[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:44.860]
Ride a little and ride a little.

[02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:56.600]
He made a new door.

[02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:56.960]
Drive a little and save a ton on that great Toyota at 605.

[02:30:56.960 --> 02:30:56.960]

[02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:00.400]
Feel that Hillary was wronged

[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:04.620]
Up in the Lincoln bedroom

[02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:06.780]
She was moaning

[02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:12.720]
Moaning our goal was doing her with bills old bond

[02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:18.180]
Bills to cause and monocles

[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:23.780]
She let's out of giggle

[02:31:24.740 --> 02:31:27.680]
Every friggin' time he makes it wiggle

[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:32.280]
Monika is not the kind you can do in the

[02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:35.540]
But us a car and her

[02:31:36.500 --> 02:31:37.940]
She don't mind

[02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:41.280]
Oh candy and say good evening

[02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:45.160]
But master is faster

[02:31:45.700 --> 02:31:47.060]
Oh yeah

[02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:51.920]
What she gotta do is take a tip

[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:02.340]
Oh

[02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:10.080]
I get emotionally a dream just from listening to that it's 104 at 5 60 WQ AM all the bleeps all the time

[02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:16.900]
America slept while the first amendment was being dismantled okay while people were saying oh you can't say and you can't do that and you

[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:18.320]
Chirinly can't play right

[02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:25.480]
And America just said back this has got to be the most passive country on a face of the earth the most passive GD countries

[02:32:25.480 --> 02:32:28.180]
Yeah, just use the initials there I heard it can't say that anymore either

[02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:34.540]
Oh, well, that's coarse speech man. That's oh yeah, whatever and and they just keep making it up as inkable long

[02:32:34.540 --> 02:32:39.600]
Justifying it under some other world while it's in decent speech. It's obscene speech. It's coarse speech

[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:43.780]
It's vulgar. You know something there the ones who are obscene make no mistake about it

[02:32:45.400 --> 02:32:48.740]
When the founding fathers made the first amendment they didn't say uh well

[02:32:48.740 --> 02:32:55.000]
Unless of course you say things that the FCC don't like or bunch of grumpy old men see the senator Sam Brownback from Kansas

[02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:58.320]
This guy's picking up right where Jesse Helms left off. That's what he's all about

[02:33:00.060 --> 02:33:05.860]
Another right-wing lunatic and of course nobody. I mean just about nobody except maybe Russ fine-gold from Wisconsin

[02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:10.820]
Almost nobody in America's got the balls to stand up to him and say hey, where the hell you making this crap up huh

[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:16.720]
You're gonna tell everybody what oh and by the way did fourth no jury no jury number four in the tyco case got a

[02:33:17.220 --> 02:33:21.540]
Causing phone call in the last 24 hours. That's why they got the mistrial

[02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:27.800]
A core or a course of letter within last 24 hours. In other words, they made them an offer they couldn't refuse

[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:33.260]
Uh-oh. Well, I don't think I want to be involved in this no more. Okay, mistrial. We'll start all over again

[02:33:35.540 --> 02:33:35.980]
Well

[02:33:35.980 --> 02:33:41.860]
These grave robbers that ripped off and scammed people from their life savings from millions and millions all these guys from

[02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:46.540]
And Ron and world comm and tyco these people should be on death row right now

[02:33:48.060 --> 02:33:53.020]
That's where they ought to be they're worried about putting Martha Stewart and Jill because she lied about the few grandets

[02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:56.420]
You made big stink and deal all of these people ought to be on death row

[02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:58.860]
And they're walking around on the loose

[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:04.820]
Anyway, like I said very passive people they lose their life savings based on a bunch of lies. Oh, what was me?

[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:08.040]
I guess I'll have to work till I'm 95. Oh gee. What was me

[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:14.880]
Let's put it another uh four years in there for the guy that's big businesses favored pawn. Okay, let's put him back in here again

[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:19.540]
He never made a big business enterprise that he wasn't in love with and then in bed with but let's put him in here again

[02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:23.840]
Well, it's speaking of money if we have any cash left over after we get our full page ad

[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:26.700]
Yeah, you know who we're gonna give it to Donald Trump

[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:31.240]
You need that yeah, I know if you don't give them money you're fired

[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:36.180]
Casino mogul Donald Trump may have the final word with his television apprentices

[02:34:36.180 --> 02:34:41.180]
But his auditors say Trump's casino company will be in deep trouble without a cash infusion

[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:44.260]
Infusion which will leave him with a minority holding in a company

[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:48.420]
So I think in the beginning of that show every week

[02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:49.980]
You watch that show?

[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:53.080]
Are you kidding me? No, I watched it once

[02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:58.140]
But to begin to the show Donald's gonna come on and make a personal plea to the audience. Yeah

[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:05.580]
The warning hit the shares of Trump hotels and casino resorts with fell more than 12% in trading Wednesday morning

[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:13.120]
Got okay, well maybe uh crushed a lot of money to keep that hair going like that. You know keep that color and keep it up the same texture

[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:16.820]
five five six seven oh five sixty

[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:22.480]
pound five sixty on a AT&T and I want to tell you one other thing too who's starting to give me a little bit

[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:28.300]
The rub me the wrong way even though he's doing a fine job is the guy that started all this got up there in New York very few people

[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:30.840]
Would have undertaken such a massive project, you know

[02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:36.840]
Yeah, and we're not looking for any and I'm speaking for myself any publicity any mention

[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:39.060]
I don't want to be associated with this thing. It's his deal

[02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:42.100]
But it would seem to me since we're trying to raise the money

[02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:50.360]
To enable this guy Scott and the people who support this idea to place this ad which he thought was a great idea

[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:56.220]
By the way, it would seem to me that just maybe since he's got a hundred and forty five thousand plus signatures on there

[02:35:56.220 --> 02:35:58.340]
And there are a lot of people that are looking at that thing

[02:35:58.340 --> 02:36:03.340]
Maybe he just make it might make a link to stop fcc.us

[02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:08.160]
Now I realize he thinks well, that's a little bit confusing two different URLs. You know something big deal

[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:12.620]
I think it can be explained we don't want to take away from any cash he might get to defraise expenses

[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:18.100]
But the bottom line is we could use some support from some other people on stop fcc.us

[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000]
To raise some cash

[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:23.440]
Right right and he ought to be one of them

[02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:27.500]
Because I don't think that there's any but I don't know. I'm just talking out of my ass

[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:32.040]
I don't think there's anybody on there anywhere in this country who's got more people to sign that than than we have

[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:37.960]
You think that's a revolutionary comment? No, I think it's accurate

[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:43.220]
So I'm just throwing it out there because Eric tells me that Scott's listening to show he's glued to it every day

[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:45.080]
And what it'll not but also to be listened to

[02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:49.100]
There's something to think about Scott give us a little help in hand. We're trying to help you

[02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:52.220]
We're trying to do it for the cause that you very violently have undertaken

[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:56.500]
It'll be really nice if he could give us a little more exposure because just sit in here and try to drain the money

[02:36:56.500 --> 02:37:01.820]
I tried to drain blood out of a rock with this crowd. I don't think it's gonna work all our well. What do we got now?

[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:05.300]
One moment please. Yeah, take a peek

[02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:06.540]
Three sixty one thirteen

[02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:11.640]
Forty three sixty once it is forty eight sixty one and whatever they're getting the thirteen

[02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:16.300]
Maybe Dan Merino allowed give the thirteen cent. He's got a great sense of humor and great lips

[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:20.700]
Forty eight sixty one and he's a hundred and thirty nine bucks more. We can do that. This is our easy. Okay

[02:37:21.180 --> 02:37:24.600]
I'm going to Todd Dreckle. No problem. What about his visor master card

[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:27.400]

[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:45.680]
objectionable than a weasel

[02:38:46.540 --> 02:38:48.800]
Just take a look at that thing. It's crawling around on his forehead

[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:52.820]
Absolutely, maybe that's why Wayne hates him. Maybe Wayne is jealous of his hairpiece. You think

[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:59.020]
Could be. Yeah, maybe Wayne would like to bar. Hey listen if you want to kind of patch things up with Wayne

[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:01.660]
Moe is that I don't want to tell you how to run your life

[02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:08.120]
But he'll want to patch things up with the owner of the team that you broadcast in the games for maybe load him that nice Sunday go to meet him one man. It's a beauty

[02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:12.440]

And there's boogie on the brain

[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:02.840]
Olson twins are Brad bedtime

[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:06.200]
So Johnny Depp, Keanu, weezer, Willes, Smith, Madonna,

[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:07.620]
For the heck of it

[02:40:07.620 --> 02:40:09.160]
Owl, lookers, shorts and licked

[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:12.480]
Covey, dying for the lakers, Maldives, and bad, I black

[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:14.180]
We just need to side out

[02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:16.400]
Here we go, now higher

[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:18.560]
Pretty soon we know

[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:20.700]
And which we please show them

[02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:23.100]
Here we go, now higher

[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:25.220]
Better not be worse

[02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:27.100]
Or they won't be short-wish

[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:38.180]
Once they've been at 560 WDQM, Sergio and Ilea, Schlepper, like per Sergio, he donated 10 bucks to our cost, stop FCC.US, thanks Sergio

[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:44.860]
He says with the threat of losing my job in the next few months indirectly to debush his policies, I still don't need a 10 bucks to stop FCC this morning

[02:40:44.860 --> 02:40:47.860]
Keep lashing out of those Nazis, thanks Sergio and Ilea, thanks amigo

[02:40:48.820 --> 02:40:50.520]
And by the way, Luis Miguel was a manudo

[02:40:51.500 --> 02:40:56.780]
Now here's somebody says, cool and corral's been in my hometown in 3-2th Missouri for 20 years, alright?

[02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:58.780]
That must be kind of like kind of a two egg, you see?

[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:00.460]
Right there next to them

[02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:01.860]
Alright, 2.0

[02:41:01.860 --> 02:41:04.760]
5.670, 5.60, 0.560, 0.560 on EAT

[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:10.460]
I realize it's not very civilating radio, which is why I hate to do it to come on here and beg and plead in school

[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:13.520]
It's childish, but again that's what you have to do

[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:17.060]
Because most people will not willingly part with a dime, you know?

[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:18.060]
You know that?

[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:18.800]
Oh yeah

[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:21.700]
Most people are like generous, so like I am

[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:26.540]
And even before I was making a big bucks, I still if I could get involved in a cause

[02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:31.080]
Anytime I asked anybody, see I'm gonna tell you right now, which I remember that Rick Riley incident at that time

[02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:32.340]
Were you there when they were doing that?

[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:34.100]
When they were doing what?

[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:38.180]
When the fire engine or whatever was that they were trying to get raised the money to buy or whatever that feel was

[02:41:38.180 --> 02:41:40.660]
Oh yeah, yeah it was a Vannis

[02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:44.540]
Andulans or a Vannis, something they were trying to raise money to get to again

[02:41:44.540 --> 02:41:46.280]
Yes, for what was the cause, do you remember?

[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:49.420]
No, I don't, it'll come to me

[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:51.500]
And I was on vacation at the time

[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.560]
I come back from vacation and we already had some other thing going either our best of for Camilla's house or whatever we doing at the time

[02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:02.540]
But in spite of that, I come back from vacation to reach out and pat myself on a vacuum which I will do

[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:05.140]
And they weren't raising squat, okay?

[02:42:06.300 --> 02:42:10.380]
And to make a long story short, they asked me and I said no problem, I jumped on a bad wagon

[02:42:10.380 --> 02:42:15.920]
I put in some kicked in some cash on my own, I got on the air and promoted it and we raised the 10 grand or whatever we needed to get the Vann

[02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:17.540]
I remember it well

[02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:19.360]
Now what did Rick put in there anything?

[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.680]
No, I'm not that I can remember, I can recall that was why I kept trying him about that

[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:27.860]
If you're going to promote for everybody else to kick in unless you're willing to take the bull by the horns

[02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:31.380]
Like I kicked in the first couple of grand on this deal and George put in a hundred bucks

[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:33.940]
Then how can you expect anybody else to do it?

[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:39.200]
I mean how can you pretend you believe in it as a worthy cause unless you're willing to put up some cash?

[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:40.700]
Right, well I'm putting up my time

[02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:45.600]
Right, the time that he'd be sitting there anywhere, what the hell is that? What does that mean?

[02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:47.920]
What a phony, no one do you hate it Rick, we're all like poison

[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:49.460]
Suts we love, Rick we hate

[02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:50.620]
Hate you Rick

[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:53.420]
It's just gone down there finally

[02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:54.460]
WDQA, hello

[02:42:56.100 --> 02:42:59.040]
Hi, I was calling about to let the Pactanel

[02:42:59.040 --> 02:42:59.700]
Speaking

[02:42:59.700 --> 02:43:03.340]
Oh, Liesney Gell was never in the noodle

[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:04.420]
That's what I think

[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:07.120]
Okay, I used to be a man noodle fan when I grew up

[02:43:07.120 --> 02:43:10.280]
Really? I think she's right because I can't find any kind of English language confirmation

[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:15.100]
Yes, he just found some propaganda there with somebody made that up, somebody who was obsessed with Luisa

[02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:17.180]
So maybe some pedophiles obsessed with the noodle

[02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:18.100]
Maybe

[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:19.760]
Thanks, sweetheart

[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:20.440]
No problem

[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:21.740]
Ask the chemo heaters

[02:43:22.660 --> 02:43:23.100]
Okay

[02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:23.840]
See ya

[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:24.140]
Hi

[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:31.140]
See it's a good thing you've got all Luisa McGill records there, I don't have any of the CD here

[02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:33.340]
Everything, I put them in a box underneath the cabinet

[02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:34.480]
Why is that?

[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:35.960]
Get out of here

[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:39.260]
Are you start with your anti-Luisa McGill stuff just because you got a fat ass

[02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:43.000]
No, I'm good as to keep them all safe and nice and doesn't fit out of here

[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.120]
Because you're afraid I might play a little bit on a year

[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.820]
As a matter of fact, you know who is really speaking of the goddess?

[02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:52.600]
I remember I was telling her that Luisa McGill record every day at the end of the show like a 155

[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:54.520]
When she was briefly doing afternoons before the show

[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:55.760]
She was going to show her off the night and put it in there

[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:56.220]
Huh?

[02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:58.140]
And I was getting blamed

[02:43:58.140 --> 02:44:00.980]
Oh, you're trying to sandbag my show, of course everybody was getting blamed

[02:44:00.980 --> 02:44:03.940]
That's before she became a political maven and went on air-america

[02:44:03.940 --> 02:44:05.380]
I think you were trying to sandbag her show

[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:06.400]
Huh?

[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:08.180]
I think you were trying to sandbag her show

[02:44:08.180 --> 02:44:08.900]
Right, yeah

[02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:11.540]
Now she did a pretty good job of it herself as I recall

[02:44:11.540 --> 02:44:14.360]
That was before I mean she was just starting out

[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:17.920]
She was a, you know she listened to Neil and listened to Neil then she knew she was ready

[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:18.720]
Remember that quote?

[02:44:19.180 --> 02:44:19.500]
Yes

[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:20.700]
I'll sorry to remember

[02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:22.240]
I know how to handle him now

[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:25.240]
Handle who?

[02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:25.740]
You

[02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:26.920]
What was the response?

[02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:29.560]
You ripped her an ass because she called you on the phone when you were sick

[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:32.060]
And when she was going to bring you soup and do all this stuff

[02:44:32.060 --> 02:44:34.500]
And you told her to bug off and just leave you alone that that's what you want

[02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:35.080]
Right

[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:37.060]
And she was all very bent out of shape about that

[02:44:37.060 --> 02:44:40.000]
Well of course Randy's one of those people unless you go along with her 100%

[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.140]
If you disagree about anything he stabbed me in the back and I'm sure that one of her sick fans said

[02:44:44.140 --> 02:44:45.580]
They're probably calling her on a year in New York

[02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:47.200]
Oh Neil was ripping you

[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:47.740]
No I'm not

[02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:50.780]
I'm just literally screaming tirade after that and then ended it with well

[02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:52.280]
Well I know how to handle him now

[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:55.320]
She knows how to handle me

[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:57.220]
Yeah, with both the both hands stay away

[02:44:57.220 --> 02:44:58.220]
No, geez

[02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:00.740]
Watch it

[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:03.000]
Get that bell jar out again Josh

[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:05.760]
The woman a big slot in it

[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:08.300]
You might have to take that hundred bucks back if you keep this up

[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:10.020]
So how are we doing on there?

[02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:11.480]
I bet you we got five grand by now

[02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:13.180]
4861 on the last report

[02:45:13.180 --> 02:45:14.580]
Come on let's let's hear it

[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:15.740]
4886 13

[02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:17.860]
4886

[02:45:18.620 --> 02:45:20.680]
Which means we need another hundred and fourteen bucks

[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:22.100]
So it's not a done thing

[02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:23.520]
Now I'm going to tell you right now

[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:26.740]
Any one of those sales holes they could donate a hundred bucks

[02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:28.980]
So we'd like drop in a dime on the floor for you or Josh

[02:45:29.980 --> 02:45:33.820]
Now like you drop in a quarter and Josh drop in a penny

[02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:35.180]
Or is it the other way around?

[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:35.920]
I'd wet however

[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:37.260]
I'm telling you

[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:42.320]
114 bucks and we can't squeeze some cash out of those sales holes back there

[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:44.280]
And don't tell me they're not listening like fat boy

[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:45.080]
That's how the crevice

[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:47.240]
You know something we might keep them alive in other two or three months

[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:48.960]
If he would put 114 bucks in there

[02:45:49.940 --> 02:45:51.580]
Instead of eating all them Cheetos and Fries

[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:52.840]
And what?

[02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:55.020]
4456 13

[02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:56.460]
That's 49

[02:45:56.460 --> 02:45:56.840]
49

[02:45:56.840 --> 02:45:57.700]
What were you doing?

[02:45:57.740 --> 02:45:58.520]
We just went down

[02:45:58.980 --> 02:46:00.900]
No no I was adding the 500 before

[02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:02.180]
I'm just reading this off right now

[02:46:02.180 --> 02:46:03.660]
So 4956 13

[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:07.800]
4956 which means we need 44 bucks

[02:46:09.340 --> 02:46:12.000]
44 dollars on a credit card

[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.520]
My God fat boy you are pathetic

[02:46:16.180 --> 02:46:19.260]
All these years I've put up with your nonsense and your foolishness

[02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:20.740]
And all your fake good deals

[02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:21.760]
Hiya Pally

[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:26.620]
Yeah all that crappy food that used to bring in from places that were about two days away from going out of business

[02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:27.520]
Hiya Pally

[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:28.520]
And every time they did

[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:29.580]
Remember that one diner?

[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:30.300]
That was special

[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:34.260]
That place made the Olive Garden seem like Ruth Kriss Steakhouse

[02:46:34.260 --> 02:46:35.560]
That's how bad that place was

[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:36.520]
The Rancid Meat Dines

[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:38.180]
44 bucks Todd Dreck

[02:46:38.180 --> 02:46:40.760]
You miserable little worthless weasel

[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:44.540]
Who keeps changing the dates on a copy and sent me the same fast train copy now

[02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:45.660]
For how many years now

[02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:46.560]
About 30 man

[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:48.860]
They must have naked pictures of our friend over there at fast train

[02:46:48.860 --> 02:46:51.000]
Because there's no other reason in the world like I would stay on here

[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.080]
I mean you talk about not servicing what you sell

[02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:54.160]
That's you Todd

[02:46:56.220 --> 02:46:56.900]

The one thing with Josh talking about

[02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:15.160]
I never heard that

[02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:18.600]

[02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:53.100]
If they're still around

[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:56.240]
Cracker Burrell 24, Golden Corral 23, I hear that's a buffet

[02:48:57.400 --> 02:48:59.140]
Do they have any Bufo under buffet?

[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:04.400]
Multi-pod 17, Rasca Loss 14, Benagans 13, Fridays 12, Macaroni Grill 11

[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:06.720]

[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:09.400]
Perkins Pancake House 10, which is another one I think is very good

[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:14.840]
Fodruckers 9, Stookeys 9, Outback 6, Hopps 5, El House 3, Bobby Rabino's 2

[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:16.660]
Tony Rome is 1 out of 770

[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:19.620]
See I mean everybody's got different tastes

[02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:22.560]
A lot of these people don't like for example Macaroni Grill

[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:26.160]
They like McDonald's you know they like vanilla ice cream

[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:28.200]
And more power to them

[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:29.660]

[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:41.500]
You know the money you're raising, yeah

[02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:44.260]
The advertising of one of those papers is going to go on or one magazine

[02:49:44.260 --> 02:49:45.540]
USA Today

[02:49:45.940 --> 02:49:47.100]

You go to our neo-ranges.com and there's a banner right near the top

Very simple, Eric did a hell of a job on that if we do so so his self

[02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:12.440]
Right?

[02:50:12.980 --> 02:50:14.200]
If we do so his self

[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:15.420]
It's a beautiful thing

[02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:21.500]
I might be a little bit confusing to people because on top we got we're promoting a Scots deal there which is what this is all about

[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:25.060]
Is protesting the people in the Senate the FCC everybody who will listen

[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:28.940]
But if you go underneath where it says what's new, what's new

[02:50:28.940 --> 02:50:33.880]
Right about the list of all the cheap channel stations that you're not supposed to be listening to if you want to protest them

[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:35.740]
All eight in South Florida

[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:41.240]
Right in between there is the big banner it's got the American flag in it back around it says stop FCC.us

[02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:50.580]
Promoting the campaign for free speech please help to raise money to advertise the stop FCC campaign the petition campaign and just click where it says please help us raise money

[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:54.180]

And you didn't think we could now I again I am really not pleased with the fact that I had to go through all that

[02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:11.200]
Perniadic bitching and pleading and squeezing and a lot of people are at work during their car during their trucking out at their computer right now

[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:15.180]
But you know we're gonna make this happen. I'm not gonna sit back and take no for an answer

And you know something if we raise the 30 grand or whatever we get and we take out the end and we've sent all the petitions

And nothing happens at least we tried

[02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:26.080]
How can anybody with a good conscience just sit back and say oh well

[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:33.280]

[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:44.920]
Right

[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:54.940]
Every time you try to like mobilize people and say hey you know open up a mouth do something you know stand up for what you believe in stand up for your career for your livelihood

[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:59.680]
Stand up for the constitution stand up for anything or just stand up and go take a leak anything

[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:11.980]
Yeah you know there's any else starting in again okay we just the too many whims man too many people who just whoops out every single time is kind of like slunk over in the corner there with that body language you know

[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:22.840]
Kind of like a Chris moron used to do the Panther games you can see by his body language in order to lose a he used to like front down as there's you know what that means from sure kind of like slump some shoulders

[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:31.580]

[02:56:48.460 --> 02:56:55.880]

[02:56:55.880 --> 02:57:01.220]
I mean you I say today they got eighty trillion people are read it that look at it that peruse it

[02:57:01.220 --> 02:57:07.240]
Charles and dear field beats says under the heading of just one more item to add the long list of horse connected with this insane war in Iraq

[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:14.380]
A recent documentary that a documentary that aired on PBS's front line said that because of pressure by the White House to get Sodom at any cost

[02:57:14.380 --> 02:57:20.460]
The US military dropped megaton bombs on the homes of Iraqi civilians killing countless numbers of innocent men and women and children

[02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:27.440]
The military defended sections by saying that no matter how weak the intelligence reports were they felt they just couldn't take the chance of missing Sodom

[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:33.480]
Which of course we now know they did but that's not the worst part of this story as we all know in a war tragic mistakes are sometimes made

[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:41.980]
But this mistake was repeated not just once but fifty different times and some people still wonder why the Iraqis are throwing bombs at us instead of flowers and candy

[02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:47.340]
One final point says Charles George Bush also puts the blame on 9-11 on poor intelligence

[02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:55.440]
But we already knew that he was an idiot as he became president that's right lack of intelligence and the W in the same sense as a redundancy

[02:57:56.760 --> 02:58:09.340]
Wow, I was saying 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line how many signatures is Scott got yet 145,000 to 52

Oh, now Eric just eric just emailed me something that I'm just a little bit disturbed and concerned about

[03:04:15.980 --> 03:04:20.880]
I don't understand what the hell I met Eric. I read it, but I don't I don't I think he's getting a little bit carried away

[03:04:22.020 --> 03:04:26.040]
Anyway, yes 48 you can add the five to this 48 3776

[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:28.320]
53 37

[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:30.740]
How can that be is that correct?

[03:04:31.980 --> 03:04:32.740]
53 right

[03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:36.140]
Well, I don't understand we had we had 5,000

[03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:42.480]
247 Amanda's gave you 250 year man. No, I haven't added his yet. Oh, I see well

[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:47.880]
I added in there if he tells you he's giving the boy the big right his word is as good as you know, how long you added in there now

[03:04:47.880 --> 03:04:51.320]
We got 5587. I'm more close than on 6 grand. We'll do this

[03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:55.280]
See, I don't take no for an answer real easily. Okay. Keep banging away and banging away

[03:04:55.280 --> 03:04:59.760]
Okay, center of bunch of people out there. This is really boring. Well, you know that cut loose for the few bucks

[03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:02.360]
We get it over with all right and then we move on with life

[03:05:02.980 --> 03:05:07.560]
This is a project. This is something like a like a like little kids, you know, here's a work project

[03:05:07.560 --> 03:05:09.460]
You're something for you to do keep you off the streets

[03:05:10.220 --> 03:05:13.380]
But anyway, Eric's the email. I'm confused. There was there some kind of a

[03:05:14.180 --> 03:05:19.020]
competition I don't know. I don't know. Do I better not say anything about this on the air?

[03:05:19.780 --> 03:05:25.100]
Because we're promoting stop FCC comments got petitioned right and if he chooses not to put us on it

[03:05:25.100 --> 03:05:29.880]
That's up to him, but I mean we're not we're not gonna start all over again Eric

[03:05:30.780 --> 03:05:34.300]
I don't think that's what he meant assuming that you got what I got

[03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:40.240]
I didn't get a copy of the email. I don't understand that but anyways is that we're getting touched with Peral maybe maybe you can do that

[03:05:40.240 --> 03:05:41.100]
Well, you're going on vacation

[03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:44.680]
Somebody can get touched. I'll send it down the line

[03:05:44.680 --> 03:05:48.760]
But again, keep in mind I do understand his predicament because he's working for a cheap channel

[03:05:48.760 --> 03:05:52.640]
That's basically he's working in land is owned by clear channel and they might not want him to go on on it

[03:05:52.640 --> 03:05:57.760]
up because they're you know busy sucking up to the bush people and the FCC they're getting fined every time they turn around

[03:05:59.420 --> 03:06:00.160]
WQA and hello

[03:06:01.400 --> 03:06:10.080]
Hey, yes sir. Hey, how you doing buddy pretty good. Hi. I am mad as heck you know that I'm a hard work in SOB and

[03:06:10.080 --> 03:06:14.640]
Push gets on keep you the dance and anybody out of work is lazy and a gold bricker

[03:06:15.220 --> 03:06:17.820]
Yeah, I'm the other private rate even though they created all these jobs

[03:06:17.820 --> 03:06:21.940]
They say 300 8000 unemployment rate just went back up to 5.7 percent

[03:06:21.940 --> 03:06:23.420]
5.7 percent

[03:06:23.940 --> 03:06:29.120]
42 interviews the last three months and this SOB is calling me a gold bricker. Yeah, yeah

[03:06:29.120 --> 03:06:31.780]
He could be subbed his head fixed among up. Okay, great

[03:06:32.460 --> 03:06:35.600]
Vote early and often pal. That's my best suggestion and good luck to you. What do you say?

[03:06:36.900 --> 03:06:37.700]
560.560

[03:06:37.700 --> 03:06:43.640]
Pound 560 on a 80 I better check my email here again real quick before Eric precipitates some kind of a

[03:06:43.640 --> 03:06:47.080]
I don't know what he's gotten minder. What did he email to you anything?

[03:06:48.660 --> 03:06:49.020]
Oh

[03:06:49.020 --> 03:06:56.040]
Confusion with people donating to scott site because he has a place to donate there right as opposed to the money that we're

[03:06:56.040 --> 03:07:01.800]
Well, I did not go on here the other day and say didn't I encourage people to donate and help him defray the cost of this thing and he's got a little side on it

[03:07:01.800 --> 03:07:07.780]
It's fine. Okay, it's great. No problem with that. Eric's concerned that some people might be going there thinking that they're contributing to this total

[03:07:09.460 --> 03:07:13.680]
Right, that's why we have the other competition or anything, but just there's there might be some confusion

[03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:18.720]
I see my never thought about that. That's a good point Eric, but I have no idea how to solve it and don't call me

[03:07:21.060 --> 03:07:27.660]
560 560 on a 80 and D line WQM. Hello, yeah, great. It's the same same schmuck

[03:07:37.920 --> 03:07:38.360]
speaking

[03:07:39.300 --> 03:07:44.600]
You can you tell me why you can't play the condolese a bit. I never heard why

[03:07:45.380 --> 03:07:49.460]
You can't play that because I was told that if I played it again, I would be fired. Is that a good reason?

[03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:56.500]
Yeah, but for what? What's that because because pressure was brought against the radio station by a bunch of right wing

[03:07:56.500 --> 03:08:04.880]
Enough jobs from newsmax.com and Fox News and Fox News Heather and they made a big simous about condolese and how is playing all this

[03:08:04.880 --> 03:08:10.060]
racial stuff about doctor rice not as other crap and then they threatened to bring in some so-called

[03:08:10.940 --> 03:08:11.340]
Equal

[03:08:12.180 --> 03:08:17.680]
Rights group some black militant group that was going to come in and pick at the station and we had a whole sort of dance about that

[03:08:17.680 --> 03:08:20.240]
And so you know since we all want to keep working. We just don't play it

[03:08:21.540 --> 03:08:26.520]
So as Bush is okay. I mean we can we cannot bush though all we want can't we? Yeah

[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:29.500]

Yeah, and we will thanks a lot pal

[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:38.060]
Yeah, the condolese story never really got told very well

[03:08:38.060 --> 03:08:41.260]
That's because most of the people in the local media that was a major major story

[03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:46.640]
We were threatened with just all kinds of everything short of death if we continue playing that and kiss a

Administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right wing is

Drilling it over and over and over into our head

[03:11:43.060 --> 03:11:45.160]
That Iraq has some

[03:11:45.800 --> 03:11:48.640]
Weapons of master's direction

[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:05.440]
The loss of civil rights is the rights that we're paying we're all suspects now

Not the ascrop this day. I have nothing to hide table talkers all are saying

out of provoked battle and world annihilation

[03:12:20.020 --> 03:12:26.020]
Old regime must fall and have a virgin installed with no objection at all

[03:12:26.020 --> 03:12:33.300]
Democrax don't have the ball and the right wing is drilling it over and over

[03:12:33.300 --> 03:12:34.060]
It too

[03:12:42.540 --> 03:12:42.900]
Farate was

[03:12:42.900 --> 03:12:42.900]

[03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:53.380]
156 to 5.0

[03:12:55.260 --> 03:13:00.120]
Compan I just get an email. I said nothing of the sort just whoa calm down now a little bit

[03:13:00.120 --> 03:13:03.480]
And says please call me and I'll explain why I'm going to lunacy so I'm not gonna call you now

[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:09.100]
Maybe later, but I doubt it just he's doing a magnificent job. Everything is fine. Just everything's under control right

[03:13:10.460 --> 03:13:15.380]
Right he tends to get a little bit emotional. I said nothing of the sort. What did I say that he said?

[03:13:16.260 --> 03:13:17.840]
That there was some kind of a competition

[03:13:18.380 --> 03:13:22.920]
That uh, well no, I just I just didn't understand his email was he can clarify it or not later on

[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:29.500]
You know, I mean we got a long weekend. Everything's fine. Just fine. We're speaking a weekend. Don't forget to turn your clock ahead one hour tomorrow night

[03:13:31.180 --> 03:13:34.940]
I'm gonna be saying that to remind myself you know spring ahead fall back all of that crap

[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:39.580]
To a clock in the morning Sunday morning, which means two o'clock tomorrow night when you go to bed tomorrow

[03:13:39.580 --> 03:13:41.520]
I turn the clock ahead now or turn them all ahead, please

[03:13:42.520 --> 03:13:46.240]
Now here's the deal here's what we got and you know another thing I was thinking while I was playing

[03:13:46.860 --> 03:13:55.740]
Now that we got Rickshaw helping out in the mad dog and duff and you and me and Greg uh and who Greg and Greg of course

[03:13:56.300 --> 03:14:01.140]
Uh, I don't think that the public out there should have to uh, I mean we welcome their support

[03:14:01.140 --> 03:14:04.560]
But they're not the ones that should have to do this because the people are working in this week

[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:08.580]
If they don't care enough to sit there very best and like to protect their own livelihood

[03:14:08.580 --> 03:14:11.260]
Then why the hell should the public care? This is what always I wondered

[03:14:12.100 --> 03:14:16.700]
Back in the days for the public as well. Oh, no, I agree with that it is for everybody

[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:20.700]
But I think first and foremost it should be the people who are in this business who ought to say hey

[03:14:20.700 --> 03:14:24.620]
Let's try to do something. Let's let's scream and yell and I just take it them roll over and play dead

[03:14:25.580 --> 03:14:28.000]
Because there's no end in sight. Where does it stop?

[03:14:29.020 --> 03:14:33.220]
Where does it stop? Does it stop at cable? Does it stop at satellite TV and radio?

[03:14:33.500 --> 03:14:36.420]
And I'm telling you what they got in mind and they've already said it

[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:41.060]
once they get all of these things uh buttoned down and they're going to work on the internet

[03:14:42.560 --> 03:14:47.400]
These are the thought police the word police the fascist police call them whatever the hell you want

[03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:48.200]
It's unacceptable

[03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:52.560]
It's not based on any kind of real law and they're just making it up as they go along

[03:14:52.940 --> 03:14:59.800]
And because you got two week need political parties who are crappin in their pants who are terrified of supporting what they would call smut during an election year

[03:15:00.580 --> 03:15:03.720]
And because they'll you know after us or after sin and 1500 signatures

[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:08.880]
When you saw what happened went after you did the same thing in the house, okay the next day the house passed the uh in decency bill

[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:12.460]
391 to 22 that's how much cloud the people that after of God

[03:15:14.360 --> 03:15:15.320]
391 to 22

[03:15:17.580 --> 03:15:20.600]
So you know their help is welcome and they can do whatever the hell you want with the senate

[03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:26.140]
But in the meantime I think a million signatures would have a little bit more cloud than 1500 the letters from the people in after

[03:15:26.140 --> 03:15:28.700]
You catch my drift I caught it

[03:15:29.540 --> 03:15:35.720]
And we got a hell of a start there. Thanks to scott 145,000 plus signatures. I know it's petitioned on stop FCC.com

[03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:41.040]
And all we're trying to do is just rate help him to raise enough money so we can promote that website

[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:44.920]
So people around the country can open up USA today one day and say hey look at this

[03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:47.860]
Here's a thing all about what they're doing to freedom of speech in the first amendment

[03:15:47.860 --> 03:15:53.000]
And while all of our favorite people are going off the year and why we can't hear a damn thing anymore on the radio and on tv

[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:58.800]
And why they're having an interest breakdown about Janet Jackson's booby on there see this is how tragic it's become

[03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:05.600]
We're blowing people away. There's your kids. There's your friends your kids your neighbors your nephews your grandsons whoever your brothers

[03:16:06.400 --> 03:16:09.800]
There are the pictures of all these slaughtered kids over there being butchered every day

[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:11.900]
All the yesterday rackies that are being butchered every day

[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:14.040]
for no good reason at all

[03:16:15.620 --> 03:16:16.040]
unbelievable

[03:16:17.020 --> 03:16:19.020]
And the public sits back and says nothing

[03:16:20.140 --> 03:16:24.100]
And is willing to accept this fascism this creeping crap that's going on in this country

[03:16:25.780 --> 03:16:29.740]
All based on the excuse of we saw a little booby on tv there for a second and a half

[03:16:29.740 --> 03:16:36.860]
How stupid can a public possibly be how lazy can they possibly be how much crap can they possibly take with the scale

[03:16:39.660 --> 03:16:41.460]
You say fat boy came in again

[03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:47.540]
So anyway, I help us out of what we can do just click on the orages.com when you're through looking at the

[03:16:47.540 --> 03:16:52.480]
Jerry Hallowell's triple booby do a shot there and get on their stop by FCC.us

[03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:57.400]
Got to with the 750 from yes, and it's in Greg 4872 76

[03:16:58.680 --> 03:17:04.760]
4872 and 750 looks like the man go over a little bit too bad 56 20 and of course on q 56 that sounds appropriate

[03:17:11.460 --> 03:17:11.500]
you
