[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]
Going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico

[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.980]
We're gonna California and Texas and New York. We're gonna South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan

[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.080]
And then we're gonna watch it in DC to take back the White House

[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.360]
Oh, oh, oh

[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.020]
I showed her right melon and man was it great

[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.900]
Had an area like a big dinner plate

[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.120]
Janet's right top breath every headline

[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.200]
Wonder if she'll help CBS pay to fly

[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.540]
First she denied it said it wasn't mistake

[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.420]
A costume malfunction said Justin Timberwake

[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.680]
Now they've admitted they flashed for the tool

[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.980]
It'll be the Super Bowl remembered for the moon

[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.680]
The FCC says it was in decent scene

[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.520]
Some pornography, big Yip, one lip

[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.540]
I'll never forget that infamous tongue

[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.420]
I'll remember his game for seeing Janet's jug

[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.860]
1002 at 560 WQM when I hear that Willie Williams is gonna be he could turn out to be one of the great Americans of all time

[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.600]
I have to look with a jaundice view upon that you know what?

[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.460]
Oh, you're just bigoted that's what it is

[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.060]
That's correct after raise all three eyebrows when I hear that

[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.760]
That was really special thanks a lot Joe Rose old blockhead forget that in there

[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.780]
Even though we're pissed off at NBC6 for screwing over Bob Weaver

[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.620]
That really pisses me off big time

[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.740]
Oh, speaking of guys that got screwed over but keep bouncing back Joe Angel remember Joe of course

[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.180]
Right

[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.200]
Who team would John Miller and the Orioles radio booth from 1988 to 1982

[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.620]
Joe Angel returning to the team as its lead play by play announcer on Fagship Station WBAL

[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.920]
That's where rumor used to work your close friend

[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920]
By the way rumors in town are you going lunch today?

[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.220]
No

[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.620]
WBAL announced yesterday on its website

[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.140]
Orioles spokesman Bill Stetka confirmed angels hiring that said the team was surprised by the timing of BAL's announcement

[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.460]
And that the rest of the world's radio and TV broadcast teams remain undecided

[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.680]
So in other words it's like oh we hired Joe so some of you guys are going to get fired

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.380]
According to the radio stations website radio announcers Jim Hunter and Fred Manfra will split time between TV and radio broadcast

[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.320]
So Joe Angel good guy comes down with his feet on the ground

[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.640]
Put it in a wind column for Joe Angel okay

[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.500]
All right good guy that's screwed over by the John Henry Marlon organization

[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.700]
John Henry was the anti-Christ

[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.340]
So what about Willie Williams huh?

[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.740]
It's got nothing to do with the poll we're going to take but boy this radio station is obsessed

[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.400]
I'll tell you who really pisses me off who's also in the news speaking of scumbag jacks

[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.700]
Is Jason Williams?

[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.940]
Yeah is it like a Williams thing?

[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.860]
Apparently the Williams brothers

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.000]
Is that what it is all the Williams people? I mean come up with somebody else named Williams

[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]
Williams who's a pretty good guy? Huh?

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.500]
The Williams brothers are good guys not the Williams brothers though

[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.900]
I mean what is it a name that maybe there's a person at name?

[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.620]
What's in a name?

[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.120]
What about the hardest driver?

[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.960]
Lil Williams he was blind on his dead

[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.440]
And he had a little bit of a nose problem

[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.240]
And anyway this thing with Jason Williams killing that dog

[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.400]
Now I must have been either in Europe on vacation or hiding under a rock somewhere

[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.440]
I never heard that thing about that thing about him killing his dog

[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.460]
You good?

[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.040]
I know

[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.380]
What about Josh did you hear that?

[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.380]
No I didn't

[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.380]
Anyway jurors are going to hear two versions of how a limo driver was killed in Jason Williams bedroom

[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.000]
And opening statements are made in the former NBI stars Manslota trial today

[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.360]
I don't want to go through the whole thing I'll save that for later

[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.480]
But 18 pool members who joined the pool early in the process

[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.580]
Had to be interviewed about some broadcast that took place after they were qualified

[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.540]
The judge then began questioning them individually as they tried to put together a jury

[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.080]
One female member of the pool was excused when she said a friend had told her stories last week

[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.220]
That said Williams had killed his pet rot wiler with a shotgun

[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.280]
If you're losing a bed involving the dog if that's true now maybe somebody will call in and inform us

[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.260]
Because we're not into that whole sports thing quite as much as anybody else on his radio station

[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.980]
Thank God

[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.940]
But if that's true man I say fry his ass right now because Jason Williams you make me sick

[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.900]
You make me want a barf

[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.520]
Okay?

[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.420]
Any asshole and I don't care whether he's white, black, yellow, purple

[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.740]
Pink with the yellow polka dots that would shoot and kill his pet dog on a bed

[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.880]
Is some kind of a lunatic needs to be put away for a long time? Okay?

[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.700]
Fry his ass now

[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.860]
WDQM Jason Williams line

[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.560]
Hello? Yes sir

[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.460]
Yeah, how you doing? I heard the story of this one

[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.940]
Is that a true story?

[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.660]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.620]
Well, let's just read what happened was the guy who was at his house made a bed with him

[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.780]
That he couldn't drag the rat while he's out of his house without that dog like biting him or something

[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.160]
Yeah

[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.180]
So what happened was the guy pulled the dog out of the leg and dragged him out

[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.980]
Jason Williams supposedly went upstairs and the guy thought he was getting the money for him to pay him

[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.060]
He said, is that a $100?

[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.140]
Mm-hmm

[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.740]
And then he took his shotgun and shot the dog in the side and then in the head

[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.420]
I say fry his ass right now don't you agree?

[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.140]
I agree I mean if you're going to kill a dog for like any reason

[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.240]
Then you're certainly going to kill a limo driver

[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.080]
For sure

[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.100]
Thanks a lot, Pally, have a great day

[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.820]
That just makes I want to quit right now, I want to just walk out on the edge of my balcony

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.540]
Take a long look down and think about it very seriously

[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.460]
I just can't deal with this crap

[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.820]
And this radio station where we got a bunch of assholes like Yelda, you know I have to agree with Mo

[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.040]
But once in my life, you know that takes a lot of pain to be greatly

[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.240]
Because I come in here 7-15 this morning like I do every morning

[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.080]
I open up the pot and I smoke a little bit of it

[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.960]
And I heard Mo go on and about

[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.520]
And Gildey's ripping him and asked about, well you just come on and give him a chance

[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.300]
And you're right in some asshole collar, chronic voice

[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.580]
Calling him in ripping Mo because he doesn't want to give away the Williams and other chance

[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.500]
How many chances does he need?

[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.420]
3rd man

[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.660]
Huh?

[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.420]
I'm sick and tired of scumbags

[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.000]
You know how about Lawrence Phillips?

[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.060]
Let's bring him back in

[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.900]
You know it's not too late for him to go back to school

[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.080]
He could learn a lot

[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.840]
Because he's probably got an IQ

[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.900]
He's probably as smart as a boxer rocks as Mad Dog would say

[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.760]
By the way, don't forget no Mad Dog today we got the Willie Williams show at 2

[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.760]
And then we got the Jason Williams show at 4

[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.960]
Man, when are you people going to get with it?

[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.880]
You sports sucking nerds

[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.100]
I can't stand it, it makes me puke

[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.940]
WQM Jason Williams line, hello

[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.780]
Good afternoon

[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.260]
Good evening

[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.380]
It's Greg and Charles

[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.960]
WQM, hello

[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.660]
Yes, I did hear something about that Jason Williams with the dog

[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.640]
What did you hear?

[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.680]
Apparently it was with one of his friends at this big mansion house if you've ever seen pictures of that house that we have

[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.940]
It's huge yes

[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:32.820]
And the friend said I could make the dog either come or to come in the house or something, some sort of trick or something

[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.560]
And the guy actually had done it and they bet $100 on it

[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.040]
And Williams said after that he shot the dog, he was going to shoot the dog because he was going to have to pay the guy $100

[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.940]
Because the dog did what the guy said

[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.920]
Can you even begin to understand that to relate to that?

[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.560]
No, but you can't relate to how much money that Jason Williams makes for being a basketball player, Neil

[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.300]
For being a scumbag

[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.400]
Okay pal, thanks for the bad news

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.000]
I'm going to

[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.060]
I just, it takes an awful lot to make me speechless

[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:12.120]
Yeah, somehow I missed this I don't know why I don't pay too much attention to that crack because there's so many scumbag

[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.140]
Jocks pressed and present that it's hard to keep track, you know

[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.920]
But plus of course I don't follow the NBA anyway because it's basically just a bunch of seven foot freaks

[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.380]
Are you saying you need a scorecard to keep track of the scumbags?

[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.440]
That's what we're going to need the QAM scumbag in fact there you go Josh something that might get some people looking at

[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.520]
The QAM scumbag scorecard on the QA website

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.440]
That'll take you a few months, some take you weeks

[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.360]
A third man

[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.240]
Take a pile at least

[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.900]
We can have their criminal statistics on there

[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.300]
Right

[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:47.300]
And of course all this business about what you know you and Larry Coker and they they've tried to put that patent in their past and they're behind

[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.240]
Well that's fine

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.480]
That's great, more power to him for that but don't start all over again trying to rehab gangsters

[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:59.220]
People that are chronic offenders, scumbags

[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:06.580]
See this is one of the biggest problems in America is making excuses for people whose behavior is so aberrant and so unacceptable

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.600]
And the fact that anybody can even relate to the idea that this guy lost a bet

[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:17.880]
A guy who's a multi multi multi multi millionaire who's making just gigantic amounts of cash for being a seven foot freak that plays basketball

[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.120]
And shoots and kills his dog because he lost a bet

[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.280]
And of course he'll probably turn out to be a really great American someday

[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.240]
That's right, we just leave him alone long enough

[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.220]
Just give him a chance

[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.060]
No

[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.680]
And another

[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.920]
I say fry his ass in fact

[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.780]
Let's take Lawrence Phillips and Jason Williams and put him side by each and a twin whore

[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.860]
Okay, I'll pull this way

[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.020]
Don't forget Willie

[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.420]
Now Willie didn't kill any dog, he didn't kill any, I mean he's you know we've got some problems

[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.240]
I don't put him in the same category yet

[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.140]
Yeah

[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.500]
Yeah

[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.240]
There's a group in it

[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.220]
But guess what, Gelti?

[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.320]
I told, I told Muff this morning I said you know Gelti really should have been a fang

[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.680]
He said what do you mean by that?

[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.920]
I said because I don't know anybody who sucks more or better than Gelti

[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.340]
He is the biggest suckle I have ever heard in my life

[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.520]
No matter what it is, whether it's the Panther organization which of course he's under payroll so naturally he sucks up to them

[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.740]
No matter what it is in the area of sports

[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.760]
He will suck up to the unsuckable

[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.820]
I mean there's just nothing to suck up there

[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.540]
There's a whole Willie Williams thing unless you're going to make into a racial thing which I know what some of the call is of course are

[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.840]
But there's nothing there to suck

[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.420]
It's kind of like just in Timberlake, Gelti, there's nothing there to suck

[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.180]
Right

[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:32.040]
But man you talk about a master, master suckle, this Gelti, Jesus, God Almighty

[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.820]
Just when we thought that we knew something about him

[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.960]
And even what he says

[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.820]
I like dick a lot

[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.700]
Yeah, well we know that

[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.620]
And he also says once in a while

[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.180]
Up to bite

[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.680]
Well, he makes me nauseous

[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.120]
I'm starting to favor Mo on that show

[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.300]
And I know that I feel I'm clean that I said that

[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.960]
I'm going to get my lice all spray out again and spray my throat

[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.180]
But I just feel nauseous from this suck it up

[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.060]
See how at what point do you, if you want to be like civilized people

[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.180]
They're all worried about Janet Jackson's booby being on there for a second and a half

[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.860]
This is the big controversy in America

[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:12.980]
And yet it's like, oh well, if you can throw it a ball or stick the ball in a hoop or hit the ball

[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.620]
And then no matter what you do in some kind of a stupid ass game

[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.420]
No matter what you are in your life, they make no difference

[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.600]
We don't care

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.460]
Right

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.840]
We'll give you 100 chances to it, whatever it takes, 200 chances

[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.960]
If you can win us some games and make us feel better about ourselves

[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.520]
Like if that's what it's all about

[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.420]
Only game matters

[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.780]
The game matter?

[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.380]
It's game matter, you ought to know

[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.980]
I know all about game matter, that's what Reverend Jones said

[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.300]
1013 at 560, I'll tell you one thing, it does matter

[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.980]
And that's a kind of mattress you sleep in on every night

[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.860]
Because if you sleep in on a crappy old mattress, your back will feel it every single day

[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.100]
You'll feel like you didn't sleep at all

[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.840]
And of course, president's day is coming in just a matter of days

[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.520]
What is it Monday?

[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.040]
Okay

[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.960]
What is the day?

[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.300]
I had that memo from Greg Reed with that squiggle on it

[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:56.820]
Yeah, it's Monday

[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.500]
Monday, Tuesday

[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.340]
I'm Monday

[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.800]
And of course, every year on president's day, the mall stores and those assures

[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.700]
And the mall stores are running those phony mattress sales, what they do is they double the price

[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.000]
And then they say, look at this, they slash it, line through it, 50% off or give any half off

[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.820]
Well, that's bull crap

[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.900]
If you want real rock bottom prices on the best mattress is going, you know what to do by now

[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.820]
Do the same thing I'm doing for years and George is finally caught on

[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.260]
And Bill Cabrine and Miguel and even Fat Boy would like to lay on one

[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.020]

eight well before we are go on uh New York Daily News today says W's guard files MIA there is a

[01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:16.490]
hole in service exit despite president pushes stated willingness to make his international

[01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:20.910]
guard records public the agency in charge of the paperwork box yesterday saying it doesn't have

[01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:24.990]
his permission in writing and the White House said it doesn't have any records to release

[01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:29.690]
Bush made the statement Sunday on eat the press in an effort to win speculation over democratic

[01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:34.990]
accusations that he was a wall from his international guard unit in 1972 and by the way he lied

[01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:39.030]
he said that he got permission to leave eight months early so it could go to Harvard law school

[01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:43.650]
guess what he didn't go tell a year later those eight months he was busy campaigning for some

[01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:49.610]
Republican in the south didn't go to law school to the year later to Harvard uh anyway when asked

[01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:53.150]
if he would release paystubs tax records anything to show that you were serving during that period

[01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:58.110]
Bush responded yeah if we still have them White House spokesman Scott McCullough and said yesterday

[01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:03.170]
afternoon that there were no paystubs of tax returns to make available I think the president like most

[01:14:03.170 --> 01:14:07.950]
Americans doesn't have his tax returns from 33 years ago McCullough and said in terms of paystubs

[01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:12.550]
during the 2000 campaign we checked with the Texas National Guard and they informed us they didn't

[01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:16.710]
have him McCullough and said he said we made everything we had available during the 2000 campaign

[01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:22.630]
the headquarters of the Air Reserve personnel center in Denver last night was compiling an updated

[01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:27.310]
review of Bush's service but spokeswoman Cindy Dewey cautioned that the record would be incomplete

[01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:32.070]
she said Dewey still beats Truman we don't have anything in writing from Dewey said until we do

[01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:36.030]
releasing the information subject to the Freedom of Information Act meaning that medical and

[01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:41.030]

Democratic National Committee spokesman Tony Welch charge that the gaping hold in the president

[01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:57.810]
services still there he hasn't done anything to clear that up a senior GOP political strategist

[01:14:57.810 --> 01:15:03.050]
agreed that Bush didn't put that one to bed with his performance on eat the press military

[01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:08.130]
law expert Eugene Fidel said the DNC chairman was over the top in charging that Bush was AWOL from

[01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:12.270]
his Alabama Guard unit as member of the National Guard Bush had most could have been subject to a

[01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:16.450]
charge of unsatisfactory performance by the L said of course what he's failing to see is that

[01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:20.130]

[01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:41.910]
for the jason widium's trial jurors will hear two versions of how a limo driver was killed

[01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:47.110]
when opening statements are made in the former NBA stars manslaughter trial in summerville new jersey

[01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:52.050]
prosecutors maintain that while widium's didn't intend to kill costas gusts christophe

[01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:55.530]
he acted with reckless indifference when he took a shotgun from a cabinet in the back

[01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:59.870]
lot of shotguns in a house you know it does it everybody and opened it and closed it in one

[01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:05.270]
motion it fired and hit christophe was about three feet away he opened a cabinet like

[01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:10.590]
but i think Williams has been free on bail of course and his defense team have portrayed the

[01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:14.970]
shooting at the forty-room mansion as accident the defense is indicated a lot of time to show

[01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:20.390]
Williams was in shock right prosecutor said that immediately after the shooting Williams wiped

[01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:25.190]
the gun trying to put the victims hand or fingerprints on it he then removed this clothing jumped

[01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:29.550]
into a pool downstairs put on new clothing he told guest they must agree the shooting was a

[01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:34.150]
suicide and helped police did all been downstairs that sounds like something innocent guy would do

[01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:38.950]
and of course told all the guest they must agree the shooting was a suicide and tell police did

[01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:45.410]
all been downstairs and then it goes on about he faces a seven charges including aggravated

[01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:49.450]
manslaughter witness tampering charges that could carry up to fifty five years in prison

[01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:56.450]
all right by his ass now not for the liberal driver but for the dog god that's the way about

[01:26:56.450 --> 01:27:01.890]
shooting the dog is just it's just all the eating i mean what what kind of a scene person somebody

[01:27:01.890 --> 01:27:06.350]
that's like walking around on the outside what kind of a sane person who doesn't play in the NBA

[01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:14.490]
is allowed to do that anybody we know no no but not if you're a jack not if you're studying jack

equipment or other instruments used in the detection reporting suppression or extinguishment of

[01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:56.750]
the white house facing election year questions about president bush's military services

[01:35:56.750 --> 01:36:00.790]
releasing pay records other information intended to support his assertion intended to support

[01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:04.610]
his assertion that he fulfilled his duties a member of the air national guard during the Vietnam

[01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:08.730]
do we believe it no will approve anything no the material to be released today

[01:36:08.730 --> 01:36:13.550]
was to include pay records in annual retirement point summaries to show that bush served

[01:36:14.130 --> 01:36:19.430]
the turkey to the troops these records clearly document that the president fulfilled his duty

[01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:23.470]
white house shield scot McClellan said the point summaries were released during the 2000

[01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:27.130]
presidential campaign but the pay records were not obtained by the white house to late yesterday

[01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:32.750]
from the air reserve personnel center in dendard he said the center apparently acting on its own

[01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:36.770]
reviewed bush's record and came up with the pay information it was our impression from the

[01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:41.090]
Texas air national guard they stated they didn't have them he said it was also our impression these

[01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:45.850]
records didn't exist bush on sunday authorize the release of his guard records McClellan said the

[01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:50.310]
latest material apparently is all of bush's records the pay information documented the dates when

[01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:54.850]
bush showed up for guard duty this spokesman said you are paid for the dates you serve McClellan added

[01:36:54.850 --> 01:37:01.150]
right bush's military record was raised as an issue in the 2000 campaign what we know all about that

[01:37:01.690 --> 01:37:06.650]
yon yon yon yon yon of central issue is whether bush showed up for duty while assigned to guard

[01:37:06.650 --> 01:37:12.310]
units in alabama where he worked on a political campaign in 72 there may be no evidence but I

[01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:16.290]
did report bush told NBC's eat the press on sunday otherwise I wouldn't have been honorably

[01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:21.570]
discharged unless of course somebody was pulling the strings behind the scenes oops another

[01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:25.350]
question is why he was allowed to end guard duty about six months early to attend Harvard

[01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:29.390]
business school bush at NBC and worked it out with the military and I'm just telling you that I

[01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:33.410]
did my duty the only problem being like I told you before he didn't attend Harvard military school

[01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:39.330]
a business school at that time until a year later right look it up look it in a read shrub by Molly

[01:37:39.330 --> 01:37:43.890]
Ivans McClellan said the White House would release statements previously distributed from Albert

[01:37:43.890 --> 01:37:49.210]
Lloyd Jr who was personal director for the Texas Air National Guard from 69 to 95 and who reviewed

[01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:54.170]
bush's military records at the request of his campaign four years ago void is said that bush's

[01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:58.910]
early discharge was not uncommon for pilots or other crewmen who were to leave soon and had been

[01:37:58.910 --> 01:38:03.950]
trained now obsolete jets as was bush's case right so we'll give you eight months off the

[01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:08.010]
old campaign for some Republican candidate down here in Georgia Alabama where it was and then

[01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:11.850]
you can just goof off all that time and we'll give you credit and we'll fix it all up for you

[01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:17.870]

[01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:35.530]
sitting so beware cross-border church visit cost man ten thousand dollars look at that

[01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:41.050]
Montreal crossing the US Canada border to go to church on sunny cost the US citizen ten thousand

[01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:46.570]
dollars for breaching Washington's tough new security rules the expensive trip to church was

[01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:52.470]
a surprise you know something I think that this inspired me this story I think if it starts costing

[01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:57.270]
everybody ten thousand dollars to go to church each time or synagogue or mosque or wherever they're

[01:41:57.470 --> 01:42:04.070]
I think that solves the problem right there don't you sure people stop going the expensive

[01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:08.270]
trip to church was a surprise for Richard Albert resident of rural Maine who lives so close to

[01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:14.130]
the Canadian border the US customs office is right next door to his house house like the other half

[01:42:14.130 --> 01:42:18.290]
doesn't residence of township fifteen range fifteen crossing the borders the daily ritual for

[01:42:18.290 --> 01:42:24.470]
Albert the nearby Quebec village of St. Pamfield is where they shop eaten prey there are many such

[01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:28.930]
situations in rural areas along the largely unguarded fifty five hundred thirty mile border between

[01:42:28.930 --> 01:42:33.270]
Canada and the USA in which in some cases actually runs down the middle of streets through buildings

[01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:39.670]
I never knew that did you yes the border runs down the middle of streets sometimes

[01:42:40.690 --> 01:42:46.050]
like four forty one like by a mommy's house there it on side on her side it's Hollywood the

[01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:50.770]
other side is a Davie but you know the rooms in some cases as a result Albert says he didn't

[01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:54.170]
expect any problems three weeks ago when he returned home to the US after attending mass in

[01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:59.750]
Canada as usual the local US customs station is closed on Sundays so we just drove around the

[01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:03.770]
lock gate as he done every weekend since the gate appeared last May following a tightening of

[01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:07.910]
border security two days later Albert was summoned to the customs office where an office

[01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:13.890]
had told him he'd been caught on camera crossing the border illegally auto has granted

[01:43:13.890 --> 01:43:17.970]
special passes to some 300 US citizens in that region so they can enter the country when Canadian

[01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:23.290]
customs are post are closed but the US cancel the similar program last May surprise

[01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:30.290]
that forces local residents to make a 200 mile detour along treacherous logging roads to get home

[01:43:30.290 --> 01:43:35.350]
via the nearest staff border checkpoint what a bunch of assholes a spokesman for the US

[01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:39.150]
bureau of customs and border protection would not comment specifically on Albert's case because

[01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:44.550]
of privacy laws since 9-11 we've enhanced our security and some of the situations we

[01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:48.030]
require inconvenience to people we have to go along with what the regulations are said Janet

[01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:53.750]
rap report rap report a public affairs officer with a bureau she ended up local residents have

[01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:57.970]
been told about the stricter controls Albert has appealed to find but has not attended the Sunday

[01:43:57.970 --> 01:44:06.410]
mass since I feel like I'm living in a jail he said sir and you are yeah there you go Albert

[01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:12.870]

[02:25:37.290 --> 02:25:41.490]
smell of popcorn conjures images of your favorite movie scenes you can probably think of Samuel

[02:25:41.490 --> 02:25:47.630]
thanks Samuel Rubin hey thanks Sam mr. Rubin the man who quite possibly made the two inseparable

[02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:52.870]
from indian movie goers died thursday and point and beach he was eighty five the smell was one of

[02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:57.150]
the main reasons the majority of new year of city theaters didn't pop their own corn so mr.

[02:25:57.350 --> 02:26:01.290]
Rubin who got the idea by seeing the snack being sold at a theater in the Midwest started popping

[02:26:01.290 --> 02:26:05.850]
corn a long gaiolin city factory where it was bagged and delivered to metropolitan movie houses

[02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:11.950]
am i losing it or what i thought when you went in the in the old days when you went in the movie

[02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:16.810]
theater they had the big machine they're making the popcorn in they were not talking about the 1890s now

[02:26:16.810 --> 02:26:23.590]
no they don't do that no more of course they do and you smith author of pop culture of social

[02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:29.830]
oh no author of pop culture of social history of popcorn in america

[02:26:30.930 --> 02:26:35.330]
said that new york theaters are among the last to embrace popcorn because it had a small profit margin

[02:26:35.330 --> 02:26:39.870]
popping machines were a fire hazard and the snacks seemed a little bit declassay

[02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:45.430]
like for low low low brown scumbags as a concessionaire where they be

[02:26:45.430 --> 02:26:49.110]
she consolidated now partly odd in group where he worked from the age of twelve mr. Rubin

[02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:52.690]
thought differently he was certainly not the first to sell popcorn in the york city theaters

[02:26:52.690 --> 02:26:57.370]
but he was like to the first to popcorn and machines on a widespread basis in the venue managers

[02:26:57.370 --> 02:27:01.290]
quickly realized that the smell of popping corn went out exactly hurt sales and improvements in

[02:27:01.770 --> 02:27:05.570]
machines had less than the fire danger he was an innovator's whole life i don't understand it

[02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:10.690]
he also sold pretzels at six and flags at nine at twelve he worked filling vending machines in movie

[02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:14.890]
theaters which didn't yet have concession stands when a vending machine ruled and broke against the

[02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:18.890]
stage used it as a counter to sell candy or precursor of the modern movie concession to

[02:27:18.890 --> 02:27:22.050]
otherwise he's the one that made you sick at the movies all the time by all that crap

that he viewed the documents but was not responsible for distributing them he also said no

[02:37:47.130 --> 02:37:50.890]
hacking had been involved in downloading the memos rather he said they were easily accessed

[02:37:50.890 --> 02:37:55.090]
through a glitch in the firewall that separated democratic and republican documents stored electronically

[02:37:55.090 --> 02:37:59.810]

for the photograph they found out

[02:57:44.670 --> 02:57:49.530]
inside the crowd I I slide into the window with no light

[02:57:49.530 --> 02:57:55.050]
but I like that that's why I live in a window with no light

[02:57:55.050 --> 02:57:58.190]
living in the window with no light

[02:57:58.190 --> 02:58:00.690]
living in the window with no light

[02:58:11.770 --> 02:58:13.210]
here's the small

[02:58:16.650 --> 02:58:18.330]
I thought

[02:58:18.330 --> 02:58:19.730]
one addition

[02:58:19.730 --> 02:58:22.430]
to what I could best

[02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:25.210]
I found a new addiction

[02:58:25.870 --> 02:58:27.870]
I like to wear a thread

[02:58:27.870 --> 02:58:33.190]
I look at your side and find them at the private line

[02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:38.070]

[02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:39.590]
I'm like a boy

[02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.790]
I'm like a boy

[02:58:41.810 --> 02:58:43.410]
inside the crowd

[02:58:43.410 --> 02:58:46.310]
I slide into the window

[02:58:46.310 --> 02:58:47.110]
with no light

[02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:49.110]
I like that

[02:58:49.110 --> 02:58:51.590]
I never leave the window

[02:58:52.150 --> 02:58:52.590]
with no light

[02:58:52.590 --> 02:58:54.370]
living in the window

[02:58:54.370 --> 02:58:57.770]
with no light

[02:58:57.770 --> 02:59:02.510]

[02:59:02.510 --> 02:59:04.230]

[02:59:05.150 --> 02:59:06.110]
just in

[02:59:06.110 --> 02:59:08.230]
Sir Goyne'sville, Tennessee

[02:59:08.230 --> 02:59:10.130]
what kind of a name is that

[02:59:10.130 --> 02:59:10.970]
Mugwa

[02:59:10.970 --> 02:59:12.270]
SURG OIS

[02:59:12.270 --> 02:59:13.870]
Sir Goyne'sville, Tennessee

[02:59:13.870 --> 02:59:15.730]
intoxicated drivers take note

[02:59:15.730 --> 02:59:18.070]
don't ask your 10-year-old daughter to drive your home

[02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.370]
ah

[02:59:19.550 --> 02:59:22.010]
Angela Michelle Brown, 37 was charged yesterday

[02:59:22.010 --> 02:59:24.810]
with child endangerment and driving out of the influence of booze

[02:59:24.810 --> 02:59:27.890]
after 30 said she got drunk and used her 10-year-old daughter as

[02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:29.370]
a designated driver

[02:59:30.550 --> 02:59:32.110]
she said I'm a very good driver

[02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:33.730]
and she designated her as such

[02:59:33.730 --> 02:59:37.770]
police arrested Brown last week after stopping a car that appeared to have a young driver

[02:59:38.510 --> 02:59:42.530]
as I approached the car I noticed that an older female was laying down in the driver seat

[02:59:42.530 --> 02:59:44.090]
officer Don Mitchell said in his report

[02:59:44.090 --> 02:59:48.210]
the younger female told me that her mother had got drunk and she was trying to get them home

[02:59:49.630 --> 02:59:53.190]
Mitchell's reports that Brown's breath alcohol test was 0.23

[02:59:53.190 --> 02:59:56.590]
nearly three times higher than the legal definition of drunk and driving

[02:59:56.590 --> 02:59:59.010]
which we already discovered from Diana Ross's 0.08

[02:59:59.670 --> 03:00:00.390]
right right

[03:00:00.850 --> 03:00:05.650]
the 10-year-old grandmother the 10-year-old girl's grandmother was called to come get the girl after police arrested her mother

[03:00:05.650 --> 03:00:07.390]
the judge said it traveled February 18

[03:00:08.710 --> 03:00:11.030]
well now let me ask you this is she do the right thing

[03:00:12.590 --> 03:00:15.010]
no maybe the 10-year-old girl had some driving lessons

[03:00:15.010 --> 03:00:19.190]
you never know and who do you think would have driven her home better the 10-year-old girl

[03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:23.250]
or herself she should have just passed out in the gutter like any other self-respecting drunk

[03:00:23.250 --> 03:00:24.090]
there you go

[03:00:25.170 --> 03:00:30.090]
oh I don't even know if I want to do this story today woman participating in Lily trial hangs herself

[03:00:30.910 --> 03:00:31.870]
19-year-old

[03:00:31.870 --> 03:00:37.610]
a toxicology test will determine whether narcotics played a role in the suicide of a 19-year-old woman

[03:00:37.610 --> 03:00:42.370]
who was participating in clinical trials for a new drug that Eli Lilly and company hopes to launch this year

[03:00:42.370 --> 03:00:45.790]
that's the same Eli Lilly and company that gave you the little mind many years ago

[03:00:45.790 --> 03:00:50.210]
the right and we had all in birth defects and people dying over there

[03:00:50.210 --> 03:00:52.150]
that's the same company Eli Lilly

[03:00:53.310 --> 03:00:56.490]
aka pharmaceutical company aka grey robber

[03:00:56.490 --> 03:00:58.070]
Tracy Johnson

[03:00:58.070 --> 03:01:02.650]
Venselam, Pennsylvania hang yourself Saturday night in the Lily Land for clinical research

[03:01:02.650 --> 03:01:06.890]
by tying a scarf to a bathroom shower rod according to the Indianapolis Police Department

[03:01:06.890 --> 03:01:12.290]
while the toxicology test is standard procedure in the investigation of suicides by the Marion County corner

[03:01:12.290 --> 03:01:18.670]
it could have huge implications for Lilly if it's determined that the trial drug or removal from it played a role in the woman's suicide

[03:01:18.670 --> 03:01:23.750]
Lilly said yesterday it doesn't believe the drug deluxe a teen was related to the method Johnson

[03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:26.310]
who was a former student in the ad a Bible college

[03:01:26.310 --> 03:01:28.350]
oh now the pieces are starting to fit together

[03:01:29.510 --> 03:01:31.830]
toxicology test results expecting about a month

[03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:34.770]
deluxe a teen is key to future business prospects of Lilly

[03:01:34.770 --> 03:01:36.670]
it's the main ingredient in Symbalta

[03:01:37.430 --> 03:01:38.910]
an anti-depressant drug

[03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:42.710]
and in a stress urinary incontinence treatment

[03:01:42.710 --> 03:01:46.150]
both of which are moving forward toward final approval by the FDA

[03:01:46.630 --> 03:01:49.810]
however incidents such as this who was out of a clinical trial participant

[03:01:49.810 --> 03:01:54.970]
often draw questions from the FDA and can relate the federal approval needed to bring a drug to market

[03:01:54.970 --> 03:01:56.770]
oh god a pox on them

[03:01:56.770 --> 03:02:00.250]
I hope that Jason Williams invades their labs

[03:02:00.770 --> 03:02:01.630]
Eddie, Eli Lilly

[03:02:01.630 --> 03:02:04.630]
okay okay they all want to pop it on Lilly pad

[03:02:04.630 --> 03:02:05.510]
they make me sick

[03:02:06.150 --> 03:02:08.570]
the Thalidomide people the pharmaceutical drug people

[03:02:08.570 --> 03:02:10.930]
and now the new deal is what they're saying

[03:02:10.930 --> 03:02:12.210]
oh if you buy drugs from Canada

[03:02:12.210 --> 03:02:14.410]
a lot of that stuff is being imported from India

[03:02:14.410 --> 03:02:17.510]
and the moon and Mars and Uranus and Gato and Rose Werdell

[03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:19.450]
it's been and who's been dealing with it

[03:02:19.450 --> 03:02:23.350]
right stay away from these unsafe Canadian drugs

[03:02:23.350 --> 03:02:24.810]
they might kill you

[03:02:25.990 --> 03:02:29.110]
just a freaking nightmare the older's only one reason

[03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:32.970]
why they're starting a big son and by the way ask Billy Tozen down there and Luziana

[03:02:32.970 --> 03:02:37.630]
the congressman that's on the pharmaceutical company payroll ask him how dangerous those drugs are

[03:02:37.630 --> 03:02:39.730]
he'll do the same fight as dance for you

[03:02:42.450 --> 03:02:44.250]
god oh there's another asshole

[03:02:44.250 --> 03:02:45.330]
was a flight instructor

[03:02:45.330 --> 03:02:49.150]
oh romsfeld

[03:02:50.650 --> 03:02:53.490]
how's that pilot doing that? oh I actually mentioned this to you I must forgot

[03:02:54.050 --> 03:02:57.630]
yes guess what story because I told you it was a big story but nobody in this crowd

[03:02:57.630 --> 03:03:00.230]
talked about it there too busy one about freaking Willie Williams

[03:03:00.770 --> 03:03:04.190]
guess was the most emailed story on CNN's website yesterday

[03:03:05.590 --> 03:03:06.930]
I give up

[03:03:06.930 --> 03:03:08.390]
the airline pilot

[03:03:08.930 --> 03:03:11.490]
oh that one the Christian the born again okay

[03:03:11.490 --> 03:03:12.550]
I'm sorry a preacher the

[03:03:13.770 --> 03:03:15.610]
preaching pilot the old P.P.

[03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:16.650]
the preaching pilot

[03:03:17.790 --> 03:03:18.930]
152 at 560 WQM

[03:03:19.610 --> 03:03:22.670]
I'll tell you what else starts with the P and that's the pizza loft that's correct

[03:03:22.670 --> 03:03:26.610]
Jeff Cohen don't start with no P's but nevertheless in fact I don't think they got P's on the menu

[03:03:26.610 --> 03:03:31.450]
someday it would be nice to have somebody with send me a menu from the loft I've been in these spots for how many years now

[03:03:31.450 --> 03:03:33.210]
about third man you have their menu

[03:03:33.210 --> 03:03:37.090]
not that I really need it but it would be nice to have because they've got every kind of goody under the sun on an area

[03:03:37.090 --> 03:03:40.950]
pasta dish ever invented one of the most important things to keep in mind at the pizza loft is

[03:03:40.950 --> 03:03:44.970]
everything is cooked al dente to order fresh nothing is sitting around for hours

[03:03:44.970 --> 03:03:48.910]
you know you're going to some of those spaghetti joints and the stuff has been sitting around you know in cold water

[03:03:48.910 --> 03:03:55.350]
and the spaghetti gets softer and mushyer and mushyer and softer there's only one thing soft at the pizza loft and Jeff will tell you what that is

[03:03:55.890 --> 03:04:00.270]
anyway they got all your pasta dishes they got chicken and veal seafood three different kinds of fantastic pizza

[03:04:00.270 --> 03:04:06.790]
calzone super subs I guarantee the best garlic rolls you've ever had in your life and one thing also they'll do for you if you don't like all that garlic

[03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:12.950]
I just Tom don't know no garlic driven I would if you do oh I love it man I just love when you squeeze it the garlic drips out

[03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:18.990]
and they roll too they have takeout they have delivery they even offer catering for as little as five bucks per person at the pizza loft

[03:04:18.990 --> 03:04:23.810]
they got lots and lots of room for you so you don't have to wait online even on the weekend at the world famous pizza loft in Davi

[03:04:23.810 --> 03:04:28.430]
you'll find them right beyond here what imports in the pizza loft plaza tons of free parking for you too

[03:04:28.430 --> 03:04:39.210]
right between Gryffin and 595 and prestigious university drive 9 5 4 9 1 6 8 8 8 8 8 that's the number to call for takeout and delivery 9 5 4 9 1 6 8 8 8 8

[03:04:39.210 --> 03:04:46.750]
if you haven't been there yet I guarantee you I promise you'll be going back again and again because the food is fresh delicious the portions are gigantic and the prices are teeny and tiny

[03:04:46.750 --> 03:04:49.490]
at the world famous pizza loft in Davi

[03:04:49.490 --> 03:04:54.070]
