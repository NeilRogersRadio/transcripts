[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]
Good news today boys and girls

[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.340]
Big Marlins game

[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.560]
1255 which we say all right

[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.680]
Bush hates gaze push hate skays see how

[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.500]
Her past a gay amendment ban while off defendants is gonna go to become a married home

[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.260]
Oh, he's discussed it unless you are happy to woke us Bush

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.380]
Barry

[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500]
Oh

[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.060]
Freedom's day, freedom's day, let's bury our heads.

[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.140]
Freedom's day, freedom's day, let's bury our heads.

[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.940]
Nice going, Mitch Lewis.

[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.440]
Our good pies on.

[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.740]
We can always count on Mitch.

[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.180]
Brack them.

[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.200]
10.0.2.5.60 WQM or even on a goes.

[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.360]
Throw one of those in for a bonus.

[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.380]
Bad nose.

[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.060]
You won't hear too many of places because it's an

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.980]
no longer news, no more.

[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.660]
Another dead American soldier in Iraq.

[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.000]
It's worth it.

[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.160]
An American soldier was killed this morning after

[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.840]
roadside bomb exploded while as Connoble was passing by

[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.300]
the West Military said this was in decree.

[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.580]
The soldier was the first member of the first infantry

[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.100]
division which is replacing the fourth.

[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.460]
He was the first of this division to die in Iraq.

[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.700]
And now the total is 553.

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.260]
Most of these that's occurring after the president

[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.080]
foreshad back in the May 1st, our combat's over.

[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.460]
We won.

[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.540]
It's just one of them things.

[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.040]
2016 votes on yesterday's poll.

[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.700]
We better talk real fast today, okay?

[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.680]
What do you think Moe is thinking about?

[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.920]
And Kjoldi and Joe and all this other stuff after that

[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.800]
Barry Jackass column and Harold as once again Greg Reed

[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.560]
continues programming and floating out of Trowell balloons

[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.720]
and Barry Jackass is column and a newspaper.

[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.960]
I know.

[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.760]
It's embarrassing.

[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.720]
It's humiliating and degrading.

[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.420]
Huh?

[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.500]
Oh man.

[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.160]
Seriously, I suppose you got a contract and you're working

[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.080]
every day even though you're rating suck like Moe and

[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.560]
everybody hates you like poison like Moe and all of a sudden

[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.180]
you read in Barry Jackass that we're considering putting

[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.340]
a Howard Stern on the morning.

[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.660]
Why?

[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.160]
Listening.

[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.680]
I would light a fire under my acid and inspire me to do a

[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.340]
much better show.

[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.880]
Well, maybe you're not capable of a much better show.

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.480]
2016 votes on yesterday's poll.

[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.960]
Why isn't the public up and arm and the way you apologize for

[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.500]
Eric Spelling, but he's under a lot of stress.

[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.200]
Stiffle.

[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.320]
Kind of like sniffle.

[00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.800]
Right.

[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.660]
Why isn't the public up and arm is about the government's

[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.540]
efforts to stifle free speech?

[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.460]
Because they're too stupid to understand it.

[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.260]
749 out of 2016 votes.

[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.780]
37.1%.

[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.060]
Because freedom of speech is just a saying in America.

[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.160]
Absolutely.

[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.400]
361.

[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.720]
Because the media is mostly ignoring it.

[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.300]
344.

[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.340]
They got bigger fish to fry like Martha Stewart.

[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.680]
You know, more important things than the first amendment.

[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.540]
Because they're lazy.

[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.640]
258.

[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.580]
Because they don't give a Schmidt 205.

[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.460]
And because they don't have any leadership.

[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.280]
99.

[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.940]
2000 plus votes.

[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.420]
As people are starting to get a little bit pissed off,

[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.280]
a little bit fired up.

[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.660]
Just like that guy to call for more land.

[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.040]
Oh, yesterday.

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.560]
Yeah.

[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.420]
See, I know his intentions were good.

[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.640]
I know he's very frustrated in the city with speechless,

[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.440]
which he just kind of like stopped him in sense.

[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.460]
And I think he expired.

[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.520]
But, you know, oh, we had a couple of hundred people demonstrating

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.380]
in front of the clear channel of the station front of Orlando.

[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.780]
Well, that's, that's, you know, very exciting.

[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.120]
And then what?

[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.400]
There they went.

[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.240]
Right.

[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.580]
And got lead.

[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.640]
So what we want to tell you again,

[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.460]
we got the eight South Florida clear channel stations on there.

[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.960]
If you want to just avoid them like the plague as a protest,

[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.420]
that would, that's one positive thing you can do.

[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.380]
Because in terms of finding somebody that's going to really go to bad for you,

[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.540]
forget about it.

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.460]
Just think what happened.

[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.920]
Especially in the election year.

[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.460]
There's nobody out there who wants to come to go to bad for potty mouth,

[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.340]
shock, jocks and freedom of speech, things like that.

[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.620]
Right.

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.560]
Shock, dog.

[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.380]
Well, speaking of the Aded American soldier, end of hot meals for US troops in Iraq,

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.500]
question mark, says NBC News.

[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.400]
Halibutans got a multi-billion dollar contract to feed in house US troops in Iraq.

[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.460]
But there are problems, multi-problemy.

[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.200]
A food subcontractor that runs 10% of the dining facilities in Iraq claims

[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.700]
it hasn't been paid by Halibutan for months and is threatening to stop serving hot meals.

[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.620]
The company event source serves 100,000 meals a day in Iraq under a contract

[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.000]
with a Halibutan subsidiary.

[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.400]
Event source claims Halibut knows that $87 million, including even payment for

[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.180]
President Bush's Thanksgiving dinner with the troops with that

[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.000]
plastic turkey his.

[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.020]
When you get stuck out there for $87 million,

[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.760]
explain to the event source chief executive officer Phil Morales,

[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.700]
it's a question of economics.

[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.000]
In an interview with NBC News, he says it's already laid off employees in the US

[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.860]
and soon we'll have to feed sandwiches to the troops instead of hot meals

[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.380]
because his company is running low on money.

[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.460]
They're running mighty low.

[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.780]
And your president's telling you, oh, we're going to take care of our troops

[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.660]
and we're going to really appreciate our ride.

[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.220]
Tragic, just pathetic.

[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.000]
Don't forget that big primary election today in Florida.

[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.120]
Don't get that all straightened out.

[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.900]
No problem at all.

[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.180]
Sure.

[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.780]
Right?

[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.500]
Because there's nobody running.

[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.520]
How do you turn me son?

[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.440]
Now here's the big story.

[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.720]
Here's the QAM programming story of the day by Barry Jackass and your Miami

[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.100]
Herald.

[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.800]
Here's line nine, though, for QAM.

[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.100]
Is this Neil?

[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.860]
Hi.

[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.840]
This is Joe.

[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.780]
Hi, Joe.

[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.220]
You forgot on your, hello?

[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.320]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.920]
Are you forgot on your list yesterday?

[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:11.860]
I think that you ought to put the category for an enemy combatant

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.740]
that people are afraid to speak out.

[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.800]
Yeah, somebody suggested that, but it's a little bit late now that the poll is over.

[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.060]
But that's possible.

[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.940]
Credit their own phone is being tapped.

[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.980]
That three o'clock at the morning.

[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.080]
They're going to get a knock on the door.

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.040]
Maybe a spooch, if I didn't have to drag out.

[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.360]
That would be okay.

[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.280]
I'll see it to the border, man.

[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.660]
We'll have a patruder to pick up.

[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.580]
Meeting could decide QAM fate of Goldberg.

[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.180]
Hey, stop.

[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.540]
And we're not talking about whoopi either.

[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.080]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.620]
That better be a real good productive meeting at 11 o'clock this morning.

[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.120]
Greg, whatever your name is, you idiot.

[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.980]
We're not going to lose the hump away.

[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.840]
And this station is, it's like sitting inside of a building that's infested with termites.

[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.280]
Which I think that's a good analogy for our building.

[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.660]
We have to answer that.

[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.500]
And you don't know.

[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.640]
You got to answer your pants, but there may be termites in the walls in that place.

[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.340]
No exterminator.

[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.340]
I think what we need in that place is an exterminator to pardon that expression.

[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.080]
And it's like sitting inside of an infested building and just watching it crumble around you.

[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.660]
With what Greg Reed is doing to QAM.

[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.260]
It's just, it's a, it's a grass being defeat from the jaws of victory.

[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.840]
He'd better do it than anybody I've ever worked for in my life.

[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.420]
He just, non-composed penis, that's Greg Reed.

[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.400]
It's just, there's nothing there.

[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.940]
Hank Goldberg's status at WQM could be determined during a meeting this morning

[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.600]
with General Manager Greg Reed writes Barry Jackass, the mole.

[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.760]
What a joke!

[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.300]
Goldberg has been kept off the air since March the 2th, following an author incident involving the anxious Luann Winnick,

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.320]
the station's General Sales Manageress.

[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.040]
What an embarrassment!

[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.820]
And a miserable bitch at that.

[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.880]
If the meeting goes well, Goldberg could be back on the air four o'clock today,

[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.680]
but Reed said yesterday, told Barry Jackass, he hasn't decided whether to retain Goldberg.

[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.320]
I don't know what'll happen, Reed said, it depends on how the meeting goes.

[00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.620]
At 11 o'clock.

[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.400]
Said Hank, I'll hear what he asked to say.

[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.680]
I parked the Luann, we're okay.

[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:05.900]
Okay.

[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.980]
It was a misunderstanding.

[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:07.900]
I'm contrite.

[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.060]
I just want to go on.

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.620]
On another matter, and this I find most hysterically amusing,

[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.600]
Reed said he was exploring the possibility of adding Howard Stern's morning show of Clear Channel's Big 106

[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.100]
does not resume carrying it.

[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.840]
Is Big 106 going to resume carrying it?

[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.080]
No.

[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.740]
No, there are two chances none and much, much, much less than none.

[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.760]
And could have happened.

[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.680]
Is QM going to be adding Howard Stern to our morning lineup?

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.140]
No.

[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.240]
I'd say we have two chances also none and much less than none.

[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.060]
Although you see it's a little bit better than Mother Clear Channel,

[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.500]
there's several less marches in here.

[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.860]
Hank, what happened?

[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.940]
Now keep in mind that he's got people under contract like Mo and Gildi.

[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.220]
Joe Rose is not only not under contract, but not even gotten paid yet in 10 weeks of filling in.

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.980]
He's got those people who think that they have a job right now.

[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.340]
Of course, he's going in Barry Jackass in the Miami Herald again,

[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.380]
programming, floating out his travel wounds, getting everybody peeing in their pants,

[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.160]
and stirring up the same old crap that he always does.

[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.680]
That's Greg.

[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.280]
That is Greg.

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.760]
So we'll keep our, because we're only going to be under 1255,

[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.720]
because we got the Marlins in the Ametz at Port St. Lucie.

[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.240]
1255 this afternoon.

[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.260]
Oh man.

[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.840]
Oh really?

[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.480]
We love the Marlins.

[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.740]
We love the Marlins.

[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.100]
We like those games.

[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:21.700]
Right?

[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:22.640]
Oh yeah.

[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.920]
Oh man, we have become humongous.

[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.280]
The world champion, Marlins.

[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.500]
Even that Norma can't.

[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.720]
And don't call it here anymore, Norma.

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.480]
You're getting on my nerves.

[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.140]
If I need anything from you, I'll let you know.

[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.900]
And it's unlikely you could get it accomplished anyway.

[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.520]
Just go away.

[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520]
Just enjoy your baseball.

[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.460]
Go back into your infant title mentality.

[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.420]
Just get out of my face.

[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.220]
Man.

[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.960]
I was even happier to hear from Marlins last night than from Norma Kent.

[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.640]
That's because Marlins got in late.

[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.760]
Ha ha ha.

[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.640]
Eight o'clock.

[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.960]
Oh, sorry Jeff.

[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.960]
I ate dinner hours ago.

[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.120]
Oh, okay.

[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.680]
And anyway.

[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.580]
Well, guess what?

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.400]
Something that you're very interested in.

[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.880]
I'm sure.

[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.200]
Thank goodness I just came to mind.

[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.240]
Well, come on.

[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.820]
The NHL trade deadline is three plus a Saturday night.

[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.280]
I'm sure.

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.280]

I'm sure.

[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.760]
He looks a little bit like an older TC on a passion.

[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.200]
By the way, TC quit beating up on Julian, you idiot.

[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.640]
Paul Winfield, an Academy Award-dominated actor, was known for his versatility in stage

[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.340]
film and TV roles, including a hobby praised.

[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.020]
1978 depiction of urban doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. his daddy was 62.

[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:19.480]

[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.460]
Died of a heart attack Sunday.

[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.220]
In 1968, Winfield played the boyfriend of Diane Carroll and her situation comedy, Julia,

[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.320]
a role that some suggest helped open TV to other black performers.

[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:35.000]
Four years later, his portrayal of the father and founder of the Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.660]
He's dead.

[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.020]
Paul Winfield.

[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.600]
He died.

[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.720]
No relation to a Dave Winfield, I don't think.

[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.620]
He's dead.

[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.340]
He died.

[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.520]
The drop in like flies.

[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.940]
So, like I said, we don't have a 2 hour and 55 minutes show.

[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.700]
Here's the pool.

[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.680]
Oh, and also today's beaded curtain, a feature.

[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.360]
Carrie Otis.

[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.560]
She's full sister to Ilyatis.

[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.200]
Carrie Otis, which you got the whole inside poop on her.

[00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.900]
I do.

[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.880]
I got the little blurb on.

[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.660]
Well, I think we ought to do this every day once with her.

[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.120]
Somebody on there, give a little background.

[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.560]
I mean, not everybody even knows who Carrie Otis is.

[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:06.980]
Right.

[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:07.180]

[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.180]
Right about her bulimia and Mickey Rourke.

[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:09.600]
Right.

[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.780]
And Mickey Rourke, both of which have something in common is puking, do you see?

[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.580]
Provinists after 10 at 5.60 WKR.

[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.140]
I guess we're not going to be playing those Mickey Rourke drop-ins anymore.

[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:19.900]
What?

[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:20.900]
Under, huh?

[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.340]
I guess not.

[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.180]
I've got a lot of friends there on the police force here.

[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:25.560]
Right.

[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.760]
Okay, that's as much of that as we're going to play Mickey.

[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.680]
Like I said, we're not even going to come close.

[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.400]
We're not going to put our toe into water.

[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.680]
Others might, and believe you me, that water's going to be really boiling hot.

[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.020]
10-13, a Q-amidst, the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.060]
The only one mortgage from financial group.

[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.540]
The benefits are incredible.

[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.320]
You pay zero closing costs, zero application fee, zero credit, zero fee, and zero discounted points.

[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:51.820]
Count them.

[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.900]
Get the low rate interested is 1.25%.

[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.040]
If you have $100,000 loan, your payments are a mere $334 bucks a month.

[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.800]
If you have you a $200,000 loan, you pay only $668 a month to not forget.

[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.580]
Once you refinance, you get a new home mortgage from financial group.

[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.700]
You'll never ever pay closing costs again.

So call out that new toll free number, 1-866-395-Lend.

[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.660]
My local business is five cities.

[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.380]
The radio's on your side.

[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.200]
You win!

[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.860]
What's this obsession with hope?

[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.220]
Announcing the show you've been waiting for, America, it's Tanya Heidings Ice Cafe.

[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.000]
Here's a limpy gold medalist, Catarina Vitt.

[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.840]
Yes, skating to the classics.

[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.000]
Oh, nice split jump there.

[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.900]
Here comes her take off, into a double left.

[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.140]
Oh, she's down!

[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.600]
She's an agony!

[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.080]
Now it's Brian Botano attempting a triple salco?

[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.980]
Oh, he really got a perfectly executed triple chin assault by Tanya Harding.

[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:28.320]
See the precision team of Tanya Harding, Jeff Gullule and her fat guy bodyguard, wipe out skater after skater.

[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.500]
Oh, now Kristi Abeducci is down on the ice.

[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.640]
It's Bung Bung Bung whole family, especially if you're the polyonor gotty family.

[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.180]
Order your tickets for Tanya Harding's Ice Cafe.

[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:47.200]
1018 at 560 WDQ, and the reason I played that is because this great former US figure skating champion

[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.840]
in aspiring boxer Tanya Harding is going to try her hand next at Minor League hockey.

[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.260]
The Indianapolis Ice of the Central Hockey League announced yesterday at Sight Harding,

[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.180]
33 to join the team for its game, Friday against the Colorado Eagles.

[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.960]
It's been 10 years since Harding's ex-husband hired a hitman with tech rival Nancy Kerrigan

[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.580]
at the 94 National Championships. That was a lot of fun.

[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.120]
What? I thought it was fun. Harding has always denied dollars to the tech,

[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.440]
but if pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution,

[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.580]
was stripped of her 94 National title and banned from amateur figure skating competition.

[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.640]
You know, everybody's made mistakes you said last month on the CBS early show.

[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.040]
Everybody's had tragic things happen in their lives,

[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.240]
but what good is it to just sit there and let yourself die?

[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.940]
Is what Tanya said.

[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.200]
Although she's been pursuing career in boxing,

[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.880]
Harding has also seen reinstatement from the US Figure Skating Commission.

[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.900]
I'm one of the best skaters in the world. I'm not going to quit.

[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.820]
I love boxing. I'm not going to quit boxing, she said.

[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.360]
Harding has scheduled a fight in Oakland, California.

[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.260]
If they hooked on the arena at March 20th, can you say Skumbag?

[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.020]
Skumbag?

[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:48.820]
The life?

[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:49.540]
No, I like it.

[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.460]
Piece of crap.

[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.140]
But she has a lot of fun, I agree with that.

[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.820]
Now here's KP Facts is me this, and he says,

[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.820]
why isn't the public up in arms about the government's efforts to stifle free speech,

[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.600]
or is that stifle?

[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.500]
You should have included the choice because we're going to let the bastards have it in November.

[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.060]
Well, I wonder which bastards is he talking about?

[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.500]
It says it would have made, by the way, bad grammar here in this,

[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.460]
it would have made a huge difference in the outcome of your poll,

[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.660]
keep preaching the good word.

[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.100]
Well, the good word, the bad word is that even if Carrie does beat Bush,

[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.260]
which by the way, we had the new poll, he's ahead pretty good.

[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.940]
But even if he does win, Carrie's not supporting freedom of speech.

[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.220]
This isn't a Democrat and Republican issue.

[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.760]
This is a government issue.

[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.420]
This is a censorship issue.

[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.400]
This is a lack of balls issue.

[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.900]
Nobody from either party except Russ Feingold over Wisconsin.

[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.300]
Nobody else has got the balls to stand up and say, wait a minute,

[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.260]
just how can you sit around a table and arbitrarily make up all of these idiotic rules,

[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.360]
which nobody understands in a first place, and then say,

[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.860]
we're going to slap your ass with a big gigantic fine every time you say something we don't like.

[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.620]
And we can't tell you what that is, but we'll just like pornography,

[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.800]
we'll know when we hear it.

[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.320]
Don't you know pornography when you hear it?

[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.940]
Oh, sure, I'm hearing something now.

[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.860]
Who should John Kerry pick for his running mate?

[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.720]
That's our, and of course it is primary day in Florida.

[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.420]
That doesn't mean anything at all because everybody else dropped out.

[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.160]
Who should he pick for his running mate?

[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.400]
Is our poll question today on your Rogers.com when you're through looking at Carrie Otis

[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.680]
or before you look at Carrie Otis or Iliotis or Otis.

[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.780]
John Edwards 34.

[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.600]
See, that's leading, and I knew he would, but that's not the good choice.

[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.320]
See, I want you to put on your thinking cap, which I realized is quite an amusing expression,

[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.640]
but think about it for a minute.

[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.500]
See, if you're going to pick a running mate, it's got to be somebody that's going to help you win somewhere.

[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.260]
Oh, I know.

[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:32.680]
On a concept.

[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:33.260]
Right.

[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.160]
Not just because somebody is likeable or because somebody came in second during the primaries

[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.600]
or because somebody looks younger than he really is and has like a nice smile or stuff like that.

[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.500]
Somebody who actually like maybe when they're home state.

[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.860]
Now, if he's on the ticket, you think you think that John Edwards with Carrie,

[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.940]
you know, as the presidential candidate, they carry Edwards ticket.

[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.900]
Is going to win North Carolina?

[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:54.360]
No.

[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.380]
No, there's no chance.

[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.420]
There are two chances.

[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.800]
In fact, there's a better chance than Howard Stern will be on from 6 a.m. till midnight on QM Starting tomorrow.

[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:07.060]
There's a better chance of that happening than the Bush, that the Carrie Edwards ticket winning North Carolina.

[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.220]
Now, where else can he win?

[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.520]
Where what other state will he help Carrie?

[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.140]
I don't know, Nebraska.

[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.180]
Carrie Otis?

[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.140]
John Edwards 39.

[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.460]
Bob Graham 24 Bill Clinton 13.

[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.680]
Now, I don't know if you put that story on a website or a fight it when I was on vacation.

[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.320]
I did, right?

[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.000]
Did you?

[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.320]
Yes.

[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.040]
I read that with much fascination.

[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.960]
I read it in its entirety.

[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:37.520]
And of course, the reason it was fascinating is because there's nothing in a constitution that prohibits a president from being elected vice president.

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.460]
I even looked it up.

[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.780]
You can only get two terms as president, but you can also then get the two terms as vice president.

[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.320]
That's right.

[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.620]
It just says that they can't be elected.

[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.600]
Right.

[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.780]
John Edwards 39.

[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.460]
Graham 24 Bill Clinton 13.

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.340]
That's what I voted for.

[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.720]
I think I carry Clinton ticket, man.

[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.180]
I like it.

[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.120]
We could get Monica back there, give her something to do.

[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.060]
I don't care.

[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.920]
I'm for Bush 10 people 8.9% so far.

[00:18:59.140 --> 00:18:59.440]
I don't care.

[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.100]
Period 10 more 8.9%.

[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.560]
They just refuse to care.

[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.380]
They're just professionally oblivious.

[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.680]
They're in their own little cocoon.

[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.120]
Nothing is going to shake them up.

[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.360]
Hillary Clinton 9.

[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.180]
So look at that.

[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.760]
Bob has got 13. Hillary's got 9.

[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.140]
She does nothing for me.

[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.080]
Well, she does something to me, but I can't say it on her name.

[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.460]
Bill Richardson 3.

[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.900]
That's the Julio factor that they are thinking about injecting in there.

[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:22.540]
He's a good guy.

[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.560]
I don't know who he is.

[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.560]
He's the governor of New Mexico, former Rob Ambassador to...

[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:27.880]
Oh, that guy.

[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.160]
Yeah.

[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.400]
He's got a good mouth on him too.

[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.200]
He's a new Mexico guy.

[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.700]
He's one of your people.

[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.460]
Well, not exactly.

[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.080]
Well, beater.

[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:33.460]
He's kin.

[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.140]
No.

[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.900]
Dick M. Hart, too.

[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.040]
I don't understand why Dick M. Hart's only got two, even though he's boring, but he is from Missouri.

[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.420]
And Missouri is a very crucial state that Bush won in 2000.

[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:48.540]
And I guarantee him, Tia, that if it's a Kerry Getthart ticket that he wins for him in Missouri, and maybe even Ohio, because of his union strength.

[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:49.540]
See what I'm saying?

[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.060]
Mm-hmm.

[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.060]
But don't confuse the people with the facts because they're just emotional, and that's the way elections go.

[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.960]
Bill Nelson, too, are fine.

[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.140]
Other Florida Senator, a lot of people are talking about him, although behind closed doors.

[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.000]
Now I'm saying, in other words, you won't turn on the news and hear them talk about...

[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.440]
Well, for example, Bobby Graham was on this morning, VDI Bobby.

[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.840]
Bill Nelson, too, and Tom Brokaw won.

[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.860]
We have a story on our website today about the urgent Tom Brokaw to run.

[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.780]
And remember when somebody called me up last year and said, oh, Tom Brokaw is a Republican, Neil, you're wrong.

[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.440]
Bullcrap.

[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.100]
He's a Kennedy Democrat, always has been, and I don't know where they come up with his garbage.

[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.820]
Tom Brokaw's got one out of 141 votes so far.

[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.240]
What?

[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.200]
A vote's heard pouring in.

[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.640]
Speaking of votes, Kerry leads Bush and the new nation-wide poll.

[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.260]
Presumptive Democratic nominee.

[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.260]
Why do they say that?

[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.140]
Presumptive Democratic.

[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.440]
Who's there going to win a Cousinage?

[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.540]
Al Sharpton?

[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.340]
Come on, you idiots.

[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.360]
CNN, man, certainly not news.

[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.360]
It is Scrake.

[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.620]
Oh, good piece of news.

[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.340]
They were showing some political rally on the CNN.

[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.420]
When I was in Europe, I was watching CNN International.

[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.880]
I ended the background of the CNN reporter.

[00:20:53.360 --> 00:21:00.940]
They had a bunch of people with big, gigantic signs that said CNN, with a band symbol through a CNN sucks or whatever.

[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:01.800]
It was great.

[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.740]
And then finally, they caught on to those signs where they were,

[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.940]
and we just lost a picture.

[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.560]
John Kerry leads Bush and latest CNN USA Gallup poll.

[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.920]
USA Today, Gallup poll.

[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:18.860]
The poll released yesterday found that among likely voters, Kerry gets 52% Bush 44%.

[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:25.760]
In a three-way race with NATO throwing his Chigger in a Woodpile, Kerry had 50% Bush 44 and NATO 2%.

[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.540]
So you see the 2% he takes are from Kerry, in spite of all his denials.

[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.360]
The miserable bastard, self-grandizing eagethist.

[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.600]
Anybody who votes for Ralph Nader this fall, by the way, will be taken away and you won't see them no more.

[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.720]
I just, you know, it's not a threat. It's just a promise.

[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.660]
Anybody votes for Ralph Nader will not be seen no more.

[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.020]
Among registered voters, Kerry's lead over Bush narrowed from 8.5 to 2.5 in a two-way race and from 6.2 to 2.8.

[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.980]
So again, NATO is already sticking his finger in it and burning it and twisting it around.

[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.060]
Well, we got a lot of stuff here today, you know?

[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:58.520]
Good.

[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.080]
And we're only until 12.55, because it's a Marlins game.

[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.900]
WQM, your Marlins station. Hello.

[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:06.900]
Hello.

[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:07.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.000]
God.

[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.720]
How are you guys?

[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:10.460]
Pretty good.

[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.200]
Okay.

[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.580]
Sonny Shainan.

[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.260]
I was yesterday just diagnosed with IBS.

[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.240]
I'm watching a way you could tell me to help me out.

[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.780]
You're a mobile, huh?

[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.260]
Yep.

[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.280]
A moment 23 and I got it.

[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:23.800]
Wow.

[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.960]
Let me give you one word, Zantak.

[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.040]
Zantak.

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:30.380]
All right.

[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:30.560]
Yeah.

[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.040]
It works miracles for me.

[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:32.580]
Okay.

[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.520]
Thanks a lot, man.

[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.440]
Okay, good luck, Colin.

[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.240]
Now, just the irritable bowel.

[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.640]
It's one of those things that a lot of people have.

[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.200]
They don't even know it and then they think they got stomach cancer or some grotesque thing.

[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.960]
And it just, it never goes away.

[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.940]
I don't believe it's one of those bitches.

[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.500]
It's another one of those great things that God invented for us.

[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.480]
Okay, the test does.

[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.300]
He's always testing us, the Lord, right?

[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:51.700]
Yeah.

[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.380]
Ayrtonable bowel, IBS.

[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.480]
And of course, maybe he might have girded it.

[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.280]
Which until somebody called him, somebody told me what it was.

[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.240]
I didn't even know I had it.

[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.680]
I never heard of it.

[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.640]
You thought you were a girded.

[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.880]
You heard the word girded?

[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.100]
No.

[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.300]
I heard the birds, the word, but not the girded, the word.

[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.600]
So anyway, carry oduses are sunshine, girl.

[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.140]
They do that in the Toronto sun.

[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.040]
They have a sunshine, who I have a sunshine, girl, everyday.

[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.280]
I guess a lot of papers do that.

[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.940]
Can we call it the sunshine, girl?

[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.380]
Behind the B.D. curtain.

[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:17.820]
Of course.

[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.040]
It has to be behind the B.D. curtain.

[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:19.400]
Sure.

[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.220]
What is a picture of John Ascroft on there,

[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.840]
who in less than an hour will be operated on for a gallbladder?

[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.060]
We could call it a rose gallbladder.

[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.800]
And we certainly hope that the Attorney General Ascroft surgery

[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.760]
goes very, very well.

[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.120]
Right?

[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.400]
We...

[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.500]
Because I had my gallbladder out, and man, I tell you,

[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.820]
it's not always a piece of cake like that rich told me.

[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.820]
Sometimes it's a piece of more like lemon meringue pie.

[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.260]
Cake.

[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.760]
And I think maybe John Ascroft might have a little bit of a problem.

[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.920]
I mean, we're not hoping for that.

[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.360]
Are we?

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.980]
Something should happen to him.

[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.620]
Because we need somebody to cover up all those nudie pictures.

[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.160]
Cario, this was born on the 20th of September, 1968 in San Francisco, California.

[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.780]
She's an all-American girl with brown hair and greenish blue eyes.

[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.100]
She began modeling at the tender age of 14 after briefs in his actress.

[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.700]
When she was 15, she moved to New York City to model and started traveling worldwide.

[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.100]
Her first big break came when she landed on the cover of some stupid French magazine,

[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.560]
giving her international exposure.

[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.200]
Calvin Klein and guests were soon to follow.

[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.820]
In 1990, she appeared in Wild Orchid.

[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.960]
She started out with her soon-to-be husband Mickey Rourke.

[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.080]
In 1999, she was once again read Hot for Her Career.

[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.780]
She starred in Simon Says, new woman San Francisco and Gearest,

[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.340]
the magazines that featured her on the cover.

[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.440]
She was divorced from Mickey work in 1994.

[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.620]
Her photos for the sports-elastated swimsuit Malin in a conditioner,

[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.920]
sizzling is what it says.

[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.920]
So there she is on our sunshine girl thing and behind the beaded development ring.

[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.900]

We're sports radio 560.

[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.060]
QAM.

[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.800]
Brunch packing.

[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.260]
Absolutely.

[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:46.640]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:46.640]

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:46.640]

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:46.640]

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:46.640]

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:46.640]

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:46.760]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:46.880]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.160]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:47.160]

[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:47.920]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.240]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:26:48.240 --> 00:27:07.940]
You can see a lot of wheels on the box.

[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:07.940]

[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.280]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful though.

[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:18.220]
I'm going to make a hole in the box when I hit the pickover vous.

[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:24.120]
4560 WQM that email you sent me didn't come through about the advancing Bush or whatever

[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.780]
thing. Oh well. I said it's from a URL that's blocked because it's unsafe. It's unclean.

[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.380]
It's dangerous like the uncircumcised masses.

[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:38.380]
Oh, speaking of Pablo, this is a great email that you send me though that you fact. From

[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:44.660]
Pablo who says, Neil, you're profound to say for the Christians, is that it? Huh? Yeah,

[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.620]
that's great. Is at its core idiotic? Your daily pontification of this subject is both offensive

[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.820]
to Christians and also educated non-Christians. Sure, there is absolutely nothing anti-Semitic

[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.340]
about Mel Gibson's movie, the passion. Did I ever say there was an anti-Semitic movie?

[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.340]
No, you quoted me. I read about 4000 columns that they all did save. So they must all

[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.880]
be obnoxious and full of crap too. Sure. Sure. There's nothing anti-Semitic. Those

[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.340]
Jews who find that not to be the case should re-evaluate their own faith or lack their

[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.080]
realm. And I would like to point out that most of the articles like the one from the Toronto

[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.280]
Star are read yesterday, wasn't written by somebody Jewish, but nevertheless. Your constant

[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.620]
bashing of this movie exposes your inability to be objective in most subjects. You consider

[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.560]
yourself to have integrity out for you at this point. A true media person objectively watches

[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.000]
the film, prior to forming an opinion, I wouldn't waste my time watching it, Pablo. And

[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]
by the way, get a real name, schmuck. The left-wing media, which you are obviously a part

[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.220]
of, truly has eliminated your ability to provide objective points, I'm not here to provide

[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.980]
objective points, I'm here to give my opinion, okay? The postmaster is supposed to give

[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.300]
his opinion. It says, funny thing, I'll even Steven Spielberg, director of something,

[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:51.720]
a pro-Jewish movie, which was excellent. And did you wipe that out or he'd do it? I didn't

[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.640]
wipe everything out. It's a lot of work. When asked his opinion of the passion, refuse

[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.180]
comment and judgement, tell if you would the film. Well, there you go. In fact, the reviews

[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.580]
that I've read, every one of those people, did you the film? How do you like that, Pablo?

[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.500]
New, you are disgraced to the radio station, they disgraced your profession, and most

[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.220]
of all, they disgraced a man. Thank you, Pablo. Amigo, get up yours. I might ask the

[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.100]
mayor to take care of me. They're disgraced to women, to rights. Well, needless to say,

[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.360]
it's disgraced to a factory. Well, I'm sure Pablo knows something about that because

[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.260]
after all, he's one of yours. No, he's not. Well, who should John Kerry pick for his

[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.760]
running, made his our poll question today? We got 231 votes. John Edwards is a women

[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.400]
thus so far. Well, there's the cheesehead, Tommy Thompson. Well, came to get their health

[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.180]
care and needs taken care of. John Edwards, 79, Bob Graham, 45, Bill Clinton, 38,

[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:40.960]
Bill Clinton, I don't care. I'm for Bush, 19, 8.2%. Those Pablo are the dangerous people,

[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:46.140]
the demented people, the subhuman people, and one thing about me, I'm consistent. I'll

[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.340]
think I'm not just Christianity, but duty is in the human Islam and all of these things,

[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.200]
all of these fairy tales. They're all equally anxious. All of the problems in the world today,

[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.540]
everywhere you look, even this thing in Iraq now, it's the Shiites and the Sunnis man,

[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:04.660]
what are we talking about? Good old time, religion. That's the problem. I never realized

[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.260]
until this last trip of mine, I don't know why, because I'm just not a history buff like you are.

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.740]
I never realized the agonizing history of the Protestants against the Catholics in England.

[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.400]
I don't know, I only know about, huh? Every time there was a new king, all these people

[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.980]
would get their heads chopped off. Right. Because they were on the wrong side. The Catholic king,

[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.880]
and then they had to like squeeze his ass out of there, and that's why we had the Church of

[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.900]
England out to make sure that everybody's going to be the in Protestant, and we keep them

[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.260]
damned Catholics out of England. Oh, we've got to be able to divorce now. Set them up to

[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:34.880]
Scotland, they, and the bus, I actually took the bus from a hotel to the airport, leaving the

[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:41.060]
Amsterdam. What a slaughter. I don't know why. And it was, there was a bunch of Scottsman

[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.240]
got on at one hotel where they made the stop. They were on 13 of these guys. They all looked like

[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.320]
they came out of a cookie cutter like the same, all those big like rugby players, you know?

[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:54.040]
Right. Rugby. Were they what? Were there were some people were in Kielsen front of the hotel

[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.480]
over the weekend, but that's not what they kept. No, these guys weren't killed, they should have

[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.280]
been killed. And they weren't speaking English most of the time they were speaking as if

[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:09.400]
Celtic they speak, what language are these? It's gay. Like, oh, they speak gay lick.

[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:14.880]
Oh, you can't, don't you? You can't say gay lick no more. Don't be say that. You can say

[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.660]
gay or even say, like, don't say it together. Don't say gay lick. Anyway, get back to the pool,

[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:27.060]
please. I don't care for Bush 21. That's 8.4% pretty weak. I don't care period 19. Hillary

[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:34.340]
Clinton 12. Did I say bubble 40? Wow. Dick Kim art 11. Bill Richardson 4. Tom Broca 3. And

[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:38.900]
Bill Nelson only 2 out of 248 votes. Bill Nelson is like, I mean, he's a good guy, but he's like

[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.960]
low key. You know what I mean? What do you mean? Well, once the last time you heard anything about

[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:50.740]
Bill Nelson, our other senator from Florida. Right. Exactly. So thanks very much, Pablo. I'm glad you

[00:31:50.740 --> 00:32:02.720]
are enjoying the show. Okay. WQA. Hello. Q.A.M. Not there. WQA. Hello. All right. Oh, no. Not today.

[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:09.560]
We got a ball game today. Okay. We don't have time to talk to be thirdos today. Okay. 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:16.880]
Pound 5 60 on the D and Verizon wireless line. And there's not one line ringing right now. Look

[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.580]
at that. One of the disgrace. See, I told you, never mention of his ball game coming up. Don't

[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:26.320]
ever do that. Never learn. Because they start turning into the radio off hours ahead of time,

[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:32.620]
just to make sure that they're safe from the marlins from that Greg Reed disease. WQA. Hello.

[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:46.860]
I beg your pardon. After that guy kind of sounded retarded. Yeah, a little bit. All right. I

[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.360]
said that because I'm in a good mood for it because we got a nice early exit today. 12.5. So

[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.000]
get in your best shots. Why you can't try and get that? WQA. I'm like, oh, line. Not there. Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.800]
Hey, Neil, how are you? Do you got to excuse me? Have a little cold. Okay. You know, there's American

[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.240]
public. I don't know what the hell's going on, but they're like standing still. If anything should

[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.940]
get them up and on. This is about the job situation. You know, that's what affects us the most.

[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:15.520]
And it's gone down. Yeah. Yeah. And on. It's just incredible. But aren't you impressed with the

[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.320]
fact that the president keeps making up these great numbers that are going to have all these

[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.220]
additional jobs and then it turns out to never happen. But he sure talks a good game. Yeah,

[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.880]
but nearly it's easy to put numbers together. But when you actually see what's going on in the

[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.500]
public, that's from the house. Well, take a look at our website. You'll see Paul Krugman's column

[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.640]
from the New York Times today. He's got the chart right there in the lead story on our website.

[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.740]
And it shows you all the promises, the projections, and then the real number of jobs that they create.

[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.900]
Let me say it again. They're going to create two big new important jobs this November,

[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.500]
the motion administration, president and vice president. Those are going to be the two new jobs,

[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:53.320]
two new people holding jobs. Other than that, bye bye. There's a carrywood say don't let the

[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.140]
do it in the ass. Now can you say that anymore in the right way out? That's what he says.

[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.840]
Because you can't say ass no more. Hey, listen, if you got a fat ass, then you're trying to lose some

[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.480]
of that weight. I guess most people who are fat have a fat ass don't they? Typically. It's very

[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.060]
typical. Take a look at fat boy. If you got a strong appetite and you're trying to lose weight on one

drink nothing

[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:14.480]
instead

[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.740]
testimony is manslaughter trial which was postponed yesterday to the death of

[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.840]
defense attorney joseph hate and his mother has presented the tales of heavy

[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.240]
drinking by the x athlete during the four hours before he fatally shot costas

[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.260]
grusk a gust of

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.920]
the four hours before he did the shooting

[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.800]
the first plan the widams drank liquor after the shooting was contained in a

[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.380]
previously underscores report by dr. michael bayden

[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.840]
a man had an forensic pathologist hired by the defense member him from the

[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.900]
oj trial yes

[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.940]
dr. baden bayden whatever's name is

[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.600]
baden stated in the december fifty thousand two

[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.320]
a document that he understood the defense might introduce evidence Williams

[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.980]
consume approximately ten ounces of eighty proofs got surely after the

[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.300]
shooting

[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.300]
on jenny ray twenty six two thousand three pod net with widams and his home

[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.060]
where the former superstar gave me demonstration

[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.160]
mister widams advised me that after the shooting he was completely distraught he

[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.440]
took the bottle to the head two or three times

[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.780]
he took the bottle to the head

[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.940]
his demonstration of this for me was commonly referred to as chugging baden

[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.400]
wrote in the may thirteen two thousand three report using a scotch bottle

[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.160]
filled with water

[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:24.000]
widams took three large swigs while baden calculated the consumption at

[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.720]
between four and six ounces of fluid

[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.720]
with each chug or swallow

[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.080]
he concluded widams would have ingested least eight possible after eighteen

[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.240]
ounces scotch immediately after the shooting

[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.880]
widams blood alcohol level tested point one two nearly eight hours after the

[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.300]
shooting a prosecution witness dr. john brick estimated widams to consume fifteen

[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.300]
to sixteen drinks prior to the shooting prior to the shooting

[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.140]
brick extrapolated the widams blood alcohol reading would have measured as

[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.180]
high as point two five at the time a twelve eight truck that he was holding

[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.000]
discharge into christophies chest

[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.100]
bought another defense experts intended bricks methodology was flawed said his

[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.780]
findings failed to consider possible post shooting consumption

[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.340]
prosecutors dropped plans to call brick at the trial after judge inward

[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.200]
Coleman offered hearing on his methods and credentials

[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.380]
so there you go there's latest in the jason wouldiams

[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.840]
he's gonna get off to a trial

[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:11.980]
what do you think

[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.400]
never convicted i know it's all potatoes

[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.760]
who'd rather see in jail Martha steward or jason wouldiams he did there's a

[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.880]
problem with america

[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.140]
oj Simpson he's busy still on satellite signals alleged

[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:29.400]
on the outside he killed two people in cold blood Martha steward even though we

[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.220]
hate that bitch she's gonna wind up doing some time in a slamer i think it's

[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:32.680]
outrageous

[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.260]
so she lied you know it's so big deal she was stupid like most rich people

[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:37.940]
and ever have enough

[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.740]
greedy she was worth a billion dollars she did this thing say fifty grand she

[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.740]
would have lost fifty grand

[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.260]
like you said she's got more in her wallet any given time she's got more in her

[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.380]
wall of the fifty grand that's pocket change

[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.740]
fifty grand her is like fifty cents your average truck out there

[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.220]
so she was greedy she was a bitch and all these other things but in the meantime

[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.060]
put her in jail what's that kind of accomplish

[00:47:60.000 --> 00:48:03.080]
jason wouldiams and oj put him in the same damn cell is what i say

[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.220]
that's my that's my humble opinion

[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.360]

[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.800]
sports we don't want to get clearance upset

[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.000]
ten fifty seven at five sixty wqm if you're in a dead-end job like clearance

[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.640]

[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.900]
religious nuts i'm in the airport in the you know when you go on the international flights

[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:07.040]
there are like two uh prop processes okay when you check in at the gate first they uh put you

[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.780]
through a uh you have an outer waiting area and then when they're getting ready to board about

[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.140]
20 minutes before they're actually going to board the plane they have an inner waiting area where

[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:18.840]
you sit after they check the passport and you're a boarding pass etc so this flight is just jam

[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:25.680]
packed 400 people and my luck i'm sitting across from this uh schmattheb family now the two guys

[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.200]
they're like uh no they're just guys talking about the bio old uh and the woman she's got the

[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.440]
full reggaea and she's got the whole outfit you know the burka the whole deal and uh right so

[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.620]
and i don't want to say anything but she looked like a guy i mean her hands you didn't have a

[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:46.760]
hair on her hands but like a hands of a man okay i guess it's maybe like a a middle eastern thing i

[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.340]
don't know what it is so she decided about 20 minutes before we're going to get on the flight

[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:58.140]
that it was time to pray okay and she's consulting with her um two male whatever the relationship was

[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:03.400]
uh where she can find a place to do it so she goes to the end of the uh seats where there's like

[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.320]
a uh clear area there you know i mean maybe four or five feet she uh roll out the carpet

[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.060]
she's well she didn't have a carpet she didn't have a portable one with her i guess

[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.700]
but now she's standing there and she's like like like like that but maybe speaking in tongues

[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:22.280]
we don't know like that in the middle east but i'll get to that don't push it now i'm not pushing

[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.320]
out of these things right and of course some of the past news are getting a little bit uncomfortable

[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.500]
just kind of like the people out of america and iraians flight that you know yeah yeah when the

[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.540]
pilot came on and said if you don't believe in Jesus you're crazy hey let's go have a good flight now

[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:40.920]
and she's been well and and now she starts the course getting down on the floor and she's like uh

[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:45.020]
i tried not to watch as much of it as i could because it was making me a little bit comfortable as well

[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:50.580]
i got out of taking my camera phone and captured the moment oh man and of course being the

[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:54.560]
hidden that i am i'm thinking to myself why didn't you do this before you assholes came to the

[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.080]
airport why are you doing this here now because it wasn't pray time then why are you inflicting this

[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:04.040]
on everybody now what the floor show come on and think about all the things in a world about

[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.460]
india and pakistan which both have the big bomb by the way you know we got the hindus and the six

[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:12.300]
remember that kid that called in a one day a year or so ago on the show he said i'm sick and i

[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:18.120]
said oh my god see your doctors a good idea hindus and the six you got the Protestants and the

[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.800]
Catholics in northern Ireland you got the uh deduces in the muslims in the middle east and of course

[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.700]
the Christians want their peace too sure even myrlandsky wants a little peace i'm in rod

[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:33.320]
everywhere you look that's what it's all about you got these sheites and the sunis i mean when

[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.100]
you stop and think about this in a media the media presents this is though it's some kind of a

[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:42.280]
rational thing you know right as though somehow these people are different they're well they're

[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.340]
different all right because they believe different fairy tales where they came from different

[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:50.720]
you know parts of the country whatever the hell the deal was pick your poison that's what it's

[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.660]
all about so don't don't give me a solid dance about the passion of the christ and all this other

[01:05:54.660 --> 01:06:00.320]
because all religion does is breed a hate that's what it is it's a weapon to breed a hate and to

[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.680]
excuse intolerance against other people and i'll say it again the greatest contribution i

[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.140]
could make is if i could get one person this audience in all the years i've been on the

[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:15.220]
earth's out florida twenty eight years to abandon their to emancipate their brain and think

[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.200]
about how ridiculous all this garbage is this that they've been brainwashed with that's quite an

[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.020]
accomplishment that shows you how difficult it is they're always talking about when it back

[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:27.500]
in the days when i did topical radio which was really boring but some of the shows i enjoyed a

[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:33.700]
one's about the religion and we'd have these people on to discuss the programming young people

[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:41.160]
from cults yeah and my favorite question to these experts always was what what is a cult and what's

[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:46.760]
a real religion right of course they had their standard answer well you know a real religion has

[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:52.040]
got a cult has got a strong central figure oh you mean like you like to pop well any of these

[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.020]
things you know no matter what the answer was they would come back with it was a one of those

[01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:00.380]
interchangeable answers that you could put in anything you know very sad

[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:07.280]
it's just that what separates Catholicism and all the Protestant cults and Judaism is that

[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:12.300]
they're just better businessmen and the Muslims forget about it they make you know for you can't

[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:18.180]
refuse not like the Christians ever did i like like i just said i just got through with them don't

[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.740]
be picking on them Christians again your buddy Pablo be waiting for you outside the studio there at

[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:28.760]
the twelve fifty five okay yeah twenty three past eleven i'm concerned about the hump around

[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.560]
we're waiting for that decision from the big meeting between Greg Reed and the hump

[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:38.380]
and Hank Goldberg the brain trust is meeting with the hump right now to try to straighten his

[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:43.720]
act out i thought i had him calm down a few years ago but you know every now and then you just

[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:50.420]
like you said some people inspire here one right that that's right she sure did it to me before

[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:56.220]
we started on the air the day i had a actually we were on the air no we weren't on the air we were

[01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:00.140]
in that studio downstairs preparing to be on there remember all the work that we did there

[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.280]
and she comes down and she says now how many spots in our did we agree to and of course it was

[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:12.280]
14 that was 16 six now it's 14 16 and she she stormed out and made some kind of a crack some

[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.820]
kind of a nasty miserable crack is only screw and what it can do and i'm my blood was boiling

[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.000]
and i remember going up that elevator the third floor just chasing around to try to find where she was

[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.820]
and of course at that point she decided to go and closet herself with Greg or somebody in an

[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:30.920]
a meeting and i was just muttering and mumbling to myself hadn't even started on the area

[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:36.720]
on qa so i know all about what it is with that screw and bitch and i'll say again Hank instead of

[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.840]
getting suspended instead of getting addressing down or even address what is it addressing down

[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:47.140]
an addressing down he should get an award for honesty for having a balls to tell

[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:51.500]
it like it is and don't give me a son and answer about uh what do they call it the unfriendly

[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:56.260]
workplace the hostile environment working right because i can't think of too many more hostile

[01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:01.580]

Never been in Wisconsin. My freedom from religion foundation is just a very nice clean

[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.100]
Pitchress kind of little town right well little safe

[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.660]
Least signed defense of the Cali Johansson by the way

[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:21.520]
I know you're concerned about that all this heavy duty stuff going on. Yeah

[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:26.580]
Shinshan Bureau with some advice and a good morning. Oh, I changed channel just in time

[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.760]
David Crosby. This is an old story from the weekend and here it is Tuesday already and then we never get around with us

[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.420]
Did you talk about this you couldn't have because it was on Saturday? No

[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:40.820]
famed rock and roller David Crosby was arrested early Saturday after a hotel made found a weapons and marriage a wini in a suitcase

[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:43.700]
He'd accidentally left behind during a short stay in Midtown Manhattan

[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.300]
Weapons and marriage a wini

[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.880]
Crosby 62 already had checked out of the double tree sweet hotel at

[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.960]
1568 Broadway where returned around one o'clock in the morning recover piece of luggage he left behind police said after we let

[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:01.360]
However, make clean his room found the bag and police were notified of its contents a 45 caliber gun

[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.680]
Three magazines of ammunition a hunting knife a folding knife a pocket knife and a small bag of weed with rolling papers

[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:13.980]
Court officials said Crosby called the hotel to say left the the bag in his room. That's always a smart thing to do

[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:19.880]
When he returned for it police were waiting and charged him there with criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of marriage a wini

[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.820]
It was arranged just before one o'clock Saturday in the States of cream court man

[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:30.220]
Hatton were just as Robert Strauss said bail of 35 hundred bucks despite the fence attorney Daniel Parker's request a wave bail and released the musician on his own

[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:30.980]
reconnaissance

[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:37.920]
Crosby appeared tired in court wore loose dark pants and a t-shirt reading a man in his truck. It's a beautiful thing

[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:44.080]
He left by a side exit next scheduled appear in court May 19 Parker would not comment

[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.360]
How do you like that poor David Crosby just can't stop you know it?

[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:53.220]
He just can't shut off the crap like me. I can't shut off the fan. Same thing

[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:57.560]
Can't shut off the Ben and Jerry's ice cream coffee coffee crunch. Oh God

[01:24:58.820 --> 01:24:59.780]
Chucky yeah

[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:07.900]
Police secretly watching hip-hop artists will you shut up speaking of that although it's a good segue police secretly watching hip-hop artists in Miami

[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:11.180]
They're watching you they're monitoring you

[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:18.640]
My in-mime beach police are secretly watching and keeping dossiers on hip-hop celebrities like P. Diddy and D.M. X

[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.940]
And their entourage is when they come to South Florida

[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:25.460]
Move police say is to protect the stars and the public protect us from hip-hop

[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.540]
Often to say they photograph rappers as they arrived at MIA

[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:37.300]
They stake out hotels nightclubs and video shoots they can sell the six-inch thick blank binder of every rapper and member of his or her group

[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:42.860]
With an arrest record in the state of New York the binder begins with a photo and rap sheet of Grammy nominated rapper 50 cent

[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:48.720]
50 cents it ends with job rule both men are embellished one of the most bitter feuds in hip-hop industry

[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:53.540]
One that M&M 50 cents producer is warned in the song bully could lead the bloodshed

[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.000]
One of them rapper few

[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.920]
Post-rappers against the West Coast rappers

[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:07.200]
The policing effort of top entertainers which hip-hop experts criticizes unnecessary stereotyping was created police say to protect the public and

[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.400]
Musical celebrities who've chosen to make South Florida their destination to live in party

[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.380]
Like I said who chosen to make South Florida and I can't even find the damn thing now. How do you like that?

[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:25.040]
Yeah, can you believe he's dead? Yeah, I was just thinking about that earlier. Wow

[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:30.680]
That was psychic you are Don Cox is dead. He's sleeping with the fishes now. I can't I just can't believe that heavy

[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:35.960]
Hey, can we interrupt just briefly because I'm trying to get a message to this guy in New York a message to what guy?

[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.640]
The guy that is always faxing books. He's a good guy. I'm sure he's listening me means well

[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.920]
He's got good intentions, but all day long he faxes 10 freaking 20 page faxes just facts

[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.240]
Third man first page if you're gonna fax it all or don't all

[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:52.680]
Day learn

[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:58.660]
Hmm from this guy. It's love alone already. We do proud your intentions are good, but to bug off first of all lost

[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:03.160]
Pist off and fired up in New York. We can't read your fax machine for some reason

[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:08.900]
It's a mighty beach police chief Charles press as we have to keep an eye on these robberies the last thing we need in the city is violence

[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.700]
We want to have no violence and soft floor a dog

[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:17.640]
Government agencies keeping tabs on musicians is not new the next administration investigated former Beatles John

[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.680]
Lynn in the 1970s tried to have them deported the band body count led by rapper Iced he got the attention

[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:29.460]
Please nationally in the early 90s with a song cop killer, but those cases involved individual artists or groups not monitoring across a musical genre

[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:36.120]
There's been no shortage of rock stars other musicians scrutinized by police and Anthony de Curtis contributing editor at Rolling Stone

[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:40.640]
But there's never been anything like this well look at the times in which we live you see what I'm saying

[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.660]
Speaking of John ascrock

[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:50.260]
Several music executives in legal scholar say the intelligence gathering highlights the misunderstanding between the police and a ten billion dollar industry

[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:55.180]
The police they can tend to use the slangs of high-profile artists like Tupac the notorious

[01:27:55.180 --> 01:28:00.660]
B.I.G. and run DMC's jam master J to justify tracking many in the industry I

[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.800]
Mean about all scumbags are they?

[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:11.960]
I don't know the moment. Oh, some people see gangs and hip-hop artists as being synonymous with Benjamin Chavez president and chief executive officer of the hip-hop

[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:17.440]
Summit action network. Oh man a government watchdog in voter registration group. Yeah, the hip-hop

[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.060]
Summit action network

[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:23.960]
Right that's a mistake. He said the recording industry is a legitimate American enterprise not a gang

[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.420]
Senator to Bruce rogo this kind of conduct shows in sensitivity to constitutional limitations

[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:36.460]
It also implicates racial stereotyping robo successfully represented two live crew when the rap group was prosecuted for obscenity in the early 90s

[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:40.800]
And you want to know why they were prosecuted in the early 90s?

[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:44.600]
Oh

[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:48.900]
They so dirty man. They so dirty share

[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:54.000]
Speaking of obscenities here's a fact that says the Rick Sanchez show is still on the air

[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.600]
But you can tell they're dying over there

[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:01.880]
Mostly they're doing plenty of vacation giveaways and prizes by watching the show to get the secret word or phrase

[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:08.160]
So even if the show is puke inducing the stay at home numb nuts will watch in hopes of winning something besides

[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.180]
It's good comedy as they wait for Oprah side note

[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:13.560]
Wow

[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:18.400]
Phil Henry shows being bleep left and right and they don't play him

[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:24.260]
Live anymore. It's mostly reruns with all the bleeps of the previous day with stuff cut out or bleeped

[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.860]
How do you like that? Are you

[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.220]
Since I hope he's still loving

[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:35.520]
Licking the bushmeister after what he and his people are doing. Well, that's what happens

[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.840]
Just like Howard same thing sucked up to the bushmeister for a long time didn't do any good

[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.880]
Soon as he changes to a little bit bye-bye

[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:49.880]
Bye-bye Stern-meister by the way something yes Hank says thank you and he loves you

[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:55.760]
But everything worked out Hank. My Hank is great Hank is legendary Hank doesn't have to prove it

[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:59.100]
And then what really I resent bitterly and I mean this

[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:03.800]
Literally you remember when we before we started and Hank had that run in with a first suspension

[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.140]
See which I'm I don't do suspensions

[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:08.960]
I mean if you don't want to pay me then we'll see in court

[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.880]
I don't play the game in the middle of that

[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:16.360]
That's right. I'm there and if you don't want to let me on here then well, we'll go to court. I'm not having any meetings

[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:23.040]
But that first thing which was a total lie and Tom Jike exposed Greg read for the liar that he wasn't the newspaper at that time

[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.600]
The business about well he picked on Wayne Harzenga and the food and the press box

[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:33.160]
That had nothing to do with it was all again about screw-an and fill us the a water Nazi to a Greg's bunk butt buddies

[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.660]
There with the station for any many years and that's what it was all about is he didn't treat them nice

[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:40.720]
And so he got suspended without pay and I'd go through all kind of crap

[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:45.900]
And I remember in those days Greg rambling his spirit. Oh, I don't know if I want to have Hank on our stab all out of the crap

[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:50.400]
Well since those days largely thanks to me and my tone Hank tank to check to the bank

[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:56.660]
Hank let's be a listen take the mind of Bank sweetheart, please ignore morons like Greg read and screw-an at bitch

[01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:01.820]
Just take the money straight to the bank tomorrow's pay day put a smile on your big fat push and quit eating so much

[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:06.780]
So now here we have the same thing all over again based on the guys of well

[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:10.640]
It's a hostile of work environment that he's making these comments in a hall

[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.280]
Well, big thinking deal okay grow up grow up Greg

[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:18.400]
Now what is this thing about a woodpecker here is this two clean

[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.640]
Uh-uh, Julian D'Areal and I read that I saw that word woodpecker and that's the end for me

[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.420]
Yeah, I'm not I'm not going there is they like to say don't even go there girl

[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:30.120]
Which I hate that expression, but guess what I'm not going there just like you said about the South Carolina

[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.400]
I'm not going here no

[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.560]
I'm not going there. I wish I'd have to pass through there

[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.980]
Woody the woodpecker not going there

[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:45.040]
Let's see studio script notes on the passion dictated to Steve Martin. Is this amusing or not? It's cute. Let's go to Ralph

[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:49.540]
Dear Mel we love love the script the ending works great

[01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:54.000]
You're gonna be getting a call from us this darn negotiations for the book rights written to Mel Gibson of course love the Jesus character

[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.860]
So like I don't want to read this. It's just yeah, it's cute

[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.440]
I don't want to do it because we get Pablo all upset again, you know

[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:01.540]
He's probably

[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:07.020]
Impaling himself on something sharp right now. I'm ready on something old for sure and that could be it

[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:11.380]
So the police are secretly watching the hip-hop artists in South Florida there

[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:15.840]
So keep your we just govern yourselves according that's all I can tell you I feel better now good

[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:18.800]
Yeah, now you'll be in a good place where you can be safe

[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:24.480]
Who should John Kerry pick is his running mate? That's our poll question. By the way don't the Miss Kerry Otis

[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:30.040]
She's our sunshine girl today. We hope to be Harry. Oh, it is behind the beaded curtain

[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.140]
John Edwards

[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:38.220]
2012 ought to be the running mate and you know, I don't have a problem with that although I don't see the great political

[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:44.200]
Strategy there. I don't see what the big game is do you with John Edwards? Right a new England

[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.520]
Kind of guy with a pick for the balanced ticket

[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:55.120]
But what's what states in the South is down Edwards gonna help John Kerry win if there are swing voters in the South

[01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:03.660]
That's the idea. Yeah, well did now for when for the last time right he did I mean a stolen but he won it nevertheless

[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:07.740]
So the words he'll swing more votes in that direction than say Joe Lieberman

[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:11.480]
You're missing the point while we're not talking about you Lieberman. He's not even on a list

[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:17.500]
We're talking about somebody who might win him some states who might win him the election by having him on a ticket

[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:23.300]
I don't see where John Edwards fits that bill. I don't care if he's got 90% of these votes because it was predictable from the beginning

[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:27.820]
When we started taking a poll they say oh John Edwards because that's what they're supposed to say they think you know

[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:32.860]
I voted for Graham on the poll and just talking about what they're saying. I voted for Bubba myself

[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:39.900]
Yeah, I ain't gonna happen but sure well sounds great. That's the ideal idea

[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:47.620]
610 votes 610. Oh my god. You know what 610? I don't you holy moly 610 W.I.O.D

[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:50.300]
Oh, I hate that stage. That's another cheap channel station now

[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:56.420]
The one good piece of news is that I don't see a lot of crossover between Lord Asselinbaugh that pill pop and phony hypocrite right wing asshole

[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:58.860]
I don't see a lot of it across over between him and Howard Stern

[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:02.840]
So I don't think that the people who listen to Howard who are pissed off a third channel

[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:09.540]
They're gonna have to give up anything that they like like rush or the Schmidt-Mistory and that crap because they don't listen to that stuff anyway

[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:11.100]
Right right

[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.100]
610 votes Edwards 213 Graham 104 good old BDI Bobby Bill Clinton 100

[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:21.260]
I don't care. I'm for Bush 58 9 1 1 1 2 3rd pretty weak Hillary 34

[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:25.460]
I don't care period 34 no matter what you say Dick M.H. It's got 20

[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:32.940]
General Wesley Clark 20 Bill Richardson 13 Tom Broca's about eight and Bill Nelson and I like that name has got six

[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.800]
We're supporting you five CC

[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.200]
You am

[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:46.680]
Mr. Kenny I like to relax by having their Magical and massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers welcome one hour

[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:47.140]
Beepin

[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:52.220]
From the makers of the passion of the Christ comes

[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.180]
Passion of the Christ on ice

[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:02.760]
All the violence of the movie you loved but with a triple axle crucifixion

[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:10.720]
See columns of graceful Roman soldiers whipping and weaving around a magnificent messiah

[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:20.420]
New York Times reports these skaters really nailed this one and USA today says jumping Jesus Christ on ice is

[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:21.900]
Cold-blooded fun

[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:27.160]
Bring the kids to witness and savior each moment they cross the grace

[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:31.900]
Shagorage and the suffering of Christ on ice

[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:38.880]
What these numbers makes for you. It's not just dizzyness careful resurrection. Oh, I told you it's gonna be a good day tonight

[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:43.140]
Yeah, it's a great day. George upholds the death sentence for John Muhammad

[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.840]
He's gonna get off in

[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.240]
Tomorrow and Lee Boyd Malvolga, so he's gonna get his

[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.240]
He's gonna get sentenced tomorrow

[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:57.220]
So that's some excellent news. We got the Marlins and the meds coming up from Port St. Lucie at 1255 this afternoon

[01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:05.560]
So that's even better news because we get out here early and I know the Marlins fans are just hanging on on the edge of their seats waiting for every pitch by the coma inducing

[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.320]
Van Boerring well, that's really that's criminal. That's pathetic

[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:12.000]
Wait till you're this

[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:17.700]
President Bush's chief political advisor Carl Roe of Tully FBI in the interview last October

[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:23.960]
That he circulated and discussed damaging information regarding CIA operative Valerie Plain with others in the White House

[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:31.420]
Outside political consultants and journalists according to a government official and an attorney familiar with the ongoing special counsel's investigation of the matter

[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:36.000]
But Roe also adamantly insisted to the FBI that he was not the administration official

[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.340]
It will leave the information that Plain was a covert CIA operative to conservative comments Robert Novak last July

[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:45.560]
Rather, Roe been assisted to only circulate information about Plain after it appeared Novak's column

[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:52.880]
He also told the FBI the same sources said that circulating the information was a legitimate means to counter what he claimed was politically

[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.860]
Motivated criticism of the Bush administration by Plains husband former ambassador Joseph Wilson see one thing

[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:02.100]
You folks have to understand you better get it right now get right it down on your arm like a memento, okay?

[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.600]
We do not criticize the government

[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:11.500]
Look got it the have days. That's right the US you know the criticize the government

[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:19.160]
You know criticize the president state device president. You don't criticize the Secretary of Defense the Secretary of State the Secretary of the Interior the exterior

[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:24.420]
The posterior none of these things. Welcome got it and you certainly don't criticize

[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:28.540]
the national security adviser that's right

[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:40.840]
Don't even think about it too late. I thought about it. Well, you're done. Oh

[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:41.380]
Stick it there

[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:48.760]
Abbon in your belly we go in with what looks like a periscope and they put a little bag around the golf a little panicky there

[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.100]
Because they discovered the hole in a crosshead and they thought gee did we drill in a wrong place?

[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:55.220]
Right, though, and that one too big one that they find his black heart

[01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.340]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 8 his black part

[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:06.180]
pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line so the surgeries underway

[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:12.400]
Oh, I certainly hope it's over successfully and he has several good bomb movements later in the day so we can read about it in the papers like eyes now

[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:16.800]
Look at that phone man. Is this pathetic or what WQ I am?

[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:22.420]
Yeah, okay, Joey Dean is sterilizers and Jay. Jay and Americans good good for you

[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:24.760]
That's it. That's the end of our calls today

[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:28.240]
I'm telling you these days when we have Marlon's baseball. It's a mixed bag on

[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.000]
One head it's a real blessing to get out of here early on the other hand man

[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.860]
They start diving away from that radio dial this in case they might hear a pitch

[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:38.800]
WQM hello

[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:46.940]

Okay, thank you this flash. Yeah, that's the real bulletin

Another one of your people by the way that was probably what's his name? What's his name Pablo?

[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:00.440]
No, it's probably Pablo's boyfriend

[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.140]
Somebody Q. M. Hello

[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:05.260]
Hello, Neil. How are you okay?

[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:11.820]
Listen, I'm pissed off about the FCC going back to yesterday's discussion. Yes, I am pissed off

[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:15.340]
I want you to know that another thing is I'm praying that

[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.820]
Ascroft died in surgery right now

[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:22.400]
Okay, well, it's going on right now, so we'll give you a play-by-play. We'll let you know how it comes out

[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:29.420]
5 670 you've got his John ascroft Voodoo doll is probably sticking a pin right in its back though right as we speak now

[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:39.820]
The anxious attorney general man just distant a disgrace a man who's covering a boobies on statues a man from the Stone Age

[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:47.580]
Wow, he makes fundamentalist Christians look like Ted Kennedy like raven liberals. That's how far to the right he is

[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.220]
Your attorney general at work

[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:53.660]
WQM hello

[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:59.020]
And you know how are you okay? Yeah, I'm also pretty pissed off about the FCC too

[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:05.400]
And what's really amazing is that the FCC got the largest amount of public input regarding the

[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:12.580]
Media mergers, you know and the expansion of the networks. Yeah, they got what was it 19 million

[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:19.340]
And they still don't care they still because they're in bed with Viacama with the in a cheap channel. They don't give a crap

[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.660]
Yeah, but point oh one of

[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:26.860]
1% of the population is upset about the Janet Jackson's boob and no like a major

[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:32.820]
But the other thing that I really wanted to talk about is this religion and wars thing that you were talking about a little while ago

[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:38.760]
And oh my god. Yeah, well, you know the United States is the country if you read out

[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.520]
This is a big new brazinski book called the afghan trap

[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.860]
He discusses on there how under the Carter administration and after the Carter administration too

[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:54.620]
They were funding the mujah had been and been lawden, you know to upright against the communism right and you know

[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:59.480]
It's a you can say this about Pakistan and it's right the power and all of their why are you?

[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.380]
Why are you going through all of this you're you're worrying me out?

[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:02.720]
You're your intentions are good

[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:08.700]
But we know all of this Sodom was our man and though so it was our man because he was fighting the Ruskys the communist and

[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:13.280]
Baby doc was our man and Papa doc before him was our man and Aristide was our man

[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.320]
And you know when you support dictators that's what what happens all over the world and

[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.740]
Then they will fear you

[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:26.100]
And they will hate you like poison. That's what's happened to America today with despised reviled all around the world

[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.780]
Not so much as individual people but the American government now they fear us like crazy

[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:34.620]
They're being on the good way either no in a bad way

[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.240]

[01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:02.120]
That's not a manly thing for a guy like our attorney generally wearing some kind of a gown

[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:07.220]
Well, maybe he can wear it backwards. Oh, brother the flap and frisk backward. Oh, can't say that

You know what I'm saying what do you say?

And it is really when I have that kind of a stuff

[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:12.300]
What you ought to be able to do is like set it automatic and go like wherever you were going to the bank with no ability to stop in

[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.280]
Between other than one of you have to stop for traffic

[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:16.580]
But no ability to make any pit stops. See what I'm saying?

[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:20.180]
Where the doors lock so you can't jump out right? That's right in the windows locked too

[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:24.320]
So you can't rule the window down and you know get that sack handed through the window

[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:30.140]
That big fat sack. Oh speaking of sacked. There's George tennis and what I did or what I didn't do

He's only got six votes out of 660 that ain't too good

[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:12.180]
Yeah, and you want to know why?

[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:13.380]
Nobody knows who that is

[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:21.440]
If you went out on the corner of 441 and I was very rude right now and you found anybody who spoke English and you said

[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.200]
You know who Bill Nelson is and they'd say okay?

[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.720]
They look at you with that strange look or

[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.560]
Or if you went on the other side of the street and asked that question they might say

[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:39.020]
Just before you make your deal WQM. Hello. Oh

All right the miracle of modern science. Oh, what a show and the price is right

Let me say it again the price is right everybody is everybody at South Florida center on her radio

[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:12.080]
They're you know dealing with that radio dial

[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:16.020]
Dive them with each other listening to this show. I don't care what arbitrons says

[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:21.160]
I don't care what Bill Tanner says that silly lady. I don't care what else. She's screaming. Oh the Spanish language stays

Miss Tanner see that that that's a mistake is Miss Tanner right there right off the bat

195 465 up for grams today of which carry will get what about 450

[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:47.160]
Something like that. Why are they even wasting their time with this?

[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:53.960]
In fact, it's a good idea and I know not too many people have voted Florida because the the die is already cast

[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.940]
but for practice right

[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.400]
Yeah, on the touchscreen machines go out there and touch it a little bit

[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:05.480]
Why they still can't this machine wait right go out there and play a little bit of and

[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:10.420]
You also can do do some practicing for November when a lot of you are going to be voting three four or five times

That what we're doing is wrong

[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.780]

Because my love is so strong

[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:09.720]

I'm your prison bitch your prison bitch and you're a sex machine

[01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:51.790]
I only have one request how about some

[01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:53.030]
Sure

[01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:57.790]
I'm tired of this prison cell I need to get away

[01:48:58.670 --> 01:49:04.010]
This sentence made to seven years not seven times a day

[01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:08.870]
I'm your prison bitch your prison bitch you're in for many

[01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:12.890]
I'm sure I really hate these markers that

[01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:15.210]
you're not back

[01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:20.590]
I thought that I could break away but now I'm losing hope

[01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:24.730]
God, I'm tired of paying off the sow

[01:49:24.730 --> 01:49:28.110]
I'm tired of this prison bitch

[01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:30.850]

[01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:39.170]
prison bitch

[01:49:39.170 --> 01:49:42.150]
I'm tired of this prison

[01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:46.750]
When I get out I'm ready to go straight

[01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:53.670]
I'm tired of this prison bitch my prison bitch I'll never say goodbye

[01:49:53.670 --> 01:49:59.750]
You're not like all the others too bad they had to die

[01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:04.070]
On the second thought I believe I'll say

[01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:06.550]
If you want me to

[01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:11.710]
your prison bitch is never leaving

[01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.830]

[01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:21.650]
I'm hurt you would not sell me but now you're not so mad

[01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:23.690]
that's a perfect man don't worry

[01:50:23.690 --> 01:50:25.230]
I know I'm not a good man

[01:50:25.230 --> 01:50:28.530]
Now I know what they call you heart criminal

[01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:31.290]
You're about to find out what they call this

[01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.810]
I'm sorry

[01:50:36.810 --> 01:50:41.590]
I like that

[01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:44.030]
I like that

[01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.690]
Do it again

[01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:52.390]
21 past noon at 560 WQ in the land of the used to be free and used to be brave

[01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:54.630]
and used to have all kinds of freedoms not no more

[01:50:55.290 --> 01:50:56.590]
No more freedoms baby

[01:50:57.350 --> 01:51:00.650]
But the good news is DC snapper killer Muhammad sentenced to death

[01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:01.010]
Alright

[01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.990]
You like that a lot

[01:51:02.690 --> 01:51:07.350]
John Allen Muhammad was sentenced to death today for his role in these snapper shootings that terrorized the Washington area

[01:51:08.150 --> 01:51:12.790]
Circuit Judge Lee Roy Mullage and you turned the side of plea for Muhammad's attorneys to spare their clients life

[01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:17.030]
He ordered Muhammad executed October 14th but that day likely it'll be postponed to allow appeals

[01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:20.890]
See that's what bugs me all these appeals on and on and just like Bundy

[01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:22.590]
How many years did they appeal that thing

[01:51:22.590 --> 01:51:23.430]
About third man

[01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:25.270]
He's trying to fright his nasty ass

[01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:26.150]
God

[01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:29.210]
Muhammad denied any

[01:51:29.210 --> 01:51:33.130]
This is the best part he denied any of the involvement in the killing stews they telling the judge

[01:51:33.130 --> 01:51:36.110]
Don't make a fool of the constitution of the United States of America

[01:51:36.110 --> 01:51:40.250]
Just like I said in the beginning I had nothing to do with this and I'll say it again I had nothing to do with this

[01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:40.770]
Right

[01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.390]
Right

[01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:45.010]
Say it again I have nothing to do with it okay keep saying it

[01:51:45.810 --> 01:51:46.590]
Are you sure

[01:51:48.370 --> 01:51:51.750]
Here's the facts from Mike who's obviously been hanging out under the bed too long

[01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:53.530]
And I don't blame him for being a little bit a scared

[01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:57.770]
He says I've got to a bunch of websites I can't find John Kerry's middle name

[01:51:57.770 --> 01:52:01.390]
Could we have another JFK is his name Francis freight up?

[01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:04.870]
Seriously is his name Francis?

[01:52:05.070 --> 01:52:05.410]
No

[01:52:05.410 --> 01:52:09.930]
Well it is JFK we do know that but I had he says do we have another JFK no

[01:52:10.810 --> 01:52:15.270]
The initials are JFK but do we have another JFK no no no chance I even close

[01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:19.210]
I don't want to pee on his parade but you know he ain't no JFK

[01:52:21.150 --> 01:52:24.570]
California lawmakers proposed lowering the 40 year voting age to 14

[01:52:24.570 --> 01:52:25.490]
All right

[01:52:26.210 --> 01:52:27.170]
What a joke

[01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:33.570]
But you've made a good point before the show when I told about the story that is that the kids they like Arnold big time

[01:52:33.570 --> 01:52:34.190]
Yeah

[01:52:34.190 --> 01:52:39.150]
So he could have like 90% of the vote next time and of course we'll pass that amendment in Congress

[01:52:39.150 --> 01:52:43.210]
And making eligible to run for president we can have eight years of Arnold as president

[01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:52.610]
millions of California teenagers become the nation's first to vote under a proposed constitutional amendment introduced yesterday by a 71 year old state senator

[01:52:53.510 --> 01:53:01.410]
Senator John Vesconcello, a Democrat of Santa Clara, proposed the idea alongside three other lawmakers, same the internet, cell phones, multi channel TV

[01:53:01.410 --> 01:53:06.550]
And a diverse society make today's teens veteran formed then generations of their predecessors, right

[01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:10.990]
So I guess they can figure out how they're going to vote for an all-emporno size right?

[01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:12.050]
That's all I do

[01:53:12.050 --> 01:53:14.850]
Behind the beaded rope

[01:53:15.730 --> 01:53:23.790]
Coming on the heels of an expected record load turned out among adults in the March 2nd election Vesconcello would give 16 year olds March 2nd election

[01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:26.310]
What does that mean?

[01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:28.410]
Isn't it a March 9th last time I checked?

[01:53:28.710 --> 01:53:28.770]
Yeah

[01:53:28.770 --> 01:53:39.630]
Oh I see on the heels of what last week Vesconcello would give 16 year olds a half a vote and for 14 year olds a quarter of a vote in state elections beginning in 2006

[01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:41.490]
Got that?

[01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:49.490]
If you're 16 you get a half a vote if you're 14 a quarter vote and if you're 50 I guess you get like what's between a quarter and a half three eights

[01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.710]
Okay

[01:53:49.710 --> 01:53:50.610]
Yeah

[01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:51.430]
Two thirds

[01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:59.070]
The idea formally called training wheels for citizenship first requires two thirds approval see there you go by the legislature to appear on this November's ballot

[01:54:00.170 --> 01:54:07.090]
California suggestion comes 33 years after the U.S. lowered its voting age from 21 to 18 amid a fledgling youth movement in the U.S.

[01:54:07.170 --> 01:54:13.070]
out of the nations to lower the voting age supporters say Israel allows 17 year olds to vote local elections while Austria and Germany

[01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:21.110]
have lost 16 year olds to vote in some local elections a bill in California letting 17 year olds vote in primary elections when they will be 18 year old for general election is languished

[01:54:21.110 --> 01:54:28.650]
People are given opportunity when accounts often live up to its is that Vesconcello's flanked by nearly 40 teenagers from across the state

[01:54:28.650 --> 01:54:32.170]
Right a Republican colleague called it the nuthiest idea I've ever heard

[01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:42.530]
Set of sentiment Ray Haynes Republican of myrieta there's a good reason why 14 and 16 year olds don't vote they're not adults they're not mature enough and here comes my favorite line of the whole year

[01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:45.110]
They're easily deceived by political shard of them

[01:54:46.450 --> 01:54:52.430]
Not like the adults right not like any of them adults but I still say it's a stupid idea okay just cut the crap

[01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:59.710]
That's like 10 year olds vote what do you say we'll give them like a tenth of a vote and then when they get to be 12 again like eight tenths right

[01:55:01.150 --> 01:55:08.870]
Right Zion America baby that's all I can tell you it's insanity mass madness lunacy this is your Congress hard at work

[01:55:10.410 --> 01:55:14.750]
This is the state legislators hard at working California's if they don't have bigger fish to fry

[01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:24.870]
26 past noon at 5 60 WQM house your new year's resolution going it's already the ninth of March like I said only moments ago and you're still fat just like every year

Well, it's just aren't tough to stick to that old diet regimen for most people like me with balance for life they make it easy not hard

Everyday right here doorstep and we're talking about fresh delicious food nothing frozen nothing they're prefabricated no chemicals

[02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:57.450]
a stuff pound 560 on the 18 and teen Verizon wireless line WQM hello hello Neil how you doing okay sir

[02:00:57.450 --> 02:01:03.110]
hey I just put my ears on so you might have already gone over this but I heard from some very inside

[02:01:03.110 --> 02:01:11.690]
sources in the FCC that them fines are going to be suspended till after the election how is that possible

[02:01:11.690 --> 02:01:17.750]
well I heard the 12 binds you were talking about that would be put out the week coming down this week

[02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:23.890]
right right are not going to be coming down until after the election because they don't want anybody

[02:01:23.890 --> 02:01:31.030]
looking like a martyr I lifted to the stone show on hold this morning yeah and that's what he started

[02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:39.630]
to show with that he's got two very good inside sources inside the FCC yeah and you know they don't

[02:01:39.630 --> 02:01:45.630]
want the people to find and of course I'm anti bush you know looking like martyrs well I think

[02:01:45.770 --> 02:01:49.670]
I knew that that's great yeah you know I figured you want to hear that that's the only reason I

[02:01:49.670 --> 02:01:55.430]
know all the more reason to kick bush out in November I guess I'm going to both right now but no

[02:01:55.430 --> 02:02:03.790]
bush in my white house and no bush on my women I'm out of here see you come that 5 6 7 0 5 60

[02:02:11.210 --> 02:02:16.370]
okay well Joe was in Austria so we had to do that all right I keep telling Duff about that he's like

[02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:21.750]
move him like that of course Clarence he's busy with sports with ball games you know with all kinds

[02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:26.890]
of odd shaped balls so that would be interesting good news if that happens to be true that they're

[02:02:26.890 --> 02:02:31.610]
going to but I I don't know I'm a little bit dubious about that because Howard seems to be singing a

[02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:35.750]
different tune every day now well last Friday was going to be maybe his last day on the air and his

[02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:40.170]
days are numbered and the finds and Kid Curry told you the finds are coming on this week that's what he

[02:06:48.690 --> 02:06:53.910]
going on now I mean I listen to you every day but I'm usually only half the day because I'm a driver

[02:06:54.530 --> 02:07:00.050]
I'm out of the I'm out of the vehicle half the time so uh now what is it has anything coming

[02:07:00.050 --> 02:07:06.170]
down on you if you got a reprimandor or no nothing or anything no no well no but we have not a

[02:07:06.170 --> 02:07:11.110]
letter but we have a statement of policy by the company and we have to watch our P's and Q's man

[02:07:11.110 --> 02:07:15.150]
we have to be because the FCC has just changed the whole ballgame now they just they just change

[02:07:15.150 --> 02:07:18.890]
all the rules in the middle of the game things that we've been able to do for 20 30 years not no more

[02:07:19.330 --> 02:07:27.610]
I realize that yeah and you know a lot of your program is excellent entertainment yeah but um I

[02:07:27.610 --> 02:07:32.150]
just you know I just don't want it to uh feed away because uh you know they take the you know

[02:07:32.150 --> 02:07:34.870]
they don't know they're not gonna allow you to do all your little skits and all that

[02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:38.030]
they're not they're not gonna allow us to do all our little skits we'll do a different little

[02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:42.550]
skits you know what I'm saying all right well we have to think of another form there you go good

[02:07:42.550 --> 02:07:49.310]
like to us pali what was he trying to say little skits I see by the way speaking of that on this

[02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:53.170]
side of the border meaning the side I'm on right now advocates of the same sex rights are probably

[02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:57.570]
gonna brain drain well that's on the US side while their counterparts in Canada are boasting of a gay

[02:07:57.570 --> 02:08:03.810]
game you got that partner since Canada's immigration law was changed in 2002 to recognize same

[02:08:03.810 --> 02:08:07.970]
sex partners for immigration purposes and ever growing number of gay unless being couples have

[02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:12.270]
uprooted migrated especially couples in which one partner is the US citizen and one is not

[02:08:13.930 --> 02:08:17.850]
most heterosexual foreigners and long term relationships with Americans can immigrate legally and

[02:08:17.850 --> 02:08:22.170]
stay with their loved ones by marrying but gay couples don't have that option the same sex wedding

[02:08:22.170 --> 02:08:26.450]
being performed San Francisco do them no good because immigration is a federal concern and the

[02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:31.470]
federal government doesn't of course recognize gay marriages so as gay and lesbian couples from

[02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:36.510]
around the world flock to San Francisco to marry people such as Abby Summer cast their eyes north

[02:08:37.190 --> 02:08:41.430]
the 47-year-old San Francisco resident is making plans to move to Canada with her girlfriend

[02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:45.410]
a six years a Russian in this country and a student visa for us folks planning to take off to

[02:08:45.410 --> 02:08:49.430]
Canada nothing's really changed we still have to go a set summer a business development manager

[02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:53.490]
at a software company no one should have to go through this this country is like going back in time

[02:08:53.490 --> 02:08:58.210]
it's a bunch of Puritans she says I don't want to sound really bitter but I am how well said

[02:08:58.210 --> 02:09:02.830]
this country is like going back in time it's a bunch of freaking Puritans I don't want to sound

[02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:04.670]
bitter she says but I am

[02:09:12.370 --> 02:09:15.370]
hey it's how it how it's been

[02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:25.230]
all right that's all for Neil today the parlance has to play I'm sure Neil doesn't find

[02:09:25.230 --> 02:09:32.670]
going home now two or three sport holes and here it's that close as the rest of us

[02:09:32.670 --> 02:09:38.930]
with five turn off the radio it's far less baseball it's boring and it's

[02:09:38.930 --> 02:09:46.190]
being far less baseball and such a god damn pity design for those who don't like to think

[02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:51.830]
and get excited from recocking the sink it's far less

[02:09:54.170 --> 02:09:56.110]
no one gives a f**k

[02:09:58.830 --> 02:10:05.650]
for get the entertainment the parlance want their payment contractual agreement must be

[02:10:05.650 --> 02:10:13.230]
better first despite the ratings they have to pay the bid and hopefully find an audience

[02:10:13.230 --> 02:10:20.770]
who brains are dead it's far less baseball it's time to make a sandwich far less baseball

[02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:29.090]
I'd rather hear Jim Mendes exciting as the sound of dry paint design for those with trouble

[02:10:29.090 --> 02:10:37.110]
any late it's far less baseball my pistachio smile is one spot open in the real day

[02:10:37.110 --> 02:10:43.910]
you can catch a fun and then miss one no one gives a f**k

[02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:47.630]
catch fun it a little trick off the third baseline a very good one picked up by the third

[02:10:47.630 --> 02:10:55.150]

[02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:24.430]

[02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:30.310]

their mind there are calling their book he's been out of shape I mean that's what Eddie's doing

[02:11:56.810 --> 02:12:02.790]
but you're right most nights he's he's lucky to be on two and a half hours three hours is plenty is

[02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:09.530]
what I say 10 to one mad dog 1 to 4 the hump 4 to 7 that's what I say sounds great to me let's take a
