[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.180]
Oh

[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.380]
Nobody told you about that lot of bottoming Greg's getting around I guess not

[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.800]
Nice going lightning baby

[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800]
degrees

[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.800]
You

[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.660]
There they roam, all that noise in the afternoon

[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.380]
Those who came up hope that they'll be gone soon

[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.980]
We read eyes in a scary face

[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.000]
That's the thing that we've buzzed

[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.800]
They're all over the place

[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.480]
It's the greatest I'm out in my yard

[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.000]
A falter fill up in more trash bags

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.900]
What's the greatest all over the East

[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.320]
If that's the trope, please I'm the bone

[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.860]
The infestation I'm taking these buzz

[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.880]
If I see any more I'll be crying

[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.360]
Instrumentation, calm out and spray

[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.320]
Get way to these things start dying

[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.120]
What's the obsession with hokey?

[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.400]
The lightning hit off

[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.840]
Or on a hot beach for 15 seconds

[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.220]
The lightning, or just 12 seconds away

[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.700]
And here comes the countering of Ryan's spoiler

[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.960]
They're all over the line

[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.820]
Leo Paul is heading for the net

[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.660]
He won't get a chance to play

[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.560]
The security guard is coming

[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.760]
The door is open

[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.720]
The captain is out there

[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.840]
The lightning hit off

[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.260]
The Stanley Cup was right

[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.800]
Now I'm off

[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.480]
Come on, gentlemen

[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.740]
I see we can still play that drop in as long as you have a lot of noise in the back

[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.220]
All right, I like that noise, that horn

[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.420]
Or you want to hear more?

[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.900]
Yeah

[00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.060]
I think that's the end of the horn

[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.200]
Anyway, how about those lightning?

[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.820]
How even George is whipped up about that?

[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.840]
It's a Florida thing

[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.400]
Oh, well it's really not

[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.340]
It's really not because there's no connection between South Florida and Tampa

[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.360]
But you know, we'll latch on

[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.760]
We'll latch on for a few hours

[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.500]
I was rooting for him

[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.580]
Pretty heavy duty

[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.760]
It wasn't a really good game because there were almost no shots

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.000]
But it was just so desperate

[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.520]
And they were just clutching and grabbing and tackling and holding

[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.940]
And just, it was, and then, Vini, Vini, Vini, what a play he made

[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.680]
And Ruzlan Fettetanko gets both goals and Brad Richards is the MVP

[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680]
The conspire trophy

[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.880]
Nice going boys, eh?

[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.500]
And of course the Panther organization had brought in Rick Dudley

[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.540]
Who was supposed to be the architect of the Tampa Bay franchise

[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.700]
That went from obscurity to winning the Stanley Cup

[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.200]
And the Rick Dudley, of course, won't see him no more at any rate

[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.940]
Speaking of psychedis, I don't think Florida's got psychedis, do we?

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.140]
I haven't seen any, but we have lovebugs

[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.740]
You love them

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.280]
No, you know what I'm talking about?

[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.460]
We have no seals

[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.180]
We have lovebugs in May and October

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.540]
Haven't you ever driven up like to Disney or somewhere?

[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.480]
Herbie the lovebugs?

[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.840]
In May or October, you don't know what lovebugs are?

[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.680]
I don't know

[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.520]
Oh my god, you've got to be kidding me

[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.760]
Oh my god

[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.200]
Holy moly, this man is living in Florida for the last 75 years

[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.680]
He doesn't know what lovebugs are

[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.500]
I'm sure it's been a million of them off my windshield

[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.120]
But I don't ask their names when they are so I see

[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.220]
Oh I see, so you do know what they are

[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.280]
And that's one of the horrors of driving in May and October

[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.520]
And are lovebugs anywhere else?

[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.380]
I think Florida is a Florida thing, kind of like Bufo Toads

[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.520]
Well we do have that swan

[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.200]
Thanks again to the University of Miami from bringing those a Bufo Toads in from South America

[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.600]
And some of them got off hopped out of their cartons and out when they brought the plane

[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.400]
And that's his real story

[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.380]
And they got out of the glades and they started reproducing like crazy

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.620]
That's why your dogs you die because the University of Miami

[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.500]
Speaking of dying, here's the bad news from over there

[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.700]
US soldiers serving in Baghdad died after collapsing while on guard duty

[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.160]
The American military said yesterday

[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.640]
The soldier in the first cavalry division lost consciousness

[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.480]
Stop breathing while 11 a.m. on Sunday

[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.100]
Soldiers death under investigation

[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.100]
Daytime temperatures are already over 100 degrees in Iraq every day

[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.460]
Two car bombs shook the northern Iraqi cities of Bakuba and Mosul today killing at least 14 Iraqis in one US soldier

[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.040]
At least 126 people wounded including 10 US soldiers

[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.500]
The three Italian hostages they've been released

[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.020]
Aren't you excited about that?

[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.980]
Oh yeah, it's goodness

[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.400]
Vinny Simo, the three hostages have been released, the Italians, the Agreespalls

[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.160]
On our beaded curtain, well let's give the poll results for me yesterday

[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.640]
First boy, do we have a response on this or what?

[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.240]
I have got, I'm going to tell you something

[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.840]
Tell me if you know about this one story

[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.900]
This British rock star, a morissie

[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.460]
You know who he is?

[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.880]
Sure

[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.520]
He formerly the singer of the

[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.680]
But what was it?

[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.080]
Smiths

[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.360]
Right

[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.060]
Right

[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.020]
Have you ever heard about this story?

[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.460]
You were out the mop in the floor or something while I found this

[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.220]
We'll get to it

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.380]
Got some heavy, heavy, do these stuff

[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.440]
Since 1960, who do you think was our worst present?

[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.520]
Now we did the best present between 10 and unias today for a couple of hours

[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.220]
And bubble one hands down, Bill Clinton had over 62% of vote

[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.500]
W didn't barely registered on a Richter's Fair on that poll

[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.260]
But contrair, 1791 votes on this poll which is just shattering, it's just mind boggling

[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.380]
Our worst present since the Eisenhower, Bush too, Georgia W Bush

[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.540]
1243 votes, 60, 69.4%

[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.380]
I think he's a disaster, including morissie by the way, wait till you hear his comments

[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.920]
What he did

[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.700]
Bush, 225, Carter, 191, poor Jimmy Carter, little peanut farmer from planes, Georgia

[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.420]
I think he was from Aintree myself

[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.780]
Ever see him in the Beasley's together?

[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.200]
Or the Benjo boy

[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.800]
Clinton, that's a Beasley

[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.720]
Clinton, 113, that's the Clinton vassiers, the Bubba vassiers, they're out there

[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.540]
Nixon 69, Reagan 57

[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.960]
Which again, actually it's surprising it was that high considering all the nonstop coverage that's just going on

[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.180]
Be able to get in

[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.240]
Oh brother

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.060]
And I hate to break the news here but there's nobody in that casket

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.300]
Oh no

[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.540]
Nobody in there, it's just a dummy

[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.900]
Oh no, I'm not a ghost

[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.080]
I don't see, I mean there are people still marching by but like you know what I mean?

[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.840]
And why?

[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.660]
And why are these punks, why are these kids walking by?

[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.220]
They're what the hell do they know about Ronnie Reagan?

[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.360]
They heard stories

[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.160]
They don't even have their Rolex watch and all the other, see that was the age of materialism under Reagan when the poor were a bunch of bastards who were ripping off society

[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.180]
And all the, you know, smaller government to him meant like not taking care of anybody

[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.680]
Like the Bushmeister says the haves and the have a lot

[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:47.440]
And any rate, Nixon 69, Reagan 57 is our worst LBJ39, Ford 31, Jerry Ford

[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.660]
Bush 1 had

[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.420]
And JFK only 19, of course we know that none of those people speak English

[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.680]
Now let me just say this about that

[00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.720]
As JFK would say

[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.460]
Okay

[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.800]
I've discovered here in the midst of an article that really I didn't think I would find anything about

[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.400]
I got it here for another reason, it's on our website and I'll get to it

[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.380]
Where it says cracks showing in GOP's Cuban American base

[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:18.600]
This is pretty interesting, maybe Muffin Claret saw to be paying attention to this but I doubt that they're probably playing a grandmatch in the hall

[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.680]
Sports, but the reason that the Spanish language stations are going up

[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.700]
It's not because of a built-hander conspiracy, it's not because Arbatron can't find anybody who speaks English but

[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.860]
I want you to listen to this one very short sentence

[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.740]
Okay, these two short sentences

[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.800]
Florida's population is, when you shut up and listen, Florida's population is grown by more than a million since the last presidential election

[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:50.700]
A 6.5% increase from 2000 to July 2003 that could transform the state's electorate from April 2000 to July 2002

[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.740]
Nearly half those new residents were Hispanic according to the most recent numbers from the Census Bureau

[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.560]
Did you know that?

[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.900]
See very quietly, where are these people coming from? Not from Cuba?

[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.920]
No, the South Americans

[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.720]
No, the Latin Americans, the other coming from Central America, South America

[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.340]
Sure

[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.080]
And you got Agua?

[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.780]
I've been seeing you for a while

[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:17.680]
I mentioned that, so now we understand that the reason that the Spanish language stations are having this tremendous resurgence in just soaring is because

[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:27.080]
And of course the most recent emigres, the most recent Hispanics to come in, they certainly can't expect them to be listening to the English language stations, right?

[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.480]
Right

[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.940]
So we understand that, as opposed to the old banana boat people from 44 years ago who have no excuse anymore but just are really acceptable

[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.420]
On our speaking of very acceptable Charlize Theron, she's been on her before but that picture today, that is flawless

[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.500]
That picture is flawless

[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.080]
If I were inclined, I'd be sitting here with my nose right on it

[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.880]
And you'll be inclined

[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.460]
And I've inclined

[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.320]
I see

[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:57.520]
Any mail listening to me right now or anywhere in the world who takes a look at that picture behind our beaded curtain today on theorongers.com

[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.740]
And doesn't want to be laying right there on that bed right next to Charlize when he or it or way seven in the morning

[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.840]
I find it astonishing shocking in fact all I can say is

[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.340]
You're gay

[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.780]
Yeah, I just wanted to know

[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.040]
There you go

[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.940]
Charlize Theron, I don't know, nobody needs an introduction but I did it anyway because I'm just in the habit of doing this

[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.500]
And there might be some people out there who don't know who she is but I find that very very difficult to believe

[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.240]
Born August 7th 1975 which makes her 29 this August, almost 29

[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.380]
Still 28

[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.420]
She's an African-American

[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:32.720]
She was born in Benoni South Africa grew up on a farm outside the Benoni as a child as a child

[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.520]
Let's see movies coming up next year she's already got two class action and A on fruit

[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.140]
Thie we talked about that can't wait

[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.180]
Heds in the clouds head in the clouds. Oh I roll back in the day. I might have said something about that

[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.480]
That's in post-production so that's coming out any moment head in the clouds

[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.420]
Yeah

[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.700]
I want you to say that movie right though

[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.480]
What A on

[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.800]
Flux

[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.360]
Okay

[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.580]
I'm just making fun of

[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.240]
I thought you were afraid to say it

[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.340]
Flux

[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.040]
Okay

[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.860]
I think you're gonna be in a state of flux if you say it one more time

[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.760]
Life and death of Peter Sellers made for TV movie with Bridekland

[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.720]
Oh no she played Bridekland

[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.080]
I see

[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.000]
Good choice

[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.600]
I guess

[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.620]
Monster what we know about that

[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.260]
Didn't she win the Oscar for something?

[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.160]
She won some award, keep it up

[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.280]
The Italian job

[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.960]
Waking up in Reno

[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.720]
Oh I think the Janet was pleased to hear that

[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.340]
Trapped

[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.360]
The curse of the Jade Scorpion

[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.560]
Oh she's been in a million things. She's got a long long list for a young person man. She's been around

[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.120]
She's got the legend of Bagger Vance

[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.320]
Now what was that? I feel like saw that

[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.440]
No you you

[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.100]
Luckily avoided it you would have remembered it because it's a Will Smith movie

[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.720]
Oh like I said I'm glad I missed that

[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.420]
Boy do I

[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.000]
I just thought Goal Fies will Smith

[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.680]
And he will Smith

[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.140]
I hate the ground that he walks on about

[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.200]
I don't know why I just can't stand him

[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.880]
He's such an arrogant bastard

[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.040]
See I would have said the piano I can't say that

[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.940]
Children of the Corn Three

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.140]
She was in 1995

[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.500]
Well a whole bunch of stuff

[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.980]
Well here you go she was the best actress

[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.640]
76th Annual Academy Awards

[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.780]
Golden Globe

[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.680]
She's been all over the place

[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.000]
She'll be Theron and there's a magnificent picture behind a beaten curtain

[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.040]
We're going to get to the good stuff after the break

[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.020]
Here's today's pool

[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.020]
Because yesterday the worst president cut such a tremendous response

[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.320]
How about the most over not the worst

[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.240]
But who's the most overrated movie actor or actress of all time

[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.280]
And we start with a very short list

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.100]
And we're not putting Ronnie Reagan on there

[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.240]
Because that would be almost as bad taste as the 85 articles I have today

[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.380]
Ripping him in an ass and exposing the real Reagan

[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.400]
See this idea that we all have to be

[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.960]
Oh we have to be so respectful

[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.240]
Why do we have to respect somebody that a lot of us didn't respect

[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240]
Like the way he did like poison

[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.500]
And the answer is I won't and I don't

[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.160]
They have been

[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.160]
I hope the worms are already inside that box

[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.560]
Who is the most overrated movie actor or actress of all time

[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.380]
John Wayne

[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.880]
Marilyn Monroe

[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.400]
James Dean

[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.480]
Or Robert De Niro

[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.820]
That's our short list and you can add to it as we go along

[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.700]
Now we got something big coming up today

[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.580]

Is Josh gonna be in on that?

[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.640]
No, I'm not taking the bait this time

[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.280]
Located at 204-75 Bis game boulevard

[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.360]
Stopped to pick up ticket

[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.140]
Might get a free adjustment over there

[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.300]
Might crack your back

[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.320]
Jack

My

[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.200]
Holy Makin' on!

[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.820]
This is Joe Boyle on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.740]
And you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God

[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.500]
Ooh, I do not have heard they made a switch

[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.780]
A rock pass, a new president

[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.460]
A tall man accepting this

[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.500]
I hear this word out on the street

[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.140]
Got a big surprise waiting for

[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.600]
This new government's working on a car bomb

[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.640]
This is a working on a car bomb

[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.680]
Yeah, step inside and say bye-bye

[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.020]
I have a car bomb

[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.160]
Maybe you're not limousine, this is a car bomb

[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.440]
Yeah, these loyalists will hit your heart

[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.480]
I reckon a place to be

[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.140]
If you're some political star

[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.920]
Get me your car ain't always cool

[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.920]
So have this sofa getting first

[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.500]
Don't you be a boy?

[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.980]
Get it on a car bomb

[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.220]
This is a working on a car bomb

[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.000]
Yeah, turn that key on history

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.540]

[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.820]
New president's better watch out for those car bombs

Take a look at the schedule today

[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.120]
It looks like a pristine like a real day for the first time in a long time

[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.260]
Everybody's working today

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.020]
We had Moe and the Geldie this morning

[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.980]
The big dog, the little dog, whatever

[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.460]
The blockhead dog Joe was on at 8

[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.140]
And then we got over here

[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.660]
Mad Dog at 2, the Humper at 4.0.630

[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.060]
From the heart, seminal heart rock casino

[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.440]
Where they're packing them in

[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.440]
6.30, it's Marlon on 10, Marlon's on deck

[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.660]
Marlon's at the Indian 70580 camp to the game

[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.000]
So we got everybody except the big

[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.800]
Who knows nothing about horse racing

[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.780]
And it's proud to tell you that

[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.720]
So I don't understand why he's talking about it

[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.440]
Don't talk about anything you don't know about

[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.060]
Okay, big, you clown, you silly person, you

[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.040]
Guess what we do have on our website today

[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.660]

We got the link to the Michael Moore trailer for Fahrenheit 9-11

[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.820]
So when you go to neo-rogges.com

[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.360]
When you're through perusing Charlize Theron, which might take a while

[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.260]
But when you're through with that

[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.520]
Take a look at the top of our webpage there

[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.320]
Take a look at the homepage

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.200]
And you'll see a link to Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9-11 trailer

[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.700]
I mean, I can play the audio but doesn't have the same pick as seen it

[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.060]
Especially the very ass end when he's playing golf

[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.480]
Oh, box this drive

[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.700]
Abu Garravia

[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.240]
So anyway, Manchester Music Legend Morrissey sparked controversy

[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.680]
When he announced Ronald Reagan's death live on stage during a concert

[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.380]
And then declared he wished it was George Bush who would died instead

[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.080]
Thousands of fans had Dublin, Castle and Ireland cheered

[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.380]
When the ex-smith's frontman made the announcement that the former American president

[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.980]
Who had battled with Alzheimer's disease had passed away

[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.760]
And an even bigger cheer followed when Morrissey who was no stranger to controversy

[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.220]
Then said he wished it had been the correct present George Bush who would died instead

[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.880]
Fan Tony Murray said he commented about the death of Ronald Reagan

[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.840]
And when he said he wished it was George W instead the crowd went wild

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.480]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.060]
Abu Garravia

[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.600]
They're not too well-liked

[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.360]
They're not too well-liked

They're not too well-liked

[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.580]
They're not too well-liked

[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.280]
lifestyle,我们 animations speak hour for hour for day everything that comes from the words that come with sense and romanism arise.

[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.560]
Where at war there's no doubt about it what I don't know anymore is just who the enemy might be since one troubled White House aid

[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:37.100]
We seem to spend more time trying to destroy John Kerry than Al Qaeda and our enemies list just keeps growing and growing

[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.740]
Aid say the president gets hung up on minor details micro managing to the extreme while ignoring the bigger picture

[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.800]
He'll spend hours personally reviewing and approving every attack and against his democratic

[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.960]
Ad against his democratic opponent and then kiss off a meeting on economic issues

[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:59.400]
This is what's killing us on a rack one aid says we lost focus the president got hung up on the weapons of mass destruction and an

[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.320]
Unproven link to Al Qaeda we could have found other justifiable reasons for the war but the president insisted the focus

[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.480]
They on those two tenuous items

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.540]
Aides who raised questions quickly find themselves shut out of access to the president or other top advisors among top officials

[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.100]
Bush's inner circle is shrinking

[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:21.040]
Secretary of State Powell has fallen out of favor because of his growing doubts about the administrations who are against Iraq

[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.580]
The presidents abrupt dismissal of C.I. director George tenant Wednesday night is aides saying example of how he works

[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.240]
Tenant wanted to quit last year, but the president got his back up and wouldn't hear of it says an aid

[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.900]
That would have been the opportune time to make the change not in the middle of an election campaign

[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.460]
But when the director challenged the president during the meeting Wednesday the president cut him off by saying that's it

[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.200]
George I cannot abide this loyalty. I want your resignation and I want it now

[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.140]
Tenant was allowed to resign voluntarily and Bush informed his shocked staff of the decision Thursday morning

[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.020]
One aides says the president actually described the decision as God's will

[00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.980]
God may also be the reason attorney general John Ascroft administration is lightning rod because of his

[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.560]
Questionable actions that critics argue threatened freedom is granted by the Constitution remains part of the power elite

[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.680]
West Wing staffers call Bush and Ascroft the Blues Brothers because they're on a mission from God

[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.600]
The attorney general is tight with the president because of religion says one a they both believe any action is justifiable in the name of God

[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:25.860]
But the president who says he rules at the b-s of God can also tongue-lash those he perceives as this loyal calling them effing

[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:33.380]
Holes in front of the other staff be raiding one cabinet official in front of others and labeling anyone to disagree with him on pay

[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.660]
Fuyatech or anti-American that was effing

[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.900]
Holes the mood here is that we're under siege. There's no doubt about it says one trouble later admits

[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:46.000]
He's looking for work elsewhere and this administration. You don't have to wear a turbiner speak far see to be an enemy of the US

[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.200]
All you have to do is disagree with the president

[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.840]
I do like that a little bit unsettling ain't it when you say killing a little bit on the disturbing side

[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.500]
I would say

[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.420]
Yeah

[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:04.280]
I'm like that huh on the disturbed side. Yeah a little under the strife see a air what's his name?

[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.420]
Josh hasn't written Robert the hero on there yet which is your choice. Oh, I forgot to tell him it's my bad

[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.680]
Oh, well, I wrote the list there. He should have been a hop and right on it man

[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.300]
He should have been right on the edge of the seat. It's either that or after that carer practical in one of the others your choice

[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:26.000]
So far 25 votes who is the most overrated movie actor actress of all time James Dean 11 John Wayne 9 Merlin Merlin Merlin Merlin

[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.600]
Merlin Merlin. Oh, that's the only three honor because I'm Ramlin, but I think it was pretty important Ramlin stuff so far

[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:38.540]
And there's only one call anyway WQ I am yeah, it takes the narrow off the list in replacement with Kevin Costner Kevin Costner is good

[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.100]
Okay, well, what do you mean we take him off the list? We're not taking him off the list. I told you I'd get some crap

[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.060]
He was great in his time, but lately

[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.460]
He's made a lot of crap and he's become kind of like like you said a parody of himself

[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.780]
So we're adding Kevin Costner on here. I'm gonna change my vote. God. That's a good one

[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.920]
No, I can't stand Kevin Costner. He's just so boring man. He's just he's terminal. He's kind of like the

[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:07.160]
Dave Van Boring of the silver screen. He should stick to directing and not be in his own movies. Who Dave Van Boring? Yeah

Oh hello how it's there now one secret government agency

[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.500]
Welcome to the federal community

[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.140]
It was like a bad black man

[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:39.120]
Just stand and get stabbed you must put your hands on the pants of the woman

[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.740]
Never done it

[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.540]
No band from a radio near you well guess what here's some good news

[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:04.420]
Janet Jackson's nipple slip and bono is a word show exploits notwithstanding the prospects for any serious legislation clamping down on broadcast and Z

[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.800]
Decency seem to be fading all right

[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:14.740]
While the House of Representatives in March passed a bill by a photo 391 to 22 a staggering vote that would greatly increase the financial penalties on

[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:21.340]
Broadcasters found to have violated so-called standards of decency the Senate after some early blustering seem to be losing interest

[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:27.100]
According to the New York Times a measure approved by the Senate Commerce Committee is yet to be scheduled for discussion by the full body

[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:35.620]
One reason for this delay and bringing the bill to the Senate floor is the slim majority held by Republicans who may not want to invest too much political capital on such a divisive issue

[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.760]
Additionally the Senate version of the anti-indecency legislation contains some highly

[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:47.040]
controversial provisions including one that would seek to curb violent content on television not just sex and swearing that the House bill explicitly avoided

[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:54.780]
Plus the issue of the war in Iraq especially the prisoner abuse scandal Abu Garrabe has overshadowed the Super Bowl halftime show

[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.180]
There's some concern on Capitol Hill that politicians who push too hard on the decency issue

[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.780]
May's Ray risk appearing to have their priorities out of whack the time said no kidding no Schmidt

[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:09.660]
This looks like a cheap date to me observed Charles Cook the editor of the Cook Political Report a nonpartisan political newsletter

[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.600]
You come out for mother to apple pie in decency and you know it's not going anywhere

[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.560]
Well put right

[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.260]
Who wants to come off for indecency for a spot for all those terrible things all those words?

[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.340]
Yeah, Phil

[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:28.500]
Gene Hackman somebody says they see it's not important whether we agree or disagree because a lot of these suckers for a poll today

[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.460]
Will disagree with but Gene Hackman I'd like Gene Hackman a lot

[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.560]
I think he's one of the great actors of all time. Oh, do I know I might be a moron for example

[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:42.640]
What's important is that we spend five minutes arguing about each and every entry? No, I don't have five minutes to argue about each year

[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.000]
I got too many fish to fry today. I got a lot of him

[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.240]
You do these stuff a lot of reading to do it's a good thing that my blood sugar was nice and low this morning

[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:56.860]
And I'm very articulate and my tongue is not wrapped around the corners of my teeth et cetera you have those days, you know

[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:03.560]
Sure, oh, it's a good there. You got a sore James Dean's got 21. No, I don't have a sore. Maybe you have a sore

[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.920]
It sounds like a chirpy to me sometimes

[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:12.720]
Sounds like oral syphilis to me James Dean 21 John Wayne 16 Maryland Monroe 11

[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:20.200]
Kevin Coste or nine and Robert De Niro's got one only one and that was your vote right right also blended on George

[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.160]
If you were pissed off about Robert De Niro being on list of people love him

[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.120]
Yeah, I understand the point in fact

[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.260]
I would also put on there and people are get really crazy about this

[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.720]
But if you want to put on people who become parodies in themselves and have done anything good in a long time

[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.400]
How about Al Pacino, right?

[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.580]
I'm not gonna say Al Pacino. Well, I just did it to say Robert De Niro. I'll say Al Pacino, okay?

[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.220]
Oh my god. No, that's what I'm saying

[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:53.080]
In fact, I think it started with that set of a woman crap. Oh, man

[00:26:53.080 --> 00:27:00.180]
That I think you need to see that someday just to appreciate how bad it is if it's raining on a Saturday and nothing else is on

[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.540]
Oh, yeah, it's like the end of the world or something like that

[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.180]
Now what what is this?

[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:11.140]
Florida's Latino vote in 2004 somebody just fact in some cool there everybody's got a pool

[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.700]
So to speak can I say that anymore?

[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.680]
Everybody's got a

[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.780]
Bush and Florida partly and respond what is NDN? I don't know what that is

[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:27.360]
Huh, I don't know. Oh, well, I would help the end the end is great Spanish language and campaign partly response to shifting demographics

[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.800]
Cubans born in Cuba

[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.800]
Bush 80 Carrie 12 Cubans born in the US Bush 33 Carrie 54

[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.980]
Well, what kind of a poll is that you're only talking about the 150 people?

[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.640]
What I got my poll is that

[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.920]
Jesus god almighty percentages are it does have the thing about population growing? Huh?

[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:54.120]
Are those not percentages listed there? Oh, I see well, it doesn't say that it doesn't I just thought that this was a little like I said

[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.580]
This is a great fact. Thank you so much. I don't know

[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.920]
It's just the way it's written. I mean look at it. You see what I'm saying looks like those are numbers

[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.760]
If it will look like percentages Cuban now now it has some great significance like I said

[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:12.640]
Cubans born in Cuba bush 80% carry 12% what doesn't it say that for Christ's and Cubans born in the US Bush 33%

[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.880]
Carrie 54%

[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.760]
Now that's the sea

[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.280]
Times are a change in

[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.920]
This is the programming the brainwashing ain't taken ain't hold well

[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.480]
That's because the people have come from Latin America. They are part of that

[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.040]
Fidero the all of that crap, you know come on Easter. That's all in the past. They don't care about these

[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.180]
They remember Nicaragua. I guarantee if you took a poll in Latin America about Ronald Reagan

[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:36.100]
They wouldn't be watching so enthusiast get a moisture. Yeah

[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.200]
Take a poll down and Grenada see how they're doing with the old hand Grenada

[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.000]
Florida's population has got the same line and here's grown more than a million since last election

I think that that puts me right over the edge right now. Okay. I think that convinces me format change

[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:03.760]
It's the first part that keeps going on in English language spot. That's bad. Well, I'll get back to it

[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.200]

So lead story thanks eric eric found it. I have no idea how he founded especially with a stomach like that, but he found it

[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.600]
But in any way in fact, here's another one Bush knew about leak of CIA operatives name

[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.480]
We'll get to that too also from capital hill blue

[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.260]
We better put a link to that website on there. You know it. I don't want to I don't want to create too much work

[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.100]
Now I don't want to push him a little bit too far

[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.620]

He had a pot to a PN. Well as a matter of fact Josh Beckett will be over before the game

[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:21.700]
Cano Reeves despised by many. I still say he was really good as different than that one movie that I can never think of the name

[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.340]
See that's what I see it's not a question of just getting old

[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.320]
That's a big part of it the Alzheimer's Ronnie, but it's also the you've seen so many of these damn right

[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.940]
And who can keep one separate from the other they start to just like that thing about Sigourney weaver and alien

[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:39.320]
I still say they I still say that damn thing came pop it out of her, you know and the alien too

[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.460]
Maybe I'm thinking of a different movie. Maybe it was like Debbie does Dallas. I'm thinking of

[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.840]
21 before 11

[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.000]
How's it coming so far? We didn't got a few names on there. It's building. We're building it nice and slow

[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.520]
Paul building is boring. Come on. You can do a pali pull the building is boring. He'll be here

[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.380]
He's one of my all-time favorites

[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.780]

Kevin Costner 18 Miriland Monroe 60 the most overrated actor actress of all-time movie actress these we have said movie you notice

[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.680]
Robert's an arrow one not yet for Gene Hackman El Pacino, Julia Roberts, a cano Reeves

[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.300]
Reason I said movie actor actress is because that leaves that are open for doing like TV to kind of a person right see

[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.440]
Oh, but what if they were a both

[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:32.140]
20 before 11 at 560 that it looked no matter what we do, you know, there's always going to oh gee

[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.620]
Yeah, all the nitpickers other like yesterday. We had like two or three nitpickers well technically, you know

[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:42.220]
And how come you didn't understand those were percentages on that pull before you moron because I'm that stupid jerk, okay

[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.760]
I'm a moron. I'm an idiot. I'm a fool

[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:50.280]
Okay radio like we have time to discuss and dissect and figure out what our vast QAM staff

[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:56.160]
Sports nerds including the big oh admits you don't know nothing about horse racing, but just likes to open up a big gap

[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.440]
I never I never turn this thing on at night when I'm in here

[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.360]
sending their stories on the website

[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:08.280]
But I happened to open it up last night the pot at about 10-dil-10 and there was the big oh and some

[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:14.660]
Call or some ask kisser was on her oh and they were ripping you all day because of the stupid things you said about the horse racing

[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.440]
You don't know anything about you admitting and I know nothing about horse racing and blah blah blah

[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:24.340]
But when it comes to football and the guy was just licking and licking and licking one of I said most callers the talk shows

[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.120]
All they want to do is either one thing and grace you it themselves or take a cheap shot

[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.840]
That's all one of the other everything else is in between in the middle

[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.520]
But that's the overwhelming majority of people are called these stupid ass talk shows is either to let oh suck up

[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.960]
Oh, you're the greatest thing I ever heard or you suck, you know, what is something like that

[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.080]
When quite frankly, I would have rather heard a call or say to Orlando you suck big terrible. You know nothing

[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.040]
Your horse's ass. Put him in a lot more fun

[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.860]
Anyway, let me tell you about Charles Alfier

[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.560]
It's no fun when your hair starts falling out some guys in the early 20s start losing it like Tom Brady for example

[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.720]
He may have two championship rings on his fingers, but he ain't got too much hair on his head

[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.780]
Although he can probably afford to go to Chuck Alphear

[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.560]
I would think you don't have to be a millionaire to do that for more than 35 years

[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.680]
Charlie's been a top-bottom name in the business of getting hair back on your head

[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.640]
He's been on good morning America the today show CBS morning news

[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.760]
In fact, when I think of Tom Brady the word head immediately comes into my mind

[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:21.440]
Charlie's got the most amazing natural hair line system you'll find anywhere the most critical area of any hair system is that

[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.320]
Hair line and Charlie's new skin like hair system looks like the real thing

[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.620]
It's a hundred percent undetectable and Charlie gives you this guarantee tries her system for

[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:33.960]
To me please and after a month if you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells if you're not getting more action

[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.120]
Then you can even handle return it for a full refund no problem at all

[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.420]
Charlie also services and repairs existing hair systems including shampoo and trim

[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:47.280]
So not to lay call Charlie today and look better and younger than you ever dreamed you could again forget about those dangerous pills

[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.460]
And all these other schlock mice do so trying to pedal you a big song in advance

[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.420]

That's the only room to run

[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.620]
I'm here in the only

It's a great

[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.020]

[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.540]
WQM

[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.480]
I've got some time

[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.020]
On a cloud in there

[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.200]
But it's cold outside

[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.640]
I've got the book there

[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:42.540]
ah

[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:53.400]
Every week on a i that's already had it guy named John Steven

[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.940]
My name is John Steven

[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:02.640]
Makes every dog in cat how old cuz he's so flat for John Steven

[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.300]
My name is John Steven

[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:10.380]
Every no that comes out his throat in the note they wrote why the hell is

[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.620]
He's still there

[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.480]
I'm a crewman

[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:20.860]
Every song seems an hour long every two days wrong he's so bad at tonight man

[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.680]
Oh I'm the other Steven

[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.840]
He's so pale pasty white he's transparent at night that John Steven

[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.540]
Oh I'm the other Steven

[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:37.880]
He can't sing he can't dance there's no freaking way he should

[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.220]
But

[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:48.060]
That week after week there's that carats up geek still singing

[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.620]
Appreciate it

[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:57.040]
Could take years cuz my poor bleeding is still ringing

[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:06.760]
1047 at 560 WQM most overrated actor somebody says rock Hudson he died by the way in 1985. I looked it up

[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.820]
Because I wanted to find out when Reagan was finally able to break his silence on AIDS and could actually bring himself to say something

[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:18.560]
1985 it was an office. Let's see since January of 81 it took him four and a half years

[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.880]
For before he could finally even utter the word

[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:26.340]
Well one of his people from Hollywood died for maids all of a sudden he became this great well kind of like marginal

[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.840]
And most overrated actress rat kel Welch okay. We're talking about acting and building. I would assume

[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.620]
Right correct acting

[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.460]
Speaking of actors bad actors Bush knew about leak of CIA operatives name

[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.920]
Also from capital to hill blue

[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:49.320]
Witnesses told a federal grand jury president George W Bush knew about and took no action to stop the release of a covert CIA

[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.160]
operatives named a would journalist and then attempted to discredit or husband a critic of administration policy in Iraq

[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.900]
Their damning testimony is prompted Bush to contact an outside lawyer for legal advice because evidence

[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.780]
Increasingly points to his involvement in the leak of covert CIA operative

[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.180]
Valerie claims name to sink syndicated commons Robert Novak

[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:11.020]
This is right in line with that first article we had from our capital hills blue

[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:17.180]
You know who before the moves suggested the president anticipates being questioned by prosecutors sources

[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.240]
Say grand jury witnesses have implicated the president and his top advisor Carl Rowe

[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:27.140]
That sounds like a very distinct violation of law to me a grotesque violation of law

[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.240]
It sounds like impeachment all over again

[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:36.480]
Doesn't it yeah white house spokesman however dismissed the hiring of outside counsel as a routine precaution

[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.620]
The president has made it very clear he wants everyone to cooperate fully with the investigation

[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.020]
That would include himself white house

[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.640]
McClellan said Wednesday night he confirmed that Bush had contacted Washington attorney Jim Sharp

[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:55.440]
In the event the president needs advice expecting probably would retain him a clone said there's no indication Bush has been questioned yet

[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:02.140]
A federal grand jury is quite the numerous White House administration officials to learn who leaked the name of CIA operative claim

[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.920]
wife of former ambassador Joseph Wilson to the news media

[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.500]
Wilson is charged that officials made the disclosure in an effort to discredit him

[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:12.600]
Bush has been an outspoken critic of leaks saying they can be very damaging

[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.720]
But has expressed doubt that the government's

[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.080]
Investigational pinpoint who is responsible while Bush has said he welcomed the leak investigation

[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.440]
It's been an awkward development for president who promised to bring integrity and leadership to the White House

[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.200]
After years of Republican criticism and investigation of the Clinton administration for those jobs

[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.060]
Even though he was and has a White House counsel Bush is dependent on the outside lawyers for private matters

[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:40.280]
A memo distributed to the staff last year reminded officials that the counsel's office works solely for the president and his official capacity

[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.380]
And is not a private attorney for anyone

[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.220]
It speaks for itself that the president initially claimed he wanted to get to the bottom of this

[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.620]
But now he suddenly retained the lawyer said

[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.420]
General Cabrera spokesman for the Democratic National Committee

[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.740]
Bush shouldn't drag the country through grand juries and legal maneuvering president

[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:58.540]
Bush should come forward with what he knows and come clean to the American people

[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.740]
Plane was first identified by syndicated commas and tv commentator Novak and a calm last July

[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.580]
Novak said his information came from administration sources

[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.300]
Wilson as said he believes his wife's name was leaked because of his criticism of Bush administration claims

[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:16.120]
That a racket tried to obtain uranium from Niger which Wilson investigated for the CIA and found out to be untrue

[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.420]
This closure of an undercover officer's identity can be a federal crime

[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:25.160]
The grand jury asserted from witnesses and come through the thousands of pages of documents turned over by the White House

[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.700]
But we turn no indictments yet

[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:33.280]
The probe is being handled by Chicago U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald to put it after Attorney General John Ascroft stepped aside

[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.520]
From the case because of his political ties to the White House and God

[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.400]
Wilson suggested in a book that the leaker was Lewis Scooter Libby

[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.840]
Chief of Staff device president Cheney

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.920]
Oh my God

[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.080]
But Wilson's book the politics of truth gave no conclusive evidence for the claim

[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.240]
The White House denied the claim and accused Wilson of seeking to bolster the campaign to John Curie

[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.400]
for whom he's acted as a foreign policy adviser

[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.580]
Wilson also said his possible leak came from Elliott Abrams

[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:03.160]
A figure in the Reagan administration around contra affair and now a member of Bush's national security council

[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.500]
Oh and speaking of those people from back in the Reagan days

[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.540]
They had the hoots but a put that

[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.940]
Piece of crap Paul Wolfowitz on there

[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:15.120]
And he was waxing Elkman about his days when he was doing dirty needs for the Reagan crowd

[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.280]
Paul Wolfowitz how do you like that?

[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.060]
Enough to make me gag

[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:26.700]
And Roe Bush's chief political adviser may have circulated information about Wilson and claim in the administration and yield conservative circles

[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.200]
Even if Roe was not himself the leaker Wilson wrote

[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.540]
Another possibility is that two lower level officials in Cheney's office John Hannah or David Wormsir

[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.660]
Rhymes with Mumsir

[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:41.560]
Leake claims identity at the behest of higher ups to keep their fingerprints off the crime bills and speculated

[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:45.640]
Sources with the investigation's evidence points to Roe of approving release of the leak

[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.220]
Oh let's ask Beckett know what time it's happening

[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.400]
The end of their investigation suggests the person knew about Roe's actions

[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.160]
But to no action to stop release a claim is there which makes him of course a guilty party

[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.600]
And impeachable offense a high crime a federal crime how do you like that?

[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.560]
I just mentioned these things in passing

[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:12.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T Inforizer Marlos line who is the most overrated movie actor actress of all time

[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.460]
That's our poll question today on the Oranges.com along with the lovely Charlize Thunon

[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.920]
And they've linked to a Michael Morris Fahrenheit 9 11 movie trailer which is coming out. Don't forget soon

[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.240]

[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:41.260]
He was great in the can mute neither make no mistake about it right excellent African Queen wasn't that all the way out

[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:46.020]
In fact Greg said that if he could borrow those steel balls he might kind of like emulate him

[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:50.020]
Running around the building trying to find out who hit the strawberries who the mole is you know

[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.800]
He's what we've already seen him do some of those things

[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.460]
Somebody QAM hello

You sound fine to me. I don't hear any of that

[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:09.940]
I'm having a hard time hearing you the the level on the on the phone. What do you got for us, Pally?

[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:16.160]
Okay, I have a question about yesterday's poll. What were the results because I need to laugh this morning

[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.560]
What were the results? Bush got 69.4%

[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.260]
There you go

[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.300]
He got a little chuckle out of that no extra charge

[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:33.920]
All right, that was it. I see you're knocking the callers. That was good. I get I did a pubic service for that guy

[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.180]
We have a crap that's going on in the world all the depressing stuff going on around us with smarty Jones getting nose

[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.340]
out there in a billmont

[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.020]
We have to have something that we can be positive about that we can wrap our legs around and say hey

[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.740]
This is really great and he got a good chuckle out of it. Not a big chuckle like that

[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.580]
Like that. I like him. I maybe he might have liked this too

[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.880]
MTV to cut shot of Eminem exposing back home his rear

[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:00.780]
This is part of the atmosphere. I can't show no rear

[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.400]
Especially if you're queer while he's queer we hope

[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.840]
Because we don't want him at least me

[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.200]
Eminem's moon has been eclipsed is what it says here

[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.500]
MTV plans to cut a shot of the rapper exposing his rear end

[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:19.380]
To the audience at the 2004 movie awards when the show is broadcast this Thursday 9 p.m

[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.860]
A network representative confirmed MTV already had enough problem

In a parody of Guns n' Roses singer Axel Rose

[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.580]
He repeatedly groped and flashed a studded

[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.120]
Cod piece in front of the cameras. Oh, he stole that from clock or orange

[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.740]
Okay, yeah

[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:52.680]
He repeatedly groped and flashed a studded Cod piece in front of the cameras and a thousand of people in the live audience toward the end of the performance

[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.880]
He pulled out his trousers and flashed his bare

[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.760]
ass at the audience

[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:01.720]
Represented for MTV which was planned for producing. See here it is Janet Jackson Super Bowl

halftime performance

[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:07.960]
Immediately said on a Eminem's act would be sanitized for broadcast possibly by blurring out his

[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:08.820]
Ass

[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.160]
Ultimately the producers chose to edit out his rear altogether network set on Monday

[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:17.100]
Eminem's representatives don't immediately be turned to call for comment when asked by the

[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.100]
AP

[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:19.880]
How do you like that?

[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:26.220]

150

[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.280]
Huh?

[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.660]
Is that it? Yeah, unless you're at least 150 years old we can't show your ass naked on TV

[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.200]
So if you're like under the edge of uh, well, but where's the cutoff?

[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.060]
You're going from the wrong angle. Oh, sorry. I understand the wrong end from the wrong

[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.000]
From the ass end

[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:03.760]
In other words up to up to what age can you still show the ass before you'd start deciding that it may be a little bit over the line

[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.020]
Comes reasonable to me diapers

Or what we could teach English as a second language

[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.860]
Right because so I thought it is a second language

[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.640]
Up here and then yet. It's just a third language

[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:19.020]

Now worse who's the most overrated movie actor actress of all time John Wayne

[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.680]
That was my vote and he's leading 44 for the Duke couldn't act as wet of a paper sack

[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:32.620]
There's only one group of people in America who are just obsessed with John Wayne red next the Duke

[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.020]
I thought you were going to say Republicans red next while is there a difference?

[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.880]
No red next

[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:45.480]
John Wayne 44 James Dean 44 he only made three freaking movies for crying out loud. They made him in like a a big cult hero. What's that all about

[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.060]
Plus he smelled bad

[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:54.580]
Kevin Costner 38. Yeah, he was I guess James Dean didn't use the soap a lot because he was afraid he'd drop it

[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.800]
Oh speaking of that can't erase 27

[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:03.100]
Maryland Monroe 25 Julia Roberts 15 and then way down to Al Pacino's got a pair

[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:07.700]

Come in a QA him. Hello. Very uncle Neil. Yes sir. I'd say John Wayne because every movie is any

[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.580]
Talk the same even as Genghis Khan

[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.240]
The Duke

[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.900]
Genghis Khan he talked like that the Duke he's a piece of crap. He's dead though so we can't get to the Duke no more

[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.580]
You know in fact I think of the Duke often take around a Reagan mm-hmm

[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:50.180]
Lot of similarities a lot of similarities there be well Duke wasn't in big-grade movies

[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.480]
He was in the you know bigger movies, but he couldn't write it all and

[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:58.080]
Right-wing about his right-wing is you can get state of mind the whole deal

[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.420]
Never saw him at the Ransfield House. That'd make you a him. Hello

[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:07.100]
How you doing then? Okay, I bet what about Ronald Reagan? He's a pretty bad actor

[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:12.540]
Yeah, but he was never rated good actor by anybody see the overrated is the question but nice try and not only that

[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:16.580]
Don't don't be knocking out poor Ronnie while everybody look at that. There's the coffin right now

[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.740]
Don't knock on the bottom legacy that he left behind instead of a path to the American future

[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:26.440]
You know something that's gonna affect my life. Oh, what a joke. What a freaking joke

[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:30.200]
What are these punks doing out there other parents must have dragged him along where these young punks?

[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:36.440]
Let's see he was president from 80 to 88. Okay. That's like 16 years as 88 right and here's a punk

[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:41.560]
It's like 25 years old. What does he know about Ronald Reagan in his legacy? Okay? You idiots you morons you

[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:45.800]
Quizlings. This is so sad. It's the flamingo effect one all over again

[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:49.740]
Like when they blow to whistle at highly or they used to be for Bernadier destroyed the track

[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:54.620]
They used to blow to whistle now higher the flamingos would all go step over because they knew it was speeding time

[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:59.120]
It's marching time maybe put on them boots and goose step come on

[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.140]
We can do it. That's it

[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.800]
My god. What is wrong with people

[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:09.560]
But he was a movie actor and he talked he was very glib, you know and see mommy

[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.820]
Is it not time yet mommy

[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:18.240]
567 the only thing that he ever said and this is the freaking truth that made any sense to me was

[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.880]
Rick Wiley is an invisible that I would have to agree with

[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:26.780]
And finally yesterday we photoshow George came out of the closet admitted that rick Rowley was a jerk

[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.740]
Somebody QA him. Hello. Yes. I wonder how to name

[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:36.780]
Yes, sir. Mr. Elvis Presley Elvis Presley. Boy, he made some pretty crappy movies wasn't oh my god

[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.120]
The crap next time I feel okay. See him do who I

[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.180]
Elvis of a gang

[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.480]
You're unfair to Elvis. I want to say that again. No, it was see the one thing is music in in its time

[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.800]
His music was fine to music out of its time in its time when you listen to me

[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.020]
But his movies even in their time they still suck they were brutal

[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.800]
So we're so why and whatever else all and they're all the same, you know, they're all crap

[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.700]
So we'll put Elvis on there the king which will give you a chance to bash Elvis a little bit

[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.840]
All you relentless Elvis that uh basher's out there. Oh, there's

[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.580]
Those alvash bashers

[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.920]
Let's go to Graceland. Yeah, but what's going on with the Reagan with the casket right now

[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.040]
And it's the same as the people that slumped the Graceland. I don't see any difference at all

[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.640]
The hero worshipers. Oh gosh, Elvis

[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.040]
Those people we need we need to be protected from those people

[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:30.140]
And you'd say well, what about the religious notes? I don't see much difference because it's the same the same concept

[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:34.620]
It's just no and look can I ask your question since you were a born a Catholic for about five minutes

[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.060]
And then we went through all the other crap until other nine

[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:41.780]
The Catholic part of it is how many times you need to cross yourself to make sure you've done the right thing

[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.660]
But third man

[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.240]
I mean if I have to see Arnold and Maria Schreiber crossing themselves at the casket is they like

[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.800]
Waddled away. What was that? Did you see that? No

[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.480]
She must across to some about a half a dozen times. I guess just to make sure

[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.960]
Well, I asked bitch. I got the explanation as far as Catholics go. Yeah, because it's all you know

[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.320]
Pergatory and deeds in a matter of degrees with them

[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.600]
So the more you cross yourself the less time you spend in purgatory. Oh, you're like pudge right?

[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.080]
Regulate well, that's a good point. He crossed himself a line to get out of Florida. That's where they say

[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.920]
But then he wound up in Detroit. So close to show you

[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.980]
Maybe cross it's not what you ask for because you might just get it. You don't criss cross

[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.800]
Pudge. Oh, I can't stand criss crossed WQA. I'm hello

[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:30.660]
Hey now. Yes, sir. Could I add mel Gibson to your poll please? Mel Gibson is fan. You can show you don't have to ask me man

[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.780]
I'd put him right there on top

[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.800]
Thank you so much mel Gibson

[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.040]
That's all I got one word for him if that's a word

[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.500]
Oh speaking of a Josh stands stupid things. Now. This is a guy really like

[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:48.820]
But you know every why do we have to be politically correct poor bill par cells you got to sympathize with the fat guys right?

[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.760]
Right Josh? Yeah, sure. No, nobody don't like bill par cells. Do they?

[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.020]
Now everybody likes you. He's a likeable guy

[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:02.400]
But he apologized Monday for calling the surprise plays used in practice jack plays. Simply remark was inappropriate

[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:09.880]
Okay, the Dallas Cowboys coach was talking to reporters at the team's mini camp about how his quarterback's coach and defensive coordinator

[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.340]
Try to walk do each other when he made the comment and a pair of reference to Japan's

[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.620]
1941 sneak attack on Pearl Harbor

[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:19.980]
You got to keep an eye on those two because they're going to try to get the upper hand par cell set about Sean Peyton in my

[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:20.280]
Zimmer

[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.720]
Mike wants to defense to do well and Sean he's going to have a few no disrespect for the Orioles

[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.660]
But we call jack plays okay surprise things

[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:32.100]
Oh, I mean is that a big deal? Why does everybody have to be politically correct even

[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:36.840]
Junior say I would his faggot comment who cares? I mean do we even know if anybody complained about that line?

[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.400]
Well, I'm gonna get to that. Well relaxed. All right

[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.680]
Akira Kubo Moshima a big party

[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.740]
Akira Kubo Shima the editor of Japan's American football magazine was in the room

[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.520]
But said he wasn't offended don't believe some people would be

[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:53.320]
He also said he was surprised more by the reaction of other reporters than the comment

[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:57.060]
There's a lot of chance for somebody to feel offended. He said to me. It was no big deal

[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.000]
So we had the right altitude right no big deal

[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.080]
No, thank I heard from now. They're going to call them Indian plays

[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:08.020]
Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple apologized on behalf of the organization in Parcel's later issued a statement

[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.280]
I made a very inappropriate reference and all the way

[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:16.280]
Prefaced it with a remark. No disrespect anyone intended it was still on call for an inconsiderate Parcel said for that

[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:21.700]
I apologize anyone who may have been offended he's a apologizing just like Arnold apologize for all those women that he

[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:26.540]
Groped he's gonna investigate it. Oh he changes mind. He's not gonna investigate it after all because now he's determined into the governor

[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:33.900]
Fact the whole thing with Reagan and Arnold being there. It's so I see such stark scary similarities, you know

[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.760]
Although at least the one thing with Arnold is at least so far

[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:45.200]
He isn't having his strings controlled by the ultra right wing Republicans far as we can see like Reagan was boy

[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:51.320]
He was he was there darling man. He was the beginning of what we got now. He was the beginning of the fascist era in America

[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:57.960]
But you can't say that. Oh just wait till I get these 85,000 articles here ripen a Reagan ass

[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.640]
And I'm gonna read each and every single one of them all right these 50,000 of them telling you know

[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.340]
Setting the record straight so that people like these punks that are out there at the casket because it's a happening

[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:13.040]
It's something to do with this good task. It. Let's go see the casket, you know what kind of crap is that

[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.660]
WQ a.m. Hello

Jesus Christ Neil. Yes, sir. 35 minutes on hold. Okay. You are three if I meant some hole. How can you been a hold?

[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:36.360]
What do you got? Yeah, I don't know if you've heard it in your mind. It's me. But if you heard about those those calls

[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:42.760]
I got a call yesterday at home and I answered it said unknown number I answered anyway and it was a recording

[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.960]
This is John Kerry

[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.580]
You know asking if you'll make a contribution to the campaign press one and press two and then press three was

[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.060]
You know you're gonna vote for us. I just press three and then I hung up

[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:00.540]
But I never seen a call or heard of something like that where they did like telemarketing

[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.220]
President well, I guess you've been blessed

[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.120]
Anyway

[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.800]
On the poor thing

[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:10.120]
Anybody who would say Gene Hackman or Robert De Niro or or a radio

[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:15.200]
But food. Even though I love George and every other way but he's a phone at times he can be a buffoon

[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.320]
We can all be buffoons at times and he's a little buffooner

[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:23.140]
I understand I understand what he's saying because I agree with him that De Niro in the last many years now

[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.740]
He's done this he's always the same, you know, he does a lot of crap than real garbage

[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.240]
No, I disagree

[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.700]
No, for me the poll has been forward

[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.620]
Oh, I like Harrison Ford now

[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.460]
Overrated okay, thanks. I know okay vote five times. Please I disagree here, but

[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.940]
Well, I had a two but then this is their opinion

[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:51.080]
Don't put on there. This is great. I love this pool. Yeah, who is the most he can disagree with Robert De Niro

[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.780]
I can disagree with the Harrison I agree with Robert De Niro

[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:58.440]
I have it to be I mean back in the up on this one which I really do because it's more fun not to but it just

[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.120]
You know, I understand what you say just like I'm saying patino

[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.420]
Al patino's made so many great movies, but on the other hand

[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:09.840]
He's made a lot and not just not just recently his he made stickers but cruising for example

[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.620]
What kind of a pilot Schmidt was that?

[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:18.220]
Gate and he admitted later on after he made the movie that he was sorry that he got sucked into that think if I can say that

[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:23.400]
He just was garbage. Yeah, it was and it was a it was a tool if I can say that of

[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.300]
The enormous hatred and the stereotype, but at any rate that was garbage

[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.920]
But and he's made what was the one I was telling you about that I saw a couple of months ago here

[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.220]
I that I'd never seen before the streets in New York or something like that. What was that? Oh, no?

[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:40.580]
Oh my god, he was doing Godfather 3 all over again

[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:46.600]
And always shouting it always gonna. I mean of course injustice for all was great. Mm-hmm phenomenal

[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.940]
Spectacular the Godfather's parts one through a hundred do it day

[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.920]
I think they ought to fear you

[00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:02.180]
Right, but when you see that when you see sentable when he and that's the one he gets the Oscar for that close to show you how screwed up that whole deal is

[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.980]
He makes all these great movies never gets the award. He makes a piece of crap like the scent of a woman

[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.380]
Which is just embarrassing. I always wanted to see a blind guy grabbing a Ferrari through the streets in New York

[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:13.900]
Wow

[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:21.120]

Now here is a fax that I really appreciate from Chip who says and didn't I tell you?

[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:56.240]
Yeah.

[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.300]
And George gets all the credit I guess because you find a picture right?

[01:03:59.540 --> 01:03:59.700]
Right.

[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:04.160]
The B-D-Cruiden today is the best damn picture that's ever been on there.

[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.100]
Like I said it's the best god picture that's ever been on there.

[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.200]
Barnon.

[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.800]
Good work guys and James Dean bites the big one but not anymore.

[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.300]
Yeah James Dean I've been telling that for a long time.

[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.680]
I didn't see the big picture I ever got it and all the hype for years I heard about it.

[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.480]
For me tree movies I'll say it again Rebel Without A Cause, East of Eden and Giant.

[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.120]
Okay?

[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:24.120]
And from what I'm hearing Giant was quite an exaggeration.

[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.840]
But anyway he made three movies and that was it.

[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.440]
Those are really weak movie two Rebel Without A Cause.

[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:30.740]
Would sound many oh?

[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.540]
Won't say him no more.

[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:32.960]
Sound many oh?

[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.220]
BAAAAMING!

[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.060]
But at any rate and of course he was in at the Giant with Liz Taylor.

[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:38.160]
Yeah.

[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.220]
So what does that tell you right off the bat?

[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.660]
I just don't see it.

[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:46.840]
I don't see any greatness there at all and yet they've oh he would have been the next Elvis

[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.440]
Presley or the Proud Preset whatever you know.

[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.780]
I just don't get it.

[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.340]
Was he that great looking?

[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:53.660]
No.

[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.140]
Not really at all to be honest with you.

[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.860]
He was kind of like smarmy looking and the very seldom bade and the rumor on him was

[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.640]
the deal was supposed to anything that moved you know and he should have been Cuban.

[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:03.900]
Yeah.

[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.780]
Anything that moved he'd hop on it around it and you're it.

[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.660]
Here's one that says can't make up my mind between Will Smith or JLo.

[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.940]
I like to spelling on JLo there.

[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:13.580]
It's kind of cute.

[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.880]
Uh we can put it both on here if you like.

[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:17.720]
Okay.

[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.660]
Even though JLo of course just celebrated her a marriage to her latest uh.

[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:22.720]
BAAAMING!

[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.160]
Mate.

[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.580]
The marriage do's you're.

[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.740]
I don't think anyone's ever said that she was a good actress.

[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.620]
Mark Antony or good singer.

[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.480]
Jesus got a brilliant.

[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:31.080]
Right.

[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.440]
And Will Smith of course I like I said I'm going to change my vote.

[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:35.480]
Please please.

[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:36.260]
Oh boy.

[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.080]
I don't know what it is either.

[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.000]
It's just he just bothers me badly.

[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.300]
Is this something about him?

[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:44.340]
Here's one that says worst and this is from Andrew and Pittsburgh.

[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.500]
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:46.340]
Cross yourself again.

[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:46.860]
Arnold please.

[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:47.220]
Okay.

[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.460]
Just to be on the safe side.

[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.880]
You can never never do too many Hail Mary's across yourself and up or rub those beads

[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.460]
too often.

[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.480]
Here's one that says could you please add Tom Hanks to the poll boy?

[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.360]
I like these.

[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.140]
These are great.

[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:00.020]
See that that qualifies.

[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.260]
This is from Richard.

[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.340]
Thank you Richard.

[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:05.320]
Thank you Dick.

[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.600]
Here's one that says Van Diesel.

[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.460]
Okay.

[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.440]
Got it.

[01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:12.940]
I hate it.

[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:14.600]
Can't stand him.

[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:15.580]
Does anybody like him?

[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:15.860]
No.

[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:16.180]
No.

[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.060]
Here's an interesting one to be honest with.

[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.860]
It's his one for the poll Charlie Chaplin.

[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.160]
I can't imagine anyone who's still alive would sit through one of those movies.

[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.300]
I don't know.

[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.500]
I thought Charlie Chaplin was a great innovator and supposed to be very funny.

[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.200]
I agreed that I couldn't watch that right now.

[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:32.900]
But silent movies.

[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.380]
Any of them.

[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.260]
Not just Charlie Chaplin.

[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.840]
A lot of these aren't answering the question though.

[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.140]
Oh yeah.

[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.300]
Who accused Charlie Chaplin of being a great actor?

[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:40.700]
No.

[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.700]
Are you kidding me?

[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.580]
Are you shmitting me?

[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.580]
They said all the things.

[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.420]
The movie kind of swears man.

[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.340]
It will Roger Ebert.

[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:47.900]
If you get a hold of the rest right now.

[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:52.160]
He would say that Charlie Chaplin was one of the great movie, one of the great pioneers

[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.740]
that he was spectacular, great comedian.

[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:54.320]
You're wrong.

[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:54.440]
You're wrong.

[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.060]
Great comedian.

[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.460]
I never heard them say, oh, he's a great actor.

[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:57.960]
He was a movie actor.

[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:00.400]
There wasn't no TV in those days, Mr. I hate to break the news.

[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.660]
I wasn't saying TV actor.

[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.860]
Well, it's the world's he then.

[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.460]
He was a performer.

[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.180]
I didn't say that he wasn't.

[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:07.860]
I just remember that.

[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:08.560]
In the movie.

[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:09.220]

[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:10.600]
In the silent.

[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:11.200]
Okay.

[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.420]
Like I said, he fits perfect.

[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.860]
Who was the most overrated movie?

[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.020]
I mean, at least they're warm.

[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:17.980]
Okay, they're lukewarm.

[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.380]
It's not like he said, luke Skywalker, something like that.

[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.740]
Here's one from Will, who says a reality check, please.

[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.400]
I was watching evening news and I see these idiots passing by the

[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.800]
gippers casket and they're saluting.

[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.340]
Are you kidding me?

[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.720]
Rigg Ray and I had to have been one of the biggest chicken offs going.

[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.580]
I mean, he was a man who skipped out on WW2 because of weak eyesight.

[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.580]
I did it to a nom and guess what?

[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.780]
I wore glasses, geeky, army issue, plastic, black-framed wonders.

[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.460]
Probably looked like William H. Macy.

[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.340]
Hell, do you mean all I had to do was say I had weak eyesight?

[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.600]
And I could have kicked back state?

[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.920]
State side and I got my ass shot at.

[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.640]
Dang, dang.

[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:55.100]
It says while Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart even Ted Williams were doing their

[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:58.240]
bit for the war effort, that numbscal Reagan was hanging out in a Hollywood doing squat,

[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.300]
talk about disgusting, how and how did he get away with it?

[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.780]
He had pull, okay?

[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.600]
He was pulling it.

[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.180]
So there you go, Ronnie Reagan, he won't pull it no more because he's dead as a

[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:09.480]
door nail.

[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.560]
He's in that box or not.

[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.780]
I still think the coffin's empty.

[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.260]
A tisket, a tasket, open up that casket.

[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:15.560]
I bet you won't find him in there.

[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.080]
Yeah, anybody home?

[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.960]
Well, Nancy's been doing that for 10 years now.

[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.080]
She's been anybody home?

[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.060]
Oh, that's terrible.

[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:23.600]
That's bad.

[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.040]
And I didn't feel any remorse when she laid her head there on a casket at all.

[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.680]
And not far from what I wrinkled up all the pimple head bitch.

[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.140]
She's a simpleton.

[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.000]
Can't say.

[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.600]
And all of a sudden she's the big hero for stem cell research.

[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.140]
A little bit late, don't you think, Nancy, that you're taking on the right wing fascists?

[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:42.360]
A little bit late.

[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.060]
Supposedly.

[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:48.500]
Really?

[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.240]
Yeah, that's what she must have been just doing at Silent Mover, under her breath.

[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.840]
And anyway, Senator Bill Nelson, good guy, kind of like grizzled and mumbled while he's

[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.840]
another unintelligible old long in the tooth.

[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.380]
US Senator Bill Nelson of Florida joined CNN yesterday in a lawsuit challenging a Florida

[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.740]
statute that prevents copying a list of names for more than 47,000 potential felons set

[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:15.380]
to be purged from voter rolls as once again the right wingers try to keep you dark folks

[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:15.780]
from voting.

[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.200]
Florida's junior senator agrees with some of these 67 election supervisors across the state

[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.100]
who are mighty concerned about the accuracy of the list provided by the FDLE.

[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:31.180]
They want to ensure voters are not disenfranchised in the 2004 elections like so many thousands and

[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:33.120]
thousands were in 2000.

[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.360]
He realized that Gourwin in landslide Florida, he won by thousands.

[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.900]
If the public cannot have access, how do we know that they're not purging someone who is not

[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:46.740]
convicted, fell on the ass Nelson, who as joining a lawsuit filed last month by CNN to obtain

[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.120]
the list, who has something.

[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.860]
See, part of this is chopped off.

[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.680]
I hate when that happens.

[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.820]
The list technically is a public record, but state law allows only certain people in groups such as

[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.600]
political parties or candidates to get copies.

[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.320]
Anyone else may look at the list but can't copy it.

[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:05.500]
Well, I'm wondering one thing, how come the carry campaigns since he's the candidate, how come he can't do it,

[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.820]
how come the Democratic party can't do it, how come CNN and poor Bill Nelson got to be doing it?

[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:14.780]
The Florida's won a seven states that does not allow convicted felons to vote unless they're voting rights have been restored.

[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:19.240]
The CNN sued to get access to the list and identified as potential felons was filed last month.

[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:25.200]
The Florida Department of State of course, as opposed to releasing copies of the list, saying that would violate the privacy of voters

[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.700]
who might accidentally be on the list.

[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:35.260]
Well, I think everybody ought to be a colon up governor Jeb Bush and asking, asking everyone question.

[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.600]
If I can find the damn thing, here it is.

[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.820]
Where is he going to get?

[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.500]
Yeah, and speaking of that, speaking of Bill Nelson.

[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:42.280]
Where is Nelson?

[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.280]
Right, that's in there too.

[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.000]
Let's try to just mention that in passing.

[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.620]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18 and 10 Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.520]
The worst amount, see I want to keep saying that, I want to do that.

[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.240]
Right.

[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.660]
That's not the poll question.

[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.280]
See, I'm the one doing understand my own question.

[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.280]
Who is the most overrated movie actor actors of all time?

[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.120]
Not the worst, we've already done the worst.

[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.500]
The best, the worst, the most mediocre.

[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.760]
Most overrated.

[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.520]
John Wayne 58, the Duke.

[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:09.840]
The Duke is pulling away.

[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:10.820]
58.

[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.800]
Kevin Costner though on his AS53, I have no problem with that if he wins.

[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.720]
James Dean 52, can't arrive, she's got 49.

[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.200]
Marilyn Monroe 29, Judy Roberts 22, Elvis 10.

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.880]
Al Pacino's moving up to four, he's lockstep with Richard Gear, they've got four piece.

[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:25.140]
Mel Gibson's got four.

[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.280]
They should have put Mel right up there on the cross, you know what?

[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.220]
Rock Hudson 3, Raquel Welts 3, Harrison Ford's got a pair of Gene Hackman 2,

[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.260]
and after that it's the old single digit.

[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:42.100]
27 past the hour at 560 WQM, if you're starvin' man right now, like, that's almost lunchtime.

[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.080]
A lot of people eat lunch early, 11, 11, 30, right?

[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.440]
Pizza lock is open and waiting for you in Davie, and the pizza lock flies away with tons of free parking right behind Pier 1 imports.

[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.120]
University drive between Griffith and 595, pizza lock has been on around for it seemed like forever.

[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.360]
Even in-

[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.680]
That's right, there's one and only, and thank goodness there's only one.

[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.320]
Well, you know Jeff, he won't listen to anybody, you know how that is, unless it's about a hot date.

[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.420]
No BS coupons like the other pizza joints because pizza lock every Thursday are for the special,

[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.660]
where you buy any on-trend the second one is half price.

[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:13.480]
Every Monday by one lasagna the second one is only five bucks, no coupon necessary,

[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.700]
and every Tuesday like today when you buy one eggplant dinner the second one is only five bucks again.

[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.520]
No coupon needed, they always give you big gigantic portions,

[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.160]
everything is cooked fresh to order no soggy pasta at the pizza lock ever.

[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.420]
No microwave in the story, there and everything is either baked or sauteed.

[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:32.340]
And they've got almost 200 seats waiting for it, the locks in there after waiting around for tables on Friday or Saturday like most

[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:36.500]
Broward restaurants, they deliver the same full menu from West of Lamego, north of Sunrise,

[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:41.300]
South of Pine's Boulevard east of 441, and the prices are so low you can take the whole family over and over again,

[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.560]
because like I said they give you big gigantic portions, you will love the pizza lock,

[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.760]
three different kinds of great pizza, the best garlic rolls you've ever popped in your push,

History comes to life on the History Channel.

[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:22.100]
The U is 1968, young men across America are ordered to serve their country and Vietnam.

[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:28.580]
Starting tonight, the History Channel takes a historical and historical look back as they're reported to the Draft Board.

[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:35.360]
Alright, listen up, when I call your name, step forward to be sworn in. Richard Chaining.

[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.820]
Are you ready to serve your country son?

[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.040]
Sorry pal, I got better things to do.

[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.160]
Except this check that's open to my gratitude.

[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.340]
Okay, who's next?

[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.920]
Rush, this is real name.

[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:49.480]
Limbaugh.

[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.980]
Rush is the name, but you might know me as Jeff Christie on KUGL.

[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.440]
Koodle has noodles of hits.

[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.320]
Here's a white boy with a questionable name.

[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.800]
Beanchain Thomas!

[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.060]
Hee hee!

[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.280]
Are you ready to serve your country boy?

[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.540]
Let me tell you this, my friend.

[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.260]
I'm one tough talking college dropout that charges my god, given right to defend it with my mouth.

[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.440]
Now if you'll excuse me.

[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.980]
You're not gonna have to hear it now.

[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:18.960]
No, don't shut me.

[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.960]
Now you don't understand.

[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.200]
It's the bullet of my eyes.

[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:24.720]
It's so big.

[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.560]
I even think it's a theater.

[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.500]
In the skirts.

[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.680]
Oh, I hate you, kid.

[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.780]
I have to give it to you now.

[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.100]
I am a trucker to the length of my cannon.

[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:37.360]
No!

[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:38.980]
No!

[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.060]
You want to go?

[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.080]
You want to go?

[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.340]
1132, Papa Humor Rush.

[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.960]
You hypocrite, you fat tub of crap.

[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:47.360]
28 till noon at QAIM.

[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:51.240]
Don't forget join WQM in the Rio de Janeiro pages from Bellsoft this afternoon, noon to one.

[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:54.260]
At AM and tour, a carer practice care center.

[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:55.440]
Oi!

[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.300]
At 204.75, this game blowbards stop by to pick up tickets to upcoming Marlins game.

[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.100]
That's at noon today.

[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.900]
And maybe Miguel will give you like an adjustment.

[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.460]
Is Miguel gonna be there?

[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.060]
Who's he sending out for this thing?

[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:06.480]

[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.760]
Like I said, go give Miguel an adjustment.

[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:09.740]
Or a back rub.

[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:15.160]
Cracked showing in GOP's Cuban American based speaking of Miguel, who's voting for Kerry by the way.

[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:26.480]
President Bush's policies toward Padelle Castro's regime and the war in Iraq are threatening to fray traditionally solid Republican ties to Cuban American voters, the largest segment of Florida's fast growing Hispanic community.

[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.060]
In 2000, Bush won Florida by a mere 537 votes that is so alleged.

[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.980]
But his advantage among Cubans was about 4 to 1.

[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.560]
Thanks a lot, amigos.

[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.020]
Lunatics.

[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.820]
CuanCuban Hispanics tend to vote Democratic and are flocking to the state.

[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:43.580]
Are you hearing that?

[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.640]
I heard it.

[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.080]
Non-Cuban Hispanics tend to vote Democratic and are flocking to the state.

[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:54.520]
On November 2nd, the Keta Florida, the decisive swing of a state four years ago, could well be this disparate Hispanic vote.

[01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:00.620]
Florida's population, here's that number again, is grown by more than a million since the last presidential election.

[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:06.500]
A 6.5% increase from July 2003 that could transform the state's electorate.

[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:13.340]
From April 2000 to July 2002, nearly half the new residents were Hispanic, according to the most recent numbers from the Census Bureau.

[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:23.740]
South Florida's Cuban American community, about 600,000, is divided over the Bush administration's policies, with some hardline exiles complaining that Bush is failed to take a tough stance against Castro.

[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:24.500]
Thank you, Abe.

[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:30.000]
A young generation of Cubans who were born in the U.S., or raised here most of their lives, are likely to support engagement with Cuba.

[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.300]
They're not knee-jerk Republicans like their parents.

[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:44.360]
Bush's problem-secker within the walls of Versailles restaurant, a batch of Cuban exiles in the heart of IMEs, little of Anna neighborhood, the war in Iraq is no good, says Emilio J. Fedor, is sipping a high-act tank cup of Cuban coffee.

[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.940]
Each election finds this life-long Republican more open to Democrats.

[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:56.980]
Most Cubans have always been Republican by nature. I followed my mother's lead, the 56-year-old bail bondsman be sane, but when you get older and see how things really are, you think differently.

[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.040]
Thank the Lord, thank God.

[01:16:59.160 --> 01:16:59.800]
Deal, God!

[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:04.720]
Indeed, the restaurants, older patrons, and there are plenty of them are firmly behind Mr. Bush.

[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:11.340]
Men as such as Aaron Ido, 68, who stops on the way to his credit-praised Bush, I like everything he does even Iraq, the retiree, said.

[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:12.700]
Moibueno.

[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:20.340]
Many Cuban-Americans have been in the Democratic Party some 40 years ago, blaming President Kennedy for the debacle of the U.S. Back pay of pigs invasion in 61.

[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:27.180]
The strong feelings remain bolstered by President Reagan's anti-communist views and Republicans tough on Castro message.

[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:33.520]
And Jeb Bush, the president's brother, made converting Cubans into his cross in the mid-1980s before he became governor of Florida.

[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:46.880]
The community is expected to vote Republican again November 2nd, but if enough switch to Bush's Democratic rival John Kerry or decide to stay home on election day, the president will have to make up those votes elsewhere in the growing state of more than 17 million teaming with people.

[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.880]
Teaming, 17 million people in Florida.

[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:52.420]
And how many of them speak English?

[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:53.480]
About 30 men!

[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:53.680]
More!

[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.940]
Would you see the thing about the jet that had to go back to the airport?

[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.460]
No. Where?

[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:05.080]
A spirit airlines jetliner, bound for Atlantic City with 131 people aboard, landed at Fort Lauderdale International Airport yesterday afternoon.

[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.200]
After the airline received a bomb thread!

[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.320]
Oh my gosh!

[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:13.180]
The 126 passengers and five crew members exited flight 262, Noignees reported.

[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:17.620]
The plane in Md80 was taken to a remote area for Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport.

[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.060]
baggage was loaded, searched, and then the plane.

[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:20.660]
Nothing.

[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:21.560]
Tipitiduta.

[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.980]
Just another one of those deals, just somebody looking at the crew.

[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:26.480]
A little fun.

[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.220]
You know, somebody boarded summertime blues.

[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon.

[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:34.960]
I can't wait!

[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.360]
I'm going to save it for like maybe noon.

[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:42.560]
Let's see, I got one, two, three, four, four.

[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.020]
Ah, five!

[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:55.380]
Very nice, very accurate stories about the legacy of Ronald Reagan, which I think will be a contrast somewhat.

[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:58.880]
The faunting, the sycophantic crap that's going on right now.

[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.700]
It's just enough to make you gag.

[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:05.100]
I mean ordinarily you don't want to knock a guy when he croaks, but first of all he's 93 years old.

[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.720]
And secondly, somebody has to counterbalance the propaganda.

[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.580]
The twisting of the hagiography is that story said yesterday.

[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.180]
And that is how you pronounce it, by the way.

[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:15.360]
Hegeography is number two. I even looked it up.

[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:15.780]
Really?

[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.140]
Yeah, how do you like that?

[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:20.980]
And then of course if you're talking about Liz Taylor, it's the fang-ha-ha-geography.

[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.700]
It gives a dog's idea.

[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:26.360]
Look at that, Ted Kennedy may make a children, he's going to write a children's book.

[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.900]
It's going to be called Don't Drive Off the Bridge.

[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:33.540]
Who is the most overrated movie actor, actress of all time?

[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.740]
John Wayne 61, Kevin Costeer 57, James Dean 54, Kenner Reeve 53.

[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.900]
We got a horse race baby, Marilyn Monroe's got it.

[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.820]
It's about third man.

[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.800]
Joel, your Robert's 24, Elvis 11, everybody, all single digit.

[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:47.860]
WQAM, hello.

[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.040]
Neil.

[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:49.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.020]
I got one for the Paul.

[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:51.600]
All right.

[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.220]
How about Keanu Reeves?

[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.580]
He's doing pretty good, he's got 53 votes, he's in fourth place.

[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:58.040]
How about Paul Walker?

[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.800]
Paul Walker is a bad actor?

[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.620]
No, I think he's horrible.

[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:03.580]
You're right, he is.

[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:04.260]
Okay, thanks.

[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:07.480]
If he didn't look like that, he wouldn't have any rules, right?

[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:08.920]
Paul Walker?

[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:09.680]
Yeah.

[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.540]
Does he know who Paul Walker is?

[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:13.920]
No, I'm afraid I don't.

[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.920]
Well, it's not up your alley.

[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.020]
Paul Walker, get him on, you're okay, he's terrible.

[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:21.780]
Who is the most overrated movie actor or actress of all time?

[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:22.920]
WQAM, hello.

[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:30.840]
Yes, I just want to ask what the purpose of naming the Florida term pike after Ronald Reagan.

[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.720]
What is the purpose of it?

[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:33.600]
Yes.

[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.360]
It's called sucking up to the right wing.

[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.560]
What relationship does he have to for the Florida term?

[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.260]
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, but he was Governor of California.

[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.500]
Oh, I get it.

[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:46.060]
I get it.

[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:46.260]

[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:50.140]
Wait till they rename I-95 the Schwarzenegger Freeway.

[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:51.980]
Have a great day, Palli.

[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.280]
Excellent question.

[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.080]
Yeah, I was wondering then.

[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:56.180]
Why is it the Ronald Reagan?

[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.960]
I mean, New York, they got the Thomas E. Dewey, he was the governor of New York, right?

[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.160]
They're funny, a little mustache, kind of like Hitler.

[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:09.020]
But why Ronald Reagan's turnpike and anybody would have questioned that, oh my God, what's wrong with you?

[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.800]
You are coming pinko best of you.

[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:11.840]
You're disrespectful.

[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:13.800]
I mean, it makes no sense.

[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.380]
It ought to be the lot and child.

[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.860]
There you go, the walk and lot and child, the heat coolens your way.

[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.140]
Now we're talking, man.

[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.100]
If you don't like walking, take it right on the lawn.

[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.700]
Oh God, don't we have a, we have something.

[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:30.560]
That's something.

[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.280]
Huge?

[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:35.140]
What I didn't even know that was that son of a, I don't know where the child was.

[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.920]
It's not worth it, to be honest with you.

[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.840]
21 till noon at 560, QM, the mad dog of two.

[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:46.260]
My, my, and Lord, this is 4205 60, you away from the New-way, yeah.

[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:51.080]
All right, this is your liberator, George Stervi-Busch.

[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.520]
Hey, if you thought it used to be a great place before we turned it into a smoke in a hole,

[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:02.760]
Wait, you experience the all-new amusement park just rebuilt by America's military just a few hundred miles from downtown Baghdad

[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:09.640]
A place you'll use to call Tuck or something like it is the funnest place in Iraq as soon as Abu Grey prisons go

[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.880]
Welcome to Bush Gardens Baghdad

[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:14.600]
Rob the bomb of cars

[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.700]
Surrender to the products of the Caribbean

[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.620]
Rob the world scariest roller coaster the second term

[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:27.780]
The scared of she out right out of time on top a naked prison

[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:33.800]
That explode the depths of Sam spider hole and all that stones throw from the room in the fabulous

[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:39.820]
Alabama this is my name take the 9-11 connector to your own to a building and

[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:44.900]
It is because you can't end here there at Bush Gardens Baghdad. It's a blast

[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:52.840]
16 to learn at 560 they're showing the clips again. Nancy Reagan with Michael J Fox. I don't know how long for that was

[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:57.260]
And guess who else was there? Yeah the King my mr. Suspenders and

[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:03.260]
Doing the thing about stem cell research and about research and Alzheimer's and all these other diseases

[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:08.560]
A lot of us like those of us with type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes, which is really much more serious

[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:12.940]
We could be without that we could go out and get a nice pizza and I have to worry about it

[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.360]
Yeah, people like

[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.020]
Huh?

[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:22.160]
We see all these other people were like all crippled up and things like that stem cell research could they bring the cure for a lot of these things

[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.360]
But of course that compassionate conservative

[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:30.260]
Oh God for me because he takes directions from the born against and even from the Pope I guess probably told him a thing or two

[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:35.000]
Well as you're dying from diabetes just consider yourself with the knowledge that you won't be going to hell because you're

[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.180]
Curious it wasn't based on stem cell research. Oh, I see that's a good point. I'll be going to help for different reasons though

[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.820]
Okay, let's see Merrill Street well, I

[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:50.160]
Can see that I applaud that she annoys me Merrill Street very seriously

[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:57.120]
So we're getting some invisible faxes faxes where you can't make out anything that is on there and the frustrated person keep

[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.580]
Refaxing and refaxing yeah like the more they fax the more visible it's going to get which it's not well

[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:03.780]
I don't understand what that means

[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:07.800]
In other words, they think that practice makes perfect design I guess in other words it's so faint

[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.480]
That's written invisible ink. You can't make out anything. It looks like dirty paper

[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.740]
I feel like feigning because a norm can't email here. It's so touching and so emotional

[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:22.920]
You won't believe this that's what you you won't care because you're just one another one of those anti sports people and certainly an anti-hockey person

[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.640]
Well, I just don't understand how the Florida Panther organization how it can even exist

[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.140]
You know we had that we had the phony baloney thing we had that one year when a team got out of the right time

[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:35.060]
Wasn't really that great of a team, but they got hot just at the right time

[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:37.980]
kind of like what Calgary did this year and

[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.760]
And I was it other than that nobody really cares. It's just tragic

[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.660]
It's pathetic and the this series wasn't really very good

[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:52.400]
But the fact that it went to seven games and a Tampa pulled out game six and over time and that we had the desperate game last night

[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.680]
That's what created the assignment

[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.840]
Believe me because I know you won't but it was anyway

[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.660]
Norma says I've been going to sporting events for over 35 years as an adult

[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:07.280]
I never knew he reached that point of being an adult and I don't think I ever experienced the energy or except and I witnessed in the

[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.800]
St. Pee Times forum last night for the seventh game of the Stanley Cup

[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.700]
You saw what was coming in the pregame more months when the lightning ran fast-skating drills while the flames

[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:22.420]
Cavalierly better the puck back and forth for the astounding power plate to start the second period where the flames tried six times together

[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:27.180]
Park across the blue line and could not and the last ten minutes which was like a blocking my boxing match on the ice

[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:32.800]
What a game. Thank you. The opportunity in a hockey years ago signed Norma Lord Stanley needed a 10

[01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:59.860]
I think I want to Stanley Cup

[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:17.520]
Yeah, they had the big horn out there in Tampa last night

[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.580]
Anyway, that's it

[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.340]
It's up because yeah, it was them. Well, why should he carry should wait for the Panthers to win when he's calling a game

[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:30.260]
So be the lucky charm. Don't you think of course?

[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.380]
Once you think when you think a lucky charm day. You think like a little twerp

[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.280]
560 560 pound 560

[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:43.100]
It's a goal. It's a goal. I can't wait for this WQM. Hello

[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.860]
Okay, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing?

[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:52.060]
Great. I have one for your Paul. Okay. I mean to be insensitive, but how about round Reagan?

[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:57.780]
Yeah, somebody suggested that before but again overrated nobody ever considered him to be a good actor. Much less a great actor

[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:02.560]
So I think yeah, okay, my other thing was as far as a future Paul. Yeah

[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:05.460]
About with which

[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:10.040]
Presidential or government governmental scandal was your favorite

[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:16.500]
You can do you know Bill Clinton and Monica and the penis gate. Yeah

[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:21.920]
Mm-hmm weapons of mass destruction, right. I think it's a good one. Okay. Thanks. All right. Thank you

[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.240]
Have a great day, pal. That's not bad. Which scandal was your favorite? Where's one of you enjoy the most?

[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:29.200]
Well, I'm sure that penis gate would be at the top of that. You're a real estate

[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:34.320]
Stingate. What do we want to call it Monica gate? Kenny Stargate. I'm gonna get your boy

[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:37.320]
I mean you know that you come right out there

[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:43.700]
Tell the public the truth and it's just yeah, I don't know where there's no sense. There's no feeling I guess that describes it best

[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:51.140]
Here Kenny Star runs into a bald head of James Carval at the airport in Atlanta in the early day well in the middle of the whole

[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.000]
Monica gate thing and he's system. I'm gonna get your boy

[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:58.820]
And it's like oh no, he didn't have any vendeda Kenny star. He was very upstanding

[01:27:58.820 --> 01:27:59.780]
God right

[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:03.040]
Or nothing political about it

[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.380]
WQA and hello

[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:07.520]
How about Marlon Brando don't like Marlon

[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.660]
Yeah, I got to go from the Godfather that Superman, please

[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.340]
Don't forget that silly movie with what's his name?

[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:20.660]
Or is the silly movie with the lizard where he was doing the Godfather was again freshman the freshman

[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:23.200]
That was a cute movie with what's his name?

[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:27.440]
Ah, I got a brain fart on him now. I don't know Matthew Broadway. There it is

[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.140]
Yeah, the freshman it was silly. It was a very silly it was a way to give him a chance

[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:37.840]
To put the cotton in his cheek again, you know and to reprise that the boys it was fun

[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:41.340]
And hey some of these don't have to be like serious job in Superman

[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.480]
Did he yeah, yeah, yeah, well, he didn't really have a major role in Superman

[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.100]
It didn't but he didn't made the best of it

[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.280]
There you go

[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.180]
But we'll put him on there Marlon Brando because a lot of people don't like big fat guys

[01:28:55.620 --> 01:29:01.160]
Let's see here's one that says and I see Frank's and I for really sucked my mother-in-law says Val Kilmer

[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.160]
Says Devon Devon

[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.480]
Frank's it after really sucked well, I would say this I didn't like his singing

[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.380]
But I think in Manchurian candidate is acting was great. What's there remake in Manchurian candidate?

[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:16.880]
Is that out the enters it this weekend? No, it's not out yet this weekend, I believe

[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:21.740]
He was great in that movie. Did you see it? Yeah, well, he was great

[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:26.320]
Yeah, and by the way, I didn't want to like the movie or him because I couldn't stand him

[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.820]
Oh, yeah, I hated it and I had to apologize to to myself for resisting

[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.640]
Now I would say this

[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:33.680]
uh

[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:38.800]
In from here to eternity, which is the role he got because somebody made him as

[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:44.780]
Manchurian opera couldn't be heard I don't get how many day go get any what grease bowl cum bars come out of the wood work

[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.200]
That was another story, but I think he actually wasn't pretty good actor

[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:50.620]
But Frank's him after put him on there just because we don't like him anyway and Val Kilmer

[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:54.440]
Which I would agree with that's the kind of Batman. I don't I don't see what the deal with Val Kilmer

[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:58.880]
And if you ever seen him and Jim Morrison together, I don't how could he possibly played Jim Morrison?

[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.760]
They paid him to oh, well, did you think he was good in the doors movie?

[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:08.520]
There it was a little bit old dramatic the whole thing pretty pretty weak

[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.000]
5 6 7 0 5 60 Jim Morrison still alive by the way, it's lunch every day at Shlumys

[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.860]
We'll give you directions later how to get there

[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:22.340]
John Wayne 66 Kevin Coster 63 the most overrated movie actor actress of all time

[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:25.200]
And I don't think we really have done this ever before which is shocking

[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:29.080]
I mean if we can come up with a new poll we've never done before out of the 80 million polls

[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.520]
That's a major accomplishment. How do I do it?

[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.980]
How do I how do I do it?

[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:39.380]
Now what inspired me for this actually maybe it was all a Reagan business that inspired me

[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:44.740]
And then I started thinking about John Wayne because it's hard to think about old Ronnie without thinking about John Wayne the Duke

[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:48.920]
And Chuck Heston WQA and hello

[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.560]
You have a how about Dennis Hopper

[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:59.940]
Well put a monitor for you we don't agree but we'll put them on there do you agree? No no don't I like that at all a lot but well put them on there

[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.820]
This guy we it's not like we're gonna

[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.880]
Nixie or a choice whatever you say what opinion

[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.160]
Everybody that goes into one of those movies there are people who love them and think they're great

[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:12.400]
And they're people they're oh my god so and so sucks they absolutely suck

[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:18.780]
You've seen some of those movies right what's a point of time we had Dennis Hopper drops that we could play

[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:19.860]
Well, we don't

[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.660]
I still don't understand where that uh

[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.520]
I just I don't think I have it

[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:33.480]
The walking lot in one it's under trials and you see that that's the problem when you do that it's like

[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:38.700]
It is so cute yeah, I was putting it a hundred years ago who put it in there. I don't know probably me

[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:43.820]
Yeah, from a car it is so cute. Yeah, he's talking about the turnpike it it is so cute

[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:47.260]
So let's have the lot and trials turnpike that was a very excellent question

[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:54.920]
It's like how come we have Arthur Godfrey wrote on my me beach when Arthur Godfrey was one of the biggest anti-Semites whoever came down the pike down the run will rig and turnpike

[01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.060]
rhymes with

[01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.240]
WQA and hello

[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.740]
Yes, 400 L

[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.860]
Yes, sir. How are you doing? Good. Good

[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.320]
Let's go to four lotterdale. Hello

[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.160]
Yes, I got one for your fault. Yeah

[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:10.600]
Brad Pitt

[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:14.700]
Brad Pitt couldn't act as well as a paper second since once in a great while

[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:21.860]
Right, he's all looks right thanks. Yeah, the other issue I brought up to you mentioned Ronald Reagan highway or Ronald Reagan turnpike

[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:24.940]
From Cincinnati and they all have a Ronald Reagan

[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:32.040]
Codway up there. How do you like that? Yeah, because he's basically obviously it's very Republican there and

[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:38.720]
Got general electric which is obviously the big war machine in all the engines behind all the planes and everything so

[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.700]
There's a tie in with all that Republican connection there. Hey man. Thanks a lot, Paley

[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:50.060]
Well, we don't have GE and Florida doing no do we have anything at all that relates to a Ronnie Reagan except we have plenty of right wingers

[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:55.900]
But no, not really it makes no sense at all. Let's conduct a campaign to get his name off of that thing

[01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.820]
And that should be pretty easy now that he died right now

[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:04.400]
Should I let him if he had told me he was gonna die? I would have worked on that before we could have had a big campaign

[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:09.740]
Yeah, but we got Chuck Meyer to have people put the big X through the quarters, you know, but nobody thought coming

[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:15.280]
No, they just sneak it in there woke up one day and all of a sudden it was no longer the Florida turnpike

[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:22.420]
It was the Ronald Reagan turnpike just like we have the Miriam Alonzo highway and we have the Dave Dixon freeway and we've got the

[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:27.700]
Chiquita banana expressway. I just don't get it. I mean the Dan Marino drive thing

[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:31.400]
I don't know not that crazy about doing it while somebody's still alive either

[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:38.000]
Are you no right? What if they turn out to like murder 500 people or something later on how about the the Schuhler expressway

[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.640]
That's had that name for years. Sure

[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:47.680]
Now which one is the Schuhler's that the 836? No, that's that one over there. No, here's they wish 36

[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:54.900]
Is a 36 the Schuhler I never even knew that although we call it chula down here the chula expressway chula chula

[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:58.800]
567 oh the how come we can't just call it the brain stem

[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:05.560]
Highway not until they legalize it and if that sounds insensitive we'll just use the initial just the BS highway

[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:09.140]
Which most of them floor to our WQM. Hello

[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:11.900]
Hi, I have a name for the poll. Okay

[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:19.540]
What you got oh Michael Douglas Michael Douglas. I certainly can cure heartily and also Vanessa red grave

[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.420]
Okay, thanks. You're welcome. Bye

[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:27.820]
That sounds like two names, but that's okay because she was very nice and our only lady of the day ladies won't play the game with the screenless

[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.120]
Plus how many ladies we got listen

[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.100]
That's about it. Well, we do the best we can but that's a red grave

[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:37.060]
And I see I get confused which one is the virulent

[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:40.620]
Lesbian the virulent bike. I don't know

[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:45.300]
Is it Lynn is if Vanessa and quite frankly who to help here

[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:57.940]
This is the king. I like to relax by having very magnet on the side of my balls

[01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:59.840]
I listen to the new rod is 12 to 1 hour

[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.100]
You

[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:29.220]
I

[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:34.380]
Won't me

[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.580]
House

[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:44.840]
Paper

Yeah, no, read it again.

[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:02.840]
Oh, you're torrid out.

[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.620]
I got too many others to work on.

[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.040]
Too many others to work on.

[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:06.660]
Oh, Jesus.

[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.520]
Here's a fact that says everyone says,

[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:10.680]
well, he's no Olivier.

[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:11.660]
Well, what about him?

[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.420]
That pompous, experienced piece of human experiment,

[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:15.640]
Sir Lawrence Olivier.

[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.280]
Now, let's see, who was he concerning with?

[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:19.280]
Was it Danny Kay?

[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.160]
Who was hanging out with Sir Lawrence Olivier?

[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:24.280]
Rhymes.

[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.440]
Rhymes with...

[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:25.920]
Your gay.

[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:26.340]
Right.

[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.640]
That was the popular rumor.

[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:31.640]
I believe it was Danny Kay and Olivier and both were.

[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:33.340]
Anyway, here's a fact that says,

[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.120]
you got it on there, Josh Sir Lawrence Olivier.

[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:35.800]
Oh, my God.

[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:36.940]
He's getting to it.

[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.420]
He's getting to it.

[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:37.620]
He's getting to it.

[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.620]
Sorry, guys, my host Steven Cigal.

[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.200]
I hate him.

[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:45.600]
Like that.

[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.360]
Yeah.

[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.440]
But I don't think anybody ever accused him of being an actor.

[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.240]
Could have otherwise.

[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:50.580]
Well, he's in movies.

[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.140]
Yeah.

[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:51.600]
He appears.

[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:54.280]
The more far walker is the actor from fast and the furious.

[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:55.320]
Yeah, well, I know Paul Walker.

[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:55.900]
You don't.

[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:56.120]
Right.

[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.300]
Josh said it for me.

[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:57.900]
Yeah.

[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:58.680]
He looks fine.

[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.020]
And I, let's see.

[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:00.840]
I'm not afraid to...

[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.060]
I don't know what that means.

[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:05.900]
Do I know who this is?

[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:06.760]
Who what?

[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.060]
I don't know who this is and I don't really say it.

[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:09.280]
It's fine.

[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.300]
Don't be defensive.

[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:11.520]
We're not putting out the defensive.

[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:13.040]
Okay, everybody's in a fine mood.

[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:14.580]
Lighting one, they Stanley Cup.

[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.180]
That's not like Dave Andrew Chuck.

[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.260]
22 years of twiling in the NHL and putting several fine years here in Toronto with Leafs.

[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.900]
Good man, Dave Andrew Chuck.

[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:27.440]
22 years twiling in the National Occupial League and finally gets to drink out of the cup.

[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:28.780]
And a Stanley Cup too.

[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.120]
Let's see.

[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.160]
Okay, except for transporting you and McGregor.

[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:33.640]
Oh, yeah, transporting.

[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.140]
I better go out and spot that leader.

[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.040]
In fact, I better throw out of the window.

[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.760]
Allen and the key is one of our regular chronics as Eli Wallach.

[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:43.060]
How could you say that after Godfather 3?

[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:44.260]
Lovely.

[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:46.940]
Let's see.

[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.660]
Now, here's another one from Capital Hill Blue.

[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:50.480]
What a great website.

[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.120]
Too bad our link is not an area for that.

[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.260]
I'll just set you the first page even though I got all five pages.

[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:55.560]
Oh.

[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.700]
Well, what is this one about?

[01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:01.780]
How big brother's watching, listening and misusing information about you also by

[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:04.660]
Teresa Ampton and Doug Thompson, who wrote the other that other piece.

[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.600]
Well, I'll stick that on the bottom and if it's worthwhile, we'll eventually get to it.

[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:09.120]
Or maybe tomorrow.

[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.660]
There's always another tomorrow, you know?

[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:14.840]
Well, well, not always.

[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:15.120]
Right.

[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.240]
We don't know that for a fact.

[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:21.460]
This one is written by William Rivers Pit, which I love William Rivers Pit and its headline

[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:22.340]
Planet Reagan.

[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:26.960]
He says, Robert Reagan is dead now and everyone's being nice to him.

[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:28.420]
In every aspect, this is appropriate.

[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:32.360]
He was a husband and a father, a beloved member of a family, and he'll be missed by those

[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.100]
he was close to.

[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:37.660]
His death was long, slow and agonizing because of the Alzheimer's disease which ruined him,

[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:39.580]
one drop of lucidity at a time.

[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.500]
My grandmother died ten years ago, almost of the day because of this disease, and this

[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:46.340]
disease took ten years to do its duty filthy, wretched work on her.

[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:50.620]
The dignity and candor of Reagan's farewell letter to the American people was as magnificent

[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:55.020]
and departure from public life as any that's been seen in our history, but the ugly truth

[01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:57.800]
of his illness was that he lived on and on and on.

[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:02.040]
His family and friends watched as he faded from the world of the real as a simple dignity

[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.740]
afforded to all life collapsed like loose sand behind his more ever more vacant eyes.

[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:10.480]
Only those who have seen Alzheimer's disease invade a mind can know the truth of this.

[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:11.960]
It's a cursed way to die.

[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:16.220]
In this morning space, however, there must be roommate for the truth.

[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:21.280]
Writer Edward Abbey once said, the sneakiest form of literary subtlety in a corrupt society

[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:22.560]
is to speak the plain truth.

[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.280]
The critics will not understand you.

[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:25.660]
The public will not believe you.

[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.520]
Your fellow writers will shake their heads.

[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:29.020]
The truth is straightforward.

[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:33.340]
Virtually every significant problem facing the American people today can be traced back

[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:36.180]
to the policies and people that came from the Reagan administration.

[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:41.720]
It is a laundry list of ill-as-woven disasters that has all of us once again staring apocalypse

[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.400]
in the eye.

[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:43.840]
How can this be?

[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:47.580]
The television says Ronald Reagan was one of the most beloved presidents of the 20th

[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:47.940]
century.

[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:52.540]
He won two national elections, the second by margin so overwhelming, that all future landslides

[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:55.280]
will be judged by the high water market achieved against Walter Mondale.

[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:59.240]
How can a man so universally respected to play the hand in the evils which corrupt our

[01:41:59.240 --> 01:41:59.540]
days?

[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:03.860]
The answer lies in the reality of the corrupt society Abbey spoke of.

[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:08.680]
Our corruption is the absolute triumph of image over reality, a flash over substance, of

[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.980]
the pervasive need within most Americans to believe in a happy face version of the nation

[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:15.220]
they call home, and the sprinter reality of our estate is unpatriotic.

[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:20.000]
Ronald Reagan wasn't always will be the undisputed heavyweight champion of salesmen in this regard.

[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:24.660]
Reagan was able by virtue of his towering talents in the Serenity to sell to the American

[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:26.540]
people a flood of poisonous policies.

[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.060]
He made Americans feel that about acting against their own best interests.

[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:34.160]
He sold the American people a lemon, and they drive it to this day as if it was a catalact.

[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.540]
It isn't the lies of killers, but the myths, and Ronald Reagan was the greatest myth-maker

[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:39.540]
were ever likely to see.

[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:44.260]
Mainstream media journalism today is a shameful joke because of Reagan's deregulation

[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:44.760]
policy.

[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:48.920]
Once upon a time the furnace doctrine ensured that the information we receive, information

[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.740]
vital to the ability of people to govern in the manner intended, came from a wide variety

[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:53.720]
of sources and perspectives.

[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:58.460]
Reagan's policies annihilated the furnace doctrine, opening the door for a few megacorporations

[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:00.160]
together, journalism under themselves.

[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:04.480]
Today, Reagan's old bosses at General Electric on three of the most watched news channels,

[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.880]
this company profits from every war we fight, but somehow is trucked until the truths of

[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:11.020]
war, thus demits their soul to us.

[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:16.160]
The deregulation policy through Ovarama Reagan didn't just deliver journalism to these

[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.020]
massive corporations, but headed virtually every facet of our lives into the hands of

[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:20.920]
this privileged few.

[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:25.040]
The year we breed, the water we drink, the food we eat are all tainted, because Reagan

[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.020]
battered down every environmental regulation he came across, so corporations could improve

[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:29.740]
their bottom line.

[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.940]
Our leaders are wholly ones of city areas of the corporations that were all made all

[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:36.000]
powerful by Reagan's deregulation craze.

[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.080]
The savings and loan scandal of Reagan's time, which cost American people hundreds of

[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.880]
billions of dollars, is but one example of Reagan's decision that the foxes would be fine

[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.300]
guards in a hen house.

[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:50.080]
Ronald Reagan believed in small government despite the fact that he grew government massively

[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:50.980]
during his time.

[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:55.320]
Social programs which protected the weakest of our citizens were gutted by Reagan's policies,

[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.040]
delivering millions into despair.

[01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:02.260]
Reagan was able to do this by caricaturing the welfare queen who punched out babies by

[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:06.100]
the barnload, who drove the flashy car bought with your tax dollars, who refused to work

[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:07.120]
because she didn't have to.

[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:11.780]
This was a vicious, racist lie, one result of which was the decimation of a generation

[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:12.800]
by crack cocaine.

[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.980]
The urban poor were left to rot because Ronald Reagan believed in self-sufficiency.

[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:22.080]
Because Ronald Reagan could not be bothered to fund research into gate cancer, the AIDS

[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.560]
virus was allowed to carve out a comfortable home in America.

[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:28.700]
The aftershocks from this callous disregard for people whose homosexuality was deemed

[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:31.380]
evil by religious conservatives cannot be overstated.

[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.360]
Beyond the graves of those who died from a disease which was allowed to burn unchecked,

[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:39.180]
there are generations of Americans today living with the subconscious idea that sex

[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:39.900]
equals death.

[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.700]
The veneer and honor and respect painted across the legacy of Ronald Reagan is itself a

[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:45.920]
myth of biblical proportions.

[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.520]
The coverage propered today of the Reagan legacy seldom mentions in propriety until the

[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.000]
Iran Compreh scandal appears on the administration timeline.

[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:58.140]
This set of omission is vast, but the end of his term in office some 138 Reagan administration

[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:02.220]
officials have been convicted and dited or investigated for misconduct and or criminal

[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:02.800]
activities.

[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:07.540]
Some of the names in this disgraceful rule call Oliver North, John Pointexter, Richard

[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:12.260]
C. Cordkastor Weinberger, Elliott Abrams, Robert C. McFarlane, Michael Diver, E. Bob Wallach,

[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:18.140]
James Wat, Ellen DeFieres, Claire George, Dwayne R. Claridge, and Buford, Rita LaVelle, Richard

[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:23.180]
Allen, Richard Begg's Guy Flake, Louis Bluthreeta, Edwin Gray, Max Hugo, Carlos Campbell, John

[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:29.060]
Federer's Arthur Hayes, Jane Ellen Helms, Marjorie Mecklenberg, Robert Nemo, J. William Petro,

[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:31.420]
Thomas E. Reid, Emmanuel Savis, Charles Wick.

[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.220]
Many of these names are lost to history, but more than a few of them are still with us today,

[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:38.140]
rehabilitated by the administration of George W. Bush.

[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.120]
Ronald Reagan actively supported the regimes of the worst people ever to walk on the earth,

[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:48.100]
names like Marcos Duarte, Rios Monten, Duvalier, Rico Blood and Corruption, yet were embraced

[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:50.260]
by the Reagan administration with passionate intensity.

[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:54.740]
The ground of many nations is salted with the bones of those murdered by brutal rulers

[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:56.000]
who called Reagan a friend.

[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:59.860]
Who can forget his support of those in South Africa who believed the part-time was the proper

[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:01.560]
way to run a civilized society?

[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:05.060]
One dictator in particular looms larger across our landscape,

[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:07.540]
Sodom Hussein was a creation of Ronald Reagan.

[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:13.000]
The Reagan administration supported the Hussein regime, despite his incredible record of atrocity,

[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.860]
the Reagan administration gave Hussein intelligence information which helped the Iraqi military

[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:21.320]
use their chemical weapons on the battlefield against Iran to great effect, the deadly bacterial

[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.520]
agents sent to Iraq during the Reagan administration are a laundry list of horrors.

[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:29.020]
The Reagan administration sent an innocent, named Donald Rumsfeld to Iraq to shake Sodom

[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:32.680]
Hussein's hand and assure him that despite public American condemnation and the use of

[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:36.800]
those chemical weapons, the Reagan administration still considered him a welcome friend and ally.

[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:41.160]
That happened while the Reagan administration was selling weapons to Iran, a nation notorious

[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:45.220]
for its support of international terrorism in secret and in violation of scores of laws.

[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.980]
Another name on Ronald Reagan's rule called is that of Osama bin Laden.

[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:53.900]
The Reagan administration believed it a bully idea to organize an army of Islamic fundamentalist

[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:58.040]
in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet Union and bin Laden became the spiritual leader of this

[01:46:58.040 --> 01:46:58.360]
action.

[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:02.400]
Throughout the entirety of Reagan's term, bin Laden and his people were armed, funded and

[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.280]
trained by the U.S.

[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:07.920]
Reagan helped teach Osama bin Laden the lessons he lives by today that it's possible to bring

[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:09.640]
a superpower to its knees.

[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:14.700]
bin Laden believes this because he's done it once before thanks to the dedicated help of

[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.260]
Ronald Reagan.

[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:20.320]
In 1998, two American embassies in Africa were blasted in the rebel biosama bin Laden who

[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.920]
used these semtex sent to Afghanistan by the Reagan administration to do the job.

[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.020]
In 2001, Osama bin Laden thrust a dagger into the heart of the U.S. using men who became

[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:31.200]
skilled at the art of terrorism with the help of Ronald Reagan.

[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.060]
Today, there are 827 American soldiers and over 10,000 civilians who have died in the

[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:40.680]
invasion and occupation of Iraq, a war that came to be because Reagan helped manufacture

[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:42.940]
both Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.

[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:46.260]
How much of this can be truthfully related to feed Ronald Reagan?

[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:47.440]
It depends on who you asked.

[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:51.520]
Those who worship Reagan seem as the man in charge, the man who defeated Soviet communism,

[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.820]
the man whose vision and charisma made Americans feel good about themselves after Vietnam and

[01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:57.320]
the malaise of the 1970s.

[01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:01.540]
Those who despise Reagan seem as nothing more than a pitchman for corporate raiders, the

[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:05.160]
man who allowed greed to become a virtue, the man who smiled rapidly while allowing his

[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:06.620]
officials to run the government for him.

[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:10.520]
In the final analysis, however, the legacy of Ronald Reagan, whether he had an active

[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:14.240]
hand in formulation or was merely along for the ride, is beyond dispute.

[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:18.580]
His famous question, are you better off now than you were four years ago, is easy to

[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:18.920]
answer.

[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:23.360]
We are not better off now than we were four years ago or eight years ago or 12 or 20.

[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.120]
We are a badly damaged state ruled today by a man who subsists off Reagan's most corrosive

[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:29.220]
final gift to us all.

[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:31.960]
It's the image that matters and be damned to the truth.

[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:33.960]
Pretty good stuff.

[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:35.400]
It's on our website by William Rivers.

[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:35.600]
Great.

[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:36.660]
Planet Reagan.

[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:41.500]
As opposed to all of this swill, all of this crap that the corporate media are peddling

[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:45.360]
down your throat about the great Ronald Reagan, the great communicator on all this other

[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:45.880]
bull crap.

[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:48.040]
But at any rate, you believe whatever you want.

[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:50.640]
Like you can turn over to Rush right now, he's probably still eulogizing.

I was going by to spend a phony on a party when

[01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:28.700]
you said you'd run

[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.580]

[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:06.120]
From 18 at 560

[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:11.460]
70 QM demanded to do the Humper at 4 and then we got Marlon's baseball Mike a Marlon's at Cleveland

[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:15.200]
I don't want to read all these anti-Ragan things the one hour. Do I?

[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:15.860]
Yes

[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:22.180]
Well, let's give it a rundown on the pool so far because I don't want to do all I read today doing yes

[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:30.960]
Here's Jerry Brown is on there, you know vulgar details of government seem quite marginal and trivial in that context that he created

[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:36.260]
While he was governor whatever that means I guess Jerry Brown's kissing his ass to you this don't you just don't dare

[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:41.200]
That's insane even though Jerry Brown of course the ultra liberal former governor California mayor of Oakland, California right now

[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:42.620]
And rumor to be

[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:45.500]
But nevertheless I

[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.680]
Mean there have been a few people like kind of like dancing around the edges with a few little

[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:53.740]
Negatory comments, but you just don't say these things right now because that's disrespectful

[01:51:53.740 --> 01:52:00.080]
Okay, so you got a lie like crazy. You just got to bite your tongue until it bleeds and still until it starts gushing blood

[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:05.180]
What are all these facts is my god. Oh, they're all great

[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:07.240]
Here's one it says

[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.860]
The most overrated actor of all time Michael Cain says Dennis and Hollywood okay?

[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.840]
Michael Cain I like Michael Cain, but this guy don't and he's entitled

[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:25.680]
He's the the most employed actor possible and he gets a lot of work outside of that but at any rate so does a sort of a lot of people

[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:30.460]
Here's one that says I get to listen sporadically during the day so I'm not sure if you knew that your line

[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:35.220]
Well, we heard reports of that yesterday the EAS which is now

[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:41.440]
You know, we don't hear it because it's automatic. That's in the middle of a laser recharge is spot apparently

[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:47.700]
Well, that's nice. How come nobody told me about that goes off at random the EAS sounder in other words the emergency

[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:49.400]
automatic Nazi

[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:56.860]
Siren the ASS sound the EAS it's not the first there be even six times this is having to your program

[01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:01.080]
It says what happened to this is a test. This is only a test. I don't know because I've never heard it

[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:04.880]
I don't hear that we don't hear it. It happens beyond us. Oh, I see

[01:53:05.380 --> 01:53:09.660]
It says you still must run the adan thing so why piss off the client and I have to schedule a make good

[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:12.360]
Schedule a make good. Oh brother. How does that say here?

[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:20.600]
This person's got it. They just don't understand the QMF and way man look at the drill a make good just because the spot didn't completely get on

[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:24.360]

What we could if he right now will do tomorrow. Don't let me forget. Okay. All right, damn

[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:42.640]
No, I'm so serious. We'll do it. We'll put it on the log and make it good because if I got interrupted

[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:48.280]
I mean our friend just Bob over there. They laser Richard. He's paying for the spot not for part of a spot

[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:52.420]
I mean, you know what what is wrong with his place? Don't you people have any?

[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:53.580]

[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:29.800]
up well right

[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:36.420]
Charlton Heston that's an excellent one. I mentioned that before but I want to put the second one on myself

[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:37.460]
Yeah

[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:44.240]
Always the same crap always hercules always a Moses. Oh, yeah, holy Moses enough with you already

[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:46.320]
Oh

[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:52.100]
By the way, he's got Alzheimer's. I just mentioned that in passing so when he quotes that we also have to oh, but he was in the Bible

[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:56.900]
And he's seen nothing. Yeah, if you think this is something. Oh, yeah

[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:02.160]
See because Reagan I mean he was just kind of like a stepper. Maybe a step underneath the Duke

[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:05.680]
But Chuck Heston he was right up there alongside he was

[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:06.140]
Much of

[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:08.460]
Macho man

[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:14.760]
If he's so much welcome he went to shuffle it away from a big fat guy like Michael Moore there, huh?

[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:20.080]
If he ought to have been embarrassed picking on an old man like that. Yeah, right. I love the nice guy Michael Moore

[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:25.440]
You go boy go for you. We got the link to a fair night 9 11 the trailer right check it out. You love it

To that website capital hill blue dot com we got the link nice going Eric

[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:42.500]
He's not taboo because he's afraid that he's gonna lose the keys to the Empire and Josh will be doing all that work

[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:44.340]
Which we thought that he wanted Josh doing the first place

[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:49.560]
Which is why I spent all that money on the computer which went about 85 hands and finally got it in Josh's hand and he's paying

[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:53.680]
For 50 bucks a month for D. S. Well, I then somebody ought to be telling me about these things

[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:59.120]
I'm not gonna expect him to be paying for it himself. What is wrong with you man? He can help. I didn't mention that

[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.600]
What he can be helping

[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:05.880]
We don't why I'm here. But in the meantime, he shouldn't be paying out of his own pocket. See him. They brain

[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:10.700]
Yeah, that's why he related that so much. Maybe he's got a brain size of a team. Yeah

[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:14.980]
Let me know how much it is. I'll take care of it 50 bucks a month

[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:21.000]
Well, but let me know for how long don't be tell me like for five years. Oh, I know some of you guys operate it all a cart like that

[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.040]
Are you pardoned you their have it or you don't?

[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:28.580]
I understand but he started at a certain point. Don't you get it? Oh, I see the back. Oh god. You are so

[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:35.380]
Just no wonder your wife hates you like poison anyway. Let's see great Stanley Cup go bold school will

[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:39.220]
Season start well the season start on time see this is the same

[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:44.000]
Chronic that facts before I think no, it's not this is Daniel how do I know Daniel, but I sure as hell doubted

[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.840]
That hockey game we saw last night that might be the last hockey and we see for a long time. Oh my god

[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.620]
Georgia survive

[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:55.100]
Gearshell survive because you don't give a flying crab about hockey anyway

[01:56:55.740 --> 01:57:00.780]
Just out of spite I should put some leaf lunch on the tap a bay. You see there you go. There's bill waters

[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:05.780]
Boys, he fat. He's a good guy. Oh, he's a good broadcaster. He was not a good GM. But he's a good broadcaster

[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:12.620]
And Don Cherey might have done his last coaches corner on cvc last night. You are aware of that aren't you?

[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:13.260]
Who?

[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:18.760]
Who should know Don Cherey? Rimmer hate you call him enough times for crying out loud. Yeah, I like him a lot more

[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:21.420]
I'm gonna give you that list of 85 people you had to call mm-hmm

[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:27.980]
The Don Chule Expressway that high knew you were full of crap the 836 is the dolphin Expressway

[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:32.120]
You better learn your expressways mister because you sure don't know. Yeah, I don't get down there's often

[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:35.580]
I'm gonna get the bridge tender all over your ass if you don't watch it. He's dead. Am I right?

[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:43.660]
Don Chule is the 874 that's why I don't know it because I never I don't think I was even ever on the 874 even when I lived in Kendall

[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:49.040]
The 836 is the dolphin Expressway anybody knows that mister the dolphin

[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:56.260]
Plus it's oh here's a very good choice very it says my voice going elsewhere, but I want to add John Pervolta. Yeah

[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:00.720]
All the way eventually see that one movie played that it was did a good job

[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:03.600]
We played the father that kid with Kirsty Ali

[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.360]
Was Kirsty Ali was sure Ali in it?

[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:08.860]
What's the name of that other movie look who's talking?

[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:15.000]
Where they were building the house and then the Jackass neighbor wanted him kept threatening to do this and do that

[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.560]
I think we're talking about different movies

[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:17.280]
Oh

[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.560]
Well, he was pretty good

[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:26.180]
Anyway, here's another let's see the C-A-N-F. Oh yeah Cuban American National Foundation, right?

[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:29.400]
And of course that immigration policy well, that's another story for another day

[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:34.320]
I can tell you stories back from W.S. News when I and S people came in but that's

[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:38.840]
Another story not I and S immigration. Yeah, I and S. La Migra

[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:43.980]
Today's pool Andy Garcia. Oh, that's a very good one. Thank you Philheim

[01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:49.900]
Villeville, wherever you are Ville or Voney. Oh, here you go and especially since I realized how ugly he was

[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:52.580]
Hayden Christensen man, that kid is grotesque

[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:54.880]
He's got zits that haven't been invented yet

[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.600]
Hayden Christensen who we thought they had a lot of makeup on he looked like he was going to be one of those cute

[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:02.040]
You know, but he's nasty looking and I don't know if he can act or not

[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:06.800]
Natalie Portman it says take your pick. They have the charisma of socially deprived granite

[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:11.400]
It says Lucas must have found them at home depot and hardware

[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:17.100]
Okay, that's cute good factors today got about a hundred more of Reagan the bastion

[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:20.880]
They're not Reagan bashing. They're just historically accurate is the way I would describe them

[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:24.920]
I mean some people can't handle the truth like Jack Nicholson would say so there you go

[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:26.820]
You know that's nobody to mention Jack Nicholson today

[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:28.420]
Thank goodness

[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:34.540]
Yeah, although if there's somebody no like them they could put him on there, but I would I would be really pissed when you

[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.580]
That would not make any sense

[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:39.500]
No, he's great

[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:44.360]
27 past known at 560 wq. I'm nobody wants to talk about cancer or heart disease

[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:46.280]
Especially thinking about yourself having it

[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:51.740]
But it's a proven fact that disease responds extremely well the treatment if you detected early several weeks ago

[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:55.820]
I went to place in Hollywood called Hollywood Diagnostic Center and I had the and it was easy

[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:58.460]
Then they may have to take on my clothes off. Thank goodness because it's embarrassing

[01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:02.100]
Hollywood Diagnostic Center is proud to announce their virtual colonoscopy

[02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:06.560]
Which is a lot less intrusive than your traditional colonoscopy and the two tests that I had

[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:14.280]
coronary heart scoring and full body screening exams like a little virtual trip right down through your lungs and through your stomach and through all your organs and all the way down to your

[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:15.000]
rectum well

[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:19.680]
And these exams can detect cancer or the life-dreatening diseases in their early stages

[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:23.940]
They don't even need a doctor's be for to take these exams before when you walk out of there with a good report

[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:29.140]
You really have peace of mind and of course if you do have something brewing then you can still catch it while it's before it's too late

I'm low-green I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders

[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:26.300]
Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:28.420]
They were from Canada

[02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:31.380]
Where everything is so much better

[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:33.920]
They were lens

[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:44.540]
Our music was a boot like positive enough beat things a lens founder mark a stand zone

[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:50.080]
Basically a Canadians are like happier than you Americans a we got like a healthcare system

[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:57.060]
They're like work say and like the crime rate is much lower here a and nobody in the middle east is like mad at us

[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:59.060]
What are you trying to say oh nothing?

[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:03.940]
Just nobody calls us to great Satan or anything a look that's enough you

[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:08.980]
You Canadian oh, it's okay. I know what the hostility is a booty

[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:15.880]
But like we're this close to legalizing marijuana here too. You are how's anything? Oh any day

[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:21.100]
Uh, listen, you think you could put me up for a few weeks. You know why let's go out of place to live. Oh sure

[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:24.160]
Great. Sorry. I got bad before. Whoa

[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:27.620]
An apology eight I've never heard an American do that

[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:35.940]
When they're upbeat positive music is shed new light on a place that just might decide not to put me in jail for getting high

[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:39.860]
It's a big juicy sopping that look at your business tonight

[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:41.000]
Uninxied about

[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:45.920]
27.01 at 560 wqm carry closes on Bush and Louisiana

[02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:50.180]
Senator John curious moving up against prison of Bush and Louisiana

[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:54.200]
And narrowing a 10 point lead held by Bush and March now to just six points the EMP reports

[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:59.020]
marketing and research institutes shows Bush leading carry 48 to 42 percent

[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:00.940]
Nearly within the margin of error of the poll

[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:04.900]
The movement could be because of carries aggressive ad buying strategy in Louisiana

[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:10.920]
You don't expect to lay entity Republican leaning state to his list of battleground states forcing the president to launch an ad counter strike

[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:12.980]
Louisiana wouldn't that be something?

[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:18.460]
And then of course, he picks that Iowa governor that we never heard of before his name already forgot as his running mate

[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:19.760]
That should the sink him I mean

[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.440]
That should do it

[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:27.120]
26 till one at 560 wqm ever been in Louisiana

[02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:33.120]
No, I can't don't have had the pleasure don't and it includes noleans okay just just pop in Southern comfort

[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:35.680]
I keep telling you that that's a good idea of pop it in your VCR

[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:40.360]
Oh, it's a great movie especially that cage on concert. They stumbled right but what you see is what you get

[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:44.660]
I guess that's why you didn't know chef Paul Prudon because he's been at cage on crap, you know cage on

[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:47.720]
Is he the one that says calling in pepper? I don't know. Yeah. He's the one

[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.660]
Oh, then I do know who that is. I think you also talk about Claude pepper over now, then

[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:57.200]
Okay, let's see Randolph T. Whole Hut. Hey, who the hell is he? Well, let me take a look here

[02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:01.880]
He's a journalist New England for the last 20 years. He writes Ronald Reagan squatted legacy

[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:08.540]
The conservatives weep and whale over the death of Ronald Reagan and lionize him as a courageous visionary who's in the same league with

[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:14.740]
Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt the president who won the Cold War and restored the nation's greatness on the international stage

[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:17.720]
Before they succeed in totally rewriting the history books

[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:24.060]
We must not forget the real Reagan record a record of immorality and corruption that far surpasses anything that Bill Clinton's ever done

[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:30.720]
Alexander Cockburn in his 1988 book Corruptions of Empire neatly summed up Ronald Reagan's legacy

[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:31.600]
Dussley

[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:39.660]
Reaganism is shorthand for a particular culture of consumption a reverie of militarism of violence redeemed of a maniac corrupted and malevolent

[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:45.900]
Idealism the priorities of this culture at the directly political level were simple enough the transfer of income from the port of the rich

[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:48.840]
The expansion of war production and an activist foreign policy

[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:52.860]
Traditional in many ways, but as noam chomsky has said at an extreme end of the spectrum

[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:59.780]
interventions aversion aggression international terrorism and general gangsterism and lawlessness the essential content of the Reagan doctrine

[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:07.300]
The Reagan the record on Reagan pretty much supports Cockburn's view Reagan didn't win the Cold War as much as benefit from forcing the Soviet Union

[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:12.300]
to spend itself into bankruptcy and collapse in effort to keep up with the U.S. and the arms race that it couldn't win

[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:15.720]
That arms race nearly bankrupted our nation in the process

[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:17.740]
Thanks to Reagan's overspending on defense

[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:20.740]
He oversaw the largest peacetime increase in national debt from

[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:24.880]
$909 billion when he entered office to 2.6 billion when he left

[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:31.320]
That's 909 million when he entered to 2.6 billion when he left in retrospect the arms buildup was completely unnecessary

[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:36.400]
Reagan purged analysts from the CIA who dared to say that the Soviets were too broke to be military threat

[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:42.960]
The CIA would later be totally caught off guard by the collapse of pro-Soviet regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989 in the breakup of the USSR

[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:43.500]
91

[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:47.700]
The foreign policy misdeeds of the Reagan years are shameful and immoral

[02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:50.660]
It funded proxy wars in El Salvador and Icaragua

[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:55.900]
Smirred the reputation of reporters and other observers who told the truth about the atrocities and killing committed by forces

[02:05:55.900 --> 02:06:02.000]
We funded training supported and others the Iran contra-affair a scandal at dwarf water-grade new cheer brazenness

[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:08.560]
Against the wishes of the U.S. Congress and the American people our government with knowledge and consent of Reagan and most of the top echelon of his administration

[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:14.740]
secretly sold weapons to Iran and used the proceeds to fund a private army to overthrow the sentinista government in Nicaragua

[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:22.980]
Laws were broken and the American people were lied to repeatedly the fact that Reagan George Herbert Walker Bush and the rest of the folks involved escape prosecution was itself a crime

[02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:27.880]
While the Reagan years were about squalid foreign policy both covert and overt

[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:29.580]
Also about unbridled greed

[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.940]
Government was the problem not the solution

[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:36.860]
Reagan and his followers proclaimed let the magic of the marketplace solve our nation's ills they told us

[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:43.560]
When a counter domestic policy the Reagan revolution hinged on a simple theory in the private sector spending borrowed money is called investment

[02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:45.740]
When the government borrow money. It's just spending

[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:47.960]
Government doesn't invest. It just consumes

[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:52.420]
And if it's not consuming it's getting in the way of free enterprise with its taxes and regulations

[02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:57.880]
This theory that the free market was infallible and government was evil was taken as gospel by the Republicans

[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:03.360]
Reagan's laissez-faire approach to economy resulted in one of the greatest transfers of wealth in this country's history

[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:10.940]
According to data gathered in federal surveys the wealthiest 20% of the U.S. received 99% of the total gains in the economy between

[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:17.700]
1983 and 1989 during that same period the richest 1% picked up 62% of the new wealth that was created

[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:24.920]
During the Reagan years the number of millionaires in the U.S. tripled while the share of our nation's wealth held by the richest 1% rose from 20%

[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:32.740]
1970 to 40% in 1990 the tax cuts of the Reagan years would drop the highest federal individual tax rate from 70 to 28%

[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:34.500]
Contributed greatly to this trend

[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:41.420]
Instead of public investment we saw social programs eliminated to pay for more tax cuts from 1980 and to 1990

[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:51.220]
Federal spending on transportation and infrastructure was cut 68% spending for education and training went down 60% and law enforcement and government expenditures declined 58%

[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:55.720]
The 1980s were an age where wealth was created not by creating new products or services

[02:07:55.720 --> 02:08:05.260]
But by dismantling and reshuffling already existing assets the people who did the dismantling made lots of money while the workers who saw their high-paying jobs disappear paid for the dismantling's profits

[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:12.240]
The idea of using governments to increase incomes reduce unemployment and maintain a social safety net is now politically unfashionable thanks to Reagan

[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:17.360]
The only public spending that's still acceptable is money for the military industrial complex and corporate welfare

[02:08:17.940 --> 02:08:21.360]
This is Ronald Reagan's real legacy to America and it's not one to celebrate

[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:24.260]
It's a legacy of criminality abroad and plunder at home

[02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:31.320]
It's a legacy of the devaluation of the public sphere and how a second-rate actor pulled off his greatest rule the genial dunce as a great leader

[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:33.080]
It's hardly a legacy to celebrate

[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:36.420]
Or I'll be telling you to the amass media to huh? That's great

[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:40.720]
You can't say that demand just croak for Krennau La

[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:42.080]
I just said it

[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:45.720]
20 to 1 in 560 QAM

[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:47.780]
My mind and local

[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:51.820]
Here's sports radio 560 QAM

[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.780]
The sky is falling

[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:56.780]
I

[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:05.680]
They're bombing them will probably close the pool again tired of those pesky summertime terrorist attacks

[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:10.980]
Where did that nerve gas come from now? I have to finish this golf game with a stupid mask on

[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:18.140]
For don't let bother some terrorist attacks get to you get a tarragon just spray and

[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:24.000]
Terror's away last year someone blew up a nuclear reactor down the street pointed at right plenty of the beach get

[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:32.260]
Terror gone stops irritating embassy bombings right where they start also great for those picnic killing biological and chemical

[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:39.400]
honey these hot dogs don't taste like I bet it's that darn anthraps again. Did you remember to bring the terror gone?

[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:41.000]
I always remember

[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:45.200]
Thanks honey you saved the day hand your life

[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:52.720]
4 out of 5 Homeland Security Directors recommend terror gone over the leading terrorism spray

[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:57.820]
So this summer when terrorism spawns get terror gone

The N. S. Red Grave or you and the Gregor out of 591 votes a lot of votes considering the fact we've been

[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:21.280]
Dilly Dallying around here, you know what?

[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:24.700]
Well, that doesn't stop him. Well, here's line 9 Q.A. M. Hello

[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:27.760]
I'll get out of here

[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:34.840]
I would put things I watched and out there for him. Let's put it on anyway. Yeah that guy like I said one of my least favorite

[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:42.780]
You're an idiot man. You just speak okay. Just once try to conduct yourself like a human being. Okay. I know it's so be an act speaking about acting

[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:46.120]
Just speak sound off like you got a pair

[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:52.180]
Yeah, pretend that you're like a real person one did just once we give you a purple star and a gold jelly being like Jerry Wittner

[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:52.960]
Of course, he still did

[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:57.300]
Okay, let me get to this other stuff. I don't want to like her run out of time here

[02:11:57.300 --> 02:12:01.380]
Okay, because I get must meet my appointed rounds. I got let's see one two. I got a few more here

[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:07.080]
Now some of the may overlap and some of the points. All though quite frankly. You can't say more than enough

[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:13.620]
Peter Preston in the British paper The Guardian writes Ronald Reagan towering. He wasn't

[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:20.960]
He was a truly great American a towering figure of our age and so on and so forth from lady Thatcher Michael Howard George

[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:25.860]
W and all who's screwed yesterday to very Ronald Reagan in an ocean of tribute

[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:31.620]
Holy edginess. What kind of a word is that in an old-reage in this ocean of tribute? How deep is that ocean?

[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:33.640]
It's amazing how fast your feet touch rocky bottom

[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:36.980]
Reagan for the moment as a particular niche in American folklore

[02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:41.100]
He came after poor care war and Jimmy Carter. He was sunshine after rain

[02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:45.200]
He made deaf jokes and read an auto cue better than any president before or since

[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.940]
He smiled and aweshocked easily a man for picket fences and peeking and pie a frank capra hero

[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:54.800]
Picking on a white house lawn the good times rolled through his eight years of power

[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:58.620]
And oh yes, he was that strong guy who won the Cold War one in quotes

[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:03.600]
Is this enough for towering greatness? Ah shucks it barely stands straight let alone tall

[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:07.920]
There was one hero of Ronnie's two terms one really strong fellow who won everything together

[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:12.620]
But his name was Jim Baker the brilliant political manager and mate of vice president George Bush

[02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:18.560]
Who became chief of staff on a crisis of competence threatening everything when Donald Reagan bailed out in the overall officer in pear shaped

[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:25.120]
Kindle like clearance is asked James A. Baker the turd was for a while the best president america never had and Ronnie upstairs

[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:28.220]
snoozing or watching TV was a passenger riding his luck

[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:33.720]
There is no point simply no point in turning Ronald Reagan into some mythic master now that he's gone

[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:38.360]
I travel campaign trails with him and lack that his jokes. He pressed flesh and political buttons better than most

[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.460]
He was hollywood on a small town visit

[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:44.660]
Maybe postcard of the US psyche did need bathing in such bomb for a while

[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:47.340]
But the reputation which flows from there is hockham squared

[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:55.100]
A champion of individual freedom see how Reagan the bosses the screen actors guild kept his head well down when McCarthy started firing

[02:13:55.100 --> 02:14:01.540]
Poisonous darts an ideal family man only if you like your families dysfunctional and your Christianity still born again

[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:06.800]
A man of action when the going gets rough in Beirut then to use the jargon he cut and ran a warrior

[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:11.460]
Only if you're recommending Grenada was tougher than a friendly against Iceland a Wizard of detail

[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:15.900]
He didn't understand Iran comfort from start to finish a non-plotter who couldn't follow the plot

[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:24.040]
Wasn't he though a true idea log of the conservative way that it was rubber a rubbish claim that even Mrs. Statcher found hard to make with a straight face

[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:27.980]
Ronald Reagan's son let years of prosperity were built from the straw ballooning deficits

[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:32.520]
Live now let old George Bush pay later. He believed in tax cuts but not hard choices

[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:34.940]
There was no pain to his gain no structural reform

[02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:38.280]
No reality of change to be vattle through he let others pick up his tabs

[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:44.860]
And as for winning that last war but two the cold one before his drugs and terrorism did Reagan piling cruise missiles into Europe

[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:48.020]
Dreaming star satellite dreams of zapping bad hats truly win anything

[02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:52.720]
Didn't he just watch the Soviet Union self-destruct on his watch was Reagan around for the Prague spring

[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:55.320]
Which told the first story of the empires disintegration?

[02:14:55.540 --> 02:15:00.900]
The plane fact which nobody discerned is that everything the West said about unsustainable economic systems and ramshaka

[02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:04.280]
bureaucracies was right the plane fact was that Soviet hegemony

[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:07.820]
Couldn't last and that the war was one mostly of mutual and comprehension

[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:10.960]
Give Ronnie credit for not dropping the ball near the basket

[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.660]
But don't make him FDR in the process

[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.920]
No, the towering lesson of Reagan's tenure was rather different

[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:22.840]
It was about what the job amount to do and how you needed to do it since the war and harding and cool the disasters 30 or more years ago

[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:24.000]
About 30 man

[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.700]
America expected and wanted more a Roosevelt to be revered a Truman to be sustained and I can experience in Kennedy field with hope

[02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:35.720]
Acute LBJ and clever of tricky dicky some of those choices went well and some were lousy

[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:40.860]
But the hurdle of effort next parties was said even higher could the system keep on producing and then

[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:46.220]
Ambling out of Sacramento in his as his 70s neared came Nancy and Ronnie in their matching check sure

[02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:51.620]
It's the record man examination have been scratched and fuzzy their friends too fat and nest-fethered for comfort

[02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:55.540]
But they talked the talk seemed to walk the walk and made the White House manageable again

[02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:59.860]
You didn't need to engage brain if you could hire it for the duration you didn't need to be brighter brinning

[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:02.160]
Ah shocks they made George W. Possible

[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:04.240]
How do you like that?

[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:08.040]
That's what they left us was Abu Gharrab that

[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:09.660]
What a legacy, eh?

[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:13.980]
These are great aren't they really Robert Perry writes

[02:16:14.620 --> 02:16:17.260]
That's P-A-R-R-Y. Well, this is a long one

[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:19.840]
Wow

[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:28.080]
AP and Newsweek writer broke many of the stories are now known as the Iran Comfort Fear currently working on a book about the secret political history of the two George Bushes

[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:28.840]
Oh, I like that

[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:33.520]
It's pretty long though. I don't want to start it now and then have to like read this interruptus

[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:37.440]
Maybe I can do this other one now before the break you think

[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:39.460]
Hmm

[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:41.440]
Now I'll try it push the break

[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:45.420]
John Nichols Reagan's politics of passion

[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:49.920]
John Nichols in the nation speaks for itself

[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:55.280]
Rest assured that the radical be working of history that America witnessed in the hours after Ronald Reagan died Saturday at 93

[02:16:55.280 --> 02:17:02.460]
Will be temporary while the over-the-top media coverage and official commentary regarding the 40th president's passing has made him out to be such a noble figure that otherwise

[02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:09.160]
Rational people have been heard to suggest that Reagan was the greatest president of the 20th century will not take long for a balancing to begin

[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:14.100]
In short order the assessments of Reagan the man and of his 10-year-in-the-oval office will be tempered

[02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:20.500]
Then conservatives and liberals will be free to consider this ideologically driven and discarded presidents record with eyes wide open

[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:26.620]
For now, however, realism is in short supply much to the detriment of not just the historical record, but of Reagan's memory

[02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:31.560]
All of a sudden the man who redirected tens of billions of dollars away from domestic needs to build up the

[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.560]
largest nuclear arsenal on the planet

[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:39.260]
ran up record deficits some members of his administration investigated and indicted at a staggering rate and

[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:43.240]
himself came close to being impeached for allowing AIDS to create a shadow government that pedal weapons

[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:48.300]
Disborn enemies of the U.S. and use the profits to fund illegal wars in central America was remade as a statesman

[02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:50.220]
We store dignity and direction to his country

[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:56.240]
Well, no one should be grudge Reagan's admirers this opportunity to replay those morning in America commercials that were deployed

[02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:59.260]
With such success during the last of the rants fourth runs for the presidency

[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:02.960]
It's a bit embarrassing to watch pundits and polls who know better embracing the spin

[02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:08.340]
The problem with all this hero worship is that the spin on the estimates and mischaracterizes Reagan

[02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:14.400]
It reduces a complex and controversial man to a blurry icon with few of the ruffages that made him one of the most remarkable

[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:15.780]
Political figures of his time

[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:20.640]
That he was remarkable doesn't mean that he was right most of what Reagan did during his two-terms governor

[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:24.780]
California and two-terms as president can most terribly be described as misguided

[02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:32.700]
Aside from his support for abortion rights during his governorship and his opposition to anti-gain issues in California during the late 70s

[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:36.960]
Reagan displayed an amazing ability to place himself on the wrong side of issues and of history

[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:39.900]
Yet there is something that liberals can and should learn from Reagan

[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:46.480]
Ronald Reagan was a master politician who understood how to package right wing ideas and appealing enough forums to get himself elected

[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.260]
And sometimes to implement his programs

[02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:55.500]
Even when Americans didn't like the ideas that Reagan was peddling as in 1984 when polls show Democrat Walter Mondale's ideas were significantly more popular

[02:18:55.500 --> 02:19:00.420]
They liked Reagan throughout his career Reagan benefited from the pension of Americans to embrace politicians

[02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:02.420]
Who seem to be at ease with their ideology

[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:07.600]
This sense that true believers are genuine creates confidence and citizens lighting itself to lines like

[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:13.260]
Even if he disagree with him you know where he stands and such lines translate an election day into votes that frequently crossed

[02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:15.020]
ideological and partisan lines

[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:21.920]
Reagan connected as a conservative by displaying an optimism about his ideology and his potential that most rightly need politicians before him

[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:28.680]
It lacked and that optimism transformed the conservative movement from a petty circle of grumbling cynics who believe that every glass was half empty and

[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:35.020]
Probably poisoned into energetic and dear it be said happy warriors on behalf of tax cuts ever more expensive weapons systems

[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:39.400]
corporate welfare privatization deregulation and the blurring of lines between church and state

[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:44.520]
In the years after Republican right-winger very gold waters landslide loss of the 64 election

[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:48.460]
Many conservatives had doubts about whether they would ever be able to pedal their programs successfully

[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:51.900]
But Reagan did not doubt he believed and his faith was infectious

[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:57.020]
It helped him be the liberal Democratic governor, California 1966 and a moderate democratic president

[02:19:57.020 --> 02:20:02.140]
1980 and it permitted a new generation of conservatives to feel they were part of a movement not just with principles

[02:20:02.140 --> 02:20:07.340]
But with the future as that movement grasped its future during Reagan's presidency and its aftermath

[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:12.360]
Liberals especially those working within the constraints of the Democratic Party began to be the ones who entertained doubts

[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:16.280]
Many Democrats gave up all together in the liberal values that a curated party with its great success

[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:18.380]
greatest successes and move to the right

[02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:21.860]
It was a tragic error for which the Democratic Party continues to pay

[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:27.680]
The lesson to be learned from Reagan is not an ideological one his ideology was wrong for America and wrong for the world

[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:32.840]
Something even Reagan sometimes recognizes when he backed away from the most extreme tenants of the conservative agenda

[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:38.540]
Do for instance defend social security and when he finally agreed at the behest of Margaret Thatcher to negotiate with reform

[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:40.120]
So we have leader Mikhail Gorbachev

[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:43.060]
Rather the lesson to be learned from Reagan is a stylistic one

[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:48.920]
He loved preaching his conservative doctrines and he loved battling with liberals at the ballot box at the debate podium and the capital

[02:20:48.920 --> 02:20:51.780]
It was a conservative first and Republican second

[02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:53.880]
He showed no respect for party decorum

[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:57.660]
Challenging a sitting Republican president Gerald Ford who he felt was too moderate

[02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:05.000]
And he was willing to lose on principle whether in that 1976 nomination with Ford or during his presidential terms and fights with Congress over tax policy

[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.320]
Foreign affairs or nominations to the US Supreme Court

[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:13.940]
Just imagine if Bill Clinton has been as committed to advancing an activist liberal ideology as Reagan was to his conservative agenda

[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:16.440]
America might have a national health care plan today

[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:19.560]
Labor law reform could have become a reality rather than empty promise

[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:23.400]
The US would certainly have a more progressive judiciary and here's another notion

[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:28.400]
If Clinton or Al Gore had put as much energy and enthusiasm in educating Americans about and promoting a liberal agenda

[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:32.580]
As Reagan did for his conservative ideals the US today would have a different Congress and president

[02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:37.980]
This willingness to fight so fearlessly and forcefully for his political faith is what made the 40th president remarkable

[02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:43.280]
It is what inspired conservatives and it is the one thing that liberals would do well to learn from Ronald Reagan

[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.520]
My life and laws this is 4256

[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:49.840]
You weigh in

[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:54.100]
But heads it's the one to two hour

[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.120]
Oh

[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:05.520]
Here we see that we're lagging

[02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:13.760]
About a headline that will be you

[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:17.480]
Absolutely

[02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:25.440]
We get

[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:30.440]
Now they I the only one

[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:31.240]
여

[02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:35.220]
Ove

[02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:36.580]
Oh

[02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:36.580]

[02:22:54.100 --> 02:23:00.100]
You say 9 or 11 is what they got you to do to me

[02:23:01.980 --> 02:23:07.380]
Can't get any rubber but a own party color to me

[02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:15.160]
You believe what they say like the fall

[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:17.200]
Like the fall of the waterfall

[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:23.660]
As they you have made the scaryest dance of the fall

[02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:29.520]
With true, those the electric ball

[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:33.780]
We got a bat, which is got his game

[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:35.160]
We got a rainbow

[02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:35.700]
A Bugara

[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:40.740]
We got a rainbow

[02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:47.180]
We got a rainbow

[02:23:47.180 --> 02:23:50.120]
We got a 60, it's our gigantic humongous smelly one to two hour

[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:53.420]
Look at that, we got a battle going on between the Duke and Cano Reeves

[02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:54.380]
Ever seen the two of together?

[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:56.520]
They both walked funny

[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:00.420]
John Wayne 86, Cano Reeves 81, Kevin Costner 79

[02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:03.460]
Just keep in mind that John Wayne's name was Miriam

[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:04.860]
I'll never forget

[02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:05.660]
Right

[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:09.660]
And anyway, Bert Randall somebody says

[02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:10.760]
And he deserves a lot of hope

[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:13.260]
It's even though we like them in Boogie Nice and in Deliverance a lot

[02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:13.820]
Right

[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:14.980]
But other than that

[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:17.180]
I think those smoking abandoned movies

[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:18.080]
Haha

[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:22.440]
All those movies he made with Dom Deloizi

[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:24.120]
I think that might have done them in

[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:25.380]
So Bert Randall's against some votes

[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:28.740]
And now somebody else who's undecided can't decide between Dan Acquired

[02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:30.800]
Which I don't know why that's on there, I like Dan Acquired

[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:32.660]
And Dustin Hoffman, which I like him both

[02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:34.140]
But we'll put him on there just to make you happy

[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:34.480]
I'll say

[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:35.240]
Okay

[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:38.180]
Adam Rubin from moveon.org

[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:41.580]
From moveon.pack emails

[02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:44.540]
And I'm sure a lot of you you're probably on this thing to our yes indeed

[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:45.100]
Good

[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:48.760]
Says do you move on member if you've seen election coverage lately you know that

[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:50.520]
Although John Kerry is growing stronger

[02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:53.180]
Although you never know that about the complexion of his face

[02:24:53.180 --> 02:24:56.820]
And President Bush is supportive of this folder and the country is still almost evenly divided

[02:24:56.820 --> 02:25:01.660]
This means election will hinge on turnout which team can most effectively get its supporters to vote

[02:25:02.380 --> 02:25:06.280]
Simply put to win we must speak to millions of our fellow Americans about what's the stake in November

[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:08.780]
And why every single vote will count if we do this

[02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:13.020]
We will take back the White House and put a stop to the Bush administration's assault on the environment

[02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:17.280]
Civil liberties jobs, choice, civil rights access to healthcare, not to mention world peace

[02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:22.060]
This Saturday June 12 is the second election action day

[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:28.280]
And move on members will be hitting into a neighborhoods to register and or mobilize progressive voters and local areas

[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:32.280]
As you may know you live in a battleground state that will be critical in the sighting of November election

[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:33.160]
Please help

[02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:38.540]
And it says see details that your local events sign up at and then it's got a link for you to click

[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.000]
Says on May 8 almost 10,000 move on members contacted hundreds of thousands of voters during the first ever

[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.440]
National election action day held in coalition with dozens of allied groups

[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:50.420]
It was the biggest one-day voter member of the mobilization effort in American history

[02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:54.680]
An incredible display of the impact that concerned citizens can have when we put together

[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:55.540]
Think of this

[02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:00.980]
If each move on member registers two people between now and November as this volunteer did

[02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:05.480]
Will register four million voters easily enough to sway the outcome of the presidential election

[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:11.400]
If we each register ten will have registered twenty million voters and change the voter landscape of this country completely

[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:15.020]
If you've never done this before this kind of voter mobilization march on intimidating

[02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:20.880]
But move on members told us again and again how glad they were made to have had a chance to do it

[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:22.040]
How you like that?

[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:26.740]
So that's this Saturday what I would do is just to go to move on.org if you remember or even if you're not yet

[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:28.400]
Out to check it out.

[02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:28.980]
Went out

[02:26:30.740 --> 02:26:37.980]
Rating Reagan a bogus legacy this will have to be a two-parter because I'll never I don't want to like rush through it by Robert Perry

[02:26:37.980 --> 02:26:42.880]
I don't want to pop any oxys while I'm reading it

[02:26:43.380 --> 02:26:49.220]
Robert Perry in the 80s while with the Associated Press and Newsweek he broke many of the stories now known as the Iran Congress scandal

[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:54.480]
He's currently working on a book about the secret political history of George Bush one and George both the W of two

[02:26:56.080 --> 02:27:03.480]
He says the US Newsweek is reaction to Ronald Reagan's death is putting on display what has happened to the American public debate in the year since Reagan's political rise in the late 70s

[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:07.800]
A near total collapse of serious analytical thinking at the national level

[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:09.660]
Analytical thinking

[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:16.740]
Across the US television dialed in a major American newspapers the commentary is spawning almost in a provd-like way

[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:19.860]
Far beyond the normal reticence against speaking ill of the dead

[02:27:19.860 --> 02:27:27.320]
Left the center commentators compete with conservatives to hail Reagan supposedly geneal style and his alleged role in winning the Cold War

[02:27:27.860 --> 02:27:32.540]
The Washington Post front headline Ronald Reagan dies was in giant type more fitting the moon landing

[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:40.120]
Yet absent from the media commentary was the one fundamental debate that must be held before any reasonable assessment commemediated Ronald Reagan as presidency

[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:42.580]
How why and when was the Cold War one?

[02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:49.860]
If for instance the United States was already on the verge of victory over a foundering Soviet Union in the early to mid 70s as some analysts believe

[02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:54.160]
Then Reagan's two historic role may not have been winning the Cold War but helping to extend it

[02:27:54.940 --> 02:28:03.160]
If the Soviet Union was already enraped to climb rather than the ascendancy that Reagan believed in the massive US military build up in the 80s was not decisive it was excessive

[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:09.940]
The terrible bloodshed in Central American African including dead squad activities by US clients was not some necessary evil

[02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:12.940]
It was a war crime aided and abetted by the Reagan administration

[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:23.700]
That debate however has never been engaged except by Reagan accolades who choose to glorify Reagan's role in winning the Cold War rather than examining the assumptions that got it as policies in the 70s and 80s

[02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:35.140]
Although it's largely forgotten now Reagan's rise within the Republican Party was as a challenger to the Daytona strategies pursued by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger before the Watergate scandal forced Nixon from office and later by Gerald Ford

[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:41.560]
They thought was in effect an effort to ease the Cold War to an end much as finally occurred in the late 1980s and early 90s

[02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:55.140]
Cold War years Nixon and Kissinger along with much of the Western Telda's community had recognized the systemic weakness of the Soviet Union which was falling desperately behind the Western technology and the ability to produce consumer goods desired by the peoples of Eastern Europe

[02:28:55.300 --> 02:29:05.360]
One only needed a look at nighttime satellite photos to see the disparity between the glittering city lights of North America, Western Europe and parts of Asia compared to the darkness across the Soviet block

[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:14.620]
Under this analysis of Soviet weakness the 1970s was the time for the Western would set victory and begin transitioning in the Soviet Union and out of its fairly economic model

[02:29:14.620 --> 02:29:22.040]
Not only could that approach have hastened the emergence of a new generation of Russian reformers it would have allowed world leaders to pull back from the edge of nuclear confrontation

[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:27.020]
Third world civil wars also could have been addressed as local conflicts not east west test of strength

[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:34.520]
But American conservatives and a new group of neo-cons who would become the ideological backbone of the Reagan administration saw the situation differently

[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:42.560]
They insisted that the Soviet Union was on the rise militarily with pants to surround the U.S. and eventually conquered by attacking through the soft underbelly of Central America

[02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:55.920]
In 1976 then CIA director George Herbert Walker Bush gave an important boost to this apocalyptic vision by allowing a group of conservative analysts including young Paul Wolfowitz inside the CIA's analytical division

[02:29:55.920 --> 02:30:12.460]
The group known as the B team team B was permitted to review highly classified U.S. intelligence on the Soviet Union

[02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:21.900]
Along with the team B analysis came the theories of academic Jean Kirkpatrick who made a name for himself and an analysis that differentiated between authoritarian and totalitarian governments

[02:30:21.900 --> 02:30:31.000]
In Kirkpatrick's theory right wing authoritarian governments were preferable to left wing communist governments because authoritarian governments could have allowed for democracy while communist governments couldn't

[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:40.200]
These two factors the team B take on the military rise of the Soviet block and in Kirkpatrick doctrine's view of immutable communist regimes guided Reagan's foreign policy

[02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:52.180]
Reagan relied on these analyses to justify both his massive U.S. military build up in the 80s which put the U.S. government deeply into debt and his support for right wing regimes that engage in blood vats against their opponents especially across Latin America

[02:30:52.840 --> 02:31:01.740]
As far back as the late 1970s for example Reagan defended the Argentine military junta while it was engaged in the use of state terror and was disappearing tens of thousands of dissidents

[02:31:01.740 --> 02:31:09.160]
Those tactics included barbaric acts such as cutting babies out of pregnant women so the mothers could then be executed while the babies were given to the murderers

[02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:17.420]
In the 1980s and Guatemala Reagan ate in military regimes that weighed scorched earth campaigns against rural peasants including genocide against Indian populations

[02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:27.620]
Reagan personally attacked the human rights reports describing atrocities inflicted on hundreds of May invilages on December 4, 1982 after meeting with Guatemala and dictator General Efron Rios Mont

[02:31:27.620 --> 02:31:33.120]
Reagan hailed the general as totally dedicated to democracy and asserting that Rios Mont's government was getting a bum rat

[02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:41.980]
tens of thousands more people died at the hands of right wing security forces in El Salvador and Honduras while the Nicaragua run a Reagan funnel support to the converse

[02:31:41.980 --> 02:31:50.120]
who behave like kind of a death squad and waiting committing widespread atrocities against Nicaragua and civilians while funding some operations with a cocaine trafficking to the U.S.

[02:31:50.980 --> 02:31:58.160]
If followed after or if followed that if the Soviet Union were on the verge of world conquest and it would mean permanent slavery then desperate measures were required

[02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:09.300]
But the problem with the TB analysis in the Kirkpatrick document is that both were wrong. The evidence is now clear that by the 1970s the Soviet Union was in sharp decline both economically and militarily

[02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:19.120]
Rather than some grandiose strategy for World Conquest Moscow was in largely defensive posture try to hold in line countries near its borders such as Eastern Europe and Afghanistan

[02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:27.700]
The Helsinki Accords for Human Rights also were put in the Soviet Union under greater pressure as this incident movement such as Poland solidarity took shape within Moscow sphere of influence

[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:33.000]
Besides greater personal freedom Soviet block residents wanted the higher quality consumer goods available in the West

[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:38.820]
Even a bigger threat to Moscow's power was the growing chasm between Western technological advances and Soviet backwardness

[02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:46.920]
By the late 70s and 80s the relatively modest assistance that Moscow handed out to friendly third world regime such as Cuba and Nicaragua was more showed in substance

[02:32:48.060 --> 02:32:53.840]
The Soviet Union had become a national potentian villagy how allowed economy and bankrupt political system would nuclear weapons

[02:32:53.840 --> 02:33:00.080]
Along with the miscalculations of team B strategic analysis they Kirkpatrick doctrine failed to stand the test of time

[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:07.620]
Democratic government sprouted across Eastern Europe and the Sandinistas conceded defeat in Nicaragua not as Koch has marched into Managua but following a lost election

[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:14.100]
Indeed if the Soviet Union had been what American conservatives claimed the nation marching toward world supremacy in the early 80s

[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:16.740]
How would one explain its rapid collapse only a few years later?

[02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:25.860]
After all the Soviet Union was invaded or conquered its troops did suffer losses in Afghanistan but that would have no more brought down a true superpower than the Vietnam defeat could cause the US to collapse

[02:33:26.940 --> 02:33:34.080]
Despite these facts the right wing's historical take on the Cold War was one has been broadly accepted with the elite opinion circles of the US

[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:41.940]
Reagan's hard line stance toward the Soviet Union caused the communist to crumble given how powerful the right wing meeting machine had gotten by the early 90s

[02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:47.980]
Liberals largely chose to see the Cold War debate of the conservatives and tried to shift the public's focus to future US domestic needs

[02:33:47.980 --> 02:33:54.040]
So instead of a soul searching examination of the unnecessary loss of blood and treasure the nation got a feel good history

[02:33:54.040 --> 02:34:04.340]
Gone was any reassessment of the alarmist views associated with Ronald Reagan and ideological cohorts gone were any questions about whether the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars on new weapon systems was justified

[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:09.760]
Whether the US government should be held accountable for the brutal accesses of counterinsurgency wars in Central America

[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:21.080]
The unpleasant history was shunned or decided or covered up when declassified US government documents led to a judgment by a Guatemalan troop commission that the Reagan administration and aided an embedded genocide it was a one-day story

[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:30.120]
When a CIA inspector general confirmed that many country units had engaged in drug trafficking and were protected by the Reagan administration the mainstream press only grudgingly acknowledged the story

[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:42.680]
Another little notice part of the Reagan legacy was his credentialing of a generation of the conservative operatives who learned the importance of manipulating intelligence from team B and about managing the perceptions of the American people from the Nicaraguan contra war

[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:54.000]
As Walter Raymond Reagan's chief of public diplomacy was fond of saying about how to sell the Nicaraguan conflict of the American people the goal was to glue black cats on the left to sand and the east and white hats on the contrary

[02:34:54.820 --> 02:35:06.680]
George W. Bush's strategy for rallying the American public behind the war in Iraq with hyped intelligence about military threats and extreme rhetoric about the evil of US adversaries follows the game plan drawn up by Reagan's national security team in the 80s

[02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:18.200]
Arguably to another troubling part of Ronald Reagan's legacy is the press corps stultifying version of recent American history a superficiality richly on display in the media peons to Reagan following his death

[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:21.900]
Oh well, I think I'm out of steam

[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:24.780]
You getting the message?

[02:35:25.460 --> 02:35:27.560]
113 at 560 QAM

[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:29.480]
My and local

[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:31.820]
This is 440560

[02:35:31.820 --> 02:35:33.840]
The way to QAM

[02:35:35.740 --> 02:35:36.980]
We're like a young man

[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:38.840]
I got the costume you've been up to!

[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:46.000]
But for animals it was three months that changed everything just thinking all along

[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.680]
You just need to let in the people who love you

[02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:50.320]
If I don't let people in, they can't let me hurt me

[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:55.920]
And a life is about the letting in of the people who love you to let them in and to trust them to catch you when they fall in love

[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:03.820]
And I don't like this toxic morning

[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:05.620]
You know what daddy looks like saying hate you

[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:09.480]
Hannah, it's your daughter, father

[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:11.020]
And find someone!

[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.820]
Sometimes from the people you love fall, they don't catch you on the way down

[02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:21.160]
But your heart and your love aren't the same thing yet for the eternity of life's inner fighter

[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:25.940]
On August 29th open your heart and pick it up when it falls

[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:27.920]
Mandy Moore or Jessica Beale

[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:29.820]
Sometimes the one that went James' real life

[02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:31.440]
A real life of the day

[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:36.640]
That introducing Jake Renway for the person who loved isn't there to catch you on the train before

[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:38.640]
You know, dying real life

[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:42.440]
They start every movie with basically the same plot

[02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:44.820]
Pretty white teens with problems

[02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:47.400]
118 at 560 WQM

[02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:48.980]
Here's a go on for the poll, Ben Affleck

[02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:50.700]
Yeah, amen

[02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:54.340]
Says throw JLo in there, they both sucks his feet

[02:36:54.340 --> 02:36:55.880]
Well JLo is already doing very well

[02:36:55.880 --> 02:36:57.220]
She's moving on up rapidly

[02:36:58.120 --> 02:36:59.600]
Facts she's already in fifth place

[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:04.260]
John Wayne 89, Ken O'Rees 84, Kevin Coste 82, James Dean 70

[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:07.180]
And JLo is moving right up on her ass 45

[02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:08.440]
Although I think they're all safe

[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.100]
Fueyde Roberts 44, Marilyn Monroe 39, Will Smith got 32

[02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:14.020]
I'm pleased as punch to see that

[02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:19.020]
Elvis 29, Vin Diesel 26, Arnold 24, Mel Gibson 16

[02:37:19.020 --> 02:37:20.840]
Everybody else has got the old single digits

[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:25.320]
Well we had a Facts yesterday from Stuttering Gill and Homestead member

[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:26.400]
Yes it is

[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:30.580]
About Al Gore and the Mayor of Penis, Virginia

[02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:31.940]
Yeah, I got to figure out how I sent

[02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:36.340]
Gore says, and this was in Sunday's hero, which I admit

[02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:38.160]
Sorry about that, Kiel, the better life than never

[02:37:38.160 --> 02:37:40.340]
So I looked it up and I'm glad I did

[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:43.380]
Former vice president Al Gore

[02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:45.600]
Who you notice lately he's starting to get

[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:48.100]
I wish he would have put stuff like this for the four

[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:52.440]
Al Gore, they drag the good name

[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:58.180]
Of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein

[02:37:58.180 --> 02:37:59.920]
Horts your breath

[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:01.840]
Abu Gharr rape that one, yeah

[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:05.940]
Former vice president Al Gore who lost the 2000 presidential election

[02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:09.300]
by allegedly 537 votes in Florida on Saturday called

[02:38:09.300 --> 02:38:13.900]
Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelos the most the single most treacherous

[02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:16.200]
And Dessana's person I dealt with during the campaign

[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:17.720]
Anywhere in America

[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.520]
Absolutely correct sir

[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:22.540]
The statement was emailed by a Gore spokesman in response to a

[02:38:22.540 --> 02:38:25.080]
Harold inquiry about Penelos' role in the 2000 campaign

[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:27.740]
Gore's support to say the vice president had counted on

[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:29.640]
Penelos for a late boost in the Hispanic community

[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:31.640]
And the Mayor didn't come through

[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:34.960]
What a stunky is man at Penelos

[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:36.300]
What a puss

[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:40.400]
The harsh remarks came just to be must before Penelos faces a democratic

[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:41.960]
primary election for the U.S. Senate

[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:45.200]
Gore's reproach could seriously damage the Mayor's bid

[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:47.140]
to succeed Senator Bob Graham

[02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:48.800]
Oh rack since party loyalist

[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:50.260]
Tend to dominate turn out in a primary

[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:54.460]
In a telephone interview Saturday evening Penelos defended himself

[02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:57.420]
saying he was by Gore's side from the very beginning

[02:38:57.420 --> 02:38:59.820]
Oh my God

[02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:02.120]
Al Gore has a right to be upset about the election

[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:04.460]
but he had he won his home state of Tennessee or West Virginia

[02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:06.100]
We wouldn't be here Penelos said

[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:08.520]
He also role as an explanation is to why he waited until

[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:10.060]
the middle of October to engage in Florida

[02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:14.900]
He said Gore had declined to return his phone calls to discuss the 2000 campaign

[02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:19.720]
The Mayor has been defending his loyalty to Gore for a full year in response to attacks from his Democratic rival

[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:21.500]
U.S. Representative Peter Doich

[02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:22.100]
Hugo Peter

[02:39:22.900 --> 02:39:27.300]
The congressman went so far as to boycott last June's Florida Democratic party dinner in his hometown of Hollywood

[02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:29.460]
because Penelos was receiving an award there

[02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:34.700]
Then at a recent forums Penelos has described himself as a strong Gore supporter

[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:36.120]
but the vice president statement said

[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:38.660]
Not all who claimed to have been supportive and loyal

[02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:39.540]
Truly were

[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:42.900]
Gore who rarely gives interviews added in his statement

[02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:48.600]
As the campaign moves forward and when appropriate I'll have more to say about this and we can't wait for that

[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:49.780]
Stick it to him Al

[02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:50.860]
Stick it

[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:54.900]
Stick both of your feet right up his old back to shoot

[02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:58.380]
In fact, Gore went out of his way to praise Doich

[02:39:58.380 --> 02:39:59.940]
who has served in Congress since 1992

[02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:00.900]
saying in the statement

[02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:04.780]
Peter Doich is a good and dear friend who's been a stand-up leader for our party in difficult times

[02:40:04.780 --> 02:40:07.120]
such as the 2000 election in the Republican Florida

[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:09.900]
Penelos did help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Gore

[02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:12.880]
when he ran with Bill Clinton in 96 and when he headed the ticket in 2000

[02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:18.520]
During one fundraising trip to Miami, Gore and Penelos toasted the victory with Cuban Capacitos

[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:19.220]
What is that?

[02:40:19.420 --> 02:40:19.920]
Little coffee

[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:21.080]
Devitasis

[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:23.440]
At the reception Penelos gushed to the crowd

[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:25.860]
We're so looking forward to calling you President Gore

[02:40:26.380 --> 02:40:28.940]
The mayor also touted Gore on Spanish language radio

[02:40:28.940 --> 02:40:30.740]
a main source of political news for Hispanic voters

[02:40:30.740 --> 02:40:33.360]
There were rumors that he might even become his running mate

[02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:36.720]
The political horror that he is mayor penis pecania

[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:39.260]
But relations between the two men afraid

[02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:45.100]
After five-year-old Ilyan Gonzalez was rescued at sea on Thanksgiving Day 1999

[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:50.820]
Many from Penelos' political base, the heavily-re-publican Cuban-American community

[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:55.600]
Tucked to the streets in rage when federal agencies little Ilyan need to a gunpoint

[02:40:55.600 --> 02:40:58.180]
from his relative's home in Senabaku's father in Cuba

[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:01.120]
They seized him right on the hands of the fisherman

[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:06.480]
Though President Clinton and Attorney General Janorino were the most visible players during the crisis

[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:10.920]
Many Cuban ex-ozlumped Gore with a federal government that returned the boy to a oppressive regime

[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:17.480]
Penelos kept his distance too instead of joining Gore when he clenched the Democratic nomination in March in Tallahassee

[02:41:18.100 --> 02:41:20.040]
Penelos attended his own fundraisers there

[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:24.180]
And August he skipped the Democratic National Convention to focus on his eight-relection opponents

[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:28.440]
On October 18th of the day after his swearing in, Penelos was a no-show

[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:30.960]
And he has spanned a get-out to vote rally in Ilyan

[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:34.260]
Later that day he and his wife headed to Spain to his Spania

[02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:38.720]
On a trip that was part vacation, part trade mission, he didn't return to October 30th

[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:39.540]
But third man!

[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:40.460]
The week before the election

[02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:45.240]
Mitchell Berger, a leading Gore fundraisers, said he and others helped raise out of state money for Penelos

[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:49.780]
So we could have let her run off and spend more time rallying his spaniac voters for the Vice President

[02:41:49.780 --> 02:41:55.000]
Alice Penelos did not help Al Gore during the most crucial time said Berger, who was supporting Deutsche

[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.120]
Deutsche in contrast was a constant presence of the Broward County

[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:05.000]
Re-County called for a federal investigation of rowdy protest to date at the Re-County for Chaut Thalminos

[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.500]
Jack gases from out of town were sent in so they could pound on the door going

[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:10.240]
Plantassin! Plantassin!

[02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:14.440]
He hosted fundraisers for Gore and donated 250 grand from his congressional account

[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:17.180]
One of the largest contributions of its kind to a national campaign

[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:21.960]
Both supporters and critics of Deutsche thought his assault on Penelos might backfire

[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:24.720]
Gore statement gives Deutsche more ammunition than he could hope for

[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:29.780]
I would like to thank the Vice President for his gracey short support and for saying what needed to be said

[02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:36.920]
Deutsche through spokesman Roy Tysher, former Florida Education Commissioner Betty Kaster, Hollywood businessman Bernard Klein will also be on the primary ballot

[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:37.820]
They got no chance

[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:43.360]
Although Penelos has been politics for 17 years, this is the first time he's run as a Democrat

[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:50.120]
All of his past campaigns for the highly the, the higher lea city council, date counter commission and date mayor of Vinnon Partisan

[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:55.700]
Still he's been one of the party's best fundraisers, he's also embraced core Democratic values for sending for gun control

[02:42:55.700 --> 02:43:00.220]
Standing up for gay rights and spreading a constitutional amendment to require public pre-kindergarten

[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:04.540]
If some people want to measure my Democratic credentials by the 2000 election that's fine Penelos said

[02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:08.000]
I've been loyal and dedicated Democrat for a long time, you should live so long

[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:09.380]
How do you like that huh?

[02:43:10.300 --> 02:43:13.880]
That alienator thing, man that was the real chigger in a wood pile right there

[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:21.540]
Little alienator and the abortless and sister Jean the dancer machine and Jen Arino and the fisherman and the Marys Grisi ass

[02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:26.780]
And the drunken relatives and the planes you playing there was a little alien to the backyard

[02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:30.360]
Is it playing he was doing his best early feelings of imitation in Espanol?

[02:43:30.740 --> 02:43:32.140]
Is it playing take me back to Cuba?

[02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:36.420]
Oh no, that's not what you meant. Oh no, no, whatever, whatever you say

[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:41.860]
All right, let's get some more calls in here because I'm just, I don't know what the hell inspired me on this

[02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:46.180]
I don't know this, huh? It's fun. What? I'm enjoying it.

[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:51.040]
Fun for you because you're sitting back around your ass not having to listen to all these important callers that we get

[02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:58.240]
Although a circuit court trial date of July 26th has been set this more of Josh's alley since he's a jocks nipper

[02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:03.580]
A circuit court date trial of July 26th has been set for Miami football recruit Willie Williams

[02:44:03.580 --> 02:44:05.560]
Does anybody care about Willie Williams? No.

[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:11.840]
On a felony charge, you're illegally setting off fire extinguishers even as attorney continued to seek a plea bargain that would lower the

[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:15.300]
Led's offense to a misdemeanor. Come on boys, I'll be boys. Let Willie play.

[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:18.560]
Well, even I can't believe that. Okay, setting off the fire.

[02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:21.580]
Remember that? Yeah. Why don't we care about that?

[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:26.760]
He was also charged with a misdemeanor for hugging a woman against her will on the same visit to a gainsville.

[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:31.500]
Oh boy, and his due back in gainsville on June 15th for a case management conference on that

[02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:36.680]
It's defense for a case management conference. What is that? That's illegal down by the way. What what?

[02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:42.280]
Hugging women against their will. Yeah, I just walked up to him kind of like giving him a big hug in the case only Richard Simmons is

[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:47.420]
Love to do that. Oh, and also the guy that used to be on PBS. What was his name? That screamer that

[02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:53.460]
BAAAMING Mr. Rogers. No, no, no. The guy that used to have that show where he'd go out in the audience and

[02:44:53.460 --> 02:44:57.620]
Give him a nice delicious hug. What was that guy that that pseudo like a

[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:02.560]
Screaming doctor feel that kind of guy. Well, you know who I'm talking about. No. Yes, you do.

[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:07.600]
We used to talk about him all the time. We did? Yeah, he wants to give you a nice delicious hug.

[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:12.940]
A delicious hug? Delicious. The Scotty.

[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:19.320]
Biscotti. Biscalia. You got it. Now where did that come from?

[02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:23.800]
Bokehbride is in the studio here. Oh Leo Biscadia. That's the one that he was with that.

[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:29.300]
Wasn't he the love doctor something like that they called him? The love doctor. I don't know that guy. I know what he was.

[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:35.000]
BAAAMING! I'll be honest with you. If it would have been me, I'd have given hugs to much better looking people

[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.820]
And then I guess I guess to get to one good one you got a hug a few ugly people first right? That's what I always say.

[02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:45.500]
27 after one at five sixty WQM. Hey, by now you all know about balance for life. Is that correct?

[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:49.580]
Yeah. And we know the big issue for most of you is should you do the five day plan or the seven day plan.

[02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:54.240]
People are having fist fights about this all over town. And the five day plan doesn't include the weekends.

[02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:59.660]
But if you just want a few meals on Saturday and Sunday the seven day plans good all the meals. But what if you have dinner plans for the weekend?

[02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:04.580]
It's all or nothing with that seven day plan. Well now balance for life being the ingenious people that they are.

[02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:09.960]
They created the six day plan on Friday night you'll get one bag one sack for the entire weekend.

[02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:13.360]
Kind of like what mode tries to use so you can choose which meals you want to eat and when.

[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:18.240]
The best part about this plan is since balance for life is the only meal delivery service that offers you choices.

[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:22.820]
You can choose meals from either of these Saturday at Sunday menu. I hope you're following this because it's pretty complicated.

[02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:29.820]
And add to this plan if you tell the wonderful people at balance for life where you're going to eat out they'll tell you which items on the menu are balanced for life approved.

[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:35.040]
What a complete service and balance for life is working exclusively with the few local restaurants, the label menu items.

[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:38.760]
Balance for life approved one of these days. They'll let us know which restaurants they are. We'll tell you.

[02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:43.660]
So move over atkins the zone is the way to go to lose that fan that disgusting unhealthy.

[02:50:00.580 --> 02:50:02.180]
You win.

[02:50:02.180 --> 02:50:05.220]
Because these millions and millions of new people are coming to Florida.

[02:50:05.540 --> 02:50:07.980]
They're not the old banana boat crowd that, you know, your people.

[02:50:08.220 --> 02:50:10.440]
Yeah, Miguel reminds me they could they call it food ball.

[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:11.960]
They call her what?

[02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:12.580]
Food ball.

[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:14.800]
Yeah, food ball with a UFUTBOL.

[02:50:15.060 --> 02:50:15.480]
That's correct.

[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:16.440]
Food ball.

[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:17.560]
What does he know?

[02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:22.560]
Anyway, speaking of, let's take some calls, okay, because I'm just burned out.

[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:24.020]
I think I overdid it today.

[02:50:24.420 --> 02:50:27.840]
I apologize profusely, not for just reading.

[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:31.440]
This is like those awful seven months when I just said here reading and reading.

[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:34.160]
And Miguel hated it like poison in which that I would die.

[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:35.780]
It just despised it.

[02:50:36.100 --> 02:50:36.780]
Hated it.

[02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:37.160]
Yes.

[02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:38.600]
Well, too bad.

[02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:42.720]
I'm not programming some banana boat mentality like you used to have it until you finally

[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:43.220]
wise up.

[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:46.180]
Until you finally realized what fashion is it really all about?

[02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:46.720]
Huh?

[02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:51.140]
See, he didn't think fascism was all that bad thinking back to Batista.

[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:52.780]
But what the hell does he know about Batista?

[02:50:52.980 --> 02:50:54.460]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8?

[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:55.380]
He made the trains run in time.

[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:56.480]
Who do you like better?

[02:50:56.760 --> 02:50:57.800]
Fashista or Kamonista?

[02:50:58.440 --> 02:50:59.080]
Or Batista?

[02:50:59.300 --> 02:51:00.840]
Oh, I know how to be good watch.

[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:01.980]
WQM, hello.

[02:51:04.060 --> 02:51:05.500]
I told you I knew it.

[02:51:06.180 --> 02:51:06.800]
WQM, hello.

[02:51:09.140 --> 02:51:09.860]
Who I am?

[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:11.320]
Hey, Uncle Neil.

[02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:12.160]
Yes, sir.

[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.440]
I'm sure I'll be beaten this today with this intensive pockety crowd.

[02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:17.980]
But how about them cuff finals?

[02:51:19.060 --> 02:51:19.260]
Yeah.

[02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:21.700]
Oh, we have one call on it.

[02:51:22.460 --> 02:51:23.100]
Are you serious?

[02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:24.240]
I miss most of the show.

[02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:25.780]
I mean, I was kind of in sarcastic.

[02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:27.040]
I thought somebody would have called.

[02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:28.120]
No, not one.

[02:51:28.580 --> 02:51:31.780]
I would have played the closing seconds of the game in a crowd reaction.

[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:32.480]
I played it twice.

[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:36.260]
But no calls because we have no hockey fans in South Florida in addition to which they're

[02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:40.280]
jealous of the attempt of eight lightweights who played so great in the Brad Richards and

[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:42.280]
Nikolai Hobby Bullin in the whole crowd.

[02:51:42.580 --> 02:51:45.700]
And a great play that the Vinyalik Cavalier made us out of the second goal.

[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:47.320]
That was awesome.

[02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:48.540]
Awesome series.

[02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:49.900]
I know.

[02:51:49.960 --> 02:51:51.380]
I guess it was not an awesome series.

[02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:53.840]
It got exciting when it got to the sixth game.

[02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:57.220]
Some of the first four or five games, man, we just coma inducing.

[02:51:57.220 --> 02:51:58.240]
It was pretty bad crap.

[02:51:58.740 --> 02:52:01.880]
But when it got to the sixth game and that went over time and then we set up that seventh

[02:52:01.880 --> 02:52:05.420]
game, I don't know how you can not have an exciting aesthetic up final when it goes to

[02:52:05.420 --> 02:52:05.980]
the seventh game.

[02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:07.120]
It was pretty intense.

[02:52:07.420 --> 02:52:08.120]
I hear that.

[02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:08.600]
What was it like?

[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:11.600]
It was only 16th one in the top series.

[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:12.060]
Is that right?

[02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:12.960]
That went to the seventh?

[02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:13.940]
Something like that.

[02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:15.200]
13 or 16.

[02:52:16.940 --> 02:52:19.340]
Now, I'm really kind of out of the loop.

[02:52:19.620 --> 02:52:22.620]
Are we not looking at no season for next year still as of right now?

[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:23.600]
Don't look too good.

[02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:24.980]
Oh, man.

[02:52:24.980 --> 02:52:26.280]
You got two group balls.

[02:52:26.460 --> 02:52:27.860]
You've got Bob Goodnell on the one side.

[02:52:27.860 --> 02:52:28.600]
It was a jackass.

[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:31.520]
You got Gary Atbetman who's a little trip who's in denial on the other side.

[02:52:31.740 --> 02:52:34.380]
And I don't see any way that they're going to prevent a lockout.

[02:52:34.440 --> 02:52:35.400]
I just can't see it.

[02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:40.260]
And if they do have a lockout, I think the NHL of future, the whole league is in real

[02:52:40.260 --> 02:52:41.360]
big trouble if they do that.

[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:42.560]
Nice.

[02:52:43.040 --> 02:52:43.160]
Nice.

[02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:43.840]
Yeah.

[02:52:44.060 --> 02:52:48.460]
What do you think of the coaching change with Florida now with my keen and being the

[02:52:48.460 --> 02:52:48.500]
champion?

[02:52:48.500 --> 02:52:50.200]
I think it's a disaster.

[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:51.220]
I think it's ridiculous.

[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:53.600]
They can't keen in because they didn't want them in the first place.

[02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:57.520]
Now they're bringing them back because Jacques Martan said he wanted them because they

[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:57.620]
went.

[02:52:57.980 --> 02:52:59.100]
They were college buddies together.

[02:52:59.100 --> 02:53:03.400]
All of a sudden, the bullcrap, they, Alan Cohen hasn't got any idea of how to run a franchise.

[02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:07.240]
And here, Rick Dudley, they were saying, oh, well, here's the guy that built up Tampa

[02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:08.000]
to what they are today.

[02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:08.820]
They're going to be a dynasty.

[02:53:08.820 --> 02:53:09.900]
They won a couple last night.

[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:11.080]
And now Rick Dudley's gone.

[02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:12.920]
So what was all that BS about?

[02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:18.540]
Alan Cohen, he's just flailing around desperately because the franchise is on the way out

[02:53:18.540 --> 02:53:18.660]
of him.

[02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:18.920]
I'm afraid.

[02:53:20.180 --> 02:53:21.540]
Oh, God help us all.

[02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:22.320]
Thanks for catching me up.

[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:22.980]
Good luck, Palli.

[02:53:23.100 --> 02:53:24.160]
And say how the guilty of the game.

[02:53:25.340 --> 02:53:27.320]
I'm sorry to be the Vera bad news like that.

[02:53:27.420 --> 02:53:28.620]
But nevertheless, let's see.

[02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:29.780]
Here's hiding under the bed.

[02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:30.780]
Mine, he's still under there.

[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:32.840]
But it came out in time to fax this to us.

[02:53:33.300 --> 02:53:35.380]
I attended the Florida Democratic Convention last year.

[02:53:35.740 --> 02:53:38.940]
Alex Penelope was the only person booed by the people when he got up to speak.

[02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:40.280]
They really stuck it to him.

[02:53:40.300 --> 02:53:41.640]
All I can say to that is, good.

[02:53:42.100 --> 02:53:42.820]
Well deserved Alex.

[02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:43.500]
You liar.

[02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:44.040]
You phony.

[02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:46.220]
Hey, I wonder how he and what his name were doing.

[02:53:46.300 --> 02:53:46.740]
Mickey Harrison.

[02:53:47.140 --> 02:53:48.760]
He slipped to Mickey to the voters in day two.

[02:53:49.020 --> 02:53:49.920]
People forget about that.

[02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:52.500]
At liar, liar, your Guava, Arizona fire.

[02:53:53.720 --> 02:53:55.280]
It says I'll miss Schmidt myself.

[02:53:55.280 --> 02:53:56.780]
I heard the VP shortlist for Kerry.

[02:53:56.780 --> 02:53:58.440]
Not since the Libra man picked by L.

[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:00.920]
Have I heard such miserable nomination news?

[02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:02.080]
Michael Moore for VP.

[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:03.080]
Could you please?

[02:54:03.080 --> 02:54:03.440]
All right.

[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:06.120]
There's a great idea.

[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:06.800]
I'm all for that.

[02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:08.100]
Let's do it.

[02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:12.240]
Then it says could you please play the Al Gore Macarena?

[02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:15.460]
Well, you can find it.

[02:54:15.460 --> 02:54:17.000]
Now look for Al Gore.

[02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:19.820]
Al Gore, as you have never heard of, was she?

[02:54:21.380 --> 02:54:25.420]
Four years ago, you gave me your nomination to be by the present.

[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:27.300]
This is a sunflower.

[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:32.420]
I've been watching you during that Macarena on television.

[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:41.180]
And if I could have your silence, I would like to demonstrate for you.

[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.900]
The Al Gore version of the Macarena.

[02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:51.380]
Macarena.

[02:54:57.180 --> 02:54:57.780]
Macarena.

[02:54:58.060 --> 02:54:58.060]

[02:54:58.060 --> 02:54:58.060]

[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:00.240]
Would you like to see it again?

[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:03.360]
Tango, Mucha, Posa, Pseudo.

[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:05.860]
Tango, Mucha, Emo, Posa.

[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:09.220]
Tango, Mucha, Emo, Posa.

[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:09.860]
Tango, Mucha, Posa, Posa.

[02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:14.560]
When your alarm goes off in the morning, macarena.

[02:55:15.020 --> 02:55:19.440]
When one of your children reaches for cereal and fruit, macarena.

[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:22.080]
Macarena.

[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:24.320]
Macarena.

[02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:26.720]
Macarena.

[02:55:27.220 --> 02:55:27.620]
Macarena.

[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:28.360]
Macarena.

[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:31.980]
How terrible.

[02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:39.780]
Drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud on Saddam Hussein.

[02:55:41.540 --> 02:55:42.640]
It was a great segue.

[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:45.540]
I like the way those two blended together there.

[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:46.920]
What a nice mix of that.

[02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:47.320]
Yeah, two together.

[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:48.300]
Okay.

[02:55:49.380 --> 02:55:50.140]
141 at five.

[02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:52.620]
Don't tempt me.

[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:54.880]
At five, 60, WDQM.

[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:57.240]
Mad Dog coming up at two, we got the Humper from somewhere.

[02:55:57.420 --> 02:56:00.600]
He's at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino where they are just packing them in.

[02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:02.040]
The Humper will be there at four.

[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:03.580]
Hopefully, keep them away from the buffet.

[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:05.440]
Marlon's on deck at 630.

[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:08.260]
Marlon's at the Indian 705, 8K after the baseball game.

[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:10.140]
And overnight, it's a total loss.

[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:14.200]
If you're trying to lose weight, if you're one of these zillions of fat people out there,

[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:22.220]
if your pupa is hanging way over your belly, you probably try one of those low carb diets like the Atkins or the Waterhole Mushroom.

[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:25.020]
I don't want to mention the South Beach stock because it really pisses me off.

[02:56:25.580 --> 02:56:30.100]
Anyway, the lights of white smokers help thousands of low carb diets achieve their weight loss goals

[02:56:30.100 --> 02:56:33.640]
because today, shopping for the right low carb products has become more and more difficult.

[02:56:33.640 --> 02:56:34.660]
The Deficil.

[02:56:34.780 --> 02:56:35.800]
Have you said, tough.

[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:41.980]
Most of the so-called low carb products on the grocery store shelves will not even help you lose weight because a lot of them are a full of crap.

[02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:45.800]
Selecting foods with the right ingredients as well as the lowest carbs, that's what it's all about.

[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:46.520]
That's the key.

[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.160]
And the light focus is on over a thousand of the right low carb food items and products.

[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:52.800]
And you can try any of them in the store before you buy them too.

[02:56:52.900 --> 02:56:53.480]
That's a great thing.

[02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:55.680]
They have knowledgeable sales staff to guide you to success.

[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:00.080]
So if you're on the Atkins, the Sugar Busters, the South Beach, the what's your name?

[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:01.820]
Suzan Summers, Summersize this.

[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:06.380]
Or any low carb sugar free diet head for the lights of Westbokah, the number one low carb store in America.

[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:08.220]
Let them help you reach your important weight loss goals.

[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:11.340]
The lights is open every day, seven days a week from 10 to 10.

[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:15.440]
And you find the lights of Westbokah on the northeast corner of Glades in 441.

[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:21.340]
Right next to Boston Market, they used to be Boston Chicken or column toll free at 1-877 Low Carb.

[02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:25.080]
L-O-W-C-A-R-V or on the web you'll find them at lowcarb.com.

[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:28.400]
That's the lights of Westbokah, it's your official Atkins retail center.

[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:33.380]
We're sports radio bikes, you see.

[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:34.900]
Q-A-M.

[02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:37.980]
David's a bitch.

[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:43.000]
And another thing, you little son of a, you little bit of a star by now.

[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.160]
You little little thing sweet voice.

[02:57:45.420 --> 02:57:49.340]
I didn't expect to get anywhere a little puny, but you'll take you.

[02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:51.380]
I don't know how many more.

[02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:54.340]
I don't want this, this is 35% of the lights that I have come up with.

[02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:54.880]
I'll let you go.

[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:57.220]
The more white you see you.

[02:57:57.520 --> 02:57:58.820]
Yeah, what about it?

[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:01.080]
The more white I hate you.

[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:02.580]
What do I hate?

[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.840]
I do not see you.

[02:58:05.780 --> 02:58:06.060]
Hey.

[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:09.080]
I want a dime.

[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:12.400]
You're a pack of green.

[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:16.180]
Oh, tone L-G's a roll.

[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:19.840]
It's the end of a roll.

[02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:24.040]
And going like that.

[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:27.680]
Why you, why you're a smak you?

[02:58:28.500 --> 02:58:29.000]
That's it.

[02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:31.820]
I know my smell attracts you.

[02:58:32.520 --> 02:58:33.340]
Thank you.

[02:58:33.620 --> 02:58:35.320]
But unlike that you.

[02:58:36.420 --> 02:58:39.960]
You still got a job.

[02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:46.800]
I feel just like that you are my kid brother.

[02:58:48.280 --> 02:58:49.880]
And one year later.

[02:58:52.360 --> 02:58:55.200]
That's why you're still not buying it.

[02:58:56.460 --> 02:58:59.820]
No, no, no, no.

[02:59:00.060 --> 02:59:04.720]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:59:05.720 --> 02:59:08.960]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:12.140]
You didn't know it was gonna go on.

[02:59:13.660 --> 02:59:17.460]
I'm more than sure that I was you.

[02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:19.460]
In the chaos.

[02:59:20.840 --> 02:59:22.980]
You're just like till it's over.

[02:59:24.800 --> 02:59:26.200]
That's enough.

[02:59:26.920 --> 02:59:29.660]
Ow, ow, ow.

[02:59:30.280 --> 02:59:32.660]
147 at 560 WQM.

[02:59:32.660 --> 02:59:34.480]
I wonder if those two are getting along any better you think?

[02:59:34.540 --> 02:59:35.220]
No, probably not.

[02:59:36.160 --> 02:59:37.280]
How's that really possible?

[02:59:37.420 --> 02:59:39.620]
Well, Gellie's just gonna have to resign himself to the fact that A.

[02:59:39.700 --> 02:59:41.360]
There's not gonna be no hockey season next year.

[02:59:41.740 --> 02:59:44.860]
And B. Joe Rose don't want him on his show under any penalty of death.

[02:59:45.380 --> 02:59:46.120]
And that's it.

[02:59:46.200 --> 02:59:46.520]
He's stuck.

[02:59:47.080 --> 02:59:47.540]
You know what I mean?

[02:59:47.960 --> 02:59:48.280]
What do you mean?

[02:59:48.780 --> 02:59:49.500]
He's a screwed.

[02:59:50.340 --> 02:59:50.660]
Let's see.

[02:59:50.760 --> 02:59:51.820]
How's that pull coming along?

[02:59:51.960 --> 02:59:53.380]
I like the pull question there.

[02:59:53.460 --> 02:59:55.000]
I thought it was pretty good if I say so myself.

[02:59:55.440 --> 02:59:58.400]
Who is the most overrated movie actor or actress of all time?

[02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:02.020]
John Wayne 108.

[03:00:03.580 --> 03:00:04.220]
The Duke.

[03:00:04.400 --> 03:00:05.400]
They're trying to catch the Duke.

[03:00:06.140 --> 03:00:07.280]
Kevin Costner 91.

[03:00:07.680 --> 03:00:09.040]
Can't or Reeves has gotten 90.

[03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:10.460]
Boy, they hate him like poison.

[03:00:11.240 --> 03:00:14.380]
And deservedly so except for that one good movie made which I can't think of what it was.

[03:00:16.740 --> 03:00:18.040]
James Dean 72.

[03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:19.460]
J. Low 53.

[03:00:19.820 --> 03:00:20.900]
She's moving up there with the boys.

[03:00:21.120 --> 03:00:24.220]
Zoolier Roberts right on her ass with 46 and that's a lot of territory to cover.

[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:25.860]
Marilyn Monroe 43.

[03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:30.240]
See we're not talking about and I think they do get it.

[03:00:30.380 --> 03:00:31.780]
We're not talking about today look good.

[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:32.860]
I mean were they beautiful.

[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.060]
Would you like to do them?

[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:35.320]
We're not talking about that.

[03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:37.700]
We're talking about were they really a great actor actresses.

[03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:42.560]
And is there a lot of hype involved which is why people like James Dean and Marilyn Monroe are doing so well.

[03:00:43.540 --> 03:00:47.940]
Because quite frankly of Marilyn Monroe would have been like very mediocre looking which her face was not like

[03:00:47.940 --> 03:00:48.580]
in the first place.

[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:51.760]
But if she'd been really margin looking forget about it right?

[03:00:52.460 --> 03:00:52.460]

[03:00:52.460 --> 03:00:55.540]
Then she'd probably still be alive because the Kennedy's wouldn't had to get her killed.

[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:58.260]
Will Smith 34 of indiesel 33.

[03:00:58.580 --> 03:00:59.360]
Elvis 31.

[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:01.360]
Arnold Scott 25.

[03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:02.600]
Mel Gibson 16.

[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:03.640]
I'm just doing double digits.

[03:01:03.840 --> 03:01:04.580]
Brad Pitt a dozen.

[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:06.100]
Charlton Heston 11.

[03:01:06.460 --> 03:01:09.540]
Now what did we decide Brad Pitt was good in the river not a river runs through.

[03:01:09.540 --> 03:01:12.940]
Is that the one California with the K although he was born with a K was good.

[03:01:13.100 --> 03:01:17.100]
He wasn't bad in what you call it a river runs through it or whatever that was.

[03:01:17.780 --> 03:01:18.880]
Is that the name of that movie?

[03:01:19.800 --> 03:01:22.060]
There's so many river movies with Craig Schaeffer.

[03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:27.940]
No you know the one where they were the Fisherman he was the Fisherman he was always do the fly fish guys like seven in the other river.

[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:29.600]
What is it?

[03:01:29.980 --> 03:01:31.160]
Seven with Morgan Freeman.

[03:01:31.540 --> 03:01:34.520]
He was good in seven when he said what's in the box?

[03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:40.340]
Come on Josh man between between Duncan Donuts and what's in the box.

[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:42.100]
Maybe it's stuck in donuts in the box.

[03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:43.740]
Maybe it's not his wife after all.

[03:01:43.880 --> 03:01:44.800]
It's a good movie.

[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:48.940]
It was a good movie I'd agree with that but actually his acting.

[03:01:48.940 --> 03:02:00.240]
You know when his acting star really going south in that movie is when the last scene there the last the last 15 20 minutes when they were in the police car taking him out to wherever he was the drop off thing was.

[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:02.460]
Which why did they do that in the first place you know.

[03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:06.480]
I know you're not supposed to do that about movies because it just is what it is it's entertainment.

[03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:10.260]
But why the hell did they get sucked into that right you knew some crap was going to happen right.

[03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:15.760]
Of course it was too late by then anyway because the view was already done his wife said was why shouldn't I say that.

[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:28.360]
His wife said was already on her shoulders well that way if anybody hasn't seen it yet they know that her heads in the box it's going to be really bad or his behavior in a cop car and a whole thing is just so.

[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:33.840]
His acting started really getting worse and worse he started thinking of himself hey I'm Brad Pitt I can't act.

[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:43.500]
And then when they got what's in the box that was just you just want to scream you want a howl I'll even Morgan Freeman was like pointing are you kidding me wasn't he.

[03:02:43.500 --> 03:02:51.500]
Was that then so Washington I know was that van diesel well I get cam and confused okay it was van Haaland.

[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:59.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60 or maybe he was in a hill and palm 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[03:03:00.260 --> 03:03:06.260]
WQA and hello what about OJ Simpson OJ Simpson is a bad actor he's okay.

[03:03:06.260 --> 03:03:09.940]
Can anybody ever consider a real actor I don't think he qualifies right no.

[03:03:10.420 --> 03:03:30.040]
Huh I mean we hate him we hit all my poison we like to put him on it but we're not going to do it because nobody considers him a real actor we consider him a bad actor in every aspect of that expression and a bad man and a bad man man he ain't no man he's a bag whatever you want to put there in front of bag he's a bag.

[03:03:30.980 --> 03:03:50.320]
Anything that sounds like dirt or rhymes with it or substitutes for it as in slime bag as in bag all the bags that we can't say no more because we live in a fashion state where freedom of speech is just a fantasy we never really headed in the first place but now man is that a distant fantasy or what.

[03:03:50.320 --> 03:04:05.600]
Wow freedom of speech my ass I mean my back though sorry my fed ass that's okay 157 mad dog coming up next I wish I had time to read the story from Doug Thompson again the one from capital whatever it is you can read fast huh.

[03:04:06.340 --> 03:04:20.180]
Read fast no you know the one I started I would because it's so damn scary president bushes increasingly a rantic behavior in wide mood swings as the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as they it's privately expressed growing concern over their leader state of mind.

[03:04:20.660 --> 03:04:45.680]
In meetings with top aides administration officials the president goes from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against the media democrats and others that he classifies the enemy of the state worried what house a pain of portrait of a man on the edge increasingly wary of those that disagree with him in paranoid of a public that no longer trust his policies in a racker at home it reminds me of the Nixon days is a long time geo people are going to consult them with contacts in the White House everybody's an enemy everybody's out to get in that's the mood over there.

[03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:58.300]
In interviews with the number of White House staffers who were willing to talk off the record a picture of an administration under siege has emerged led by a man who declares his decisions to be God's will and then tells aides to F over anyone they consider to be and opponent of the administration.

[03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:09.840]
Red war there's no doubt about it what I don't know anymore is just to the enemy might be says one troubled White House aid we seem to be spending more time trying to destroy John Kerry than Al Qaeda and our enemies list just keeps growing and growing.

[03:05:10.500 --> 03:05:22.840]
Aides say the president gets hung up on minor details micromanaging to the extreme while ignoring the bigger picture he'll spend hours personally reviewing and approving every attack at against the democratic opponent then kiss off a meeting on economic issues.

[03:05:23.140 --> 03:05:33.840]
This is what killing a center rack one aides had we lost focus then the president kind of hung up on a weapons of mass destruction and an unproven link to Al Qaeda we could have found other justifiable reasons for the war but the president insisted to focus

[03:05:33.840 --> 03:05:49.100]
on these two tenuous items aides who raise questions quickly find themselves shut out of access to the president of top advisors among top officials president bushes inner circle is drinking secretary estate colon poundless fallout of favor because of his growing doubts about the administrations war in Iraq.

[03:05:49.500 --> 03:06:03.820]
This is the part I just want to get to again the president's abrupt dismissal of George tenetwoods the United is a insane example of how he works tenet wanted to quit last year but the president got his back up and wouldn't hear of it says an aid that would have been the opportunity to make a change not in the middle of election campaign.

[03:06:03.820 --> 03:06:21.080]
But when the director challenged the president during the meeting on Wednesday the president cut him off by saying that's it George I cannot abide this loyalty I want your resignation and I want it now and there's a little bit more so on our website how do you like that I like I think the award we're looking for there is just like that by by by.

[03:06:21.080 --> 03:06:22.060]
