[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.580]
I always told you that Joe Rose a little wrong he's the best

[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.080]
Oh, I'll make this good is I want to go

[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.820]
It's Friday you bastard. What the hell is that?

[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.460]
You're the rules in the me with a big star right now

[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.740]
You have a little bit sweet voice. I didn't expect to get anywhere a little beauty film.

[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.280]
We'll take you.

[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.280]
I think I said that's a good ride.

[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.040]
What did you say?

[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.860]
I was right there. I got to come up with you.

[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.560]
The more I see you.

[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.900]
Yeah, what a pun.

[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.440]
The more I hate you.

[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.180]
What do I hate you?

[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.220]
And when I see you.

[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.200]
I want to die.

[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.640]
You're a tech degree.

[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.080]
No, don't help.

[00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.580]
Cheese a roll.

[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.460]
Put me in a coma.

[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.120]
And point my eyes.

[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.020]
Why you, why you're the smart you?

[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.520]
That's okay.

[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.180]
I know my smell attracts you.

[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.660]
I know.

[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.660]
But unlike that you.

[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.280]
You still got such a.

[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.160]
I feel just like that you are my kid brother.

[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.660]
And when you need to another.

[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.620]
That's why you're still not buying.

[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.940]
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.620]
That's right, don't, don't, don't.

[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.720]
I'm going to go and go and go, go and go.

[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.820]
If you get the going dog, you're gonna go.

[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.600]
I'm going to show him what you.

[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.960]
In the cold night.

[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.500]
I can't wait till it's over.

[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.540]
All right, that's enough.

[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.680]
Give another slap for us, Mo.

[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.600]
That'll work.

[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.520]
10-0-2 at 5-60, WQA, man.

[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.300]
This place is just full of controversy and hate and rifts and riff raft, love, parts, flowers.

[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.420]
All of these things, man.

[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.440]
I thought our only real problem was...

[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.060]
Howard from Boca.

[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.620]
Little did I realize he's just small potatoes these days.

[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.440]
You know what?

[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.020]
I think the biggest problem is that Geldy is so desperate to get away from him.

[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.680]
Howard from Boca.

[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.540]
That's where the real problem lies.

[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.180]
If he asks me, I could be wrong about that because you know I'm so out of touch.

[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.900]
Thank God.

[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.200]
Anyway, we got a lot of Geldy material here today, so we'll probably play this.

[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.760]
No!

[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.340]
No!

[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.800]
No!

[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.460]
Several times.

[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.940]
No!

[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.580]
No!

[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.660]
No!

[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.920]

[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.040]
Anyway, Jim Sarni writes a whole bunch of crap.

[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.900]
Hey Jim, you haven't got any clue what you're writing about.

[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.700]
As usual, you're another stop-floor to loser.

[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.280]
Anyway, four helled-in-be heading of American.

[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.080]
Do you see that story?

[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.420]
No.

[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.840]
No.

[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.240]
Just in.

[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.900]
Iraqi police have arrested four people in the slang of American Nicholas Berg and Iraqi security officials

[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.340]
said, yeah, today, this morning.

[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.020]
The suspects were former owners of Saddam Hussein's Fadayin paramilitary organization

[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.720]
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.020]
They were arrested a week ago in a house in Salahedin province north of Baghdad.

[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.980]
Isn't that great that we have all of these words that...

[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.000]
Nobody's got any idea what the mean pictures are?

[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.760]
What is that?

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.900]
The moving pictures of what?

[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.100]
Of the prisoners.

[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.720]
Oh, the abuse?

[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.240]
Hey, listen, they should be given a medal.

[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.860]
That's what the...

[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.320]
A good poll your audience said yesterday.

[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.200]
That poll you took?

[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.140]
Good poll, but man, the response was about as embarrassing as anything we've ever had on

[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.580]
this show.

[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.500]
Does it surprise you?

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.720]
The group that was involved in the killing of Berg was led by Yasser Al-Sabawe.

[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.320]
And nephew of Saddam Hussein, the security official, said.

[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.720]
He said American intelligence that asked Iraqi authorities to hand over the suspects, but

[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.780]
they were still in Iraqi hands.

[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.080]
Al-Sabawe was not among those arrested, he said.

[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.440]
And I'm sure also not arrested was Al-Zakari, who supposedly did the beheading, and

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.980]
probably wasn't even there, because he's dead.

[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.320]
And it's very least, at the very least, had his leg chopped off.

[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.880]
Not.

[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.720]
Well...

[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.680]
Yeah, that's what he said when he chopped his leg off.

[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.500]
POOT!

[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.980]
Anyway, Georgia, I asked yesterday, and you'll be pleased that all those people who like

[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.880]
me and hope I'm around a while, and those people who hate me like poison also will be

[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.140]
pleased, because otherwise, what would they do if I wasn't here?

[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.800]
I have no life.

[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.880]
Everything came out just fine, so to speak.

[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.320]
Oh yeah.

[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.940]
Everything was great.

[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.500]
My prostate is great, 2.4 PSA, for an old far like me, is fabulous number.

[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.200]
So yesterday, I had several vizingers.

[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.440]
What?

[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.500]
Yeah.

[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.480]
It felt like a finger.

[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.900]
Well, I can't go into that.

[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.980]
No, you can't.

[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.840]
I can't go into that.

[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.700]
They sure did.

[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.180]
Well, the problem is, when you go to these, see, there's no more proctologists.

[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.800]
Now it's co-rectal specialists, or something like that.

[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.400]
In other words, whole doctors.

[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.440]
But when you go there, they have like a whole team.

[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.620]
I said, is that the first team you got back there?

[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.820]
Get ready behind me, whatever they're going to do?

[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.840]
I would have sworn I saw a depot.

[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.880]
You know that depot showed up with the who else was with them with the PD Lenny, right?

[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.400]
For Zach's birthday party at the Terrad.

[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.360]
I wasn't invited.

[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.820]
And our program director, Clarence Darrow, such a cheap Jew, that he drove all the way up

[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.660]
to, where was it?

[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.360]
Somewhere in Broward.

[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.300]
I have no idea.

[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.620]
He drove all the way up there just so he can get a free meal at Charod.

[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.040]
He probably spent like five bucks gas going up and back.

[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.160]
But he didn't care because it was a free meal at Charod because he's a shanur.

[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.240]
He's learning fast.

[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.320]
Then embarrassing or what?

[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.420]
No, I didn't.

[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.520]
So PD Lenny showed up and also D-fo.

[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.260]
I wonder what kind of drug.

[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.320]
I mean, what kind of stuff they ate up there.

[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.560]
Anyway.

[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.860]
Oh, listen, I'm loaded for it today.

[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.480]
You have no idea.

[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.120]
Just wait.

[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.160]
Wait till I get to Gully.

[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.280]
Oh, man.

[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.440]
Hey, Gully.

[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.800]
Let me tell you right now the idea of you doing the Panther games.

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.660]
I was thinking about it driving to work this way.

[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.260]
It's a goal.

[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.340]
It's a goal.

[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.300]
It's a goal.

[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.760]
Oh, it's a goal.

[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.540]
I did this here and now.

[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.120]
Can't you?

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.740]
I can't.

[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.660]
And they were Randy Moor reaching over and slapping him on.

[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.080]
Yeah.

[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.620]
Slap again, Randy.

[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.840]
Because there's a rift is what Joe Rose is reporting this morning between Randy Moor,

[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.840]
who is by the way the Panthers director of broadcasting.

[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.060]
I didn't know that.

[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.040]
That's Randy Randy is the Panthers director of broadcasting with their 0.7 share that nobody

[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.720]
cares about it.

[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.980]
In fact, Mad Dog had a driver home from Mommy's Wednesday and Mad Dog had a call somebody

[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.480]
saying, how about that flyer lightning series?

[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.580]
And man, he said you got 10 seconds.

[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.520]
Nobody cares about it.

[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.020]
And then he was counting down the 10 seconds.

[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160]
I think I was trying to say something.

[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.920]
So why the Panthers are in this station?

[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.700]
I have no idea because we are the anti-hockey crowd except on the show.

[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.720]
And Gelly would like to be in there, but he'll get slapped to side by Randy Moor and everybody

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.200]
else too.

[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.900]
I'm going to slap him around a little bit today because he deserves it.

[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.560]
He's out of control.

[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.300]
His ego has just become so massive in vivid.

[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.820]
I don't know if I should do all 82 games in too long season.

[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.400]
How can I do the games and stand?

[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.840]
The morning sure is the main thing.

[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.920]
See, that's why he wants to get off the morning show too.

[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.100]
A two-prong thing.

[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.100]
First of all, he desperately wants to get away from...

[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.720]
Howard from Boca's we can understand easily.

[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.620]
So does everybody else.

[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.040]
I'll tell you our good friend.

[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.700]
Howard from Boca.

[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.020]
He's so desperate to find an ally that he's even sucking up to the beast now.

[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.860]
How do you like that?

[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.420]
Do you hear that?

[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.740]
No.

[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.300]
Oh yeah.

[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.620]
Another great update by my good friend, the beast.

[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.840]
He's a hell of a guy.

[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.700]
A whale of a guy.

[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.160]
I'm about to...

[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.780]
All this other crap.

[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.320]
He's sucking up to him because he can't find anybody who will...

[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.740]
Now that Gelly turned on...

[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.360]
Howard from Boca.

[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.000]
What does he got left?

[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.900]
He's got no allies.

[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.620]
That's...

[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.240]
That's so sad.

[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.980]
You got us.

[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.040]
That's right.

[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.580]
We're chums.

[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.000]
Relatively speaking, I think we're pretty tight with our good friend.

[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.740]
Howard from Boca.

[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.720]
Because Joe Rose just...

[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.800]
I mean, Joe would just need sooner blow his brains out than even look at him.

[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.180]
No, he would.

[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.060]
He would just assume grab that piece that must grab off his head and just...

[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.340]
But I'll bang just...

[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.820]
Yeah.

[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:52.760]
Do that.

[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.620]
As look at them all ever again.

[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.180]
Because Joe is a little bit p-oated.

[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.920]
Howard from Boca.

[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.560]
Just in general.

[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.080]
Not anything specific that I know of.

[00:07:59.220 --> 00:07:59.980]
Just in general.

[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.880]
Just life, I believe.

[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.800]
So anyway, the whole thing goes on and Gelly wants to do the games.

[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.900]
He doesn't know if he wants to do all the games with his quick evil.

[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.520]
He said, go!

[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.400]
It's a go!

[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.000]
But anyway.

[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.980]
I just somehow can't envision that.

[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.280]
I know he did that one game when Chris Moron was in New Jersey or something, you know?

[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.340]
And couldn't make it back.

[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.120]
And I went to bed for Gelly.

[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:21.840]
Remember those days?

[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:22.580]
Back in the day.

[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.040]
And I was when Christina Moron.

[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.820]
Anybody would have been a big improvement over Christina.

[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.660]
I mean, now that we got Joe's McDonald being put out to pasture.

[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.160]
And by the way, it's just their radio show, Joe.

[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.380]
It's quick being so sensitive.

[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.940]
Quick being a grumpy old man.

[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.520]
Just like...

[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.180]
Howard from Boca.

[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.180]
They'll say bad things about you.

[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:37.780]
You don't want to do that.

[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.040]
And let me show you otherwise.

[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.300]
I mean, you're fine record over all those years, including the two years in Toronto

[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.060]
where they rode you out of town on a rail.

[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.300]
You don't want to do that, Jigs.

[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.200]
What?

[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.180]
What are you smirking about?

[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:48.740]
That's true.

[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.420]
You think real hockey fans like the Maple Leaf fans, who listen, especially after being

[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.620]
honored with a great Joe Bulland, who listen to the jugs McDonald, my god.

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.960]
That's like a slap in the face.

[00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.920]
That's what that is.

[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.000]
To real hockey fans.

[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.160]
How many of those we got here?

[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.060]
About third man.

[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.320]
Yeah.

[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.280]
It sounds like I'm rambling, I am.

[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.060]
But that's okay.

[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.440]
Yeah.

[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.780]
I'm just in a rambling mood.

[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.720]
I'm a rambling guy today.

[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.840]
I'm like Bob's, the Hibbleman.

[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:10.400]
Yeah.

[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.440]
I'm a rambling man, right?

[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.440]
A pup...

[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:12.880]
A pup...

[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.580]
A pup...

[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:13.840]
A pups?

[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.300]
Nine minutes while we're excited because we're waiting for our ponytails, Jeff Cohen, to bring

[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.900]
us food to them.

[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.180]
Actually, we're going to break a longstanding fast and on the air fast.

[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.140]
Haven't had food in here while I'm here in a long time.

[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:27.440]
No.

[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.900]
But today we'll make an exception because you got stiffed.

[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.260]
You're not fooling us, ponytail.

[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.160]
You're not fooling me.

[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.680]
I'll take you that.

[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.780]
George was in here with Josh yesterday, polishing is the Chinese saying, dying for food,

[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.800]
just starving to death.

[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.460]
And they were going to get some.

[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:40.520]

[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.240]
If you want food, give it, give it the order to a real man.

[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.000]
Which had a skipping, okay?

[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.080]
Anybody who's a bigger shrimp than you are.

[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.400]
A smaller shrimp.

[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.180]
A smaller shrimp than you are.

[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.200]
See him is not somebody that you give a major league man's job like getting the food

[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.500]
in here.

[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.620]
He could have just said that Jeff didn't want to have anything to do with you.

[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.620]
No, but you see you're assuming that he cared.

[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.180]
No, I'm not assuming that he cared.

[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.040]
He told him, oh, Neil's going to be back tomorrow bringing food tomorrow.

[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:05.820]
So is he cool on that?

[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.580]
That was it as far as giving us.

[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.040]
He doesn't care about you.

[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.960]
He's got lots of friends.

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.120]
He doesn't care.

[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.160]
He could have just said that.

[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:12.700]
I understand.

[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.840]
But he doesn't have way no other than that.

[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.560]
He doesn't care about you enough to tell you that though.

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.120]
Because it has to be true that then you could have called somebody and they would have

[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.380]
brought it.

[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.840]
He told you, Ira, right?

[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.880]
Or all of a sudden, you might have said he's substance.

[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.600]
Where experts are getting free food in here.

[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.400]
Everybody knows that.

[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.360]
We're both feeling faint.

[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.680]
Yeah.

[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.060]
Josh had to eat Chef Boyard's spaghetti.

[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:30.520]
Yeah?

[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.780]
Well, I'll tell you one of them.

[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.000]
I'll tell you because I know he likes the...

[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.140]
Yeah.

[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.700]
But that's beside the point.

[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.100]
I couldn't get any.

[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.760]
I see.

[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.840]
Maybe Jeff will bring you some of those.

[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.180]
Tell me that's bad.

[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.880]
And by the way, I'm not putting you on the airpony tail.

[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.600]
Not after your brutal behavior of George and Josh yesterday.

[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.340]
That was very, very acceptable.

[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.540]
I mean, no, because if he'd brought you food yesterday, he wouldn't come back.

[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.080]
The only reason I want him here today is because we have no more so than.

[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.560]
No more so then.

[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.780]
Back in the day.

[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.780]
In the salad days, the glory days.

[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.720]
If I can say that.

[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.380]
Can I say glory?

[00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:58.680]
No.

[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.600]
Well, we used to have all these people bring this like South Alcone, who would bring us

[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.440]
that great, the sole water, the bottle water straight from Italy, all of the stuff that

[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.100]
used to come in here.

[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.880]
And it was great when when people liked this.

[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.480]
But now we've got so many people that he does like poison, or at least he hates you like

[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:13.880]
poison.

[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.320]
Right.

[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.100]
And so I have to suffer for it these few weeks a year when I'd bother coming back here.

[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.180]
I have to suffer.

[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.360]
I mean, the cupboard is bare.

[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.600]
Look, usually there used to be cartons piled up to the ceiling with free water and free

[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.580]
the snack all kinds of stuff.

[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.040]
You're not here.

[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.620]
Why should they drink?

[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.700]
Yeah, they don't like you.

[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.140]
Like Skippy.

[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:31.860]
They don't care about you.

[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.520]
They're small potatoes.

[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.540]
Oh, my own soda.

[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:34.920]
That's fine.

[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:35.480]
Yeah.

[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.400]
Like that.

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.560]
No, it's got caffeine in it.

[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.200]
I don't want that.

[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.280]
That's why I bought it.

[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.000]
Because you keep eating that caffeine and you'll find things growing in your...

[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.360]
Backed home.

[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.180]
That's what they told me yesterday at the clinic.

[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.160]
That's right.

[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.040]
I could explain things.

[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.660]
They said we see like evidence of caffeine in your...

[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.020]
Backed home.

[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.460]
But we can't talk about it like because that might then the next logical step is that

[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.380]
Duff spot about painful...

[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.280]
Cache.

[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.400]
Attention, man.

[00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.440]
Painful vacation.

[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.860]
I mean, def... def... def... def...

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.000]
Cache.

[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.200]
Is not what they call it when like a death guy gets some time off from work at def...

[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.400]
Cache.

[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.140]
I think that's what they call it.

[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:07.740]
Anyway.

[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:08.780]
What do you think?

[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.940]
It's painful, you're right.

[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.460]
He's a nutkin at Pantheid job.

[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.600]
Not if I have anything to do with it.

[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.180]
12 minutes after 10 at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.360]
VOOM is not just your ordinary regular TV.

[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.340]
Anybody can see that.

[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.940]
But it's high definition TV delivered via satellite dish and HD receiver.

[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.500]
The picture is so sharp, it's almost like you could reach in there and just...

[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.100]
...tickle your athletes right on the solar plexus.

[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.080]
VOOM is the only entertainment system designed for high definition TV.

[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:40.700]
VOOM has got the most HD TV anywhere and they provide you all the equipment necessary to enjoy the ultimate HDV experience, including the satellite dish.

[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.880]
HD receiver and the remote.

[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.740]
I bet you're... I know who'd like one of those.

[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.500]
Howard from Boka.

[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.660]
And VOOM is God.

[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.080]
Over 30 channels.

[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.040]
Stop 30, man.

[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.620]
Of HD programming, you can watch ESPN and high definition.

[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.500]
That's three times more HD TV channels than you get from cable.

[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.400]
They got all your other favorite channels too, like HB-O-M-T-V.

[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.880]
Even your local Yoko channels, which are mighty sad.

My life and love, this is Fort Real Vice City.

[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.080]
Way to A.

[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:51.920]
We macken on, this is Joe Bohr in the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neil God.

[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:28.880]
Something that we know they did not do, push up our unnoticed occupation.

[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:38.260]
Now we're all screwed, and there's garbage feed, let's end free to bring.

[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:47.020]
And I elect from my barbed wire to their face, and those they get amazed, slack them in a pile.

[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:54.980]
There's a code at home and say cheese and smile, over-sleeve all that scrapest parts, here.

[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:03.360]
In rest they know atrocities or fives, like the first you only follow orders.

[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:12.560]
Look what we've become, Canada's company, barely that full die.

[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.420]
That's what hurt like rocker on a Saturday night.

[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.420]
But it's listening.

[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.440]
10-18 at 5-60 WQM, happy Friday to you.

[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.200]
We got the Mad Dog at 2, I'm looking at this, ad Hooters in the Pines, no less.

[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.780]
But that's got a little change in it, change the pace, change the place.

[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.780]
Why not?

[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:44.120]
Humber in the studio, 4-7 this afternoon, the Hebrew hammer, Henry Goldberg, Marlon's on Deck at 7, and he won a game last night to start to turn things around.

[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.080]
Kind of like when I was at the Doctor yesterday, he said, turn that thing around.

[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.720]
Now it's bad when they're behind there, and you can't, they make you hunched down over that table, and they got like three of them behind you.

[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.300]
And they have that like cloth over your neck.

[00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:02.120]
You can't see what's going on back there, and you feel these instruments release your praying that they're really are instrument.

[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.340]
Anyway, we can't go into it.

[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.360]
Boogin from Ad Dog today.

[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:04.780]
To Dooply.

[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.000]
A boog is in for the Mad Dog.

[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.420]
Was that clearance on the phone?

[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:08.620]
Yeah.

[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.700]
Well, how come when he was in here before, scratching his private, why didn't he tell us about that before?

[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.740]
Obviously, I don't want to see you scratching your private.

[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.680]
Did you notice that when he was in here?

[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.500]
Thank God no.

[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.960]
I guess he was aroused because he had seen the beast in the hallway a couple of times.

[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.120]
Yeah.

[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.340]
Yes!

[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.920]
Maybe that's why the beast's head was glowing when he came in here before.

[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:29.600]
Shiny.

[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.720]
Just like one of them bugs, them, what do they call those?

[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.740]
The little ones that light up like, you know, oh the fireflies.

[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.500]
Fireflies, yeah.

[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.100]
Like a cross between a firefly and a fruit fly.

[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:39.880]
Maybe you got a fresh bug.

[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.520]
That's what moss is.

[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.580]
Anyway, what was I just saying before we got sidetracked?

[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.640]
Something very important, and you like got me all off on that clearance crap about him scratching his crotch.

[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.640]
What were we talking about?

[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.440]
I don't know.

[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.880]
Yeah, we were about guilty not getting that Panther job.

[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.640]
Oh, I don't know if I'm going to do all 82 games.

[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.980]
It's a long schedule and I want to let you know.

[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.400]
Man, quit belly.

[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.780]
I can and you're not going to get it anyway because I'm sure that Randy Mordor is going to stick it to you.

[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.300]
That's the room where the Joe started this morning.

[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.380]
That there's a real riff there going on.

[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.480]
You know, let's spice it up a little bit for that Panther organization.

[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.300]
They're like a .7 share on this radio station.

[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.700]
I mean, if we lost the Panther broadcast, wouldn't that be bad?

[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:15.940]
No.

[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.120]
Huh?

[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.700]
To like a station that really cares about hockey, which we don't.

[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.120]
Maybe that Carl bananas fostering put it on his 5 watt station at night.

[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.040]
Then nobody can hear.

[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:23.660]
Huh?

[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.560]
Still probably have the same 20 people listen.

[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.780]
Because anybody that cares about the Panthers, we're watching it on the TV, right?

[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.060]
Everyone here's some old funny dirty guy like Jug MacDonald, old MacDonald.

[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.820]
And now that he's hanging it up, plus there may not be any season next year anyway.

[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.200]
It all may be a moot point, right?

[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.760]
I'm sure.

[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.420]
That's what you said.

[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.840]
In fact, I got a good idea.

[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.620]
Let Geldie, this may be the solution.

[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.140]
Let Geldie go up into broadcast booth and just practice all season.

[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:48.660]
There you go.

[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.980]
Pretend there's a game on.

[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.500]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.660]
And make it excited.

[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.820]
You're like that.

[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.180]
And it's a goal.

[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.960]
What's a goal?

[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.080]
Like, make sounds like that.

[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.660]
Geldie, I don't think so.

[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.620]
I mean, if they really have 50 tapes from real broadcasts,

[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.920]
is that leaves you up in a cold man?

[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.500]
I'm telling you.

[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.420]
I don't want to pee on your parade, Geldie, because you're not a really bad guy,

[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.720]
but you just out of control.

[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.060]
You need to be put back in your place a little bit, especially the way you treated our good friend.

[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:13.800]
Howard from Boca.

[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.000]
Yeah.

[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.540]
He was, I don't know whether Moe was still in that room this morning,

[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.920]
or you're getting your car washed?

[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.100]
These guys, you know, they're going to see your car again.

[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:22.840]
You give him your keys.

[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.580]
He can take it up a little bit.

[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.200]
That's all right, dude.

[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.040]
Man, I saw him driving a Cadillac Sivila right up seventh avenue coming to work.

[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:29.720]
Take it.

[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.960]
You don't want that one anyway.

[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.620]
It's a piece of crap.

[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.240]
Anyway, oh no, actually, it's an ice vehicle.

[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.560]
They got it from Kim Bockampers University, Doc.

[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.880]
You would have that big cow out in front.

[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.320]
AC sure blows cold now.

[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:40.800]
Anyway.

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.820]
Morris, in our audience, faxes me a whole long thing, which Morris, you know,

[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.040]
I knew he had a send it to somebody.

[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.240]
The other day, Rush Limbaugh actually said that Al Qaeda wants John Kerry to defeat W.

[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.420]
Just now he knows how he knows another question.

[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.080]
Maybe he divided in an narcotic induced reverie.

[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.860]
Nice thought, Morris.

[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.820]
Anyway, I was so incensed, I wrote it, rebuttaled it in the world to send it.

[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.720]
So I'm faxing it to you.

[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.840]
Hope you enjoy it.

[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.440]
Well, I probably won't enjoy it because I don't have time to read it, Morris.

[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.380]
But thanks for getting it off your chest and being pissed off and fired up.

[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.060]
And especially, here's one Jewish guy that's going to vote for Kerry.

[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.500]
Morris, thank God for that.

[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.480]
Because I'm encountering all of these Jews for Hitler.

[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.740]
Everybody, I talk to this week.

[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.400]
See, this business about how he panders to Israel because he's going to get the Jewish vote.

[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.920]
And they're saying, oh, no, he's not going to do that.

[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.560]
I think they're wrong.

[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.660]
I think he is going to get, at least here in Florida, the people I'm talking to.

[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.220]
Ethnic pandering, working in politics.

[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.540]
No, no, but seriously, I mean, people who have been lifelong Democrats supposedly,

[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.360]
although the people I've been talking to are more like an involved in the financial field,

[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.120]
which means that they're like, they don't really care about all these other issues,

[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.180]
or really about Israel.

[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.740]
That's just an excuse because they're selfish.

[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.600]
And they want to get more tax breaks for the rich, things like that.

[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.100]
There you go.

[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.800]
That's really weird.

[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.120]
Yeah.

[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.000]
It gives a bad image to the rest of us Jews who aren't cheap penny-pitching, you know, that stereotype.

[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.220]
Nickel shaving.

[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:53.720]
Right.

[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.020]
Oh, nickel shaving.

[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.660]
Todd Rex back in the Asale Department right now, shaving it.

[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.180]
Yeah.

[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.800]
In fact, it's a good thing that he never worked at IOD back in the day,

[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.400]
because if Steve Nickel would have been the PD, he probably would have shaved him too.

[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.000]
With a straight razor.

[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.680]
Oh, good.

[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.300]
Good. Now that I'd like to see.

[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.340]
One thing about Steve Nickel, man, he sure had a nose for town.

[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.540]
What should happen to the, this was George's poll question yesterday,

[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.760]
and your response was so outrageous and unacceptable, I'm just embarrassed for you.

[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.480]
WQA, yes sir.

[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:27.720]
So good now.

[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.440]
No, I don't think so.

[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.980]
That sounded like your friends, didn't it?

[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:31.620]
What of them?

[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.840]
Well, you got so many.

[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.700]
I know I don't mind.

[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.460]
I don't want to talk about your mugworms, okay?

[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.580]
If you've got speaking, let's just speak, you know, or even a couple of words of it.

[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.680]
But otherwise, I'm not going to waste my time with it.

[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.480]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.860]
Yes. Good morning.

[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:44.620]
Good morning, sir.

[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.160]
Does it bother anybody that a guy who has no minor league experience than what two broadcasts

[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.280]
is now up for a major play-life play-time?

[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.520]
Father's down a lot on May outside of it, when there are a lot of really great broadcasters out there.

[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.700]
See, the only problem being in this town, or reason that doesn't bother anybody,

[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.960]
but including that idiot Jim Sarni at the Sunset was because they don't know anything about hockey anyway.

[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.580]
But you think that Jim Sarni would know a good hockey broadcaster?

[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.900]
Probably not, but here's the point.

[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.980]
You're championing rightfully so the fact that people don't pay their dues to get up in the business

[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.960]
and that people who are actually devoted to working in the business get passed over all the time.

[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.140]
Well, this is a classic example.

[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.500]
You've got a squeaky voice punk who's done nothing.

[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.140]
Nothing!

[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.600]
His whole career took me the right place.

[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.420]
Oh, you're giving a part of spankin, man.

[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.840]
In fact, maybe we should do that all day.

[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.520]
Call in and spank y'all day a little bit.

[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.300]
He deserves it.

[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.080]
You must spank him.

[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.480]
So it's basically promotion by attrition, is that it?

[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.320]
Well, let me just make one suggestion to you.

[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.560]
Okay, I don't want to say too loud.

[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.160]
I think he might work cheap.

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.300]
Really?

[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.760]
Think about that.

[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.420]
Think about the Panther coaching selection last year, remember that?

[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.520]
But you're saying other broadcasters in small markets who wouldn't work at a smaller salary level wouldn't come here?

[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.560]
They would probably chop off their right leg.

[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.940]
They would just like all that crowd so they could do the game.

[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:58.420]
He read.

[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.220]
It's got to be just, you know, infest you.

[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.160]
Well, be sure to tell that to the director of broadcasting Randy Moulter, okay?

[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.480]
Because I'm sure he's looking for any excuse to not yell his name off of that list.

[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.200]
Is he sober?

[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.360]
See ya.

[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:09.700]
Bye.

[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.240]
Well, there you go.

[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.180]
There's a guy who makes a good point.

[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.600]
I think it's spank y'all day Friday.

[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.340]
I'm really excited to forget about it Friday, which didn't go over too big.

[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:17.920]
That was on the...

[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.520]
Howard from Broken.

[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.920]
But I think that spank y'all day Friday might just impact on him.

[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.880]
Who will enjoy that too?

[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.560]
Howard from Broken.

[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:24.940]
I was like, oh, yeah.

[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.900]
So I started to say this before and interrupted myself because I'm on drugs, I think, today.

[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.200]
But, uh, Gildi was out there in a hall with a blockhead with Joe Rose.

[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:34.960]
And they were...

[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.120]
No, I was confabulating with him briefly when I came in this morning because I don't see them very often, which is fine.

[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.020]
I mean, at least in Gildi's case, which is fine.

[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.500]
I like Joe.

[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.540]
But, uh...

[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.500]
Why are you making a face when I said that?

[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.480]
No, I told myself a joke I never heard that.

[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:48.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.180]
But anyway, and they're knocking.

[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.000]
They're ripping Moulter.

[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.040]
I don't know whether he was still in the studio or he was on his way out the door to that...

[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.220]
Whatever he was driving this morning, the Jeep or something.

[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.100]
What was that thing?

[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.460]
Who was talking to Humvee?

[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.020]
Huh?

[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.280]
An armoured fan.

[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.320]
Howard from Broken.

[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.300]
That's who we're talking about.

[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.360]
So he might have already been gone.

[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.440]
Because they were...

[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.860]
They were standing right outside that studio there where he sits in there and adjust his peace.

[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.220]
And they were like ripping him and ass.

[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.560]
I guess that was just to amuse me.

[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.160]
Is that what it was?

[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:14.500]
No!

[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:14.980]
Oh!

[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.660]
Anyway, one of them Joe said that it was very amusing.

[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.900]
I don't find Gildi too amusing.

[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.120]
I find him to be a very unnerving, disturbing little twerp.

[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:24.620]
Anyway.

[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.440]
Well, what...

[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.540]
There's that face again.

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.120]
You keep me going.

[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:27.660]
Oh, boy.

[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.460]
26 after 10.

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.240]
No, seriously, if they're going to be a Panther Broadcaster, we don't want somebody like this...

[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.100]
Like this caller just said, it was an excellent call.

[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.840]
We don't want beginners.

[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.200]
Okay.

[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.440]
There are a lot of people who have paid their dues.

[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.860]
They broadcast minor league hockey.

[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.340]
They broadcast maybe in Canada where they really understand the game.

[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.940]
Let's get a real broadcaster in here.

[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.260]
I mean, of course, here most of these people would know Joe Bowen from Jimmy Bowen.

[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.120]
You know, even George knows Joe Bowen.

[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.280]
Yeah, because we got droughts.

[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:52.700]
There you go.

[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.020]
26 past 10 at 5.

[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.140]
60 WQ, if you're still afraid to buy a bet over the phone, what are you waiting for?

[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.940]

So why would you waste any of your time and money,

[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.000]
schlepping from showroom to showroom?

[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.180]
It's strictly a waste of time.

[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:38.880]
It's for suckers.

[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.080]

[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.320]
serda, king coircements, tempera peat against stirons and foster a hewitt.

dial-mactrises can deliver the finest betting around.

[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.360]
Chuck Myers, by the way, that morning show suck, Chuck.

[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.000]
It was bad.

[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:54.540]
And those interviews.

[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.660]
Oh, but you need to do this smart thing,

[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.000]
like everybody else at QM is doing,

[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.880]

[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.200]

1-800-MATTRES, or online, it's mattress.com.

[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.640]
My, and locals, this is Fort Real Phi City.

[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.300]
Way, way.

[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.580]
Why the, you bastard?

[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.660]
Oh, my God.

[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.840]
I'm 10-boy Latoya with your telebook,

[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.860]
exposing the Jackson family you're a coup.

[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.680]
But naked and playboy, you beard all for some cash.

[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.180]
Oh, right.

[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.100]
You're more suited for the inquire girl, your trash.

[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.960]
All the dead, all the Jackson's you tell.

[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.020]
Michael and his movie, Juicy Star.

[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.880]
Yeah, with all his witness,

[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.860]
you may might see normal.

[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.180]
Girls, you shut up.

[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.920]
Tap on the tall, you're downless and lame.

[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.180]
Time to make a sleazy book of your family's names.

[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.800]
You're here.

[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.840]
10-32 at 560 WQL on a great Friday,

[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.080]
boy, it's really some kind of a sensational day.

[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.080]
You ought to see all the stuff, all the crap that's going on,

[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.980]
the hallways and this building.

[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.360]
Now, this is why it's good for me to come back.

[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.080]
One, not too often, just once in a while,

[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.820]
and see the kind of lunacy that goes on in the name of business in here.

[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:38.580]
And that's right.

[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.140]
You're making faces in the wagon, your tongue all around,

[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.100]
but that's about what this place is all about.

[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.740]
It is just a nut house.

[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.960]
Anyway, what should happen to the soldiers in the Iraq Prisoner Abuse scandal,

[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.260]
which, of course, the Washington Post has released all those new

[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.460]
grotesque pictures today, including moving pictures.

[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.640]
Yes, 1,544 votes.

[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.180]
Absolutely.

[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.900]
It is a disgrace, your response to this.

[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.080]
It is just a grotesque and unacceptable when you come right down to it.

[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.560]
Prison time in a dishonorable discharge, 757, 49.1%.

[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.700]
I like the 77 myself better.

[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.900]
Nothing they were just following orders, 516.

[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.400]
We know about people who follow orders.

[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.560]
They should all get a medal.

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.880]
This right here, 242, 15.6%,

[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.960]
who think that these soldiers who abuse the Iraqi should get a medal,

[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.820]
15.6%, you people need very, very, very serious, like a slap.

[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.440]
That's what you need.

[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.080]
The surprises.

[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:29.520]
I'm beating.

[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.180]
Yes.

[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:30.640]
Really?

[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:32.820]
It didn't surprise you?

[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.140]
No.

[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.140]
They should get a medal?

[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.400]
That's why I put it on there.

[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:40.760]
I knew that 70 to 90% of those Iraqis that were in that prison were not guilty of anything.

[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.260]
They've already let 750 of them go.

[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.300]
They were terrorists.

[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:44.800]
Oh, I see.

[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.260]
They bombed those people in the lab.

[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:46.520]
Yeah.

[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.120]
Life in prison 24.

[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.120]
So 15.6% think that this is a wonderful thing.

[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.660]
And let's continue abusing because let's face it, there are a bunch of ragheads anyway.

[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.080]
Right.

[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.920]
And we're pissed off at them.

[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.860]
So let's abuse them.

[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.780]
Matter of fact, I'm an abuser.

[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.700]
Let's pick it up a notch.

[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:04.680]
But of course, if that's your philosophy, then why the hell are we letting all of our people over there being...

[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.040]
What are we doing trying to free them and having our people being killed?

[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:07.340]

[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.220]
Using that excuse that it's, you know, trying to bring democracy and feeling that chalabee.

[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.120]
How long have I been screaming about him?

[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:13.880]
About 30 years.

[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.560]
About chalabee?

[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.340]
Or chalabee harb, you want to say it?

[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.340]
They keep changing the pronunciation like Tony Dursett.

[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.240]
Yeah.

[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.180]
Well, if they rated his home.

[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.940]
And didn't we have the story on the website?

[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.640]
I had it on there myself many, many, many days ago if you read our crap on there.

[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.600]
That he was feeding secrets to Iran.

[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.040]
He's buddies with the Iranians.

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.000]
On the one hand, he's good buddies with Dick Cheney.

[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.900]
But then every crooks good buddies with Dick Cheney.

[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.720]
And on the other hand, he's buddies with the Iranians.

[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.060]
He was feeding them top secret information, helping them build on Obama Grande.

[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.460]
And he's the guy that we were going to put in charge.

[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.400]
Oh, we don't think so.

[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.180]
Again, just like the pictures, it's the same thing.

[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.740]
They keep getting caught when they're just like I was at the doctor yesterday with their pants down.

[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.300]
Well, they've got a lot more than three people standing behind him in line waiting.

[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.660]
Kind of like just like muff.

[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:56.680]
Wow.

[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.840]
Oh, somebody faxes you this.

[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.200]
Well, no, this is for you with this.

[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.740]
I'm sci-fi fantasy pool ideas for George.

[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.160]
And they can spell you with a GM with a J.

[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.400]
And by the way, skip me or like you?

[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.320]
Oh, gee.

[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.800]
No, of course you don't like anybody.

[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.780]
He's only interested.

[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.240]
Like most of the people in this building, he's only in it for himself.

[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.360]
If he can siphon off the commission on any account that he inherited,

[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.520]
name me one new account that he sold on the meal Roger Show.

[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.540]
How long has he been on this working in this joint?

[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.600]
A yearish?

[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:25.120]
Okay.

[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.360]
Name me one new account he sold on this show.

[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.700]
I mean, you got Adam.

[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.560]
Adam has sold a bunch.

[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.940]
Adam's always selling new accounts.

[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:37.380]
In fact, Adam is one of the few people we got that goes out there and beats the bush and brushes and comes up with new accounts.

[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.740]
Our joy, huh?

[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.760]
Well, you're not supposed to say that.

[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.300]
I'm supposed to get true like that.

[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.020]
I'm not that quick.

[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.320]
I don't have it on a button like that.

[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.220]
Oh, I like that one.

[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.580]
Yeah, give another spanking, Randy Morris.

[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.700]
He's spanking Gelly.

[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.960]
He's got him over the edge of the table right now.

[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.280]
And spanking both cheeks.

[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:57.680]
Spacem.

[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.740]
Oh, man.

[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.180]
I bet you even judge would like to come back and see that one time.

[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.320]
I bet you judge me soundly to find a Gelly either.

[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:05.900]
I don't know why.

[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.020]
And then of course there's Rhymer.

[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.540]
Well, we'll get to the article, the Jim Sarny piece.

[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.900]
I'm just getting way behind you, which is good.

[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.580]
This will kill a couple of hours real fast.

[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.260]
1130.

[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.200]
No, that's much too late.

[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.600]
1130, my ass, Kippy.

[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.380]
Boy, you are useless.

[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:19.900]
What?

[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.460]
Name me a new account that you sold on the show since you've been here.

[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.020]
Name me one.

[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.900]
He's standing there in the doorway.

[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.720]
He's back here out of the doorway.

[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.360]
And now the door is closing and he's on the other side of it.

[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.680]
How do you like that, huh?

[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.420]
He ain't no true.

[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.240]
I'll tell you that.

[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.000]
In fact, he ain't no anybody.

[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.280]
He ain't even old fat boy.

[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.840]
Yeah, he just backs out the door.

[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.880]
Oh, he's...

[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.980]
Listen, we just expose the baker.

[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.020]
This is a man who came in here.

[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.920]
Now, Scrooan has got a thing for him because I understand he's got something she likes.

[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.400]
I don't know.

[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.380]
A pretty mouth.

[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:52.740]
Yeah.

[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.420]
But the bottom line is all he did was inherit a bunch of accounts that other people sold

[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.360]
or that I've had on the year for 100 years.

[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.960]
He comes in here and he's siphoning off the commission.

[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.220]
So now Jeff is going to be with our food and our so-it-1130.

[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.060]
Now, let me just say this.

[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.380]
Okay.

[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.380]
I don't want to get anybody nervous, especially some of the nervous nellies in middle-level management.

[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.280]
But look at my mug.

[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.280]
I'm not that one.

[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:13.840]
Mm-hmm.

[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.340]
I've got about three quarters of a mug full of dials.

[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:16.460]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:16.900]
Okay.

[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.740]
When it's gone, I'm gone.

[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:20.460]
Right.

[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.660]
How are you told him off that this morning?

[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.360]
He thought I was joking.

[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.640]
I can't do a show.

[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.360]
I don't know about you.

[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.220]
I have to keep sipping because...

[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.840]
No, anybody who's s-

[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.060]
You have to wet your palate.

[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:29.540]
Sure.

[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.780]
You can't do it with dry throat.

[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.040]
I mean, everybody like deep throat, but nobody likes dry throat.

[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:33.500]
Right.

[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.160]
And four of those during the course of the show.

[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:36.700]
Maybe.

[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.100]
Yeah, I would say that's about right.

[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:38.320]
One of them.

[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.520]
Which is the cancer when you're all that big, but one an hour.

[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:41.200]
Right.

[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.000]
I would say that.

[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.660]
And of course, it's not all that good for it, but then again, I'm still alive.

[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.020]
And I guarantee you my test to be a lot better than some of you much younger pubs out there.

[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:48.900]
Did you bring picture?

[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.680]
And you want to know why?

[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:50.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.880]
I brought you some inside pictures of my leg.

[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.020]
Backed them.

[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.760]
Just like that one.

[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.260]
Yeah, I know.

[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.020]
It's like something else.

[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.180]
We have a picture of each end.

[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.280]
Anyway, so here's some sci-fi.

[00:31:59.400 --> 00:31:59.820]
I'll show it away.

[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.060]
Yeah.

[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:07.080]
I mean, see, whoever's an insult to Georgia makes it seem like he's some kind of an overgrown child with that restriction stuff.

[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.400]
Okay.

[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.600]
Which in a way he is, but he don't want to do that in a year.

[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.480]
Well, let's suds do that.

[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:11.740]
Snippets.

[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.900]
Here's today's poll.

[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:13.980]
Well, we'll get to it in a minute.

[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.220]
I see he's already got it up there.

[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.980]
Well, he wants to get that up there so he can go do his thing.

[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:18.320]
Okay.

[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.020]
He's probably pretty pissed off here.

[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.840]
I've been wasted 40 minutes now.

[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.000]
Not even getting to the, you know, well, I'll do it in my own good time.

[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.080]
How do you like that, Fatso?

[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.420]
I'll do it when I get around to it.

[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.920]
I got some big fish to fry here today, including one.

[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.360]
He's just out of control.

[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.840]
Now that Jim Sarni wrote that piece, he was in here this morning.

[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.880]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.500]
He should go.

[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.260]
What should go?

[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:37.960]
And hit the pose.

[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:38.660]
And hit the pose.

[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.340]
Now look at that.

[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:39.740]
Hit the pose.

[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.800]
I mean, come on.

[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.060]
That's squeaky voice piece.

[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.660]
I mean, you don't have to have a great voice to be a hockey player or a sports broadcaster.

[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.580]
You have to have a distinctive voice, but you don't want to have a grating, annoying voice.

[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.480]
See, that's a difference.

[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.200]
See, the difference between a distinctive voice and a great voice.

[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.540]
And a grating, annoying voice.

[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.760]
Squeaky voice, like, oh, like that.

[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:02.740]
Wow.

[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.120]
No, necessarily.

[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.780]
There was actually a chill went up and down my spine when I heard, oh, God.

[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.340]
I mean, the idea of listening to a hockey game was something doing that for like two and a half, three hours.

[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.100]
Oh, wow.

[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.280]
It just, uh, well, you know something, Geldy, whatever crap we give you today, you deserve it.

[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:19.540]
All right.

[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.860]
And then the rumor from the organization is from inside the organization is that he's called up.

[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:31.700]
He called up people out of the phone book out of the Miami phone directory and Broward also.

[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.520]
So when you think, should I take that passage, I'm not having offered it to me.

[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.300]
What do you think?

[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.180]
Everybody, like, like, like this is what all of our lives are revolving around is.

[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.780]
And of course, nobody told him to go get his wife pregnant twice.

[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.080]
They could have waited a little bit, right?

[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.700]
Well, I think I can't stand these guys who like get their wives pregnant when they can't afford to be, uh, I'm sorry.

[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:51.920]
Sure.

[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:52.440]
Sorry.

[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.520]
Well, no, she, I mean, she pulled a fast one on you.

[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:55.940]
Right.

[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.380]
Is if I have to tell you that the whole world knows it.

[00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.960]
And ever, she has no shame, see?

[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:00.500]
No.

[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.580]
She's a woman.

[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.000]
Just like Teresa on passions.

[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.100]
Of course, now they get the blood test and we find out you'll see today that she actually is pregnant.

[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.600]
But of course, it's not the eggs from, uh, Gwen that she lost that baby.

[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.640]
She's pregnant by Ethan now is the deal on passions, which I know you're watching very closely.

[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:17.460]
Mm hmm.

[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.520]
And who the hell is that?

[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.480]
The Paloma that's coming back to a harmony.

[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.000]
La Paloma.

[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.660]
La Paloma Blanca.

[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.000]
La Paloma Blanca.

[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:25.580]
I don't know.

[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:26.620]
It's bizarre.

[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:32.240]
But then again, don't let me forget in a couple of weeks to do a poll about phrases and cliches.

[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.700]
We've done it before, but I have to do it again.

[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.660]
There are people hate you know the one that bothers me a lot speaking of sports casting and sports nerds.

[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.480]
Small ball.

[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.080]
Oh, I see you wouldn't understand.

[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:42.900]
I know I do.

[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:43.480]
It's a baseball.

[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:44.300]
Sure.

[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:49.940]
And as opposed to like having home run hitters in line of you got a bunch of guy that hit singles and bunts and sacrifice and, you know,

[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.640]
they scratch out a small ball.

[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.220]
Now the booster.

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:52.800]
I love boot.

[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.320]
He's great.

[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.100]
He's a good guy and he's also great at what he does as opposed to they've been boring with terminal.

[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.380]
But he says that to it.

[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.400]
And well, don't do it.

[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.400]
Please, booster.

[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.560]
You're a great broadcaster.

[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.320]
You don't need to say stupid cliches like small ball.

[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.380]
I mean, if you see Gully.

[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.100]
Although I hear things.

[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.340]
19 before 11 at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.780]
Well, we can't say the Olings anymore.

[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.560]
We can't talk about the size of this or better.

[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.120]
But small ball.

[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:20.400]
Oh.

[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.040]

Who needs a little training?

[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.540]
Why can't you understand?

[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.660]
You don't sound like a man.

[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.920]
Remove the rubber bands that choke.

[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.700]
Your scroll comes guilty.

[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.260]
Jelvy.

[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:20.720]
Jelvy.

[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.780]
Jelvy.

[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.620]
Your lucky management don't care.

[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.580]
Jelvy.

[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.340]
You don't belong there on the air.

[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.400]
Jelvy.

[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.780]
The sports can wait till your voice cracks.

[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.380]
Lost anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:44.840]
Absolutely.

[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.040]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.

[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.680]
L-K-L-D.

[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.120]
L-D.

[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.280]
When you're gone and grow up.

[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.280]
You think I want to throw up.

[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.560]
You feel a squeaky boom.

[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.320]
Go to broadcasting school.

[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.440]
Your pretty, you bastard.

[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:11.640]
Boys make you sound like a punks.

[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.360]
You're a punks.

[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.000]
I'm listening.

[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.380]
You're a punks.

[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.160]
You're a punks.

[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.620]
Silly people, I'll give you an example.

[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.480]
Cam Dennerbrook.

[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.260]
We like Cam a lot.

[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.380]
It used to be a sales guy at IOD.

[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.160]
And Tom, of course, has been a clear channel all these things.

[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.240]
He's had the rough life.

[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.960]
Most guys that like to e-card living in a sales business.

[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.000]
Now he's working for 850 up there with Bob Eisenberg.

[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.520]
And anybody else whose name ends in Berg?

[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.260]
Dennerbrook, Eisenberg, Goldberg, etc.

[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:42.860]
Anyway.

[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.860]
Now there's a guy who's a silly guy.

[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.340]
He doesn't take himself like real seriously.

[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:47.200]
Right.

[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:47.780]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.420]
Tom Dennerbrook understands his place in life.

[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.740]
He's just one of those silly people.

[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.860]
And we like Tom.

[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.660]
But like Gelly is a silly person.

[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.260]
But he takes himself seriously.

[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.360]
That's the difference, Steve.

[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:58.660]
Yeah.

[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.640]
Well, I don't want to spank you too much on a era.

[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.360]
But Randy Moor told me to do it.

[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.780]
I ripped that kid in the ass and put him back in his place.

[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.580]
Knock him down a couple of nachos.

[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:07.780]
Nachos.

[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:08.520]
Nachos.

[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:09.860]
Anyway.

[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.160]
Got a lot of stuff to do here today, including eat.

[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.540]
Man, oh man, this is great.

[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:15.180]
It's Friday.

[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.120]
It's Friday.

[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.460]
You're about to get out of here.

[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.120]
I'm getting a hell out of here.

[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:18.900]
Well, it was a party.

[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.220]
It was nice to see you and see in your purple piece.

[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:22.520]
You're comfortable with the people.

[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.540]
You got all the things done that you wanted done, right?

[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:26.860]
Yes.

[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:29.660]
Anyway.

[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.900]
Oh boy, you are dangerous.

[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.740]
You are dangerous.

[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.580]
In fact, you ever see George and Fat Rich together?

[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:36.820]
No.

[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.440]
Same person.

[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.180]
Look for the QM van that I had six to eight for a cigar tasting event.

[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.220]
These Stokey cigars.

[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.920]
By the way, I love a big cigar.

[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.740]
Big fat stone.

[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.260]
Not any kind of a cigar.

[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.220]
Good one bad one for New York one, but they will kill you.

[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.920]
Anyway, a cigar tasting event at Stokey cigars at 11612 North Kendall Drive.

[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.600]
Stopped to spin the wheel for Marlon Tickets.

[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.920]
Other prizes as well.

[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.180]
That's at Stokey's.

[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.140]
Six to eight to nine Kendall 170 there.

[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.680]
And I guarantee you Miguel will be there for that.

[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:02.540]
Probably.

[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.440]
He likes a Stokey.

[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:03.960]
Sure he does.

[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.280]
I can't tell you what he does with it.

[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:06.800]
I can.

[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.060]
Well, tomorrow afternoon, look for the QM van from 111.

[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:12.700]
It's Santa Rosa marble located at 3400 North West 77th Court, Miami.

[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.560]
Also, George will be out.

[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.940]
I don't know you were coming out this weekend.

[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.960]
George will be out from noon to two at Bill Siles.

[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.380]
Boulevard the savings on Northwest 36th Street in Miami.

[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.640]
He is now the famous Georgia so much a guy.

[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.100]
Not just he's actually got a name attached to the so much a guy.

[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.000]
Stopped by to win really marginal, very embarrassing prizes.

[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.400]
But enjoy really good free food from El adding city subs in our close friend Ira,

[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.720]
whom we love very, very much.

[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.780]
He's a good guy unlike his former partner Scott.

[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.580]
Scott's still there.

[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:37.700]
I haven't seen him.

[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:37.940]
Good.

[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.320]
And on Sunday, George will be a day land Chevrolet boy.

[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.500]
You're going to be busy this week.

[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:42.980]
I'm going to be going.

[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.820]
David Land Chevrolet at 8455 South Dixie highway in South Miami.

[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.540]
Stopped by to spin the wheel for prizes.

[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.200]
And enjoy free food from El adding city subs in one problem with his promo.

[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.880]
That is, it doesn't have a time.

[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.040]
Do we have a time for your food?

[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.660]
No, you do, I do believe.

[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.200]
No, no, no, no.

[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.020]
I don't want to pick out Miguel because he generally means well,

[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.740]
even though he's very confused and overly Cuban,

[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.420]
but obsessed with Fidel and all that crap.

[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.900]
But no, no, no, I guess Sunday.

[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.120]
See, that would be a good idea to put that in there instead of all the commercial stuff they stick in there.

[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:09.520]
Yeah.

[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:10.420]
All the free plugs.

[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.320]
Oh, we'll give you a hundred mentions on there.

[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.580]
Anyway, the reason I'm doing this poll today,

[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.960]
which some people already are voting on,

[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.020]
it Couseric is very impatient and he's done his part,

[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.800]
is because here in the inquire,

[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.120]
what has a list?

[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.220]
It has a list.

[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.460]
Magazine picks the craziest celebrities.

[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.520]
I added one.

[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:28.500]
Did you?

[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.100]
I see that.

[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.620]
And H and yeah.

[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.000]
But I can't vote.

[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.420]
But I did.

[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.600]
Anyway, who do you think is the all-time, craziest celebrity?

[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.700]
Michael Jackson's got 35.

[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.580]
Courtney loves got four.

[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.720]
Azziasmo in three.

[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.840]
None yet for Sidvicious or Anne Hayshad of the first 42 votes.

[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.140]
But we'll get a lot more names for the poll.

[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.020]
A lot more votes will start coming in, etc.

[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.860]
So now behind the beaded curtain today.

[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:53.600]
Look at this.

[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.820]
It's almost 11 o'clock already.

[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.180]
I'm just getting around to our beaded curtain.

[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.960]
By the way, Skippy, tell Ponytail to step on it, okay?

[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.160]
No, well, look at it.

[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.300]
I got a half a mug.

[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.060]
I better get a die.

[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:04.560]
I'm dying so ready.

[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.640]
Oh, and when the soda's gone, I'm out.

[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.160]
I'm out of here.

[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.740]
I told Muthat this morning you had a thought he'd run to the soda machine

[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.620]
or at least to Walgreens.

[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.300]
You know, tied me over just to make sure.

[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.000]
I guess you thought I was fun on him, okay?

[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.200]
It was a fucking joke.

[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.280]
I paid broadcast your like me.

[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:20.700]
Don't say that.

[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.360]
I'm not going to do damage to my throat.

[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:23.800]
My livelihood.

[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.160]
By sitting here doing dry throat on the air.

[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.660]
I mean, he ought to know something about dry throat.

[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.140]
Attention, man.

[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:29.560]
Yeah.

[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.380]
Well, that's his favorite line in it.

[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:33.820]
Huh?

[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.000]
But anyway, you know, thought that there were maybe clearance with all that money

[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]
you saved from getting the free lunch at Char Haathia today.

[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.360]
He would have gone down with a couple of nigger quarters, whatever.

[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.280]
He got me a diet soda tied me over till Ponytail gets here.

[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.760]
Then of course, once Ponytail gets here, we're expected to feed the whole building.

[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.700]
See, that's right.

[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.460]
That's what works.

[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.060]
They give us nothing just like Joey Zazai and Godfather 3.

[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.540]
You give me nothing.

[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.200]
You don't want to give, I'll take.

[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.020]
Yeah, I thought we could reason together.

[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:05.840]
Oh, my God.

[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.440]
Eli Wallach's pretty sure.

[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.720]
Oh, that could be.

[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.780]
We've done that pull.

[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.160]
Haven't we the worst acting performance?

[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.560]
Yeah, we did that not that long ago.

[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.200]
But it's just it is so unspeakable.

[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.880]
I mean, Sophia, she can't help it.

[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.720]
Number one, she's grotesque.

[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:18.920]
She's got that huge honker.

[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.400]
And number two, she's not an actress.

[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.760]
She's not thrust in the industry.

[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.600]
She was just the director's daughter.

[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.200]
That's all.

[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.880]
But Eli Wallach, what is his excuse?

[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.320]
He's been acted for a zillion years for about 30,000 more.

[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.160]
Like about 300.

[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.980]
You know, they'd be rewatched some of his old stuff.

[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.020]
And we'd find out that he was just a bad actor.

[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:36.820]
He was never a good actor.

[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.120]
No, I don't agree with your man.

[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.500]
Not, well, was he?

[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.500]
Never good as far as I know.

[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.060]
But not like that though.

[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:43.860]
Nothing was like that.

[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.820]
Not that bad.

[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:45.660]
That was his peak.

[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.440]
The good part.

[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.160]
In fact, even when he was croaking on Connie's canolees there,

[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.280]
he did it badly.

[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.580]
Remember, remember, she was looking with the glasses, you know,

[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.560]
with the opera, and she's looking with the little glasses,

[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.860]
and he's like, he's only ever melodramatic.

[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:57.920]
I noticed.

[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.180]
Keep on it.

[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.220]
Holy, holy, but first of all, nobody in Italy would say that.

[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.580]
Nobody anywhere in Italy would say that.

[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:11.060]
First of all, it was just a loaf of bread that he probably pulled out of his ass.

[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.160]
I mean, it was just, you know, out of the donkey's ass.

[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.000]
And then, holy, holy, but like it's a big surprise, like you know,

[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.320]
he used olive oil and Sicily.

[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:20.940]
I mean, wow.

[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.200]
What a concept.

[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.300]
It's just, well, the script didn't help either.

[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:25.520]
Yeah.

[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.580]
That was part of the problem.

[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.420]
Maybe they should hurt you.

[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.140]
It was, it was, actually, maybe it was a comedy.

[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.400]
We just didn't realize it.

[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.380]
Let's go watch it again.

[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:34.840]
Joey!

[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:35.900]
Zaza!

[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.720]
I did like, I don't like Andy Garcia all that much,

[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.540]
but I did like him there and I was, he went down the horse.

[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.220]
He's what?

[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:42.960]
He's a good actor.

[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:43.540]
He is?

[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.900]
Yeah, I thought we were in the untuckable.

[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.260]
Yeah, he's a good actor.

[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:46.460]
He was a good actor.

[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.040]
He was a chorus.

[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:47.640]
He was great.

[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:48.340]
He was good in that.

[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.720]
What else is he good at?

[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:49.720]

[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:50.060]

[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:50.820]
What else is he good at?

[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.440]
What else is he good at?

[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.580]
What else is he good at?

[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:56.540]
It'll come to me.

[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.020]
Don't ever give an order like that again.

[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.680]
It was not what I wanted.

[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:08.100]
Hey, Michael, how about some cake for your diabetic coma condition?

[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:08.760]
Anyway.

[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.480]
Who's that actor, a very great actor who played the apope that, uh,

[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.040]
and that's a true story, by the way, they killed the liberal pope.

[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:16.580]
They didn't like that.

[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.500]
Who's that guy?

[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.340]
I'm waiting for your great actor.

[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:19.960]
Huh?

[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.080]
You can look it up on Ian.

[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:21.840]
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:22.640]
Probably.

[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.380]
He was good.

[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:29.060]
Anyway, it'll take me an hour, but I'll be behind to be the curtain if you want to get all excited for the weekend.

[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.520]
Stephanie Seymour is on there.

[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.740]
That ain't enough of no slouch.

[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.400]
And maybe if you look close enough, you will see more.

[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.020]
Stephanie Seymour was born July 23rd, 1968.

[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.380]
That makes her 32 and 436.

[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.120]
Less, uh, a couple of months.

[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.780]
She's 35, almost 36, getting order by the minute.

[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.200]
Uh, she got her big break in March 1991, while shooting a sexy spread.

[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.260]
Can we say that?

[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.000]
No, no, no, no.

[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.480]
The shooting a sexy, for a playable and Florida beach.

[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.040]
Just four months after having her first child, Dylan.

[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.040]
Did you know that?

[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.040]
No.

[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:57.840]
What now you do?

[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.320]
And then the then 22-year-old Grace the cover of Vogue, UK.

[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.220]
Vogue.

[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:08.020]
Seymour's rise, however, began at age 14 when she modeled for local newspapers and department stores in her hometown of San Diego.

[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:08.840]
14.

[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.800]
She entered the elite look of the year contest.

[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:11.940]
Got the first prize.

[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.900]
She walked her runways of Europe for two years, and in 1993, appeared in Playboy's Valentine issue.

[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:25.860]
In 1994, Seymour hit Superstardom, and two striking photo shoots with famed photographer Richard Abedon for egoist and Versace jeans.

[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.220]
That year, Paris matched Nink of the most beautiful model.

[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.320]
She also began a longstanding link to Victoria's Secret.

[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.980]
Oh, but I don't see that show no more.

[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:33.620]
Mm-hmm.

[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.900]
Because the religion is the goody-two-shoes that crazy people leave.

[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:41.160]
They don't make sure that they ain't going to be on the more that Victoria's Secret Show.

[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.800]
You might see a boobier-two on there, or something you shouldn't be seeing.

[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:44.560]
Underwear.

[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.640]
And appeared on the covers of Sports Illustrated, Elle, Self and Vogue, Vogue.

[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.120]
She was in two music videos by Axel Rose, including Don't Cry in November Rain.

[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:57.320]
She is the most recognized face in swimsuit and lingerie modeling on the planet from here to Uranus.

[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:57.900]
So, do you like that?

[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:02.360]
Stephanie Seymour, behind the beaten curtain today on neorodges.com, take a puke at it, okay?

[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.940]
And make sure you got plenty of ID.

[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.060]
Because John Ascroft ain't taking no excuses.

[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:06.760]
Hold it up to the face.

[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.140]
He's not taking your word for it.

[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:14.220]
And make sure you hold your hands way up like, not just above the counter, but like up in the ear like it's a stick up like that.

[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:14.600]
Yeah.

[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.780]
Because it probably is.

[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.500]
Oh, he's used for Bush that I'm discovering here.

[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.260]
It just tears my kishki's out.

[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.600]
And Catholics, Catholics for Bush?

[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.560]
Well, that's because of that carry, you know, he's a baby killer.

[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.340]
Which never bothered him any of the time in the past, but he's a baby killer.

[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.080]
I don't get that whole deal, especially Bush's so virulently anti-Catholic.

[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.760]
The Pob Jones University thing.

[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:35.960]

[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.220]
The stuff that he did to McCain, all of this crap.

[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.480]
They believe the Catholics are Satan's church.

[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:41.560]
Yeah.

[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.400]
But they're all double words.

[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.240]
Well, you better show it up.

[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:43.580]
All right.

[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.020]
10, 57, and 5, 60, WQM.

[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:51.160]
If you're on one of those, you know what really cracks me up is this morning they had another segment with Dr. Pupta in his pants.

[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.500]
I'm seeing that about the Atkins diet again.

[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:03.820]
Not only is the low carb thing everywhere, but now they got every day, every show, even the comedy shows, they've got pieces on the Atkins diet.

[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:10.160]
If you're on Atkins, sugarbusters, South Beach or any of these low carb sugar redites that are just taking the world by storm right now,

[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.240]
you got to find a store that will give you some variety because otherwise, forget about it, you'll never stay on it.

[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:14.780]
It's boring.

[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.520]
But if you have some things with some taste, this is the place you can even stay on it and lose that weight.

[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.600]
Do you like the West Booker?

[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:25.280]
The shelves are loaded with all kinds of great stuff that are geared toward losing the most possible weight.

[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.000]
Not just unlike a low carb's a little bit, a cutting back, but I'm really losing weight.

[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.960]
The weight loss phase of low carb dieting.

[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:39.340]
Do you like, carries over a thousand great tasting products with a focus toward the lowest possible carbs that can really fit into a successful low carb weight loss plan?

[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.300]
There's spring sales in full swing right now, so stop on by the store.

[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:49.060]
There's stuff like I always tell you, really understand low carb dieting inside and out, and the lights is open every day, seven days a week from 10 to 10.

[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:54.720]
That's the lights of West Booker. You'll find them on the Northeast corner of Glades in 441, right next to Boston Market in Boca.

[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.580]
Boca, which by the way, don't get lost because it looks a lot like Tamarack.

[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.320]
Or column 12, what?

[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.460]
It looks just like Tamarack.

[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:08.340]
Or call tool free 1-877 Low Carb, that's what they'd W, L-O-W-C-A-R-B, or on WebItFlowCarb.com.

[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:13.400]
There's only one, but it's crap. One hell of a store, D-Lights of West Booker, your official Atkins retail center.

[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.460]
We're supporting you 560, UAE.

[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:22.260]
People are ice-holes.

[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.880]
We're so sorry, there is Rodman.

[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:32.660]
We don't stock and roll the teddies, use and green.

[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:39.340]
Or they, we're so sorry, there is Rodman.

[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:46.620]
But the panties come with snappies, use and fuel your little thing.

[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.420]
C'mon, Phil Jackson, notify me.

[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.020]
He said you're very picky, but you're dressing for the teeth.

[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.600]
He asked if you would buy wearing something other teeth, but your way to call.

[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.320]
Every time he jumps, you can see his basketball.

[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:13.600]
There you look, great target, retarded, or said, and for talk-out.

[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:24.220]
There you look, great target, and retarded, said, and for talk-out.

[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.980]
Fred is running, might just hit the floor, round, round.

[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.060]
Who is like you, the crowd, if you wanna hold it down?

[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:40.680]
Fred is running, might just hit the floor, round, round.

[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.360]
Bob and State don't touch the crowd, even let one play you down.

[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.260]
I'm listening.

[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:08.680]
Hey, you look, retarded, retarded, or said, and for talk-out.

[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:18.220]
Hey, you look, retarded, retarded, or said, and for talk-out.

[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.120]
Hey, you look, retarded, retarded, or said, and for talk-out.

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.120]

[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:40.920]
I'm listening.

[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.720]
I'm listening.

[00:51:49.420 --> 00:52:08.440]
Hey, you look, retarded, retarded, or said, and for talk-out.

[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:17.100]
is this crazy? There's the clue. Chuck Heston man. Hey Michael Moore wants to see

[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:22.780]
again Chuck for a follow-up interview. What do you say huh? 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60

[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:28.160]
on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. So what do you think? Gellery for the

[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:31.680]
Panther broadcast. We don't have any hockey fans. What a game last night. Wow!

[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:39.020]
Tampa Bay actually they had that Eastern conference thing wrapped up and

[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:43.400]
Daryl Sidore highly overrated. He played a horror game all the way around. He

[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.280]
makes a pass right in front of his own net right out to the blue line to a

[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.600]
Vladimir Malikov who sticks it over to Keith Primo who sticks it right in the

[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:55.940]
net. That was so bad Daryl. Too bad it wasn't like in New York that could

[00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:01.140]
all been going Daryl. Daryl it was bad. And so the flyers went in overtime which

[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:04.600]
they should have lost that game in one overtime. 6 to 5 very exciting game. And

[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.460]
so the series is tied three games a piece game seven in Tampa Bay tomorrow night.

[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.080]
You're gonna be going over for that? Sure you will for what? That hockey game

[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.160]
game seven of the Eastern conference final baby to see who plays Calgary. This is

[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.460]
go if the lightning wind and I'm sure pull them for them because I hate the

[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:24.420]
flyers. I like the lightning a lot. But if especially Brad Richards but if

[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:28.320]
lightning should win it would be Tampa Bay against Calgary in a standard cup

[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.620]
final. Can you imagine even you who know nothing about sports? Can you imagine

[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.140]
the American network now the CBC is happy because they got one Canadian team

[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.960]
in there. They're ecstatic. Even though nobody outside of Calgary cares about

[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.260]
Calgary. You think the people in Toronto you're flying crap about Calgary? No.

[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:48.260]
But your Cowboys. Much of those pickers. Calgary. Yeah Alberta. Right. Beaf people.

[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.640]
You know about it. But anyway so Calgary and Tampa Bay that I don't think

[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:58.020]
that'd be like a real ratings winner. But nevertheless 105 votes on air. I

[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:02.460]
better refresh this. Well no because I because I know you're adding some other

[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:07.520]
names like naturally show see you at her monitor 115 votes. Who do you think is

[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:12.140]
the all-time craziest celebrity Michael Jackson 85 nobody's gonna touch him and

[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:17.080]
who would want to Ozzy Osborne 17 Courtney loves God. Look at that. Courtney's

[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.400]
right up there with nine and Haitian's got three. So vicious one. None yet for

[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.880]
Denise Rodman Mike Tyson. Winona Ryder Ted Nugin or Charlton Heston out of the

[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.900]
first 115 votes. By the way it is a true story if there is a lockout and know

[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.280]
it in NHL season next year that Panthers in order to raise some cash will be

[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.180]
doing that dinner with the you know that they do over here. Usually it's

[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:40.240]
weighted. There's a puck in my soup but only in these pot family be appearing

[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.700]
this year. It'll be called weighted. There's a frog in my soup. Denise pot

[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:49.900]
fan what no river. Rhymer I think there's no rhyme or reason is to why they even

[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.920]
do that whole deal. Waiter there's a frog in my soup a dumb frog in my soup.

[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:59.100]
Oh sorry Denise there's another one for you. Hardass. That's a real yeah.

[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.420]
Lot of real schmucks in that organization make no mistake about it and that

[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:08.960]
Randy Moore what's that title again here it is I guess I better get to this. Jim

[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.820]
Sarny one of these silliest people on the face of the globe a real silly old

[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:17.040]
koot. He may know who he makes even look good. Howard from Bokeh. Right. He

[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:22.000]
makes most seem like a real upstanding old guy. That's what a jerk Jim Sarny is. Jim

[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:27.140]
why don't somebody buy him a radio so we know what that he's writing about. He

[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:31.340]
writes the Panthers hunt for a new radio voices reach the final stage with eight

[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:37.660]
candidates including WQIMs Steve Gellie Goldstein. Flying to replace Jigs

[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:40.520]
McDonald who retired at the end of the season and certainly in not a minute too

[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:45.320]
soon. Several observers believe Gellie is the out the leading candidate and

[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:51.200]
the club would be wise to pick him right Jim Sarny. Why is the pick. Gellie has

[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.580]
been a vital member of the Panthers broadcast team for seven years doing

[00:55:54.580 --> 00:56:00.340]
pre-game and post-game shows television and filling in on play by play once. Am I

[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.700]
wrong about that? Did you do more than one game? Yes. He didn't he didn't fill in

[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.600]
on play. I mean he may have laid to fill in but he certainly didn't fill in

[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.620]
more than one game when Christine and Moore was being hijacked in New

[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:15.320]
Joy's Year something. He has an identity with the club and here here comes

[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.660]
another one of those brilliant lines that we get in South Florida and the fish

[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.920]
wrappers down here just like that Howard Cohen's in the big O6 one of six

[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.980]
wasn't hurt by loose now it's turned this is the kind of journalism you get

[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:29.120]
here and I use that to very loosely. He has an identity with the club is

[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:35.860]
involved in the community an important element in modern broadcast. Now modern

[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:39.020]
broadcasting which means that almost every radio station has got a bunch of

[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:42.320]
syndicated shows where whoever is on the air is got nothing to do with the local

[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.300]
community is broadcasting from four thousand miles away is either the same fat

[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.160]
ass limbaugh or dr. Laura one of those losers that has nothing to do with

[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:58.380]
wherever you are but an important element in modern broadcast. See all he's

[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:05.140]
doing is just sticking his tongue in Gelties. I'm definitely interested gold

[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:08.900]
scenes and we've been talking we're talking. I don't know if I want to do all 82

[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:13.420]
games though I mean a lot of games I got to do kids. The path is opening as

[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:18.000]
creative as a goal as a goal. Has it created a lot of interest around the country

[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.620]
it says. I know I see I just can't conceive of him really doing the games. You

[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:26.780]
know what I mean? Take a moment to think about it. No I already have I just I can't

[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:30.460]
see being the hockey maven that I am and being an expert on the great hockey

[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:34.460]
broadcasters of all time like Dan Kelly and Bill Hewitt and all the

[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:38.780]
Grigio Bowen, Michael Lang, Rick Generette and Sam Hayek and Wilson I don't put

[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:42.460]
the Geltie in that category now or ever quite frankly. If you know what I mean

[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:46.920]
not that I want to pick on him all of Joe Rose is really on the outs with him.

[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:51.300]
Joe don't watch on the show by the way Geltie. See his problem now is he's

[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.840]
between a crock and a hard place because he's between Howard from Bokeh and Joe

[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:59.300]
which don't know what I'm going to show so he got no chance of that. So if he

[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.360]
wants to keep a job with he's being very overpaid anyway. He's got to stick with

[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.540]
the Howard from Bokeh because he's already bringing that bridge not a good idea

[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:13.660]
right? He was what? Right? Well you know the light situation he had in there.

[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:18.760]
He was the one guy the one person that would at least tolerate Howard from Bokeh

[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.200]
right and so they were been on together and I think I don't know but he's just

[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.600]
got a feeling of hostility there that is so deep and so great he wants to get away

[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.660]
from Howard from Bokeh at the worst possible way so his only opportunity now is

[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:36.120]
only shot is the Panther broadcasters. Now we get the last part of this

[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.220]
and there's a couple more interesting things in here in Jim Sarni's pathetic

[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:43.360]
column. We received over 50 tapes and it's an impressive list said Randy

[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.660]
Moore the Panthers director of broadcasts. Oh my director of broadcasting is

[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:52.900]
Bozo the clown junior from Red Deer Alberta or Saskatchewan where the hell it is

[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.380]
and the team's radio analyst it was tough narrowing it down said Randy

[00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:00.480]
Moore who told Joe Rose that was so great when he called Joe at the end of

[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:05.080]
the show. I think Joe made a lot of money. That was fun. That was great. Nice going

[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.360]
Joe you to man that blockhead you know when you least expected he what did I

[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:12.360]
tell you what I always said about Joe Rose. Good guy but a little bit of a back

[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.420]
stabber and you just don't want to be on the stabbing end which he likes me a

[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:19.400]
lot and I like him to. No you know what I'm saying right when you least

[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:24.020]
expected man he slips that knife in air and just twisted. I'm feeling good. Yeah.

[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:31.480]
Yeah. Then lightning rod can pan can Panther fans roof it a lightning they're

[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.420]
hated rivals and the Stanley Cup finals miss Sarni wants to know it's good for

[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.360]
hockey in the state more said that's the director of broadcasting for

[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:41.120]
the country's Randy Red Deer Andy Moore. The main thing is Rick Dudley built

[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.280]
the lighting and that's exactly what we have going with the Panthers that's

[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.840]
what we're going to be the blue parents right across the state right you should

[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.820]
live so long. The lightning would create interest in the sports throughout the

[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:53.880]
state said Jeff Reemer a Rimer the Panthers TV announcer it would be much like

[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:58.100]
696 when the Panthers win the finals the examine interest was state-wide. Does

[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.100]
anybody believe that? No. No. People in Tampa they could care less about us and

[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:07.340]
we feel more so only times about a thousand right. That's our feeling is

[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:11.000]
Tampa I can't play that drop in anymore. No. Not believe it very well. Well we don't

[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.220]
want to get muffled then other shape on her Friday. Spall or whole weekend you

[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:21.240]
know probably a conjure up ideas of heading for fantasy fest. When is fantasy

[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.760]
fest? Halloweenish? I don't know. Why he's probably making her plans already and

[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:31.380]

gonna have like a Roger Clemens deal that's true you're right the fact I

[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.880]
thought they would be talking about that he when Houston plays on a road he

[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.340]
doesn't bother going is it just here is it like anywhere no road trip he doesn't

[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.800]
want to go because he's old and feeble like me I see in your Greg don't okay

[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.640]
and I'm thinking also like you know I'm thinking it was great this week because I

[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.940]
had that thing on a procedure on Tuesday and then yesterday the doctoring Monday

[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.280]
Wednesday and Friday and then the summertime Tuesday and Thursday sounds good

[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.400]
and that's how good to you sure what no this was this was a great week see he's

[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.200]
laughing that he told me about Roger Clemens I'm sure a hell of a lot more

[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.520]
entertaining they're Roger Clemens I may not strike out as many guys but you

[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:44.340]
know not what I heard yeah well no you're business anyway so Greg

[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.380]
just came in which I that couldn't knock me over with a feather probably thought

[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.960]
the food was here already now he wouldn't want to stay in that the $600

[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.780]
for the suit it was where it's a nice jacket it was a very nice the pants didn't

[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.580]
match the jacket though you notice that yeah I don't want to say anything is what

[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:03.080]
I heard his feelings really shlumper like haircut which he always does but what

[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.120]
do we know what do we know what I know a lot I can't say what I know but I know

[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.680]
no no seriously the jacket did not match those pants he had a dark blazer which

[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:18.300]
was very nice expensive blazer and like very light gray almost like those

[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:24.200]
checkered pants that the more wears I thought maybe boredom I couldn't have been

[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:30.320]
most because there was no stain in the back anyway oh that's bad is what that is

[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.780]
absolutely God you are bad well I was pretty nice it's been a very pleasant week

[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:41.240]
very shocking so far let's say Jonathan Witters is crazy says John in

[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.700]
Columbia South Carolina who just loves this show so much he's out of control

[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:47.580]
he's on that fact machines probably squatting on it right now and a machine

[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:54.380]
to let's say brief letter today's New York Times is served to be heard from

[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:58.960]
John Scalise in non-pleasant Michigan who writes you are correct when you say

[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.400]
the emphasis must now be on the future it is clear that the 93 attack on a

[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.840]
world trade center did not sufficiently proud the federal government to

[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:10.160]
plan seriously for and finance coordinated responses to such attacks sadly

[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.740]
the Bush administration appears to be ignoring the lessons of 9-11 by

[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.760]
diverting money to questionable anti-terror measures without financing

[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.040]
effective programs to help local communities respond to terrorism when it

[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.160]
happens you see Mayor Bloomberg screaming and whining though they about how they

[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.540]
just aren't got any funding right and places like Peoria they're getting like

[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:29.960]
billions and he's getting like 15 bucks every reports in 9-11 say John Scalise

[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.900]
shows that we're still unprepared for attacks in our most vulnerable cities

[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:36.140]
like Geneva New York an addition president Bush has squatted the good will of

[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.620]
the world and billions of dollars on a war in Iraq that has no bearing on

[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:42.320]
terrorism except the full method while Mr. Bush has presented himself as a

[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.620]
war president and on ending terrorism his real legacy will be a country

[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:48.760]
hopefully unprepared for future terror attacks of John and my

[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.700]
pleasant goodnight John thanks for factoring it along Gary Busey somebody says

[01:06:52.700 --> 01:07:00.120]
spell very bad answers Gary Bussey he had that brain injury why he strains

[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:05.020]
though he's crazy a lot of crazy people running around Chris says just tuned in

[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.320]
last night Alice Rantell was against on the Dennis Miller show oh what a good

[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.000]
match made in purgatory that is Al was sandwiched in between two other

[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.460]
fascists and she looked like a fem version of how he doodie

[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:22.540]
Alice Rantell does he have arthritis or is he just weird who Alice yeah both I

[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:25.800]
don't know is he she have arthritis I haven't seen her in a long time I've seen

[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:31.360]
him once self-hating queen it's all weird looking Liz Taylor somebody suggests

[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:37.140]
there is a great choice neurotic nutcase fag-hag just but look like that

[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:40.840]
Liz Taylor go away Liz okay we're tired of here that you're dying in fact if

[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.300]
you're gonna die please do it soon Liz Taylor we're tired of hearing about so

[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:48.060]
anyway here's Jim Sarni's column I guess I can what oh well that was some very

[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:51.840]
important material I don't need to like Pia didn't I go to bat for Geldie I want

[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:55.240]
to make it very clear again in fact the only reason that he still got his and

[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.760]
Greg was still in here which he ran out real fast but if he was in here he could

[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.480]
vouch for me sure when they broke up the first time when Greg screwed up the

[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.320]
radio station and sent the first team packing

[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.760]
dredge packing they they came right in here him and muff of course that was

[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:15.200]
before clearance got promoted to being a chief cook and bottle washer and the

[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.000]
crock scratcher what no sir that was discussing

[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.020]
with you know you don't come in here I'm you're not my type clearance okay no

[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:27.680]
sir I thought he was coming on to me really he kept like arranging and I don't

[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.820]
know maybe just had a little problem there maybe it was a his search party couldn't

[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:34.260]
help him out today I don't know I have no idea what that was all about but

[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.700]
anyway Geldie was on the block I don't even know if he knows this he was this

[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:41.400]
close a little curly here away you know the kind you find on the soap if you use

[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.400]
that anymore right see that's another great thing about using the body wash is

[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.320]
there's no hair on it right on a plastic bottle because if there was it like

[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:54.540]

[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.680]

[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.160]
and down with these people but you know the Cleveland Clinic the one out there

[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.620]
in now is that Western I guess I'm a writer I'm Western Road there by off our

[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.720]
right of Parkway I've had some experiences there that weren't the best

[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.460]
especially when it used to be on McNabb Road there what was it McNabb and

[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:46.920]
something whatever it was and then you're gonna February when my good friend

[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.760]
doctor Bush put me on the treadmill and damn near kill me I ripped them and

[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.740]
asked you know but they really treated me very very nice they believe me I

[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.560]
didn't get any freebies I played paid plenty there yesterday believe you me I

[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.340]
paid plenty but you know what it was worth it what I always tell you when I do

[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.580]
that spot for Hollywood diagnostics it's peace of mind man when you can go in

[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.960]
there and they check everything from your from your armpit to your throat to

[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.480]
your neck and everything in between and you say I'm pretty good shape

[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.200]
considering what the fat Slav you are and you say I ride and you start making

[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.080]
plans for like living your life you know I suppose they're like rolling over

[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:21.520]
and playing dead here's another suggestion for our poll let me give you a clue

[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.680]
yeah the craziest person out of them all Scott Farrell a little bit too crazy

[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:32.080]
and a little bit too wild or no I should say a lot too crazy and a lot too wild in

[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.020]
fact ponytail probably and did you ever meet Farrell was he ever involved with

[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:39.140]
you at all or no no that's probably why you're still in business and knowing

[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:41.580]
the kind of pervert you are if you hooked up with him that would have been no

[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:45.300]
that would have been it that would have been the end I was not wasn't bad enough

[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.760]
we got you hooked up with Al Goldstein that was the beginning of your road to

[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.940]
the property but getting you hooked up with the Farrell that would have been a

[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:51.180]
pain

[01:16:53.860 --> 01:17:01.040]
what is this I know how to do it you know what kind of a are you like my mother I've

[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.500]
already got one mother she's almost 91 by the way I think 90's hold on up mom

[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:11.660]
anyway how she's all right how is mom how's fat rich you know all that crap look at

[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:16.900]
this some beautiful Italian sausage Keppane or lilyva yeah where's he like

[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:20.440]
Wallach when we need him he is just brutal you know I don't think what have I

[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:25.020]
taken one call so far have you taken one yeah I took the one the guy that was

[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:28.860]
ripping guilty and asked which our life he was spanking guilty it's spank guilty

[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.180]
Friday if we could make it a regular thing just rip him and ask every Friday

[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.780]
till they like our crawls into a hole and goes away don't take any more

[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:38.140]
because so far all the calls have been good today all the cover we had one for one

[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:42.640]
yeah thank you very much pal it was a good call no seriously if the only reason I

[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:47.560]
went to bat for him was because it was at the time it's just like when I saved your job when

[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.520]
most try to get you fired and your wife took you into the unwanted pregnancy right I mean not

[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.300]
that I wouldn't have gone to bat for you anyway but just that really sealed I mean the deal yeah

[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.820]
that's timing I'm gonna let you be out on the beach with like an unwanted kid on the way

[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:05.920]
what right plus I like Sabrina she's a sweetheart she's British she's a great little girl and

[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.940]
not little anymore I know it's hard and yeah you I could deliver with her without but I mean

[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:16.800]
Sabrina I like a lot and your wife wow that's the story no she's all right I don't want to say too

[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.340]
much because is she listening who does yeah she's probably watching Ricky Lake probably

[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:29.180]
just just relax you a little bit too red in the face okay jeff Cohen it no see I know what you

[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:33.980]
were doing before you came here I know exactly what you were doing see nervous and don't say

[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:39.180]
anything because I'm not opening up your mic this time I will not do it this man probably this

[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:44.140]
morning had the wildest sex in the history of the human race he just looks like even the dolphins

[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:49.000]
that the camp don't sweat even even the big linebackers the 600 pound guys don't sweat like your

[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.380]
sweat right profusely red is a beat I mean I know it's out Florida but it's not exactly a hundred

[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:57.880]
of the reason the shade out there you know it's from yesterday what when in doubt you're working

[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:02.200]
it out oh yeah you were at the beach yesterday screwing over George all right we know exactly the

[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.560]
game you play it's give me told us you don't want to come in here with food for George and Josh

[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:10.720]
because they're small potatoes you don't care about them you're making a TV spot well it's a good

[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.520]
thing get that one with me and remember off here please I don't really care so that's the deal

[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.540]
jeff isn't going to be running too many more spots anymore I'll just give him some free plugs

[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:22.680]
on the year and that way Skippy gets screwed out of the commission I'm gonna start getting even

[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.800]
with these QM sales people that my last couple of years here you'll see what what do you live in

[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.500]
about you saw what I did to Todd directly other day I stepped on his pathetic little last when he tried it you know

[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:38.520]
we've got a bunch of losers man in that sales department the only people we like are Adam and Troy

[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:43.600]
that's it might leave anybody out that I mean my boy's kind of grown on me

[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:51.160]
hi boy has kind of grown on you hi I wonder what that four hundred pound growth was on your elbow

[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:56.120]
there it could be because he's going to be dead any minute oh senator you feel sorry for him

[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:00.960]
why because he's going to be dead anyway but no no see a fat people who are nice people we're

[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:05.640]
going to die from being fat then you feel sorry for them like your brother right good guy very

[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:11.300]
guess from what you said okay and your other friend that died with but but he he's a fat guy who's

[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:17.960]
going to die and I have no sympathy for him he means well no he is not oh my god

[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.180]
oh

[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.420]
and

[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:31.660]
me

[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.840]
of

[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:38.740]
your

[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:43.920]
We will mock you on your hands

[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.800]
With flesh our eyes,

[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.880]
And to fly our sight

[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.320]
To reclaim your good you sing

[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.740]
It's a legal drugart parting to you

[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.540]
A good old I will sing

[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:08.260]
The day to sleep

[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:12.040]
Glory as death's ringing

[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:21.740]
O, give the besties as that stone to me

[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:31.180]
O, give the besties as that stone to me

[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.840]
O, 14 to noon I got food in my mouth

[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:40.800]
Bad, bad style

[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.360]
Bad radio baby, we don't want to do bad radio

[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.120]
Because Rick Shross says I do great radio

[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.220]
What he said when he writes

[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:51.240]
But that was before I got so old about a month or two

[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.100]
Rick Shross, he's a great guy

[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:54.160]
Don't be picking on Ricky Ticket

[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.500]
He ain't a day over 80

[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.040]
He's a good guy

[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.100]
That cap though he got a stink like hell by now

[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:03.560]
Anyway so Will says, what is this?

[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.560]
See I can't, oh no, oh no

[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.080]
Page 104 George

[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:12.160]
I don't want these things Will, okay

[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.040]
I do read the BBC website, I do read all the Guardian, the Independent, the Mirror, all of those things

[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.320]
I don't want this stuff, please, okay?

[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.440]
I want to do mostly a lighthearted show today

[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.820]
Have a pretty good time, I don't want to try to save the world from George W

[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:27.520]
You'll have a chance on November the 2nd

[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.160]
I got a whole bunch of Jews, I'm going to lock in a room

[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.240]
Make sure they can't get out to the polls or closed

[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.060]
What is that all about these Jews for Bush?

[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.340]
Can you explain that to me?

[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.100]
Sure like you said, it's money, Israel

[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:42.220]
No, no but Israel's the excuse, don't you understand?

[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.060]
Israel's the excuse

[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:45.240]
It's a really new word to play in the world

[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.700]
There was a phrase about Israel they'd be over there right now in a kabuts

[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:48.900]
Lay into fillin

[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.860]
Throw in rocks at the women at the wailing wall

[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:53.240]
They'd be doing something useful, okay?

[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.560]
Like blowing away those little Palestinian kids

[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.540]
God, all these people so obsessed

[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.960]
I just can't deal with that anymore, the older I get the more nauseous it makes me

[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.800]
The Cubans with their Cuba and the Jews with their Israel

[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:09.700]
Coxa Chois, that's my comment to you, okay? Cut the crap

[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:10.600]
What?

[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.780]
No, I got a basket right here, just eat your lunch really

[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.140]
You definitely need to calm down a little bit

[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:17.820]
You're a little bit hyper

[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:22.980]
Let's see, who do you think is the all-time?

[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:26.200]
Now somebody says, of course, because they can't leave Malone, W

[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:29.900]
That's not the category we're looking for, okay?

[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:33.520]
We're not looking for politicians, he's crazy, well, crazy like a fox

[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:34.820]
You know what I mean?

[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:35.240]
Yeah

[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.120]
He's just a face man anyway, they don't want to understand that

[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.060]
He is the face man, Cheney is the one that's pulling all the shots

[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:46.160]
Cheney and Wolfowitz and Richard Pearl, Robe, Carl, Robyn Maniac

[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.020]
Well no, Rob is just the PR guy

[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.500]
He's just the strategist, but I'm talking about the people that make all these decisions

[01:23:53.140 --> 01:24:02.380]
And how come this Ahmed Chalabi, or however they're pronouncing it this week, how come they want to tell us, not only is he turning over secrets to Iran, but he's also a business partner of Dick Cheney

[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.500]
They don't buy the tonus that it is

[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.340]
They don't buy the tonus that it is

[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:04.820]
They don't buy the tonus that it is

[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:06.420]
They don't buy the tonus that it is

[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.760]
Because people might get pissed off

[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:15.840]
I'm thinking to myself if Clinton would have invaded another country almost unilaterally that had represented no threat to us and lied about the excuses for us

[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.980]
Talk about impeachment that would probably be hung in right in the middle of the Capitol building

[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:19.760]
Yeah

[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.860]
In fact Mel Gibson could have made another movie about it

[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:26.140]
They're nailed to sass up on a cross right out in the White House lawn

[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.420]
You know what I mean?

[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.640]
Yeah, exactly

[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.820]
But this son of a bitch for whatever reason they can do whatever he can do whatever he was

[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:40.280]
Oh, anybody that sets the point of Israel, how can I be against him? Well, what does that mean? What does that mean, Moishi?

[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:41.080]
Huh?

[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.620]
Jesus, K Christ

[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:49.640]
Don't they know the rest of the plan for Israel from the president and his buddies?

[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.980]
They don't care, convert or die

[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:52.400]
They don't want to think that far

[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.340]
From here on they always die

[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.720]
Tax cuts, tax cut for the rich

[01:24:55.740 --> 01:24:57.120]
Tax cut for rich investors

[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.000]
Tax cuts for my aunt

[01:24:59.440 --> 01:24:59.960]
Oh yeah

[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:04.420]
5,670560, pound 560 on a AT&T

[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.520]
They're sending all these kids off to be slaughtered over there

[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.640]
It's like, yeah, that's all it is

[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.020]
It's a human sacrifice thinking of nailing on the cross

[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:11.620]
That's exactly what it is

[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:19.220]
And when they now CBS you see on Dan, whether they put these pictures up in these kids and they give you the whole low down who got killed and what her?

[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.620]
And I don't say this disrespectfully

[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.600]
These people aren't heroes, they're victims

[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:25.180]
Right

[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.360]
Right

[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:34.060]
A hero is somebody that goes out and does something constructive to save somebody else to help somebody else race for love and be on

[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:35.280]
They're a good purpose

[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:41.420]
These people, well intentioned obviously, most of them except the abusers, but these people, all they are as victims

[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:44.320]
That's all they're being set off to be slaughtered like sheep just like in Vietnam

[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.500]
That's all, they're not heroes

[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:49.340]
They're victims, they're tragic victims of a bunch of ruthless lunatics

[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.520]
Even Miguel knows that

[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:53.280]
Miguel ain't voting for Bush

[01:25:53.980 --> 01:26:00.760]
See that? And I'm gonna tell you when Miguel, Esco Barr, the drug man, when this son of a bitch is voting against Bush

[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.080]
What does that tell you, okay?

[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.660]
In addition to what tell us Bush done about the, if he would invade Cuba then he would vote for Rob

[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:10.180]
And you know something, that would have been a hell of a better idea

[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:11.540]
Sure

[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:16.200]
If all that crap going on down there is so important and we're so concerned about Fidel, Fidel, all this other garbage

[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.900]
And by the way he will look 240, he said

[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:19.120]
But what?

[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.420]
Well that'll at least keep him something they'd be concerned about the rest of his life

[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:24.360]
He got something to look forward to Fidel, Fidel

[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:26.720]
Anyway

[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.200]
We still only took one call, right?

[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:29.600]

[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.060]
Well let's keep it that way for while

[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.880]
No, we gotta get a lot of these calls on, there might be important names on here that we're looking for crazy celebrities

[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.640]
Like Whitney Houston

[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.320]
Sure, got her

[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:40.920]
Alright

[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.980]
He's on the enquire list, yeah I held some back

[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.040]
Purposely

[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:47.180]
I'll give you another one

[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:49.240]
Why just sitting there tapping away?

[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:52.040]
Jury Lee Lewis

[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:52.780]
Oh yeah

[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:55.220]
Mary is what, three-year-old cousin, whatever she was

[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.960]
Yeah Jeff Cohen, his eyes lit up when he heard about that

[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.680]
It sounded like a good idea, yeah he could really bang on it

[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.460]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line

[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:08.700]
What do you think about Geldie doing the Panther games, Jeff?

[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:09.780]
No chance

[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:11.340]
No chance

[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.240]
Spank him

[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:13.560]
No

[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:16.140]
No

[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.000]
No

[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:20.380]
I hear Randy Motors gonna stand back at any way so don't worry about it

[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.440]
Geldie you're out, man, you pissed too many people off

[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.600]
Too much talk too much, you've got a big mouth

[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.120]
See, in this business, Geldie, don't have a big mouth

[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.500]
Maybe on the air have a big mouth but off the air keep it close to the vest

[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.360]
Bigha bigha bigha, you know, call a lot of people out of the phone

[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.560]
Oh, buddy, it's a kid who 40 won games, 82 games, I'm gonna be Graham

[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.920]
I'm gonna be next year, oh boy, I'm gonna be Bill and Foster

[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.660]
He would all roll up and I'm gonna be out of my mouth

[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.600]
Nobody wants there some squeaky voice, putts

[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.040]
Broadcasting the sporting event, okay?

[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.900]
It's a goal, it's a goal

[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.120]
I don't wanna hear that

[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.460]
Man, that's the one thing that Rimmer can, you know, be safe forever

[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.460]
Did I put Geldie on here?

[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.000]
Did I see who announced?

[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.620]
Lemme tell you a story, okay?

[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:04.580]
Lemme tell you a story

[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.220]
The first one they were gonna mind me a arena, the first five or six seasons, whatever was

[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:11.380]
Back when it used to be a lot of fun by the way, the pants is thing

[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.860]
And when we had really a fan base till I pissed everybody off

[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:19.100]
He and my season seats, the last two years were in a arena, maybe three years

[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:25.020]
Were right next to, right the first row below where he and Denise used to sit up there, old froggy

[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:29.640]
And during the game every time I would look back at it, he was doing two shows

[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.920]
He was doing a broadcast on a year and doing a show for me

[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:36.540]
And in between periods it was always, he'd be standing in there in the back and calling me up there

[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.340]
I'd have to schlep through the crowd, schlep up there

[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:42.560]
Not to say anything but just because to piss off that he's pop band

[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.340]
Because then he hates me like poison

[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.420]
That looked like Todd Dresdans in here, they were there, didn't it?

[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:54.380]
I didn't know that Todd, my phone fell down

[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:58.300]
I didn't know that Todd Drekken, Jeff Rumor, went to the same school of dance in their pants

[01:28:58.300 --> 01:28:59.660]
I didn't know that, till this moment

[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:02.060]
I thought it was the tag, he is all along

[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.220]
Oh, hey if Rumor's listening, what's your name?

[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.440]
I'm sure he is Jeff just insulted you bad man

[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.380]
Something about an ass

[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:10.780]
What?

[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.780]
He's dancing doing a game?

[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:16.380]
Yeah, he's like often but playing on the table

[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.840]
That's a like a show

[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.220]
Really? Well you have a good time watching

[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.660]
You ought to see him when he reaches over to pick up the check

[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:23.020]
Not

[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:27.560]
Maybe that's why he does that during the game

[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.300]
Because he's not nearly as animated a dinner

[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:32.860]
Because he might accidentally reach over in his hand

[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:34.480]
Might brush, make a brush with the check

[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:35.920]
Bad move

[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:37.600]
WQM

[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.420]
Oh, see the everywhere I'm supposed to be taking these calls

[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:41.420]
That just woke me up

[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:42.940]
WQM, hello

[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:44.320]
Hello Neil

[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:44.920]
Yes sir

[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:48.760]
Yeah, I was calling the two things, and Nicole Smith for the poll

[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:49.800]
Okay

[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:53.520]
And what was the deal with Mueller telling Joe Rose

[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.320]
Because I listened this morning and Joe was ripping Goldie

[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:58.640]
What did Mueller have to say?

[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.000]
Joe cut him off

[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.280]
Joe pretended that he was out of time and just said, oh yeah, I'll talk to you later Randy

[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.080]
It was great

[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:04.880]
He did?

[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:05.840]
That's hilarious

[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:06.840]
I have a good weekend

[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:07.720]
You too, Polly, thanks

[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.920]
Yeah, it was great the way Joe Rose handled the Randy Mueller

[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:12.480]
Joe is, there's a lot more there than you think

[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.420]
Because on the face of it, Joe sounds a little bit like a dord

[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.300]
If you know what I mean, I hate to say that

[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.080]
That's not what I really meant

[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.100]
I mean not a dord like

[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:21.260]
Howard from Bokeh, not like that

[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.240]
But underneath that dumb jock exterior

[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.580]
It is a pretty sharp mind

[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.360]
And you better be aware

[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.160]
Because once he sharpens up that shit of man

[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.680]
You better not be under receiving end

[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:31.800]
You don't want to talk about it?

[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:32.520]
I don't want to talk about it

[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:32.760]
I don't want to talk about it

[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:32.820]
I don't want to talk about it

[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:33.800]
I don't want to talk about it

[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.440]
I don't want to talk about it

[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:35.980]
I don't want to talk about it

[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:39.900]
I don't want to talk about it

[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.980]
Waddling in here so we can cry on my shoulders

[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.520]
I don't know, I want to think I think I got a shot, what do you think?

[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.060]
I think the answer, Goldie, I don't want to look, you know, peon your parade

[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:49.060]
But I think the answer is no

[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.420]
No, you're not going to get it

[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.320]
Because the director of broadcasting is Randy Mueller, right?

[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.900]
He must have a lot to say about it

[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:57.040]
You'd think

[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.240]
When you think of he's the director of Panthers broadcasting

[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:02.760]
And all these other titles they gave him because he's a silly person with a clown nose

[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:05.780]
I mean, it fits right in with the ambience to the organization

[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.560]
The organization has been in business how many years now?

[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.420]
About 30 men

[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:10.580]
Three years they made the playoffs

[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:12.060]
How the Panthers do it in a playoffs?

[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:15.000]
They make it a fowl, they're like, oh, by the way, Skippy, you better not eat any of this food

[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.100]
You little piece of crap

[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:20.820]
I sure hope that Skippy heard what I said before about how Jeff is going to stop running spots all together

[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:23.900]
So I'll just give him preplugs so that we can take away all your commission that you're stealing

[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:28.100]
And Jeff thinks it's a great idea because basically he said, Skippy sucks

[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:32.320]
My life and all this is for radio by city

[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:40.240]
I owe my favorite Republican, this is not drugs

[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.440]
And it's time for the real excuse me uploading

[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.940]
It's time once again for the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour

[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.080]
It sounds that you hate

[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:05.500]
But I'm an idiot and I think they're really great

[01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.100]
I doubt that you can't handle one or two

[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:12.980]
Much less or eight

[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.820]
It sounds that you hate

[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.580]
Come in from the boys they will surely separate

[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:23.560]
I tell you what they are

[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.080]
Guaranteed you'll go, yeah

[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:31.660]
I like fingernails on a blackboard

[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.080]
People crack their neck for their knuckles

[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.660]
When I rough style we're full together

[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.040]
That just makes me shak-

[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:44.560]
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha

[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:47.720]
Eight sound you can't stand

[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:52.000]
Would you tolerate if you were half the man I am

[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.240]
And to the list of eight

[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:59.020]
A fork and a knife scraping on a plate

[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.920]
Scraping on a plate

[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:04.000]
Scraping on a plate

[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:10.980]
Here's what I really love

[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:15.100]
You might want to try it

[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.580]
Give me feedback in my headphones

[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:22.780]
Ah, yeah, that's more like it

[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:25.460]
Little more, little more over there

[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.560]
Little more, yeah

[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:31.240]
Eight sound so unique

[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:35.700]
Now let's review so you can really, really free

[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:38.700]
Figure nails on a blackboard

[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.940]
When people crack their neck for their knuckles

[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.760]
Rub his side we're full together

[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.660]
Cause it makes me chuckle

[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:53.120]
I like when new sneakers on a gym floor

[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.420]
Raising an aluminum window

[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:59.960]
When it gets into drilling my mold

[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.600]
That makes me say, Fingo!

[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:07.080]
My boy singing on his record

[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.820]
You can't hold on, fine, China

[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:14.440]
If these have give you the shivers

[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.100]
That makes you a whiner

[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:22.900]
Hey, you've got nuts and someone bites their fork like this

[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.180]
Cause I love it

[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.460]
Here, I'll do it again

[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.900]
Do you have a nervous system left?

[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.280]
How about the squeegee wiping window I back my neck?

[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:38.820]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.920]
Sup, are you wimp?

[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:42.640]
Sup, are you wimp?

[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.160]
Oh wait, I got one more

[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:50.320]
Oh and here's number nine, the sound that you hate

[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.520]
Or is that one at your low?

[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.600]
1203 at 560, Jeff Cohen needs a pizza man

[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.820]
It's a pizza loft in Davy, a good pizza man

[01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:59.240]
It's everybody knows how to make a good pie

[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.160]
You can spin it and twirl it and the pie too

[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.420]
He said he'll pay it at most anywhere

[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.080]
And if you're good

[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.160]
I've used that line before

[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:11.260]
Okay, pizza loft in Davy, a university drive between 595 and Griffin Road

[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:12.660]
Right behind the Pierwain imports

[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:14.980]
Tons of free parking and it's the weekend now

[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:16.960]
So go in there and just give your free spot

[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.180]
And skip you won't get a dime commission off

[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.520]
Because we hate him like poison man

[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.860]
No, and the only thing Skippy's got going for me in this place is Todd Dreck

[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:29.520]
Cause if we didn't have Todd Dreck then Skippy be right down to the bottom of the barnacles

[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.560]
You know, scraping it

[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:33.600]
But the fact that we got Todd Dreck got a long way to go

[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.780]
Who did I say the other day?

[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.080]
It was like even worse than Todd Dreck

[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:37.640]
Gary Sarner?

[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.820]
Oh Gary Sarner

[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:41.320]
Out of sight Adam and now he doesn't come in your place doesn't he?

[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:42.120]
If he does something

[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.000]
No, that's right, you sell trac

[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:50.240]
We got so many of these Jews for Bush who are busy eating their cheeseburgers for lunch right now

[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.200]
You're gonna burn in hell, don't you realize it?

[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.120]
That's right

[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.080]
Eating trac for lunch in mean time you're worried about Israel

[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.680]
God, what about your lunatics?

[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.740]
So we'll get you a pizza man

[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.900]
I'm gonna say that every day

[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:02.680]
Do you really?

[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:03.860]
Why is that?

[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.740]
Yeah, the pizza was outstanding there I should point out

[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:06.500]
Wasn't it?

[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:09.080]
It's always good but I mean this was some of the very best

[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:09.840]
Now who made this?

[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:11.780]
One of the pizza guys is there

[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:13.100]
But everyone's working too many hours

[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:13.660]
Oh I see

[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:14.720]
They're getting burned

[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.580]
Looks like you did too yesterday

[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:17.460]
Okay get out of here Jeff

[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:18.380]
Thank you, it was really great

[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.600]
Jeff called pizza a lot sucking up for some more free plugs

[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:21.880]
Good lunch though

[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:23.440]
Excellent lunch

[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.460]
And lots of sodas too

[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.960]
Which you notice even Jeff said

[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:27.580]
Radio station like this

[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.880]
Greg Reed came in at somebody day for the first time in many months

[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.840]
Did he bring me any soda?

[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:31.180]
No

[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.560]
Did Muff bring us any soda?

[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:32.800]
No

[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.260]
Clarence was busy scratching himself in the other room?

[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:35.480]
No

[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:35.860]
Nothing

[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:38.880]
Yeah I don't know what you're...

[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.020]
Didn't you see that before?

[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.420]
No I missed it

[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:42.960]
And I kept trying to look like the other way

[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.280]
Because the last person I want to see

[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.480]
Adjusting his private or whatever he was doing is him

[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:46.980]
God

[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:48.540]
Man oh man

[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.880]
Or maybe he was just searching

[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:50.380]
I don't know

[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.580]
Who do you think is the craziest celebrity of all time?

[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:55.800]
That's our poll question today

[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.680]
How many calls have we taken appear?

[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:00.260]
Maybe

[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.080]
Two are there

[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:02.980]
And they were both really good

[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:04.680]
Right?

[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.880]
The last guy was a great

[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.440]
The first one was excellent about the guilty rip in min' ass

[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:09.960]
Did you take one of them?

[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.080]
One of them

[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.460]
The guilty the spanking of his life?

[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:11.840]
No!

Ozzy Osborne 28

[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:20.780]

What about Denise Potman?

[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:27.940]
She's a loser

[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.600]
Gary Bucy 9

[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:34.220]
You see that?

[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:34.580]
Yeah

[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:35.860]

Novos even for Dave Ryder

[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.780]
Wonder what kind of scam he's pulling these days

[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.520]
Whitney Houston's got none

[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.780]

And then Nicole Smith don't have any yet either

[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:03.140]
See I wouldn't call her crazy

[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.740]
And like Ozzy it's pills and booze in the case of those two

[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:07.100]
Yeah

[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.400]
Oh yeah but he he caught up

[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.480]
Oh no you see that

[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.120]
Oh my gosh yeah

[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:14.960]
Oh that's talent

[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.960]
That was we have picture of that

[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.100]
Wait a minute that's talent that's called a cheap fork

[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.480]
Of course yes as he likes to cheap fork

[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.540]
But that's beside the point

[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:23.900]
That's what he said

[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.600]
Oh give me another fork somebody please

[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:27.660]
Before it's really

[01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:28.740]
Oh we got a bag of it in here

[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.260]
Plastic fork just snapped in half

[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.040]
Now maybe that was that was the Lord

[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:32.880]

[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:33.440]
Thank you

[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:35.860]
Telling me that's enough fat

[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:37.660]
So you're gonna kill yourself and that's a siege

[01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:39.060]
Hey Bonnie

I know my fish was great

[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:44.640]
I scarred you all

[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.320]
Oh you had fish that I already forgot about that

[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:46.980]
I ate it all gone

[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:49.000]
The pizzas maybe some of the best he's ever produced

[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.780]
They needed a new pizza man at the pizza lot by the way folks

[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:52.660]
Get with it

[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.200]
WQM hello

[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:54.980]
Neil

[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:55.600]
Yes sir

[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.380]
You've got to have a big conscious in there

[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.080]
The craziest person of them all

[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.380]
Yes sir this is shocking news

[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.640]
What do you say Neil?

[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:10.360]
No

[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:12.920]
What does that mean?

[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:13.400]
Wow

[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.220]
I mean how could they

[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.740]
I never even crossed my mind that this was a poor question they wouldn't understand

[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.320]
It didn't

[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.560]
They don't get it

[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.080]
Crazy

[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.100]
Crazy

[01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:23.860]
Most of you said I understand that

[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:24.780]
But it was crazy

[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:25.580]
I don't know

[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:25.580]

[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:25.580]

[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:25.580]

[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:25.580]

[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:25.580]

[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:28.980]
Especially the callers that we got on the show they should know from crazy

[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:29.760]
Okay believe me

[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.780]
It sounds like experts

[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:31.700]
Crazy

[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:34.200]
And we still got to explain it to them

[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.240]
See what all they wanted to do is put the same

[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.900]
Why don't we just do a pull every day

[01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:38.300]
There you go

[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.180]
Who do you hate the most

[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.260]
George W. Bush Rick Sanchez

[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.320]
Mojauer David

[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.440]
You know they're the same but Anna Cole Smith

[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.160]
This is a different poll

[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.820]
It's if it's good enough to be the inquirer

[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:51.580]
It's good enough for us to kill four hours you better better believe it

[01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.380]
This is just a fine lunch

[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:55.900]
Too much

[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.180]
The lunch was just right

[01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:00.740]
Was it not too hot not too cold

[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:01.040]
No

[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.520]
That's a very few I am hello

[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:03.980]
I keep spitting the sausage out

[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:04.480]
Q.I.M.

[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:05.100]
What else do you know

[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:05.640]
Hello, Neil

[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:06.220]
Yes sir

[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:09.420]
A little laugh toward the guy I can't stand any longer

[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.200]
Ha ha ha

[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.800]
Come to stop I hate it

[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:14.500]
Yeah

[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:15.820]
No that's it

[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:17.220]
I was just thinking just maybe

[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:21.020]
See when you deal with people I've got a whole new attitude now about some of these people

[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:24.280]
I'm going to put them on the spot and once they get through with their initial

[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:27.460]
Pre program

[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:31.020]
Pre program pre scripted a stick which usually lasts about three seconds

[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:35.300]
I'm just going to I'm going to put them on a spot to see if they can elaborate on which I know they can

[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:35.760]
Like him

[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.240]

Let me tell you about when I saw Judy Garland the archaeopalus in the New York it wasn't her fault either though and senior wences was there

[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:31.680]

Absolutely. Yeah, and I think it was that guilty sound

[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.260]
Yeah, I pushed him over the edge

[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.700]
Yeah, even your fat boys

[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:32.720]
Hi, a palie neighbor right over the edge. You'd like to put you over the edge too

[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:36.200]

[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:43.160]
So what about this is any idea you think that guy don't have kids see whatever

[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:44.500]

Is it like some great biological? Well, you should know right probably my accident. Yeah, so I just feel sorry for the kids

[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:58.280]
PD Lane has kids too sure. I feel sorry for them right Todd wreck has kids

Yeah, sure I continue

[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:06.200]
Just because somebody has kids does that mean that they're more respectable

[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.760]
Responsible rational saying

[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:12.780]
You should be hot human to think of your children if nothing else

[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:15.880]
What does that mean you're embarrassing your children?

[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:19.420]
Not those but I told you a date line that's right where they start where they starve the kid to death

[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:23.400]
They had children and not just the one that they starve they had other children. Did that make them saying?

[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:28.560]
Responsible parents no qualified, you know somebody was telling me to the day and I agree that there ought to be a test

[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:05.820]
lawyers and

[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:11.720]
Officials say the confidential memorandum several of which were written or co-written by John C. You

Abuse prisoners were in some other nation's custody a

[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:04.620]
Lawyer and former government official to saw the memorandum said it anticipated the possibility that US officials could be charged with

[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:10.660]
War crimes to find as grave breaches of these Geneva conventions the documents said away to avoid that is to declare that the

[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:11.780]
Commissions don't apply

[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:13.160]

I want to make a suggestion to all the audience right there. We'll be driving on the turnpike going south

[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:57.860]
And you see those cameras, you know right after the Cypress Creek pole class. Yeah as you approach

[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:02.460]
Give them bird just to let them know we know you're watching and we don't care

[02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:07.720]
Right all right. Excellent job pal have a great day. Okay, you're flooring

[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:13.100]
five six seven oh five sixty and that's another thing this whole obsession with you know, of course

[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:15.940]
We got the holiday coming up pretty soon Memorial Day next, you know

[02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:18.780]
The amazing point I think about this show today is there's nobody in town

[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:22.420]
No, you notice that most of my trip to work today was a real

[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:25.980]
Piece of cake. There was nobody on the road except five ninety five was a little

[02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:29.280]
Outchi here in there, but other than that pretty lame

[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:34.140]
All right, I mean pretty good right as long as you don't go near any schools that is

[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:38.420]
Yeah, and then it's a nightmare. I'm trying to think where I was driving the other day

[02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:43.120]
I mean, I know where it was when I went to the dentist on Tuesday

[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.920]
Mm-hmm in the pines

[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.040]
Yeah, and I'm driving on tastery. I'm going out west

[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:53.660]
And there's a school zone. I like that's right about two houses wide, you know, right? Oh, yeah

[02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:58.460]
One one thing about pember of pines in pember of lakes man. They love speed speed traps

[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:03.860]
It reminds me of high-disk rodent plantation that's the local cousin yeah, that also in plantation

[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:10.460]
Sunrise and brown you know, I'm talking about the world of churches are out there the Mormons and the disney Jews and the going everybody else

[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:14.460]
Yeah, they're at that that's that's what they love they write business. That's all this mm-hmm

[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:19.580]
And the same and that's one of the reasons I got out of pember lakes. I couldn't handle a punishment

[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:22.120]
That's a million miles away in the high eighties

[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:28.800]
Right, you know the island there the uh, sure. Yeah, they did a sit behind the trees. Uh, Doug this road

[02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:33.880]
I remember one I don't even want to go through the story back in the day

[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:41.300]
Got a ticket from an ornery surley cop they hadn't even there was an intersection where they had not put any stop sign or a stop light

[02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:41.720]
Okay

[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:42.620]
nothing

[02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:47.280]
And I went through it he said oh you could have killed somebody. I said well, let me ask you well

[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:51.880]
They haven't finished they haven't put the thing up yet, but I'm supposed to know it's supposed to be waterwards

[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:56.460]
You know, I came to an intersection. I should have stopped right looked all the way around stopped again

[02:17:56.460 --> 02:18:00.720]
I mean, I guess it wasn't possible that there could have been stop signs going the other way that you know

[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:04.780]
That I had the right away but there was nothing there. He still wrote me a ticket piece of crap

[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:07.000]
Parker clown

[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:13.980]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound. I mean like we don't have more important things to worry about all the crap that's going on the world today

[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:18.660]
And we still got a bunch of brokers sitting in behind the bushes with a radar, you know, old smoky

[02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:24.420]
It's a bunch of crap. Okay, go go save a life somewhere go do something worth a while go save somebody

[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:26.260]
Go do some real police work

[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:30.200]
Instead of harassing the poor damn public. That's paying eighty dollars a gallon for gas

[02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:32.180]
man

[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:39.720]
In fact if they're on it's what if we had like those real close-up mics you know we could have given all the gas they wanted for nothing just a few minutes ago

[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:49.300]
Boy, it's the one to two hour

[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:52.760]
I

[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:09.880]
Here

[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:09.880]

[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:26.780]
Well, I was a Christian soldier a god believer all these years

[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:32.480]
All that time I followed every word of the scriptures

[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:34.420]
written by queers

[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:41.180]
Catch me say he's a powerful god and an unknown woman a mighty way

[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:48.540]
Accepted not 11 when he must have been gone on a bust friend holiday

[02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:53.200]
Take your god and shove it

[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:55.980]
I ain't gonna worship him no more

[02:19:56.780 --> 02:19:58.960]
Just that you're all right

[02:19:59.980 --> 02:20:03.700]
If you're with us because everybody else is wrong

[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:08.080]
You're not getting tired of watching people die

[02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:11.100]
Give the name of an invisible lord

[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:14.880]
Take your god and shove it

[02:20:15.580 --> 02:20:18.160]
I ain't worship him no more

[02:20:19.900 --> 02:20:22.280]
Take your god and shove it

[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:25.540]
Oh right I ain't worship him no more

[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:29.280]
The Tainees were forced to curse Islam. How do you like that?

[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:33.480]
Well then they're showing pictures that the Washington Post released today the moving pictures

[02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:38.320]
Not just your stills, but your moving pictures see if these were al-Qaeda if this was a gitmo

[02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:42.220]
I don't mean to have a lot of problem with that because these people might just have information

[02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:44.640]
I could save a lot of our lives maybe maybe

[02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:52.000]
But this over and again when you they know that the overwhelming majority of these people were just people in a wrong place at the wrong time

[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.240]
That they slept off the street like that cad driver

[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:56.600]
I'm not gonna be sure unless you torture them

[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:58.640]
Oh that's right unless you beat it out of them that's right

[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:03.040]
Within an inch of their life and maybe sometime on the other side of an inch of their life

[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:06.160]
Right and then you can like stand over the dead corpse and you can like do that

[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:08.700]
So that's something kill them all let go for it right

[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:18.040]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Who do you think is the all-time craziest celebrity

[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:22.880]

Sir and have a great day you too. Okay

[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:31.640]
No, I wasn't really sure what he said

[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:38.380]
I know you know, I thought for many said talk about that's what I thought he said we can't say that anymore, Ken

[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:40.120]
Part of it

[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:45.200]
Five six seven what we can only we can't say moon if it has to do with like showing your record the world

[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:49.000]
We can't say moon in that fashion and of course the people of the FCC will be able to

[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:54.920]
Disciple and dissect that for themselves because they are the mind police also. That's just the word police right but the mind police

[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:58.800]
Yeah, that was a quadruple on time we got on that one

[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:01.500]
WQ a m hello

[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:04.520]
WQ a m hello

[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:17.140]
Yes, sir

[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:21.580]
Christopher walkin is Christopher walkin?

[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:26.240]
Yeah, okay. I'd be running if I was him. Okay Christopher walkin. What do you say crazy?

[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:34.500]
No, I don't think so. Not even a little. Oh, okay. Well, we give it a shot Pally, but we we're branded by the pole and I know

[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:34.500]

[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:35.440]
Said no chance

[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:38.600]
How so local panel I don't know

[02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:45.000]
For these people they don't understand it. They don't get it. They don't get it. They're not even close to getting it

[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.500]
And maybe that's why see the reason that they're so much in a blue funk today

[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.180]
It's because of the fact like I said before just about everybody's out of town

[02:24:52.180 --> 02:24:57.360]
Right, and so what's on the road are doing every soon and and these people unfortunately are left behind and they're a little on the

[02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:02.620]
Gilleside I am but as soon as their kids are out of school, which is when we could two we could to yeah

[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:04.440]
As soon as that happens

[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:09.820]
Then those who can afford to do it out they'll be all gone too and then you'll be on July and August and

[02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:15.200]
You have a great time on sure while you you'll have some dependable people out of hey

[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:28.580]

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T

[02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:46.560]
I think we've we've pushed them over the edge like I said they can't they can't handle it

[02:25:47.660 --> 02:25:50.820]
You know what I mean? Oh, I know that's it and it's Friday

[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:54.560]

[02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:55.940]
Taco alone

[02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:59.280]
WQA him hello

[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:00.520]
Neil yes, sir

[02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:03.860]
Hello, hello Neil yes

[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:06.320]
How about Tony Lee?

[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:13.400]
Tommy Lee is a fantastic choice. I like that one. I've seen how this guy gets it. Okay crazy. I'll take another one Bobby Brown

[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:18.620]
Tommy Lee and Bobby Brown ever seem together. Oh same person. That's a little uh, you know

[02:26:19.180 --> 02:26:21.900]
Shupalish a little bit of that shoe polish Reagan don't need anymore

[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:26.360]
Ronnie Reagan man, there's a guy was he a president or what?

[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:35.620]
See Nancy's being punished for that just say no that that's what this is all about. That's why he's hanging on and hanging on

[02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:39.160]
Yeah, he'll probably have to be 110 and that's funny that you know

[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:45.120]
They do a 180 on their whole stem cell research position when it strikes it, you know close to home right when it's one of their own right

[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:47.740]
Oh, yeah, well all timers. Oh, we could do something about that

[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:52.440]
We wouldn't have had to do all of these or horrendous things and live these last 20 years in this

[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:55.960]
Psychotic kind of state could have been doing something all along right

[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:01.980]
No, no, we don't want to do that because we'll piss off see that's what it's all about with Carl rove and his whole bush

[02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:04.080]
Groud is who we're gonna piss off, you know

[02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:08.900]
Is it gonna be the Christians? Is it gonna be the Jews and Florida which we need to steal their votes again

[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:11.300]
And of course they're all whipped up to a frenzy about Israel Israel

[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:16.640]
Then that's all it's all right of course carry on the other hand. He hasn't figured out who to a alien or please

[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:17.360]
That's the problem

[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:23.260]
You can't complain about his campaign because quite frankly there isn't one yet

[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:28.260]
What you'll see when he picks Wesley Clark that's my prediction. I'll say it again

[02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:33.880]
And then they're not going to be able to turn around say and of course how how a bunch of draped dodging chicken ox can say

[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:36.500]
Oh, he's wick on a military because he opposed the war and Vietnam

[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:42.820]
Da yeah when he came back after he risked his life and saved those people right all these things got a test full of metal right

[02:27:43.700 --> 02:27:47.680]
Because he had the balls to come home and tell the truth about how we were butchering people in sacrificing

[02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:52.180]
58,000 of our own kids over there and he enlisted right exactly

[02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:56.820]
He wasn't a draft dodger like all these chicken ox like cheney and all these others and a wall bush

[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:02.400]
But even setting that aside because the American public is so stupid at any rate

[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:04.940]
I'll be able to say well we got a four star general over here Wesley Clark

[02:28:04.940 --> 02:28:09.980]
Okay, so if our man needs any assistance when it comes to all of these things about international affairs

[02:28:09.980 --> 02:28:16.160]
I mean our last president had you know, we have some expertise in affairs sure international and all of the play just like

Zero for Judy Garland Jerry Lee Lewis Tommy Lee or Bobby Brown

[02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:48.940]
I realized Tommy Lee and Bobby Brown just went on a few minutes ago, but my god they should be climbing up their ladder fast

[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:50.080]
Bobby Brown

[02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:54.180]
Out of 518 and he's got the big bad

[02:32:55.400 --> 02:33:00.560]
And that you know what the big is bad 5 6 7 0 5 60 let's pick on Galdi some more what you say

[02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:02.000]
Come on

[02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:07.400]
Well, I see the only reason we're not getting any response to that other than that one very outstanding early call the first call

[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:08.280]
I took which was smart

[02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:11.340]
Is because of the fact that we got no hockey people

[02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:18.780]
See right they don't we knew that they don't in addition which even the hockey people that we do have they either go to the games or they listen

[02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:19.820]
They watch them on TV

[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:23.360]
How many people I said listen to Panther hockey on the station

[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:27.400]
But third man that's not a good night when you're playing a team that somebody cares about you know

[02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:33.820]
Mm-hmm you could in these two rooms together you could put some folding chairs and you know and and and that's it

[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:37.340]
Piping the audio watch the game on TV. No, no, no

[02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:39.240]
Talking about listening on a radio

[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:42.940]
So it didn't really make any difference who does the games but in any rate

[02:33:42.940 --> 02:33:46.060]
Galdi's running around shooting off a big mouth because he's pissed off

[02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:50.940]
Howard from broken right even more who used to think that Galdi was remember all the times

[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:53.540]
Galdi loves me either way and get along just fine

[02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:57.560]
Well, now he realizes that even Galdi can't put up with his crap anymore Howard from broken right

[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:04.620]
And Joe Rose who Galdi really always thought was gonna be the guy he could just latch on to just like a

[02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:10.920]
Kangaroo with the with a pouch if you just hop right in there. Yeah, he thought that was it his lifeline

[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:19.040]
How the world turns yeah, and now come to find out that blockhead is doing just great on his own

[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:20.640]
You don't want no part of Galdi so

[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:25.140]
That's right. He don't want that little propenary. He also can't stand the beast

[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:31.560]
No apparently now. He don't want to be I mean Zach does a fine job in there in spite of what most said Zach is just fine

[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:36.140]
And Zach and the blockhead got that little routine that there's going back and forth

[02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:39.860]
Medzac does a fine Harvey green. That's kind of a cute thing

[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:44.100]
And I'm not telling you something that takes some balls in his brain. You got a guy to use the play for that often

[02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:46.380]
That people would accuse of being a shield for the organization

[02:34:47.060 --> 02:34:51.780]
Which you know who is the shill you know all right. I don't want to pick on my good friend mad dog

[02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:54.780]
But I mean he's a shield for the organization pretty much

[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:58.300]
But Joe Rose a different kind of a guy horse of a different feather

[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:00.340]
California boy

[02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:04.880]
Yeah, he and from Solano Ohio see that's a different kind of upbringing. He is surfer

[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:08.280]
So at any rate and probably was at any rate he I don't have any of your

[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:15.000]
Compulsions in rip and Harvey green and the fact that they're trying to cover up all of that rickie William stuff and the uh, you know, he smoked a little pot who cares

[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:21.440]
Man oh man he smoked a little number here and a big fat one over there and who cares all right

[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:26.880]
Got his haircut. I give him much higher marks for getting his haircut looking human than for like who cares

[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:30.760]
Whether he spoke to a little reaper or not who cares? I don't

[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:36.720]
Especially nothing you know, I mean if we were still one to head the long hair the deadlocks people say suffered from reaper madness

[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:38.080]
but now

[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:41.300]
Or like on that morning show from creeper madness

[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:45.500]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the how can he still be here?

[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:48.640]
This is the longest exit in the history of the entertainment industry

[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:54.420]
Nobody has ever been leaving a job whether it was a big job a small job a job whatever

[02:35:54.860 --> 02:36:01.340]
As long as Robert the grim creeper he's leaving. He's leaving. He's thinking about leaving. Hey, well pack your salami sandwich

[02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:05.700]
Okay, we'll twist. He's on it. Pray swiss cheese somebody Q a.m. Hello

[02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:12.240]
Hey, how you doing? I love grilled salami and Swiss. Yes, sir. Hey, what's going on? You know go on for the ball. Okay

[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:15.360]
Uh, what about John Belushi? He was crazy

[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:20.440]
And probably a little bit too crazy for Zonga. Thank you so much. Thank you. I have a great day job

[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:23.780]
Belushi. Why do you make a face like that? He was nuts. He was certifiable. Huh?

[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:26.680]
He was funny. Yeah, I mean you could be funny

[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:31.720]
It's still be crazy. Ozzy Osborne's funny yourself, but crazy, right? Right? Belushi. Yeah

[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:36.080]
A little blow problem is what he had yeah a little blow

[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:47.240]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line as opposed to like John Candy, right? Who had a little sugar problem?

[02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:54.260]
A little food problem a little food addiction and now he's dead. He's dead. Fat people are the good people and the fat people are the dead people

[02:36:54.420 --> 02:36:57.180]
Go see fat so this weekend. Okay, go rent it by it steal it

[02:36:58.740 --> 02:37:06.340]
The fat people are I'm telling you we're fat and we're getting fat. This is the thing that really uh, it's so typical of what it was happened in America and the world in general

[02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:08.980]
But especially in this country because we're so over commercialized

[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:13.220]
Since Dr. Atkins croaked since he had that bad slip and fall

[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:17.960]
The marketing people and you you were the first one to pick up on it and you're right

[02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:22.540]
The Atkins organization man see what what did I always say about him? He had a great died

[02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:27.640]
He was a brilliant guy, but he was a bad marketer that infomercial you step on with the most yeah that real

[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:32.020]
Jappy broad from the Bronx where come on to the Atkins diet the low-carb

[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:34.400]
You know nobody wanted to see you should like John Rivers on helium. Oh

[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:38.620]
And so anyway the marketing people have come along and now we got Atkins

[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:42.580]
I think we have in place of gonna have Atkins toilet paper sure why not which is gonna make your

[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:46.780]
Rectome real slim. It's low carb in fact what you do is you just said

[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:50.280]
Just I want to discuss it made a soy even if you have a painful

[02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:53.220]
Accination just walk away, but at any rate

[02:37:53.960 --> 02:38:01.620]
So now they're marketing like crazy and everybody else is imitating so that's all you hear about our low-carb this and low-carb that and but and the meantime we're getting fatter than ever

[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:08.060]
I can't believe the number of fat people I see yesterday. I'm watching a cubs game yesterday afternoon

[02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:16.500]
After I got through with all my doctoring after they looked in every orifice they could find and the they got Billy Williams on there with Steve Stone and chip Curie

[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:23.560]
And Billy Williams now you wouldn't know who that is, but he's a Hall of Fame former black guy former great the couple here

[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:27.980]
He's in there. He had a puppet on him man. He made fat boy look like a

[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:30.060]
Liza Manelli. Hmm

[02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:40.080]
I'm telling you a huge puppet we're getting fatter and fatter and oh we got low-carb this and low-carb that and then you look on the labels on the ingredients man

[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:46.480]
I'm in Walgreens yet. I'm looking at one of these health bars and the carb solutions in this and I look at

[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:50.420]
49 grams of carbs for a little candy bar the size of your thumb and

[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:56.340]
And then Hershey's also has these new candy bars low-carb if you see no I haven't look at the ingredients

[02:38:57.120 --> 02:38:57.440]
Toss

[02:39:00.580 --> 02:39:06.580]
So if you're one of those people who's fat and you don't have irritable bowel which I don't know how many how many of those people exist

[02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:11.220]
Then you're you're in luck because you can eat that stuff. It has almost no carbs and you'll be very successful

[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:15.840]
But if you're like me if you're a fat old slob like me and you got the old ibs

[02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:21.020]
And ispca and the ita and the h where you see then you got real problems

[02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:24.080]
Don't forget gurd and gurd is the word

[02:39:24.940 --> 02:39:25.980]
You know who told me that?

[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.180]
And you know what the mad dog told him you turd right that's what I heard

[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:36.460]
Let's spank y'ally come on let's spank it a few times okay. You're not getting that gig gully

[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:04.420]
I don't think so

[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:06.920]
5, 6, 7

[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:11.560]
Come on that was good you got it

[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:15.260]

[02:40:15.980 --> 02:40:17.200]
Neil yes sir

[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:20.980]
South Florida cops don't like to write tickets, but they will

[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:27.820]
What does that mean? I don't know that's the commercial they're running on uh your station on this station

[02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:32.660]
Yeah, oh my god. They don't like to write them but they got the quotas. I didn't otherwise blame somebody else

[02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:36.060]
Everyone who ever wrote me one look happy is could be yeah you bet

[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:39.980]
Especially when they pulled it walked up to the car and uh show me show me everything you got your license

[02:40:39.980 --> 02:40:42.780]
Registration your shoe size whatever you got I want to see it right

[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:47.380]
I thought this was the car tell administration we had in power

[02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:49.560]
Yeah, these gas prices

[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:56.360]
Yeah, that's the least we could get away wait wait till you see wait till you see the profits from a exon and share

[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:00.740]
On all these others at the end of the next quarter wait till you see their record breaking profits and somebody we say

[02:41:00.740 --> 02:41:05.920]
Well, how can they keep making record breaking profits and they keep gouging the public like that something stinks somewhere

[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:09.460]
Aren't the tankers running from the person golf straight into Texas?

[02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:15.160]
They're running straight into a hypha is what I'm hearing and my choice for a crazy guy. Yes, sir

[02:41:15.160 --> 02:41:18.000]
Joe Coroio. All right. That's good crazy Joe

[02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:23.400]
See there's a good one now. We just had a caller online nine who made some sense

[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.380]
I'm it just after play that you know

[02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:32.160]
Joe Carroyo he's I don't know out of sight out of my kind of thing people actually hated him like poison and deservedly

[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:34.960]
So but then once he threw the last he canistered his wife

[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:39.440]
That was kind of like it, you know, yeah one r2 although let me ask you this

[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:44.100]
I beg your pardon one r or two

[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:49.940]
He's one of your people and you're asking me how you spell his name you know how to spell all the Jewish names

[02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:56.020]
Yeah, how about Moishi Hanyanko Moishi Pupik. I know how to spell that too. Maybe it's good. Okay

[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:01.740]
Pupik I'm gonna put two. I don't care what you put on there. Okay, Joe Carroyo

[02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:06.640]
Uh if he's gonna be on there, I'll tell you another one needs to be but nobody remembers him. Xavier Suarez. Oh yeah

[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:10.360]
At least Joe Carroyo wasn't running around in his bathroom campaigning toward the door at three in the morning

[02:42:10.940 --> 02:42:14.340]
Every night what they'll just happen there. Oh, you know

[02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:17.340]
I didn't again

[02:42:18.300 --> 02:42:19.600]
And sorry Neil

[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:30.060]
Voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God

[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:35.320]
That's the movie

[02:43:10.940 --> 02:43:11.380]
The

[02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:15.440]
132 at 560 WQM no mad dog today guess what we got it to instead though

[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:21.400]
So booster

[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:28.960]
Booster you ain't no Dave and boring thank God

[02:43:30.020 --> 02:43:32.240]
Uh booster will be at the Hooters in Pemberg Pines

[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:35.080]
In fact, you might want to call him up and say you know that guy that you work with on the games

[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:39.520]
Will you just poke him into ribs once in a while? Wait come up. Just give him like a little elbow

[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:44.000]
Anyway, then we got the Humber at four the Hebrew hammer four to seven to seven o'clock

[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:44.980]
Three solid hours man

[02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:51.420]
Then you got the Marlins on deck at seven o'clock

[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:57.740]
735 Arizona you know, I gotta tell you and we'll see because supposedly they got big weekend ready Johnson

[02:43:57.740 --> 02:44:00.380]
Pitch in this weekend at Don Trill and etc

[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:05.660]
But those crowds during the week for Houston pretty embarrassing Houston's a very good team

[02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:10.720]
And you know the Marlins lost a few games see I'm afraid when it gets to be June and July and August and it's

[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:16.720]
Needed to reason the shade. I'm afraid that if the Marlins ain't exactly sent a house on fire like people in those first couple weeks in the season

[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:21.780]
That just maybe we'll be reverting back to those really paltry embarrassing crowds again

[02:44:21.780 --> 02:44:23.880]
I don't want to say this is a front running town

[02:44:23.880 --> 02:44:27.900]
But when days after the game six is already over with the heating Indiana

[02:44:28.460 --> 02:44:32.600]
And people are still calling on these stupid ass sports shows we got on the station talking about a game

[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:37.100]
That's been over for days now and this one should have done this and this one should who cares about that

[02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:40.240]
Huh, yeah, I sure don't

[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:42.980]
Who the hell gives a crap about that

[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:47.680]
But uh, you know that's the nature of this town give me a winner man

[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:52.880]
Give me something to grab on to please I'm a loser give me something to grab on to anything

[02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:55.540]
Give me a bandwagon to hop on hop aboard

[02:44:57.060 --> 02:45:00.340]
That's why that whole panther thing from back in 96 is it's a joke

[02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:02.940]
How many hockey fans do we have in South Florida?

[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:07.920]
I don't know why we still have a team here. I mean I'm glad that we do but um, but why we still do I have no idea

[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:10.180]
Something to do

[02:45:10.180 --> 02:45:14.080]
No, but it's not something about something to the place to go and be seen and whatever

[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:19.780]
I guess wander around and drink some beer in a hallway talk on your cell phone right and wave to the guy on the cell phone and the other

[02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:21.460]
You know section one or whatever

[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:23.800]
It's really sad

[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:30.060]
There's no real passion about almost anything here five six seven oh five sixty so why should I be surprised

[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:34.840]
That the nature of the people I've been talking to all week long is you know they're like a automata or a maintenance

[02:45:36.420 --> 02:45:42.420]
Yeah, that's what they are. Oh, what is real listen Cuba that in the same old tired balloon no matter what's going on in the world

[02:45:42.420 --> 02:45:47.520]
See that that goes beyond their ability to reason no confuses with all this my news you okay

[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:53.920]
All I know is the bigger picture that is that I'm Jewish therefore I must love Israel and defend them at all cost or I'm Cuban

[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:57.320]
And therefore I must be obsessed with Cuba no matter what the hell is going on in the world

[02:45:57.320 --> 02:46:01.520]
And that's it and don't bother me with anything else apparently evidently you're right

[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:04.240]
WQA him hello

[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:04.940]

[02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:23.320]

Hey Neil how are you doing okay?

[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:24.300]
I'm kind of late, but he would have got a lot of votes. I think Bobby Knight's kind of a whack-jump

[02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:29.260]
Bobby Knight's good. He is crazy very good choice and you got all weekend so maybe he can catch up he can play catch up

[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:30.880]
Absolutely, and it goes in

See that was so bad

[02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:38.960]
He's doing nothing that so you gave a bad look there, but he's trying his best to do a little

[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:42.460]
But he just don't have it yet practice makes perfect all weekend log

[02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:45.460]
It'll keep you off the street pal out of trouble just keep doing the guldies

[02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:51.840]
Yeah, the important part is the slap. See I just slap yourself real hard. How come I never played that bit which one?

[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:59.640]
Uh do the guilty. I bet it's not in here. I never heard of it do the guilty. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh that one

WQAM. Hello

[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:05.120]
Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, uh, I wanted to say Jason Williams put him on that pole. Somebody said did we ever put him on or what?

[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:10.160]
I don't think so. Yeah, well, we'll do it now just because you said no, I don't think so we decided. No, we we took it to committing and we decided

[02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:12.220]
No, no

[02:49:12.220 --> 02:49:16.740]
Just because you know like dogs in the limo drivers. That's his you know, it's up to him

[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:23.240]
Besides they killed themselves and he walked away. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the dog was definitely a suicide

[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:26.420]
I got ready to report the follow-up on it the dog definitely off himself

[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:28.460]
It was a suicide

[02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:34.500]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and that fat boy man

[02:49:34.500 --> 02:49:38.060]
I'm glad that you and he are getting really tight, you know what? I think he tries

[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:39.380]
tries what

[02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:44.960]
To be an oil trying to ambush people like he did to me on Monday. That's all part of him

[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:50.700]
That's why he has found this spicable unacceptable and spider-want is boyfriend on the facts machine

[02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:54.460]
You'll see you'll see how many days before he's back. He ain't ever went anywhere. Of course not

[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:57.740]
What do you mean? You know what this reminds me of I was thinking about this before

[02:49:58.460 --> 02:50:01.840]
Back in the day. I mean I'm talking way way back Ws. News back in it

[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:05.760]
You know old-time talk radio topical talk radio the all I crap

[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:09.260]
And it was the same it was a different bunch

[02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:12.960]
It was the same crap and somebody who you know loved you and liked you and I love

[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:17.360]
But all you had to do was look at them cross-citer make one comment that they disagreed with and they would uh

[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:22.040]
Well, you you of course that we didn't have factions come in those days. It was all in the phone, you know or letter

[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:28.180]
You I'm never gonna listen to you again. You are the worst of them all the other crap because we have to agree with all of them all the time

[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:32.060]
Now of course you can't possibly agree with all people all the time because they all got different opinions

[02:50:32.060 --> 02:50:34.440]
But uh nevertheless don't confuse them with the facts

[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:39.500]
You must agree with them at all times and everything you must be say must be in uh goose step with what they say

[02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:44.400]
Maybe that's why a lot of these people like bush so much. They like the old goose step or at least they like the old goose

[02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:47.340]
And box cars right ovens

[02:50:48.420 --> 02:50:49.180]

[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:51.800]
And then again like I said that soap

[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:57.140]
20 liquid soap right liquid soap. Oh, I wonder who's in that bottle

[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:03.920]
Wouldn't it be wouldn't it be something if like I've after I used the whole bottle of that body wash now to bottom

[02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:06.540]
I saw Todd Rex named stamped on there wouldn't that be bad?

[02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:11.200]
Oh, I would stand the shower with like some real soap for hours. I would get like mr. clean

[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:16.340]
And listarine and just in the power tower. I spleen. Yeah, the old shower of power

But they really were out to get him and he helped him out. You know, yeah, they were out to really nail his ass and he had been over

[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:44.940]
And even muffs it. That's not necessarily a good idea, but attention man 20 till two at five sixty

[02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:49.300]
Reckham. Yeah, when I told him about my exams yesterday

[02:51:49.300 --> 02:51:55.220]

German women fed up with the man with a poor aim can turn to the ghost shaped gadget

[02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:55.080]

Which is why I guess CMQFM when soaring up there to the top

[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:38.580]
Like a rotten banana floats to the top

[02:55:39.440 --> 02:55:45.680]
The latest results represent continued growth for the growth for the group a group group a format's classified under the

[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:46.660]
Spanish label

[02:55:46.660 --> 02:55:49.200]
Topping the record set in the fall 2003 report

[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:53.720]
Spanish years are up nearly a full point the last year because nobody speaks English you're no more

[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:55.780]
No, I bet you don't have that in there either

[02:55:55.780 --> 02:55:56.600]

Your DCS blows yeah, I don't think we had it news talk remains the most listened to specific format classification

[02:56:09.020 --> 02:56:16.460]
Although they combined news talks sports category is off slightly as the sports segment gave back some of the extra listening

[02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:17.880]
Generated last fall do you hear that?

[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:24.020]
No, let me say it again news talk remains the most listened to specific format

[02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:28.480]
Although the combined news talk sports categories off slightly as the sports segment

[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:32.420]
gave back some of the extra listening generated last fall

[02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:38.100]
Huh the sports segment in other words people are secondary and about rickie this and rickie that and

[02:56:38.620 --> 02:56:41.760]

Classic rock oldies new rock and jazz other of course the classic rock then big 106 which went tumbling tumbling down to the bottom

[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:11.240]
Okay enough to make you cry

[02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:17.860]
Because Howard's stirring got taken off of big 106. It's a major story to anybody really write about those numbers

[02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:22.820]
No Howard con no Glenn Garvin Glenn Gary Glenn Garvin. No, Tom jicke. No

[02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:28.380]
Just amazing how many really meaningful stories that go on in this market and they can't be bothered

[02:57:29.080 --> 02:57:30.540]
Speaking of meaningful stories

[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:37.040]
Previously secret sworn statements by detainees at the abble great prison in a rack described in raw detail

[02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:42.420]

[02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:46.960]
sexually fondled by female soldiers and forced to retrieve their food from toilets

Retrieve their food from toilets you turk like we're gonna cue an

[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:57.060]
The fresh allegations of prison abuse are contained in statements taken from 13 to 10

[02:57:57.060 --> 02:58:00.880]

Oh yeah

[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:03.800]

[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:22.260]
So Randy Moller, the director of communications and broadcasting and humiliation for the

[03:00:22.260 --> 03:00:25.780]
Florida Panther Organization, says over his dead body, Steve Geldig-Gelstein, will be

[03:00:25.780 --> 03:00:26.360]
doing that thing.

[03:00:26.900 --> 03:00:28.200]
Of course, I don't know what thing he was talking about.

[03:00:28.620 --> 03:00:29.320]
I just made that up.

[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:32.120]
157 at 560 WQM.

[03:00:32.180 --> 03:00:33.540]
Now what was that thing you just dropped in there?

[03:00:33.540 --> 03:00:34.160]
What was it to his head?

[03:00:34.160 --> 03:00:34.300]
K.

[03:00:34.620 --> 03:00:35.260]
Oh no.

[03:00:35.660 --> 03:00:35.960]
What?

[03:00:36.060 --> 03:00:36.640]
Play that again.

[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:37.700]
K.

[03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:38.720]
Oh no.

[03:00:39.300 --> 03:00:40.520]
Do you hear the way she said that?

[03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:40.960]
No!

[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:42.900]
Wow, that was painful.

[03:00:43.020 --> 03:00:43.340]
No!

[03:00:43.740 --> 03:00:44.020]

[03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:45.420]
No!

[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:46.760]
No!

[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:52.380]
Anyway, 157 at Booster stand and buy over there at Hooters and the Pines, he's going to be

[03:00:52.380 --> 03:00:55.960]
a doin' 2-2-4 for the Mad Dog, who just like me now, he's taking a page out of the

[03:00:55.960 --> 03:00:58.320]
Neo-Rudges' workbook, works whatever he feels like it.

[03:00:58.640 --> 03:00:58.900]
Right?

[03:00:59.380 --> 03:01:01.400]
There was at least one other day this week he didn't show, right?

[03:01:01.780 --> 03:01:02.460]
Right, at least.

[03:01:02.460 --> 03:01:06.400]
And then the next two weeks we've got, let's count him a three, not one, not two, but

[03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:08.160]
three, Marlon Day game.

[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:11.920]
And then it'll be from Monday's Memorial Day, which means George is working that day.

[03:01:12.100 --> 03:01:13.500]
Oh, I like this schedule, man.

[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:18.220]
Just remember that Neo-Rudges motto, it's a good motto to live by, let's work in more

[03:01:18.220 --> 03:01:18.500]
pay.

[03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:20.760]
Less hours, more money.

[03:01:20.900 --> 03:01:22.420]
That's, everybody should be demanding that.

[03:01:22.540 --> 03:01:24.760]
More vacation, more time off, more money.

[03:01:24.960 --> 03:01:26.220]
I thought your motto was, let's work more.

[03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:26.460]
K.

[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:27.720]
Well that too.

[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.400]
Well if you have less work, you got more time for that.

[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:36.160]

Lunatic, 613 votes.

[03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:44.480]
I don't think they like this poll.

[03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:45.860]
That's because it's so one sided.

[03:01:46.200 --> 03:01:49.220]
We probably should've said, aside from the King of Plop, who's the, you know what I mean?

[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:50.880]
But that's okay, just forget his honor.

[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.460]
Michael Jackson, 321.

tea room, I would not go in there.

[03:02:09.140 --> 03:02:11.300]
No, no, I would not go anywhere near there.

[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:15.280]

Ferrell's got 9.

[03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:34.860]
Scott Ferrell, remember him?

[03:02:34.900 --> 03:02:35.200]
He's got 9.

[03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:37.040]
I said do one more so we get to 10.

[03:02:37.060 --> 03:02:37.600]
He can't do it.

[03:02:38.020 --> 03:02:39.300]
Come on, do some up there a little bit.

[03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:40.080]
Goose up Ferrell.

[03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:43.640]
Jonathan Winters 8, Howard Hughes without the E is got 6.

[03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:44.800]
Sid Vicious 4.

[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:46.760]
Liza Mennellie's only got 3.

[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:48.440]
Liz Taylor's got a peer.

[03:02:48.940 --> 03:02:50.460]
And the Coul's got a big peer.

[03:02:50.780 --> 03:02:51.560]
Would honor Ryder 2.

[03:02:51.720 --> 03:02:52.280]
Keith Moon 2.

[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:54.220]
Joe Carrillo has got the 2.

[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:55.920]
2D Garland 1.

[03:02:56.100 --> 03:02:59.960]
Whitney Houston only 1 for Whitney Houston only 1 for Bobby Brown only 1 for Margot

[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:00.380]
Kitter.

[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:01.600]
You can me.

[03:03:02.540 --> 03:03:03.740]
Xavier Suarez has won.

[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:05.180]
He's got his bathroom on right now.

[03:03:05.940 --> 03:03:10.720]
And no votes yet for John Belushi, which she was called in what 40, 50 times at least.

[03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:12.260]
Jerry Lee Lewis don't have any.

[03:03:12.340 --> 03:03:12.920]
I think it's normal.

[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:14.300]
Gamers is 5 year old cousin.

[03:03:14.300 --> 03:03:15.080]
What's wrong with that?

[03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:18.640]
Tommy Lee don't have any Richard prior none and Bobby Knight don't have any.

[03:03:18.740 --> 03:03:20.320]
We just don't have that basketball crowd.

[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:24.260]
But I'm sure that once the boobster comes on and we exhaust the Marlin talk after the

[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:28.620]
first 5 minutes, we can rehash all of that good stuff about the heat game game 6 and

[03:03:28.620 --> 03:03:31.480]
why they lost and how come they didn't do this and how come they didn't do that at

[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:32.200]
Citraman so on right?

[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:32.960]
Yeah hoops.

[03:03:33.140 --> 03:03:33.700]
Let's talk hoops.

[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:37.580]
And then if there's any time left over we can discuss how wide Kelly shouldn't get

[03:03:37.580 --> 03:03:38.260]
that Panther Jack.

[03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:39.400]
Bye bye bye.

[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:44.120]
The man who's the right to show unplicit is a new QA and he might have been for Margot.

[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:45.120]
Attention man.

[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:46.820]
Does she like to feel relaxed once again?

[03:03:46.920 --> 03:03:47.100]
No!

[03:03:47.500 --> 03:03:47.900]
