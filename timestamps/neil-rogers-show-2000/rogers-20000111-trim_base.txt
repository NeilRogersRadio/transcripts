Now, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.500]
Please, enough talking.

[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.600]
You are not my desire to show.

[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.020]
You stand so far on the inside.

[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.700]
Oi!

[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900]
So they have no life.

[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.360]
They saw Murriamaki.

[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.780]
And they saw how beautiful the day.

[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.280]
There we are.

[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.140]
There we are, there's this thing.

[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.000]
It says it wants to stay.

[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.880]
See them in the day of TV.

[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.660]
As the cubist flies them all away.

[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.820]
Just lick them.

[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.260]
And we're trying to build on them.

[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.800]
And we're trying to process.

[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.480]
We should send them.

[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.340]
Oi!

[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.220]
They have been so hard to walk down.

[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.060]
And the oil tanks are long.

[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.880]
Another chance for publicity.

[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.340]
While the whole day old shut high and let down.

[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.980]
They tell y'all what to live with Mickey.

[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.160]
Leave it to the fall behind.

[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.140]
Showing here with gifts and stars.

[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.380]
While my am is slowly dying.

[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.380]
Oi!

[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.300]
In the eight so she was another fall to get their way.

[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.740]
With the help said, stand the back in the hospital.

[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.540]
We want it off the go away today.

[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.760]
And we're trying to trust again.

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.360]
And we're trying to always trust.

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.660]
We just want to live on life.

[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.800]
And we're trying to process.

[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.580]
We should send him.

[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.500]
And we're trying to trust again.

[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.260]
And we're trying to always trust.

[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.740]
And we're trying to process.

[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.100]
Who is it that did that for us?

[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.200]
We always get credit when somebody does something down.

[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.320]
Danny and Chuckie and Danny.

[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.040]
Is there anybody in this audience by the way who isn't sick?

[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.600]
I think castor is behind it.

[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.160]
I think the bearded son of a bitch is behind his viral thing.

[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.320]
I'm seriously stopping to think about that.

[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.180]
Everybody has got this viral crap.

[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.420]
I have alternate days.

[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.820]
Every other day I feel fairly good.

[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.500]
And then tomorrow I'll be undergoing all sorts of tests.

[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.540]
I'll get to be an old fart like this.

[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.520]
But this stuff is just a malady.

[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.140]
Everybody has got to be lingers on and on and on.

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.020]
Everybody has talked to us like huking and other sort of things.

[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.960]
Maybe this is a delayed Y2K.

[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.820]
Maybe our calendar was just a little bit off.

[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.680]
Maybe this is a delayed Y2K thing.

[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.820]
That we're all suffering.

[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.900]
Maybe the moon is in your rain or something like that.

[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.600]
Oh yeah, cool.

[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.940]
Because it makes a lot of money for the doctors.

[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.080]
Maybe there's like an 85 pound tumor in there.

[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.440]
Who knows?

[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.840]
Who's that at the door?

[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.980]
I'm sorry.

[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.440]
I called him Todd.

[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.040]
What is that?

[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.400]
Movie pass.

[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.540]
Is this stuff ever going to get over here?

[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.840]
Good.

[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.720]
Let me tell you about two of the worst shows I've ever seen in my life.

[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.900]
A lot of creative people out there.

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.600]
If something works, we have 8 million copycats overnight.

[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.500]
There's anybody in this audience who wants to tell me who wants to be a millionaire.

[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.560]
I like Regis.

[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.840]
He sucks up all the time.

[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.320]
It's big.

[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.860]
But nevertheless, that's your blows.

[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.660]
What are we going to do?

[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.080]
Let's copy it with a more shocking 21.

[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.620]
I bet you Jack Berry is rolling over on his grave right now.

[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.980]
Okay, now if you don't know the answer, you haven't seen that one.

[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.160]
They select the contestants.

[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.140]
Based on who?

[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.180]
The first challenger was a schwarzer.

[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.120]
They show you the result.

[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.320]
I'll talk about you in the periodic complex.

[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.120]
Here's Bill and Sally and Tom and Jimmy and Danny.

[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.660]
You vote for whoever you want to be next to.

[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.100]
They're all rip off.

[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.840]
They're bad.

[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.860]
Bad.

[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.840]
You get three strikes.

[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.280]
You have to go home and rip the crap out of you.

[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.760]
You have to drop your doors right on stage.

[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.940]
If you call up your friend or your husband or whoever to help you with the answer.

[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.440]
My idea of a quiz show is like you do it alone.

[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.020]
You do it alone.

[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.420]
You don't know the answer.

[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.740]
We got parting gifts.

[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.580]
That's their favorite expression.

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.320]
Six pack of Burium animals.

[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.680]
That's it.

[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.180]
Go home.

[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.960]
Farting gifts.

[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.300]
Farting gifts.

[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:48.420]
That's it.

[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.740]
That's a quiz show.

[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.860]
I have three challenges.

[00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:05.320]
I'm going to call up my mother-in-law who mysteriously gets on the phone immediately and doesn't see the surprise that she's talking to Rita's filbert and her son-in-law is going for $85 billion.

[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.900]
Those drums are going in the back.

[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.440]
The drums are peeing in the back.

[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.500]
Do we have any drums in here?

[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.020]
Drums are pounds of fun.

[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.260]
No, not so much of drums.

[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.280]
Those are boots, not drums.

[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.220]
And the contestants just go on and on.

[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.840]
The drums are peeing in the back.

[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.460]
I don't know.

[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.480]
What's the time of time?

[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.540]
I saw a part of the delivery room and it smelled real good.

[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.080]
If the South Pole is in the South, the North Pole is in.

[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.140]
What kind of questions are those?

[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.240]
Bad, bad quiz shows.

[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:44.540]
Of course, to show you how bad television is, that's like now this week it's on every night with Regis.

[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.880]
Because they got nothing else going on.

[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.560]
It's big deal.

[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.600]
It's big enough both of them.

[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.620]
Yeah, you already said that.

[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.060]
Very, very weak.

[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.300]
Very, very weak.

[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:53.920]
You know something?

[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.300]
Any day of the week and some people in the audience will laugh at me when I say this.

[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.480]
Any day of the week I'll take prices right over either one of those shows.

[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.400]
And then it's...

[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.800]
Oh, in here.

[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.940]
You know what $160,000 looks like?

[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.440]
Yeah, take a look at this, Mori.

[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.800]
You don't want to know what this looks like?

[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.400]
And they get them a big black sack when they're going off with their winnings.

[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.560]
And you can't really even see that it's real money or funny.

[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.220]
It's just a block of what looks like money.

[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.800]
Show us the money, okay?

[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.760]
Because we're about to greeny mercenary assholes.

[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.820]
And then the show Greed would Chuck's Flurry, which I already talked about, just pathetic.

[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.580]
Just pathetic.

[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.960]
Where they try to knock each other out.

[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.140]
They're going to wind up with fish.

[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.760]
And what they're going to do is combine quiz shows with Jerry Springer.

[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.540]
And they'll have the contestants beating the crap out of each other because they knocked each other out of the running or else they gave the wrong answer.

[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.580]
Or something like...

[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:40.840]
Bad.

[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:41.840]
Bad.

[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.640]
Television.

[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.160]
Bad.

[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:51.160]
In fact, you'll remember some of those people from $21,000 and $64,000 question went to jail because there were some people from these shows are going to go to jail.

[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.560]
Not because they're fixed, but because they're so bad.

[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.900]
This is 560, QAM.

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.260]
No portion of this broadcast may be reproduced without the express written from the public.

[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.500]
QAM, briefly read acquisition course.

[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.520]
No car, Hs L papel, Engel Toilet, focus at Oopi.

[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.460]
Hey, who you looking at?

[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:15.460]
Who?

[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.440]
Yeah.

[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.060]
Yeah.

[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.660]
Life is a nutcase.

[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.460]
You can't look directly at him.

[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.920]
You cannot look in his eyes.

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.260]
No.

[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.960]
If you do your job goes by by.

[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.520]
He'd say, when I come in a room,

[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.500]
you leave it, you leave without turning around.

[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:53.100]
It's no wonder they deal that long.

[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.880]
You try to love, for a second of none.

[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.840]
Well, if I'd guys there job,

You're like a lady, you slide to love.

[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.500]
You keep it deep in your mind.

[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.180]
Thank you, backscores, your gosh.

[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.220]
There's gonna treat men just the right.

[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.360]
And you're gonna meet 10, 14, and 550, WKM.

[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.740]
Here's the best facts we ever received on this show.

[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.060]
From Ken and Miami Lakes.

[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.780]
Nice going, Ken.

[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.460]
It says, Jimmy and Danny and Aleyon.

[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.600]
There's another big for both of us.

[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.060]
Yeah, you can just take the same one and stick it in there.

[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.280]
It just says over and over again on here.

[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.700]
Jimmy and Danny and Aleyon.

[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.540]
And Aleyon.

[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.060]
Oh my god, is there anything else going on this town?

[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.380]
No.

[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.880]
All of us are like sick as the dog and everybody's got the intestinal flu

[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.040]
and puking and all kinds of crap.

[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.180]
And the crap is to top it all up.

[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.340]
Here's a great cartoon, which I missed.

[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.440]
Thank you for practicing this to me from the sunset and all on whatever day this is.

[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.380]
It says, what's next for Aleyon?

[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.560]
And it shows him sitting in a chair with a thorn, the authority crown.

[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.580]
He's sitting on a high chair and there's a guy with suspenders.

[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.760]
What are your people, of course?

[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.980]
He says, I do some cure.

[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.060]
He's touching them on the head.

[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.300]
Yeah, the miracle workers.

[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.860]
He's the baby Jesus.

[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.060]
I know it. The baby Jesus.

[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:25.840]
Interesting.

[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.760]
Paul, by the way, Channel 10, it seems to me.

[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.100]
And I hate to say this because I will never watch Channel 10 News.

[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.340]
No.

[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.800]
I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.180]
But Michael Putney, who's a good guy, even though very stupid and boring, but a good guy,

[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.340]
they expanded his show yesterday morning or Sunday morning.

[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.100]
Do you have Miss Monday?

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:41.560]
All right.

[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.040]
Sunday morning, they expanded the usual boring Sunday morning show.

[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.200]
And they showed all these polls that they took.

[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.520]
Very, very, very, very, very, very interesting.

[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.200]
Of all the people they had, and the question was, do you support these slowdowns

[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.680]
than the civil disobedience in regard to all this crap that's been going on here?

[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.360]
Of all the respondents, 74% of the people said no, and only 24% said no.

[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:05.440]

[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.100]
Of the Hispanic respondents, 28% said no.

[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.380]
And 58% said no, no, no.

[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.020]
How do you like that?

[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.420]
See?

[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.320]
See?

[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:14.780]
No.

[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.300]
I see.

[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.000]
Yeah.

[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.360]
So this is, and that's why there really been a handful of people out there because the fact is that what,

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.900]
and I'm not going to go into that thing about should he stay?

[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.480]
Should he leave?

[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.120]
Because I'm just, I can't stand it.

[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.300]
Maybe that's what I got.

[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.400]
Maybe got alien disease.

[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.280]
That could be it.

[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:30.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.040]
Just coming out of every poor in my body.

[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.700]
I can't take anymore with all the respect to this poor little kid.

[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.380]
And I do mean poor little kid because he still is even more than ever before.

[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.880]
We got Dan Burton now.

[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.300]
We got this local judge whose name is Gonzalez, but she's a Puerto Rican.

[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.820]
And all of a sudden, the crap going on.

[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.100]
And this kid, they're tugging on one arm and tugging on the other.

[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.680]
He is a human wishbone.

[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.280]
So I feel really bad for him.

[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.080]
And of course, thank God that we did it right at the time being he's over there because they, uh,

[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.400]
they propagandize over there.

[00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.180]
I'll propaganda.

[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.840]
Thank God we don't brainwash and propagandize over here.

[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.440]
All right.

[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.220]
That's not the American effing way.

[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.040]
Is it all it is?

[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.940]
But like I said, there are two different issues.

[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.940]
Two different issues.

[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.280]
And I noticed that the assholes, uh, the basuto, jo basuto.

[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.280]
From your friends, uh, what is it?

[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.480]
Brothers lost in the Everglades shooting themselves in the feet to 56.

[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.260]
Is that what it is?

[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.380]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.940]
And that the Sowl Sanchez and at the Getchke with the Yavuku,

[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.940]
I'm starting to get pissed every time I see him.

[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.860]
I'm sick and tired of yours.

[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:33.560]
I am.

[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.240]
You know, he's not what I'm I'm sure he is.

[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:35.900]
No, he is not.

[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.980]
He's not what of anybody.

[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.880]
He's a gold Getchke is what he is.

[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.600]
God, get that smart off your head.

[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.660]
People are starting to talk.

[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.280]
And he's talking about brainwashing.

[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.140]
I saw that King had 600 guests online.

[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.080]
And I was talking about this.

[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.300]
And here's this Getchke with a schmata on.

[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.440]
And he's talking about the potential for poor little aliens over there being brainwashed.

[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.980]
And I'm thinking to myself, who are you?

[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.940]
Can what that's right?

[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.880]
Will that schmata on your head, Spencer?

[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.400]
And how many years locked the you know, name Spencer except maybe Spencer Ross?

[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.360]
Remember Spencer Ross?

[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:07.620]
No.

[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.180]
Well, too bad.

[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.480]
Stan Burstian and Spencer Ross.

[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.640]
Come on, get with it.

[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.920]
The clients would be off.

[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.620]
Oh, well, what is that on?

[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.140]
Uh, some in BC.

[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.580]
I'll just put that on.

[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.780]
Oh, no, I don't know.

[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.320]
I don't want to put that stuff on again.

[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.040]
I can hear you.

[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:19.120]
I can hear you.

[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:19.560]
Huh?

[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.500]
I will not put that on.

[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.760]
But like I said, there's two different issues.

[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:31.020]
And I guarantee you, I assure you, I promise you that nothing different would have happened

[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.560]
except a lot of people, a lot of us people would have been inconvenienced.

[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.480]
And a lot of people would have a big smile on their face.

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.200]
They would be sick.

[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.500]
If just a whole bunch of people would have come out and demonstrated peacefully,

[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.620]
Ilyana Gross-Latin would have still been there, and Jose Basuelto would have still been there,

[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.640]
and Saul Sanchez and all these other getchkeys, they still would have been there,

[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.240]
and they still would have gotten their brownie points, and Dan Burton, who never met a fidelity liked,

[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.060]
and of course, the way it's dinner, we don't like poison, he still would have done his thing,

[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.260]
and all the right wing Republicans would have still been doing their thing,

[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.020]
and making a big political issue out of this.

[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.520]
Without inconvenience in here, but without the threats.

[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.260]
That's what really pisses people off, the threats.

[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.080]
Oh, we're going to slow it on the airport.

[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.880]
Well, what is that going to accomplish?

[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.540]
Yeah, like a bunch of sporad little brats.

[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:20.340]
And let me say it again, a very, very small, tiny minority of assholes,

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:26.520]
assholes, and each and every one of you that believes that blocking off disrupting other people's lives

[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.520]
who have nothing to do with whatever your issue is to get your way,

[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.040]
it's not acceptable, you're an asshole.

[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.680]
Period.

[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.240]
Sunset and the Long Saturday, in fact two good eductorials.

[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.860]
Of course, the Harold, Harold just can't seem to find a co-host and really tell it like it is, you know?

[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.920]
I can't imagine why, you know what I'm saying?

[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.160]
I can't imagine why.

[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.800]
Sunset and the Long Saturday says,

[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.460]
Elyon Gonzalez protests must be peaceful and legal.

[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.940]
It says anyone who wants to demonstrate against the U.S. government's decision to return Elyon Gonzalez

[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.560]
to his father in Cuba has the right to do so,

[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.840]
but this right includes an obligation to protest in a peaceful and legal manner.

[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.320]
Yes!

[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.460]
The protesters who have tried to block traffic and disrupt orders are breaking the line

[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.880]
and the inheriting their cause.

[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.020]
Absolutely.

[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.480]
Absolutely correct.

[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.680]
It appeared that no more than 1,000 protesters in Dave County, home to 780,000 Cuban Americans,

[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.700]
took to the streets on Thursday, then stood against the INS decision.

[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.800]
While a majority of Cuban Americans may believe Elyon should stay in the U.S.,

[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.920]
most of them remain calm over his imminent return to Cuba.

[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.400]
A minority, though, have sat in the middle of the Vigilator section,

[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.580]
charged barricades and thrown bottles at police officers who try to control the crowd.

[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.120]
Such behavior is not only irresponsible and illegal, it's dangerous.

[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.600]
Absolutely correct.

[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.500]
Two protesters were run down by an angry motorist who was trying to get around the demonstrators.

[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.340]
Fortunately, the two protesters were not seriously injured.

[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.260]
In a separate incident, a police officer was also hit by a car and taken to a hospital with minor injuries.

[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.840]
This reckless behavior needs to stop before somebody gets killed.

[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.260]
Absolutely correct.

[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.840]
Protesters include many elderly Cuban Americans who are the faithful listeners of Spanish language radio programs

[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.300]
that have expressed outrage over the Elyon issue.

[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:12.940]
Radio commentators have a right to free speech, but they also have a responsibility to encourage respect for law and order.

[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.380]
Absolutely correct.

[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.220]
Some violent protests involve young people who have seized the Elyon debate as an invitation to a brawl.

[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.180]
They are clearly out on a joy ride.

[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.840]
What sounds like my show from that day, doesn't it?

[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.040]
Many day police have a difficult situation in the need to help the exiled leaders to maintain peace

[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.780]
they should get this up without reservation.

[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.500]
Those who truly believe Elyon should stay are not helping this child when they try to hold a city hostage

[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.780]
by promoting civil disorder protestors are convincing most non-cubans that Elyon should go home sooner rather than later.

[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.760]
There you go.

[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.140]
And let me just say this.

[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.740]
Let me add this in the middle of these two-graded torals from the Sun Sentinel that at this point I'm just...

[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.500]
I have no problem with this stand.

[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.980]
No problem with that.

[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260]
And like I said on Friday, I could make the word...

[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.140]
Forget about that Getki with Ishmata.

[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.340]
I could make a thousand times more convincing case for him staying.

[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.120]
The father applied for an exit visa twice in Cuba.

[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:13.520]
There is not one word now that comes from the father that can be believed because of the fact that they twist him away from the house.

[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.160]
Cast your wine and dine in and they hand him like in custody.

[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.100]
Therefore a week brainwashing do in their thing, although he did not go to Disney World anymore.

[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:21.560]
No.

[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.240]
Not yet. No.

[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.520]
In addition to which...

[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.840]
How about the dry foot, wet foot policy?

[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.700]
Okay? Thanks to those two fishermen in Pompovich, the kid managed to get his feet on American soil.

[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.320]
He's here. How come he couldn't stay?

[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.780]
Like all of the other people in many of whom quite frankly ought to go back.

[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:40.800]
Please.

[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.280]
So there's a tremendous case to be made.

[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.200]
And of course it's very obvious that anybody who wants to look at this objectively,

[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.880]
the reason the father isn't here is because he's got a wife and another child over there.

[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.480]
Now even if Castor allows him to come here to pick up his son,

[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.560]
is he going to allow the...

[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.400]
You know what it reminds me of?

[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.520]
Which Godfather wasn't.

[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.420]
It was Godfather II?

[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.020]
With the brother.

[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:01.580]
With the brother.

[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.600]
Oh yeah. And all of a sudden...

[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.820]
Oh, I didn't know Godfather?

[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.760]
Yeah, I was in the olive oil business with his father.

[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.380]
I didn't know no Godfather?

[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.280]
Yeah, he told me to stay there to say that I'm not a meat but I'm like, oh, okay, sure.

[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.380]
Yeah, Frankie Pintangely.

[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.500]
That was between the brothers.

[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.820]
Yeah, I was between a brother because they brought his brother in from Greece.

[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.120]
They stood him in the back of the courtroom.

[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.560]
He looked around and all of a sudden, but he was singing a different tune.

[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.280]
Am I right?

[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:25.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.020]
Yeah.

[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:27.800]
Same thing here.

[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.460]
If I, Ilya and his father comes over here,

[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.500]
they got to...

[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.740]
Are they going to let them all come here?

[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:33.960]
No.

[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.020]
Of course not because they let them all come here.

[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.340]
They're all going to say, hey guess what?

[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.200]
We decided to, in fact, by finegula, if we're not coming back.

[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.320]
I mean, does it take a genius to figure that out?

[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:42.600]
No.

[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.280]
Of course not.

[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.620]
Of course not.

[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.020]
So he's not going to let the Gothamish Baha'i come over here, the grandparents, the father,

[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.440]
the new wife, and of course not.

[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.620]
So there's an overwhelming case that could be made for this kid staying here.

[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.480]
And quite frankly, I don't care.

[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.800]
I don't care.

[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.300]
I think that most of us would like our lives back.

[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.580]
Yeah.

[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.020]
I mean, surely there might...

[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.680]
Oh, don't call me surely.

[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.440]
There must be more important things going on in the world and in this town than that.

[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:10.940]
Yeah.

[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.600]
That's a genius, Danny.

[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.400]
Exactly.

[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.240]
Jimmy and Danny, without Aliah.

[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:14.760]
Yeah.

[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.340]
For one more week, by the way.

[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.920]
And by the way, George tells me that yesterday there were people calling George with

[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.700]
dolphin comments.

[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.960]
Oh my God.

[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.520]
Are you people out of your mind calling Mr. Antide Sports?

[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.000]
And by the way, don't call me with a leader because I don't think about you beating a girl's

[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.540]
team on Sunday.

[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.320]
I saw that crap.

[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.800]
Jesus Christ.

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.960]
Desperation to beat to squeeze by a girl's team.

[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.340]
Oh, and these people, all of a sudden, oh, Jimmy, we want some hope.

[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:42.900]
We want...

[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.840]
Oh, well, Troy, not some hope.

[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.700]
We'll story some rope.

[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.080]
So hang yourselves, okay?

[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.300]
You people that are living in some kind of a dream mode and a delusionary state like Florida.

[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.460]
But the other issue, like I said, the one that's important is how you go about doing these things.

[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.120]
And this crap has got to stop.

[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.640]
And these incessant threats.

[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.460]
Oh, wow.

[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.260]
And I love the way he says, well, you know, of course, if he does go back, I have no...

[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.000]
I can't say what would happen in this town then.

[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.760]
There's no telling.

[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:09.900]
Yeah.

[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.940]
Threat after threat after threat after...

[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.760]
And let me ask you, how much disruption you're going to cause with your 1000 disputes?

[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:22.020]
Because between the channel 10 pool and the very small numbers of people who showed up who were mostly

[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.320]
older, the people like it said in the editorial and a bunch of punks out there for a joy right on the streets.

[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.220]
How much disruption are they going to cause?

[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.240]
They just aren't that many.

[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:38.320]
The overwhelming majority of people with the Cubans or Americans or Africans or Martians, they don't give a flying crap.

[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:43.620]
They have an opinion obviously because they've been overwhelmed with this stuff day after day after day, even more than Jimmy and Danny.

[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.280]
They have an opinion.

[00:22:46.420 --> 00:23:01.220]
But they're not going to like take time from making a living and living their lives and getting laid or whatever else they enjoy doing to go out there and make a whole big

[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:01.800]
peaceful demonstration.

[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:02.980]
Did they win any brownie points?

[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.240]
No.

[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.060]
Oh, that was a bad expression.

[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:04.820]
I'm sorry, brownie.

[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.700]
Darky points?

[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:07.500]
No.

[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:07.840]
Whatever.

[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.400]
No.

[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:09.580]
No.

[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:12.860]
Very sad.

[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.420]
And the other one in today's subpoena complicates matter.

[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.040]
Congress, no place for custody battle.

[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.620]
But again, keep in mind, Dan Burton.

[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.820]
Here's the guy who was trying to get Janorino impeached last year because he wouldn't point that special prosecutor.

[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.800]
Hates are like poison.

[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.380]
And of course, a co-author of the Helms Burton act.

[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.140]
Hates to hell and Janorino equally as much.

[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.140]
In fact, if Janor had a beard, probably you'd think they were the same person.

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.100]
Janus Mosmacho, Janor Orfidel, that impudel.

[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.860]
Not that we're bringing politics into what you understand.

[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.860]
And then Larry blows it last night.

[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.540]
Of course, I did watch that because he had 15,000 guests on here.

[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.500]
He says to Dan Burton, do you have children?

[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.620]
Evidently, Larry's Alzheimer's must be kicking it again.

[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.920]
He must forget that illogidimate child that came out last year during penis gait.

[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.660]
Dan Burton, five of the illogins, Mr. Moralist, like Henry N. is hide.

[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.460]
Henry Hyde who broke up the family of that guy in the World of Heli, in Western.

[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.380]
Right.

[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.200]
You've faker Dan Burton, you have any children?

[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.960]
Yeah, some that you know about and some that you don't.

[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.140]
Oh my God.

[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.920]
And then of course that Jappy cousin of his, of alienate, whatever her name is, the Gonzalez Ross,

[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.980]
Garcia Schwartz, Jones Rodriguez, whatever her name is.

[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.060]
Oh, if I have to see her for one more second on her, she's an expert on immigration.

[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.760]
Oh yeah, the whole, the Gontz and Mershbacher, they're all immigration experts now.

[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.940]
Jim Manditz talks sports.

[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:38.660]
Oh, he's right.

[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.380]
Right here.

[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.160]
On sports radio, 560 Q.A.

[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.460]
Al Engel Mochopiejo and Al Pumpe.

[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.640]
From the director of the Shawshank Redemption.

[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.940]
It's the movie you knew Tom Hanks would eventually make.

[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:55.920]
Hey, God did not put a gift like that in the pants of a man who he did not intend to use it.

[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.800]
Starring another slow-witted southerner, our president.

[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.520]
He told me not to go near it because it was so big and never right.

[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.600]
Oh yeah, well, obviously, Daisy, here take my Hanky and wipe your chin off, would you?

[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.700]
Can't have any evidence.

[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.060]
It's the cream-to-smile.

[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:12.680]
What's he?

[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.740]
That was almost really embarrassing.

[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.640]
Yeah, do you see any more anywhere else?

[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.800]
Oh, well, you see you still miss on them.

[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.360]
You have to clean that up, darling.

[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.280]
The cream-to-smile in CDP theaters everywhere.

[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.320]
1031 and 560 WQM.

[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.500]
So George tells me yesterday was kind of a battle of struggle here and it looks to me like it's going to be again today.

[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.080]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.820]
Which I don't understand for the life of me.

[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.700]
560-70560, 05-560 on the AT&T line.

[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.960]
In today's Suncentle, it says,

[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.260]
The subpoena complicates matter.

[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.940]
Congress no place for custody battle.

[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.060]
US representative Dan Burton has made the case of Ilyon Gonzalez.

[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.660]
Any easy to understand by issuing a subpoena to have the child testify before Congress on February 10th.

[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.620]
An action that could postpone the boys return to Cuba.

[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.760]
What can a six-year-old child who does not speak English possibly tele-American lawmaker is the likely answer is very little.

[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:04.080]
Burton, who is chairman of the House government and reform committee, said he's trying to buy time for Ilyon supporters

[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.560]
so they can take the boys' case to court.

[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:10.520]
Yet these supporters don't need a congressional subpoena to ask the courts for a temporary restraining order against the IMS,

[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.580]
which had decided to send the home boy home January 14th.

[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:20.820]
In fact, a Miami-Dade Circuit Court issued a temporary protective order Monday that would keep Ilyon in the US until March giving the boys Miami relatives their day in court.

[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.200]
While the courts are the proper place for custody battle, a congressional hearing is not.

[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.160]
The subpoena is addressed to a six-year-old and it's unclear what impact it'll have on the IMS if any.

[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:37.600]
Let's get real. This is a little boy who watched his mother drown and now finds himself separated from his father and his closest family members who live in Cuba.

[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:45.340]
Supporters raise a valid point that Ilyon would have a better life in the US, but a better and free life, though important and precious, is not enough to terminate a father's parental rights.

[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.140]
The IMS is determined that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the legal guardian of his son, Ilyon.

[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:56.140]
Federal investigators found that Gonzalez had a close relationship with the boy, even though he was divorced from Ilyon's mother, who drowned on the journey to Florida.

[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:02.780]
Cuba's communist regime may be forcing Gonzalez to insist on the boys return to Cuba as Ilyon's US supporter suggests.

[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:10.160]
It would be better if Gonzalez traveled to the US to make his true wishes known, but no father needs a dictator standing over him to say that he loves his son and wants him to come home.

[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.400]
Burton's subpoena isn't shedding any light on Ilyon's case only making it more complicated.

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:20.140]
It's an indication that Burton, a conservative Republican from Indiana, can't let go of the Cold War.

[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.980]
How do you like that? Two great editorials and a son sentinel.

[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.580]
Two out of three days, not bad, 6067.

[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.680]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line looks like the catch got their tongue this week.

[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.240]
Here's four Myers, hello.

[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.640]
Hey, how's it going, buddy?

[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.200]
Okay, sir.

[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.860]
All right, you were talking about, well, first of all, yeah, I was watching Larry last night, Larry King.

[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:43.360]
Yeah.

[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.960]
Any heavy people on? He had some, uh, wetsome.

[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:46.500]
I saw it.

[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.560]
Yeah, you saw it.

[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:54.480]
Okay. Yeah, it's amazing to me. I'm convinced more than ever that that's the old boy is going to be the next great philosopher because that girl, that cousin.

[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.580]
Okay, the cousin of boys saying that supposedly he can explain how people are suffering in Cuba.

[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.980]
Okay, he can explain how he wants to stay here.

[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.380]
A six year old boy knows this, Neil.

[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.480]
A six year old boy can, can, can, can, can, can hold a, uh,

[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.980]
And don't forget, uh, Senator Bob Smith from New Hampshire, that good Republican right wing fat slop.

[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.900]
He says, oh, Ilyon told him a couple of times he wants to go back home.

[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.880]
Well, it doesn't want to go back home. He wants to stay here.

[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.780]
Listen, I had nothing against the boy. I just really, this was really sad.

[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.880]
Yeah, I used to live in Miami and this is, this is really, it's a circus.

[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.220]
It's a, it's a circus. It's a three ring embarrassing circus.

[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.140]
The baby juice.

[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.020]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.520]
Yeah, I'm telling, I guess I'm telling my friend, but family, that kid's been going to be like the next confused.

[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.300]
She's a great philosopher.

[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.280]
Maybe he'll be performing miracles. He's healing people. He may be using the baby juice.

[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.320]
Hey, on a second note.

[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.800]
By the way, did you happen to see that today show this morning?

[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.800]
No, I don't want to.

[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.660]
You will never get to Matt Lauer with talking to this morning.

[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.380]
He was talking to our baby Jesus.

[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:58.680]
He was talking to our bell and some and some some New York Times, not New York Times, but some writer that he wrote a book.

[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.540]
If you check it out in Amazon, our bell wrote a new book called The Coming Global Superstorm.

[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.360]
Yeah, more intending danger.

[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:13.580]
Oh, something about the, the, the, the, the, the melting ice cap of the polar North.

[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.340]
I mean, this is good guys crazy.

[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.340]
It's crazy. I don't know.

[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.180]
And have a great day.

[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:28.360]
That tells you what it's coming to when the today show, a supposedly respectable news show puts Art Bell on the, or a madman, or radio madman, appealing to the craziest people in the US of eight.

[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:35.560]
5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T line, 877785 Neil out of town line.

[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.560]
Here's a call in the Grove.

[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:37.940]
Hello.

[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.280]
Coconut Grove.

[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.760]
Neil, happy Tuesday.

[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.460]
And back to you.

[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.080]
How are you?

[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.100]
I'm better.

[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:44.640]
Good.

[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.660]
But anyway, yesterday I almost was Channel 7 or Channel 4.

[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.600]
They used your Jimmy and Danny bit.

[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:53.780]
Really?

[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:59.560]
And, uh, I don't know, but it was on the sports, uh, when they did their sports show.

[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.380]
And it, you know, they pumped it out there and, uh, kind of cracked out.

[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.700]
But, uh, they actually played Jimmy and Danny's.

[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:08.860]
Yes.

[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.420]
Yeah.

[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.880]
I don't know if it was Channel 7.

[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.560]
If there's anybody out there that did see it, it was either Channel 7 or Channel 4.

[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.080]
And it was on the sports show.

[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.060]
But of course they didn't give us credit for it.

[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.300]
No, no, no, no.

[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:19.440]
No, no.

[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.340]
They mentioned WIOD, the sports station at all.

[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.240]
WIOD?

[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.400]
W, um.

[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.960]
Did you say WIOD, sir?

[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.060]
Is that what I just heard you say?

[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.040]
Oh, I, I, oh my god.

[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.520]
I'm sorry.

[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.360]
Oh, I hate that state.

[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:34.920]
Yeah, me too.

[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.320]
I'm sorry.

[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.300]
That's okay.

[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.140]
It was a great light moment.

[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.320]
But anyway, about this, uh, six-year-old, uh, just some, uh, dollars missed it.

[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:54.640]
Out there, those old parts out there that are, uh, the cause of this and a couple, uh, that they just, they got a stand-up ground and, uh, they got a, uh, they, we just got to get strong with them and, uh, not, uh, this is strong.

[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:54.900]

[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.180]
Because Miami is, uh, toilet.

[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.440]
You got it.

[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.980]
And, uh, thank you for taking my call.

[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.960]
And thank you for making it, Paul.

[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.520]
Have a great day.

[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:03.760]
Thank you.

[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.980]
Thank you for making your statement and movement.

[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.720]
In fact, here's the facts from a chronic factor.

[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.340]
It's as ever since, early on, came to Miami.

[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.400]
I know a lot of people, including myself, have got diarrhea.

[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.300]
How do you like that?

[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.760]
And I'm telling you, I think you're Fidel.

[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.760]
Fidel sent some kind of a killer virus here with the baby Jesus to try to avoid poison, so I'm Florida.

[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.120]
Don't take it out on the kid, but boy, oh boy.

[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.520]
And maybe it's just a coincidence.

[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.420]
You think it's a coincidence?

[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:24.840]
No.

[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.060]
And everybody seems to be like sick and puking and gagging and, uh, squirting their brains out.

[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:29.880]
Wow.

[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.460]
Maybe we better have a congressional investigation about that.

[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.000]
And who better to, uh, head it up than Dan Burton, of course.

[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.700]
I thought they'd be smoking today, man.

[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.960]
I thought they'd be hyperventilating.

[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.180]
Here's Hi, Alia.

[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:48.420]
Hello.

[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:49.820]
Are you doing, Neil?

[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.320]
Okay, sir.

[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.220]
I do feeling better.

[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.740]
Just a quick comment on immigration.

[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.900]
You know, we have, we have so many different types of hyperventilating groups in this country and all the cities.

[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.160]
So, last is for the next two centuries.

[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:08.220]
I can't understand why every time somebody wants to maybe change the immigration system and close our borders automatically.

[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.240]
And don't forget, by the way, the people who want to do that are the same Republicans that are screaming the hell out about poor aliens, stay here, etc.

[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:14.640]
And so on.

[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.840]
Those are the ones who want to close the borders.

[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.600]
Don't want any more AI immigration, etc.

[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.000]
And so on.

[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.240]
But, of course, don't confuse the local people there with that, because they vote for all Republicans anyway.

[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.020]
So what the reason is, isn't it?

[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.420]
Right.

[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.640]
And if, from fortunate that the candidates, those are the type of candidates that want to close our borders.

[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.360]
Because right away they're labeled as racist.

[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.880]
Anybody who wants to close our borders is labeled as a racist.

[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:33.780]
And I don't understand that.

[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.700]
That's a legitimate suggestion.

[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.760]
I say take care of the American people first.

[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.060]
Take care of the people you got here now.

[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.400]
Then start worrying about the being Godfathered everybody else.

[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.000]
Absolutely.

[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:42.620]
And he's been.

[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:43.500]
Absolutely.

[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.620]
And one last comment.

[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:50.680]
If the courts tomorrow come February, come March, decide that Ellie and I have to go back to Cuba.

[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.520]
I'm willing to accept the United States government's decision.

[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.760]
And if I want to protest, I'll go out there and I'll do it in a peaceful manner.

[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:02.720]
But I guarantee you that if that decision comes to life, these people are going to go back out there and break the law

[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.340]
and do the same thing they did all over again.

[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.800]
It's a ridiculous, ridiculous progression.

[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.140]
Just cross your fingers and pray that we don't have to go through this again this Friday.

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.440]
Oh, especially anybody who might have to go to the airport on Friday.

[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.740]
Oh my God.

[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.780]
I'm definitely praying.

[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.080]
One last comment here.

[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.460]
I know that you got a viral infection.

[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.460]
I just want to go to the violent infection, yeah.

[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.460]
From the intestinal?

[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.220]
Yeah.

[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.400]
I was going to suggest to you, and I know you may not want to hear this, but I don't want to hear it.

[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.380]
The adkins diet, I don't think it's helping you.

[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.820]
Who's doing the adkins diet?

[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.220]
I'm not doing the adkins diet.

[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.720]
Oh, you're not doing it for like four hours at a time in my sleep.

[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.020]
So what kind of a diet are you doing now?

[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.980]
It's called being sick diet.

[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.820]
It works very well, by the way.

[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.260]
Look, it's traditional.

[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.360]
Like today, in fact, today I'm doing the young kipper diet.

[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.900]
I'm doing a fast because I have to prep for tomorrow and this afternoon I have to drink a bunch of stuff

[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.800]
that's going to make me crap my brains out for that tomorrow I can do all my testing.

[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.160]
Stick tubes all over my body.

[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:54.560]
Correcto.

[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.880]
And then tell me, oh, well, I'll go home.

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.680]
Well, I'm going to give you a suggestion.

[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.440]
You may not like it, but it may sound artsy, farcey to you, but the macrobiotic diet is definitely one of the best.

[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]
Have a great day, my friend.

[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.420]
My first guest on WKET a hundred years ago, Mishio Kushi.

[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.540]
He and his wife, the great proponents of the macrobiotic diet.

[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.280]
The same man that told me, oh, there's no problem that he spoke those strange little cigarettes.

[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.760]
You know, it was in those cigarettes, don't you?

[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.700]
Yeah, but at any rate, guess what he did?

[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.560]
He died from cancer.

[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.480]
Oh, how surprising.

[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.800]
With his macrobiotic diet, very, very dangerous or pleased, I've been plenty of my own research.

[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.760]
The macrobiotic diet is clacariots, garbage.

[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.220]
You know what the best diet is?

[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:35.720]
Don't eat.

[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.220]
Yeah, that's the best diet.

[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:38.600]
Don't eat.

[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.540]
Eat very, very little.

[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.560]
Don't eat a bunch of crap.

[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.860]
Don't eat a lot of fatty stuff.

[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.780]
And that's the best diet.

[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.160]
Don't eat.

[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.300]
Don't be obsessed with food.

[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.400]
And by the way, I shouldn't mention on here that my good close friend, Fat Rich,

[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.060]
who's a real celebrity on his show over the many years.

[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.780]
You know, Fat Rich from the Arroudra Show, that guy.

[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.180]
I shouldn't mention that he's in the hospital with an intensive care.

[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.000]
And you'll Plasty.

[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.600]
And you know what it was from?

[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.060]
Fat.

[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:03.660]
That's right.

[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.580]
You know, Fat Rich reminds me of my mother.

[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.480]
Only a fatter version.

[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.500]
Take care of yourself, Fat Man.

[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.860]
And you'll Plasty a shunt, which rhymes with stunt.

[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.960]
That's what happens when you become obsessed with food, man.

[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:17.960]
To all of us.

[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.820]
I know you people in the audience, you're rather here about food.

[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.720]
You'd rather Haka trying to go out fish food and all this other good stuff.

[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.720]
But you know, when it push comes to shove, when you're lying there staring at your maker, you know, at Marvin Maker.

[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.380]
Coming down the stretch, you say, oh, maybe I shouldn't have eaten that last point.

[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.880]
That's what alcohol thing is going to say when he's there gasping for oxygen in his life.

[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:37.880]
Like that.

[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.080]
Yeah, he's going to say, maybe I shouldn't have eaten that last quote.

[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.320]
But what he's going to say, trust me.

[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.360]
Hurricane, basketball.

[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.980]
Raking, riding, riding, riding, roll.

[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.900]
Locains, travel to Jersey to take on the sinking hole.

[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:52.860]
Hines tonight.

[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.140]
Join the new boys to the hurricane's more than direct.

[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.560]
Chosing acting for the action.

[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.580]
Hurricane's warm up.

[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.400]
Start at 7.

[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.980]
Here on Sports Radio 560 QAA.

[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.480]
50 Hoover, out the moon, man.

[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.280]
Today's broadcast is brought to you by New Sicken Clean, the all-purpose cleaner.

[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.220]
See this shirt?

[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.560]
It's f**king clean.

[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.360]
How nasty is this carpet stain?

[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.800]
Well, just dropped out of your knees.

[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.840]
Use a little bit of elbow grease and f**king clean it.

[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.200]
Yes, you can f**king clean anything.

[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.680]
F**king clean your dog.

[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.500]
F**king clean your silverware.

[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.120]
F**king clean your car.

[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.620]
F**king clean everything you own.

[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.660]
Get f**king clean today.

[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.320]
Come visit one of our eight f**king clean stores.

[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.340]
Or look us up on the web at www.f**kingclean.com

[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.120]
and f**king clean it up.

[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.560]
Okay, 16 to 11 at 5.

[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.600]
16 WQM.

[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.960]
So a very nice statement.

[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.040]
Whatever her name is, Renate.

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.060]
That's kind of an unusual name.

[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.500]
R-E-N-A-I, but a nice name.

[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.640]
She sends me some stuff.

[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.540]
Some button, she says.

[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.360]
My name is Renate.

[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.480]
I own a company called BS Button Company.

[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.100]
My husband is an avid listener.

[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.300]
And all this past week he's been telling me about your stories about alien gunvalles.

[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.960]
I love the way I say that, by the way.

[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.120]
So much better than all the way.

[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.640]
I know how to say it.

[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.600]
I know my espagnol.

[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:03.980]
See?

[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.260]
So as I first read it, it says in America,

[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.600]
I'm tired of all the illegal coming over here to South Florida and getting everything for free.

[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.400]
There's nothing worth any illegal coming, by the way.

[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:11.900]
Of course, of course.

[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.560]
I've decided to make a button for you and to make this for your staff.

[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.320]
If you desire to give any way it's that of and so on.

[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.780]
Please understand I have a love for children that I truly feel what's happening since Thanksgiving with this boy.

[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.140]
Has been a total joke.

[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.840]
And of course, obviously yes.

[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:28.800]
And so Renate sends me a few of these with a band symbol, band alien.

[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.660]
Which doesn't mean anything to him personally, but it means enough of the crap already.

[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.860]
I think basically is what it means.

[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.860]
Button lovers in Carl Springs.

[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.320]
Is that any of their business?

[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.060]
B-A-O-B-S button lovers.

[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.940]
Nice going there, Renate.

[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.520]
Thank you, sweetheart.

[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.380]
That's for you.

[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:43.380]
Yeah.

[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.780]
The band symbol with alien in the middle just to your name.

[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18th and of course CNN, man.

[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.400]
They're obsessed with it.

[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.460]
The whole King's show last night for an hour, right?

[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:54.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.180]
Yeah.

[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.440]
Longing, 60 dollars.

[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.280]
And then of course the lead store and every guy they have newscasts morning noon and night, around the clock.

[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.940]
And so this is a big story.

[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:03.880]
So this is important.

[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.900]
It is not important.

[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.340]
It's important to this kid.

[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.920]
It's important to his father.

[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.920]
It's important to people who are immediately involved.

[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.160]
Am I immediately involved?

[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:11.360]
No.

[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.600]
Are any of you immediately involved?

[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:12.920]
No.

[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.820]
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, man.

[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.500]
I've been trying to tell you for a long time.

[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.080]
The media is sick and they've helped out me.

[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:25.740]
Here's Kendall.

[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.080]
Hello.

[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.660]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.420]
When was the hour?

[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:30.460]
Yeah.

[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.120]
You've left out some important people in this evening on.

[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.220]
Is that the right way to say it?

[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.040]
No, I'm whatever you like.

[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.560]
Yeah.

[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.680]
Kennedy, Torselli, Dwyche.

[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.080]
Yeah.

[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:41.780]
And then this.

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.820]
And now, outdoors.

[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:43.500]
Yeah.

[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:44.520]
That's right.

[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.300]
Now, the Democrats are jumping on the bandwagon.

[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.000]
Yeah, that's absolutely fair.

[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.320]
Well, listen, this is what I said last week.

[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.300]
It's a pissing contest.

[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:50.640]
Yeah.

[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:51.920]
Who can piss the farthest?

[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:52.240]
Right.

[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.280]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:53.640]
Okay.

[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.220]
Like some of those tribal Africans, you know, who can.

[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:56.860]
Squared, squared.

[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.640]
Shoot it to farthest.

[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:58.760]
That's what they're doing.

[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.520]
They're having a contest.

[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.220]
No, we're the most in favor of this little boy.

[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:03.540]
No, no.

[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.520]
We're the most in favor.

[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.360]
No, we're the best.

[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.640]
We're the great humanitarians.

[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.060]
And you know what you all are?

[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.300]
You're a bunch of political horrors.

[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.140]
Each and every one of you.

[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.060]
You know, I'm not that political horrors.

[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.500]
And this kid, he doesn't count for anything.

[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.580]
That's the saddest part.

[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.600]
That's the most tragic part.

[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.880]
Don't believe for a minute that any of those people, whether it's Jolba Sulto or any of these folks,

[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.820]
give one flying crap about it and Bob Smith, that big fat turd burger from New Hampshire.

[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.440]
He cares about this kid or Maine or where the hell he's from.

[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.840]
What a piece of crap he is.

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.680]
Oh, no, he told me he wants to stay here.

[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.380]
It doesn't want to go back.

[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.260]
No, say I'll fly bull crap about key, okay?

[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:42.720]
Senator Smith.

[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.300]
And what kind of a name is that?

[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.720]
Anyway, forgot to talk to China with all these Cubans Smith.

[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.060]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:49.400]
Hello.

[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.320]
Hello, Dean.

[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:50.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:51.220]
Okay.

[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:57.260]
Is it just one to, if I may, correct you on the information of the mayor of Miami?

[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.260]
Is that Carl?

[00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.500]
Is it kind of for you?

[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.100]
Kind of for you.

[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.900]
Check with George without me.

[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.660]
He's going to let you down.

[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.160]
Okay.

[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:06.360]

[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.060]
Another amateur comedian out there and does George get it?

[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.220]
No.

[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.900]
Pomp probably saying something dirty on your hood down.

[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.100]
Yeah.

[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:14.380]
Good.

[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:14.840]
Thank you.

[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.220]
You're on your inflexed ear or something dirty every now and then.

[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.800]
Here's a candle.

[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:19.120]
Hello.

[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:19.840]
Neil?

[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:20.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:28.840]
Neil, the majority of this community, as you said, agrees with everything that you have stated.

[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.160]
I'm glad you mentioned the poll on Channel 10.

[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.200]
And you know, it made me feel better about the life.

[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:36.760]
I knew that.

[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.760]
I was shocked and very pleasingly shocked.

[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:44.720]
That 68% of the Hispanics said they do not support this crap out there, block it a traffic and block it a street and slowing down.

[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.080]
They do not support it.

[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:51.260]
I was absolutely amazed, but it gave me a good feeling that there are some normal people out there.

[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:51.680]
Right.

[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.620]
Neil, let me let me mention that.

[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.160]
Let me postpone the scenario that is high in the problem.

[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.240]
Before you propose that, just keep this in mind.

[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:05.040]
If there weren't the overwhelming majority who felt that way, there would have been a lot more than just a few scattering of people out there in the streets.

[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:05.800]
Exactly.

[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.420]
But anyway, they caused a great deal of stress and discomfort for this community.

[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.040]
As Nick Carter would say, chaos, right?

[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:24.260]
Neil, what if one of these people like this Mr. Ramon Lopez or Sanchez, they had a child?

[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.240]
Now, I say this is highly improbable.

[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.020]
Yeah.

[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:33.740]
What would happen if they were sent to his right in the parking lot in front of the stadium over your right?

[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:41.020]
One of his children was hijacked or taken by a human network.

[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.280]
You're confusing them with a fact.

[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.700]
Don't dignified by going with that extent.

[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:51.920]
My point is this country would probably be, could be, could be, at war with Cuba.

[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.340]
No, we're not going to war with Cuba.

[00:41:53.340 --> 00:42:04.220]
No, no, no, no, I'm saying if the child was an American, taken to Cuba, I don't think this government, because Cuba is not strong enough to do anything to this government.

[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.720]
We're not going to war with Cuba, sir, believe me.

[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.200]
The whole thing is so happening.

[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:13.760]
I only wish that we would go to war with Cuba tonight and I wake up in the morning and the bearded one will be gone.

[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.440]
And all these agitators will be back there on their plantations and they will build their casinos and do their thing.

[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.620]
We could all live happily ever after.

[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.340]
That would lead to happier than anybody.

[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:33.840]
I'm just glad it's a minority of the Latin community because where I live most of my neighbors are decent and good people and I don't know these people don't have a life.

[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.900]
And most of my neighbors, I don't know and I'm happy to keep it that way and have a great day.

[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:46.000]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line, 877785, we got Hank from Cool City at 2, the big fat booster at 6,

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.220]
Herakun, basketball at 7, Ed Kaplan, 1039 who keeps getting, by the way, I had a spy report from memory yesterday your close personal friend who was monitoring your show.

[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.140]
And he said, you know, we were, yeah.

[00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:02.500]
And he says that you mentioned something about Ed Kaplan being responsible for all those Gulf Stream Facts on the top it said from Ed Kaplan.

[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.940]
From Ed Kaplan, then why is he faxing him over here?

[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:07.800]
I don't know.

[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.920]
I don't know. That's what their fax machine says at Gulf Stream.

[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.920]
From Ed Kaplan, he's wasting all of our, he doesn't even know his own guy, the fax number over there.

[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.060]
What is wrong with his man? He must have had a bad, a bad lifetime at the track.

[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:24.100]
And Kaplan, one for radio, I switch to the WNP Ray.

[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:29.160]
Oh my God, stop wasting our fax paper ready. They're going to start taking the money out of your paycheck.

[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.400]
I got doubts on the case.

[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:31.300]
Oh good.

[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.620]
That should take care of it, don't you think?

[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:34.960]
No.

[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.780]
Just leave him alone, okay?

[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:43.180]
Oh boy, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18th T line. Here's the lady in West Palm. Hello.

[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.860]
Hey Neil, 6 minutes.

[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.580]
I think it's about 5 minutes.

[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.460]
Go ahead, that's your line.

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.180]
I heard you talking about the quiz shows earlier.

[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.240]
I was on, he wants to be a millionaire in November.

[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.700]
You were on it?

[00:43:52.740 --> 00:44:00.500]
Yeah, I didn't win anything in the chair, but anyway, just to let people know because I had a lot of questions about this, why people don't ask surprised when they call.

[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.040]
Because it's obviously edited.

[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:08.940]
Well, alright, and they are called as soon as the person gets in the chair and told your friend is in the chair, be ready to be right by the phone.

[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.960]
Right. I like the Ted Bundy thing, your friend is in the chair, if he lasts words.

[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.160]
They all know that, that's why they don't react.

[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:16.620]
Right.

[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.340]
Anyway.

[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.860]
And it very poorly edited to him, it's very obvious.

[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.840]
You know, it took an hour and a half to take my half hour show. They stopped taking constantly.

[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:29.160]
They retake questions, they ask them, the contestants have to react and say the thing over and over again.

[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:37.700]
And the questions they act, and the guy that won a half a million last night, who was pontificating and the drums were going, oh well, it could be this.

[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.860]
And the one that he had to ask for help was duck duck.

[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.940]
Oh no, what's that incredible?

[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.440]
What is that? Duck duck goose?

[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.140]
I thought that was really fun.

[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.020]
If the President's initials are BC, you know, I mean, what does that mean?

[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.660]
What kind of questions are these?

[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.440]
I don't know.

[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:53.680]
And is that your final answer?

[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:54.320]
Final answer?

[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:54.940]
Yeah, no.

[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:55.960]
That is annoying.

[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.440]
It's horrible.

[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.520]
It's a horrible show.

[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:57.940]
I'm sorry.

[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:58.940]
I know.

[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.220]
And I'm trying to get back on, but you don't want to see Bob Barker. He'll fix you up.

[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.020]
Hey, that's a good show.

[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.240]
Okay, do it soon though, because you know, have a great day.

[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:06.760]
Okay, bye.

[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:15.220]
Yeah, better go see Bob Barker real soon, because he's not getting any younger, but that's an eight million times better show, even though they go to a little bit more than you do.

[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.580]
That's the only reason that these, and now we got Dick Clark. That old dick is coming back.

[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.500]
He just signed for another hundred years from New Year's Eve there in Times Square.

[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:26.480]
And he's got another guy named 50 billion dollars show for twenty-trillion dollars.

[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:29.260]
Oh my god.

[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.060]
And then they got to bring it out and show you all the money.

[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.680]
And then the public is out there just eating it up.

[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.860]
Which, of course, I will say this.

[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.260]
It certainly is bad as they are.

[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.500]
They're more entertaining than all of the goddamn stupid sitcoms.

[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.700]
And these other crappy melodramas they got on there.

[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:42.740]
Horrible stuff.

[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:48.060]
Thank God for 50 satellite dishes, which by the way, I want you to write down this phone number, which I did bring in today.

[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:48.540]
Where is it?

[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:55.120]
Instead of calling me with stupid questions about satellite dishes, if you're interested in a small dish,

[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.500]
one, tripe-late, dish, help.

[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.760]
That's a toll-free number and they can tell you anything you want to know about the direct TV.

[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.000]
What's the other one?

[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.640]
Dish network.

[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.760]
Any of those small dishes.

[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.300]
One, tripe-late, dish, help.

[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.340]
Which there's too many letters, but that, you know, they don't want to do dish hell.

[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.300]
That would have sounded bad.

[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.020]
Nobody wants to be in dish hell.

[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:17.280]
Do they?

[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:17.460]
No.

[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.520]
One, tripe-late, dish, help.

[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.080]
And so instead of calling here or anybody else with stupid questions, call that number.

[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.420]
And that's how you how great it is.

[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.220]
And it was a big article in the business section of one of the papers the other day.

[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.220]
What paper was it?

[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:28.920]
I'm glad you asked.

[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:29.700]
The hero.

[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.300]
And it says, cables direct thread.

[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:38.080]
Big article about they changed it along the satellite TV industry and the local channels, which I'll get to later on maybe.

[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.160]
And as usual, I'm like light years ahead of all the rest.

[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.980]
I'm telling you, say goodbye to the cable company.

[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.140]
They're a bunch of grave robbers.

[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.660]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.000]
Hello?

[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:48.920]
Hello?

[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:49.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.700]
Neil, how are you doing?

[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:51.220]
Okay.

[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.720]
Neil, I enjoy your show.

[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.980]
And I just wanted to call you.

[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:54.600]
I called everyone.

[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:55.120]
It's been a while.

[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.060]
I'm on my way to New York and bought this kid.

[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.380]
Neil, do you really think, well, I know you don't?

[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.680]
These people are pathetic.

[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.780]
Do you think any people think and care about the welfare of this kid?

[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.260]
People are just making themselves a big show for nothing.

[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:08.740]
Yeah.

[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.580]
You know, Neil, I've worked hard on my life.

[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.200]
I got six donors that I educated him and my wife.

[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.120]
But the thing over there is, I think we got kids right here

[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.940]
can't even eat this kid been all of a sudden.

[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.660]
The dog, Disney World, and things that they did.

[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.700]
Everybody's just slurping all over this.

[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.580]
I think it's an outro.

[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.660]
And he's got that little puppy dog that's trying to pull his pants off, by the way.

[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.420]
I mean, what's the, how many times do we gotta see that threat?

[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:33.240]
A lot of kids, a lot of little kids out there who live in poverty who'd like to have a little puppy dog.

[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.140]
I'm from New York, man.

[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.820]
Neil, Neil, most of the kids will love to have a warm bed and some food in his stomach before they went to bed.

[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.680]
You know, Neil, I enjoy your show a lot.

[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.260]
I don't get to hear you a lot because I travel, but anyway, I call you occasionally.

[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.420]
But I really stand up for what you stand for.

[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.540]
I want you to do for the truth.

[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.040]
Thank you.

[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.220]
You have a good day, Neil.

[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.060]
And I'll pray for you.

[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.120]
And I'll talk to you later.

[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:54.560]
All right.

[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:55.280]
Bye-bye.

[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:59.060]
56670560, pound 560 on the 18th.

[00:47:59.060 --> 00:47:59.280]
T-line.

[00:47:59.360 --> 00:47:59.780]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.180]
Hello.

[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:01.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.820]
Hey, how's it going, Neil?

[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.240]
Okay.

[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.140]
Yeah, good.

[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.080]
I'm talking a lot.

[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:05.900]
Are you there?

[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.240]
Okay.

[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.620]
Hey, how are you?

[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.480]
I'm from, uh, do you know what Glenn Hill is doing?

[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.180]
Oh, you're right.

[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.080]
This is, it must be something in here.

[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.480]
This is the week all the crazy people came back from this.

[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.180]
It was from Zeta, no less.

[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.520]
Maybe all the normal people are sick and bad.

[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.120]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.880]
All the normal people.

[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.940]
We all got to crud the intestinal flu and the influenza and a cough and a puking and they are, that's who.

[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:32.760]
Wow.

[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.700]
George was warning me about this from his experience yesterday.

[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:39.700]
All these bizarre, pathetic people have made it come back today.

[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.520]
Wow, wow, wow.

[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.140]
Yeah.

[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:43.880]
You don't want to have to see that?

[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:44.660]
Yeah.

[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.740]
10.56 at 5.60 WQAMs.

[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.100]
Kim Mocaver talks sports.

[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.560]
Oh, right.

[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:52.820]
He begins right here.

[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.960]
On sports radio, 5.60 QAM.

[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:57.660]
WQAMs.

[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.440]
My heavy 40-bottled tail.

[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.340]
One, two, uh, three.

[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.120]
I made it through college and average to see.

[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.620]
I have a lot of money.

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.920]
Look, I'm not much of a friend.

[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.560]
I'm not supposed to use voters who are just this lame.

[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.360]
But I can say one thing that you can.

[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.040]
My daddy is an ex-president saying I got money.

[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.020]
Power is up to the rules.

[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.380]
I can do anything I choose.

[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.860]
A little bit of cash is all I need.

[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.740]
Is satisfied my ego and my grade.

[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.600]
Manipulated marketing is all I use.

[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.340]
A garnered vote for more around.

[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.340]
Just like you.

[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.540]
That's a fact.

[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:36.900]
That is clearly the last.

[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.900]
I don't think I laughed that bad.

[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.460]
Remember to vote for George Bush.

[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.180]
And those of you who don't, you can kiss my touch.

[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.900]
You see what matters to me about the presidency.

[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.700]
Is that it makes a nice conversation, please?

[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.220]
I'm the king of denial, too.

[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.080]
I have no problems lying to you.

[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:04.040]
So why is it so important for you to know whether or not I did blow.

[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.740]
A little bit of cocaine up my nose.

[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.160]
A little bit of tooth.

[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.760]
A little blow on.

[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.260]
When I elected out voted and all that.

[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.140]
When I put up the science administration, damn.

[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:15.940]
Is it good?

[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.140]
It's 11 o'clock at 5.60 WQAM.

[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.640]
We got a couple of overlines there.

[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:30.100]
20 or 30,000, 5.60, 7.0, 5.60, 0.5, 5.60 on the 18T line.

[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:31.700]
Here's Miami Beach.

[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:31.920]
Hello.

[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:33.060]
Yeah, Dale.

[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:33.460]
Good morning.

[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:33.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.520]
Yes, switch the conversation up a little.

[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.860]
I don't know if you ever had this happen to.

[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.080]
But I'm writing down 9.95 the other day.

[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.040]
And there's a funeral procession coming along.

[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.620]
And they have two guys not marked, please, the private,

[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:45.880]
two little motorcycles.

[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.260]
Zoom in in and out of traffic, going in the emergency lane

[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.560]
about 60 miles now.

[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:51.960]
Who the hell are these guys?

[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.820]
And how do they have the right to drive like that?

[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.060]
Well, not even police officers.

[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.280]
Have you ever experienced that before?

[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.060]
Who are these guys?

[00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.040]
They were a funeral police.

[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.780]
Oh, they had the death police.

[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.640]
Yeah, I understand that.

[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.740]
But I mean, are they trained?

[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.680]
I mean, these guys zip in and out of traffic.

[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.200]
Well, I don't know.

[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.820]
Why did you conduct a little survey on answer?

[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.160]
When you find the answer, call us back.

[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.980]
Because I'm sure that the inquiry minds in the audience

[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.980]
are just dying to know the answer.

[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.740]
Those are the kinds of things that I'm very, very concerned about.

[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.900]
In fact, I spent hours and hours scouring through

[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.420]
and psychopedias all over the internet.

[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.740]
All of the worldwide wealth of literature trying to

[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.240]
find answers to questions like that, right?

[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.120]
Oh, my God.

[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.140]
5, 6, 7, what would happen all of a sudden?

[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:29.360]
Huh?

[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.720]
All of a sudden, there's kind of like a turn.

[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.140]
We took a turn in the road.

[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.060]
By the way, thanks to the people who came out on Saturday

[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.560]
and Nixon, thanks to the people down there and next to their wonderful folks.

[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.600]
And thanks for coming by, Danny.

[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.840]
Wrong Danny, but yeah.

[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:41.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.800]
Don't stay way too long, Danny.

[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.340]
In fact, when it's real friend or whoever that lady was,

[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.380]
a sister, whoever you think she was, goes to Amsterdam,

[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.360]
and I'll keep Danny company.

[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:52.820]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.360]
It's a miracle we had anybody show up because it was only like moments

[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.940]
before the appearance on Saturday that finally was down.

[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.460]
Well, we're not going to demonstrate today.

[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.300]
So I'm sure many, many people stayed the hell away.

[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:02.560]
Yeah.

[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.260]
Because they weren't too crazy about going to fly

[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.500]
or street at that particular moment.

[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.480]
In fact, they did cross my mind.

[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.240]
Here's a mobile in Drobeech.

[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:10.420]
Hello?

[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:11.720]
Welcome, Neil.

[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.180]
How are you?

[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.760]
I wasn't very well.

[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:14.920]
I'm heading south now.

[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.280]
I'm almost I'm in Broward.

[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.640]
Anyway, how are you?

[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:18.140]
Happy New Year.

[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:18.660]
I'm Cindy.

[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.780]
Can you come here?

[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:20.700]
Hi, you're fine.

[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:21.260]
OK.

[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.040]
Just a couple of comments, then I'll let you speak.

[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:29.260]
I wonder how many of these people that are out there demonstrating in the streets.

[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.140]
If I opened a training camp out in the Everglades tomorrow,

[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:37.380]
trained people to go, fight over in Cuba to free the country.

[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.420]
I wonder how many of those people that are in the streets

[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.920]
would sign up for this camp?

[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.120]
Probably none, right?

[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:43.800]
I don't know.

[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:49.200]
Anyway, also, isn't that a cross-slot to get the fly at those...

[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:49.540]
Oh, what?

[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:50.760]
Isn't there a fly?

[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:51.800]
A communist fly?

[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:52.720]
Yeah.

[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.940]
The fly in Cuba?

[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:54.920]
That's what I thought.

[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.020]
OK, have a great day, pal.

[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:56.620]
It's old material.

[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.320]
That's 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.740]
pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.380]
Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:02.640]
Hello?

[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:03.700]
How you doing, man?

[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.240]
OK, sir.

[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.240]
And, Neil, I talked to you about this last week.

[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.720]
You know, these guys, these people down in Miami, they're not Cuba.

[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:10.260]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.500]
You talk to me about it and you want to say the same thing again today.

[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.300]
I don't think so, sir.

[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.020]
I don't think so.

[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.740]
See, what do people do that?

[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.640]
He talked to me about it last week.

[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.420]
He wants to call and say the same thing again this week.

[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.320]
Now, you can probably get away with that in the other shows,

[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.640]
because when I left here on Friday, the first call on one show

[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:28.500]
I don't want to mention who it was.

[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.220]
Woody, you know, Steve from Hollywood.

[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.340]
And, of course, the screeners on those shows, even though they do intensively screened,

[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:36.520]
sometimes whatever they're in the motorway,

[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.700]
and the host don't want to talk to whoever wants to pick on them.

[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.020]
They just...

[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.940]
Did they ever get those voices?

[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:41.200]
No.

[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:41.460]
No.

[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.780]
So, it's the same old tired people saying the same old tired thing.

[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.420]
Sorry, pal.

[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.620]
Give it a rest.

[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.520]
Put it down on the ground.

[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:49.980]
Water red a little bit and see if it grows.

[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.600]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:52.920]
Hello.

[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:54.100]
Hello.

[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:54.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.200]
I'm a photojournalist.

[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.720]
I've been to Cuba about four times now.

[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.140]
I'm American citizen, born in Cuba.

[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.420]
I'm in my 40s.

[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:08.060]
And I think most people, my age and 30 to 48,

[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:12.460]
probably are pretty moderate concerning a lot of the information on Cuba.

[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.060]
I believe that the...

[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.740]
Pretty moderate way.

[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.520]
When a pretty moderate concerning the information, are Cuba, what does that mean?

[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.380]
Well, I'm saying, I think that many, many people, my age,

[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.360]
the silent majority of Cubans,

[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.760]
believe that the embargo should end,

[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.280]
because I've been there so many times, you know, nothing's going to happen.

[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.500]
Nothing's going to happen with what's going on in the embargo now.

[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:38.040]
But I think that a lot of people forget one thing, that it's not...

[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:43.100]
The situation is definitely a repressive regime.

[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.560]
But the thing that would always linger in my mind concerning this boy

[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:55.040]
is regardless of when anybody says, here, I don't believe that it's a...

[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.640]
From my standpoint, it's not necessarily an anti-castro type protest.

[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.040]
But I would already be telling it...

[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.440]
Well, I mean, in my situation, I'm saying it's not,

[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.940]
because my belief is that, based on the fact that I've been there four times,

[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:18.480]
I can never be convinced that there is 100% sincerity in what the father is saying,

[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:22.960]
unless he was literally physically here along with...

[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.420]
Sure, everybody else cares about that.

[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.560]
That's not the issue.

[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.900]
Like I said before, there are two separate issues, two completely separate issues.

[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.240]
The one issue is, should the kids stay here, or should they go back,

[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.020]
which is for the INS and the courts to the side?

[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.640]
And the other issue is, how much crap do the people who live here have to put up with?

[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.060]
That's the most important issue.

[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.180]
Yeah, I'm not...

[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.020]
I thought for you or for me to decide whether the kid is going to stay here

[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.300]
or not, or a bunch of crazy politicians or crazy bunch of old banana boat people.

[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.100]
It's up to the law to the side.

[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.280]
It's a country of laws, not a country of energy.

[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:55.900]
I agree with protests, but I do not agree with the types of protests that have been going on.

[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.880]
Well, that's the issue. That is the real issue.

[00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:58.060]
Right.

[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.340]
That's immaterial to us.

[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:07.340]
The other thing though that kind of also bothers me a little bit though is that any strong...

[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.400]
Especially in the last couple of callers that you've had,

[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:20.440]
any type of strong, strong anti-Elean sentiment always also has to be viewed with some,

[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.760]
quote-unquote, anti-cuban sentiment also.

[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.200]
And I think that you've realized that...

[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.040]
What is anti-Elean sentiment?

[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.400]
What is anti-Elean sentiment?

[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.340]
Well, I think the...

[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:31.320]
Is that...

[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.540]
What does that mean?

[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:38.480]
There are some people that feel that he should stay, some people that feel that he should go,

[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:46.220]
and I think that many people that are vehemently toward him going back...

[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:51.040]
You're making a long thing out of something very simple that is that there are people who don't like Cuban,

[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.560]
and therefore I want him to go back.

[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.300]
Well, you didn't take that long to say that.

[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.120]
I could have said that in five seconds.

[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.000]
Let me try it again.

[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:00.460]
There are a lot of people who don't like Cubans in general, and a lot of those people want him to go back.

[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:01.380]
Four seconds.

[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.900]
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.700]
Am I impressed by the bruby of you, Joe?

[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.140]
No.

[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:07.720]
Not at all.

[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.580]
Oh, well, thanks for coming.

[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.380]
Good time, sir.

[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.040]
And you really did.

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:11.700]
You buttered it.

[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.460]
5-6-7-0-5-60.

[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.520]
Pound 5-60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:17.500]
Anybody know what he said?

[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:17.860]
No.

[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:23.480]
8-7-7-7-8-5-63-45 on a world-famous out-of-town line.

[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.740]
Let's try Weston.

[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:26.980]
Hello.

[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.260]
I yield.

[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:29.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.480]
Yes, I want to clear something up.

[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.720]
Bob Smith is from New Hampshire, not Maine.

[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.740]
I said New Hampshire, and then I made a mistake.

[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.800]
I said, oh, who knows?

[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.860]
One of those Yahoo States.

[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.400]
Yeah, but you know, he's here to be an embarrassment

[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.300]
to the state of Maine.

[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:43.640]
OK.

[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.440]
And I don't know if any Republicans out there

[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.820]
would ever do anything for anybody to be truthful.

[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.480]
You know, if these politicians, they all want their 50 minutes,

[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.900]
if they would get on the bad wet bandwagon in Washington

[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.760]
and in other areas, they'd represent

[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.820]
and try to take care of the people's business,

[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.980]
there'd be a lot better.

[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.240]
Yeah, I understand what senators from Indiana and from Maine

[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.640]
have got to do with what's going on here in South Florida.

[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.560]
I don't understand that.

[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.060]
Nothing.

[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:14.000]
Now if the Graham says something, then I can say.

[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:14.620]
Then ignore it.

[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.280]
Ignoring if Senator Max says something just plug your ears.

[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:17.980]
That's right.

[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.720]
He's a terrible average.

[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.380]
The fact he's going to be gone.

[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.600]
Ask him how grand that he's doing with that baseball thing.

[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.140]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.300]
OK, thanks.

[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.960]
Hey, Connie McNebron's granded eddy for ya.

[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.000]
Long live.

[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:34.220]
Eight minutes after 11 and 5 600 wqM S Christians.

[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:40.700]
Look at all those mandanding semi andjing in Danny.

[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:41.660]
We're kidding.

[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:42.660]
That's right.

[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.160]
We님� Asianian greetings.

[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.540]
That's right, Kimmy.

[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:52.160]
We're a Pakistani.

[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.500]
This is aian, too.

[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.260]
We have a mobile from Miramar. Hello.

[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.540]
Can you hear me okay? I got a question about a Jimmy and Danny situation.

[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.920]
Yeah, Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.520]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:30.480]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480]

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480]

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480]

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480]

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480]

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480]

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480]

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.480]

[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:30.980]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:31.200]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.020]
David, what lay?

[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.420]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:36.880]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.560]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:41.060]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:43.120]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:47.220]
And that's a form about Jimmy and Danny after this word from Valley Along The

[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.080]
Hot Gents, wherever you thought it comes with its own frigid air.

[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.760]
1113 at 560 W.K.

[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:55.500]
And by the way, in the story in Saturday's which paper is this the hero about

[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.460]
Cecil? Oh yeah, we talked about Cecil.

[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.380]
In the story in Saturday's hero,

[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.180]
it says host on local radio sports talk shows have picked up the theme about

[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.540]
him. No one is brought saying unnamed inciders have heard of a relationship

[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.060]
between the two from Collins himself.

[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.920]
Even though, of course, he denied that in his confession.

[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:16.920]
And then it goes on to say WQM Sports commentator Joel Rose, who has discussed the

[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.740]
case on the air, said on Thursday broadcast that he was subpoenaed and testifying

[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.820]
the case. What he gonna say? I like the we we.

[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.780]
Yeah, probably.

[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.980]
The state attorney's office citing the gag order would need the confirmed or

[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.920]
denied that his subpoena had been issued to Rose. How do you like that?

[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:31.880]
Grab the word. Yeah.

[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.320]
Unbelievable.

[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:38.020]
See, even if they didn't have a relationship, I realized that some of the

[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:41.260]
jocks nippers on this radio station have a hard time understanding that if you

[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:44.520]
have a relationship with somebody, you don't take the screen off their window

[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.180]
and break in 530 in a morning. Usually.

[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.520]
Of course, it could be a little bit unusual. It could be different. That's the way

[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.700]
it's done here. Who knows? Only the experts on a station would know things like that.

[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.060]
If he was just trying to dip his lick a little bit. Yeah, sure was.

[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:06.660]
I'm sure she thought so too. 1114 at 560 WQAM. Here's a mobile in candle. Hello.

[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.240]
Neil, God.

[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.880]
Hey, to change the subject matter, but there's actually something in the

[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.000]
editorial section of the the rag the Harold last week that I thought was

[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.500]
significant. One of our high school principals, he sexually harassed a

[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:26.380]
couple of his his teachers and his secretary was found guilty and made the pay.

[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.880]
The school board made the pay over half a million dollars.

[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.760]
Oh, right. Yeah.

[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.900]
And he was made to pay over a hundred thousand dollars and then guess what his

[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.660]
punishment was. What is that? They found him a nice cushy

[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.040]
read assigned them. Yeah. Not got rid of them. Not prosecuted.

[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.660]
They want the thought he was a priest on the side.

[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.260]
That's what I'm saying. That only is it bad for for the way we're teaching our

[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.140]
children. So think of the money. They're always the clean. They don't have enough

[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.640]
money and hear the spedding all this money to bail this guy out.

[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.420]
Then how many more times they're going to have to do it.

[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.280]
And by the way, whatever happened with that prostitute, the ring, which is now

[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.140]
almost a year old, that story. It's still a little bit more.

[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.620]
Yeah, the police of the town.

[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.740]
The police of Brown. Yeah, what happened with that?

[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.320]
And what happened with the school teacher in Hollywood,

[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.980]
without the young boy that they moved in with the family and all that stuff?

[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.660]
That was it. That was a moral.

[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.440]
But whatever happened with it, they think it died, you know,

[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.960]
because they don't care. They just want to.

[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.940]
Oh, I forgot. I forgot. We got alien. Have a great day, sir.

[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.280]
We got alien and Jimmy and Danny.

[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.600]
We don't kind of talk about those things. Do we? No, because nobody wants to know.

[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.440]
By the way, somebody sent me this from the Irish independent,

[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.380]
tried to December 10, 1990. I'm just a couple of weeks ago, a month.

[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.480]
First time I think I've ever received an Irish newspaper.

[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.840]
Thank you, profusely. It says,

[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.740]
pedophile priest, long reign of terror. How do you like that?

[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.180]
In Ireland, no less.

[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.660]
There's no fact in the church.

[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.180]
A retired priest, yesterday pleaded guilty away horrendous,

[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.160]
underlined horrendous, lit in the of sexual abuse against

[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.520]
all their boys. What a shock. What a surprise.

[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:03.420]
The 71-year-old admitted 41 sample counts of sexual assault,

[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:08.800]
buggery and indecent assault in the period from 1966.

[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.060]
Correct him to 1982. He didn't just destroy their lives.

[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:19.020]
The retired cleric said impassively as a detective guard

[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.540]
took over three hours to outline his catalog of horror.

[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.640]
A detective guard, I don't know what that is.

[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.180]
The ex-preased face of total of 108 indecent assault charges.

[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.960]
A shocked, shocked,

[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.380]
in-camera court heard how the systematically

[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:36.080]
bugged alter boys in several locations in West Donagal

[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.660]
over a 17-year period.

[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:41.120]
He bugged him in their West Donagal. I thought if he bugged

[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.240]
or somebody it's in their rectum.

[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.240]
Anyway, one of his 26 victims was bugged umpteen times.

[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.600]
This is a court proceeding in Ireland.

[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.360]
And whether they have any problems over there, you know?

[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:54.680]
It says he was bugged umpteen times from 1976 to 1979.

[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.720]
Did he pre-prey on the innocent altar boys

[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.460]
after luring them to parochial houses?

[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.740]
His car and a church locked them on occasion.

[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.900]
One of the assaults took place in the sacristy of a church

[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.160]
where the priest was saying, mass.

[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:10.600]
Yeah.

[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.820]
He said, oh god that's good.

[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.540]
The detective guard told the court when

[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.940]
the confronted by the priest's behavior one of his

[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.900]
appears after he want the problem shifted somewhere else.

[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.800]
Just in line with what this guy just said,

[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.340]
do we want to like reassign them maybe?

[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:29.560]

[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.260]
So we can let some kids someplace else far away from us

[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.560]
then let it be their problem.

[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.540]
There are animals anyway.

[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:35.440]
Let them lose their soul.

[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.880]
There's no fact in the church.

[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:37.460]
Unbelievable.

[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:38.800]
Is it unbelievable?

[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:39.240]
No.

[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.000]
Very believable.

[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.360]
Here's a lady mobile and coral springs.

[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:41.680]
Hello?

[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:44.200]

[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:44.760]
Hello?

[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.460]
Yes ma'am.

[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.640]
Hi young, how are you?

[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.180]
Okay.

[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.140]
This is Renee from Spent Lovers.

[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:49.800]
Oh hi Renee.

[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.460]
Hi.

[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:51.360]
How are you pronounced your name?

[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:52.480]
Renee yes.

[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:53.060]
I'm sorry.

[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.800]
I never saw Renee's spelled R-E-N-A-I.

[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:55.740]
Oh I guess it makes sense.

[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.940]
R-E-A-N-A-I.

[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.540]
I just wanted to call and thank you very much

[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.480]
for reading my letter.

[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.920]
Well thank you very much for sending your letter

[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.120]
and for sending these buttons too.

[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.640]
Oh you're very welcome.

[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.940]
My head still listens to you all every day on the radio.

[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.200]
It comes home and tells me what the topic of the day is.

[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:11.380]
Of course.

[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.620]
And when he told me that day about Ilyan

[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.220]
I had just had enough.

[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.480]
Well you make them.

[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.440]
Next time you make these you have to remember to put the

[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.500]
accent to over the A.

[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.040]
Oh okay.

[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.980]
Just so we are you know correct.

[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.300]
So we are uh

[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.040]
publicly and otherwise correct right.

[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:27.580]
Exactly.

[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.640]
Expannically correct.

[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:29.880]
Expannically correct.

[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.300]
Well I just I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea.

[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.380]
I do love children I have two of my own.

[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:35.260]
But I think-

[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.240]
I'd be defensive Renee don't be defensive about that.

[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.320]
No I know but I just feel sorry for this little boy.

[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.060]
Everybody's like making such a big issue.

[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:42.420]
Yeah.

[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.180]
He has no clue what's going on.

[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:44.380]
Right.

[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.320]
So I let again I just want to-

[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.320]
He told Bob Smith though that he wants to stay here.

[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.940]
You don't want to go back in so many words.

[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:51.100]
Oh yeah.

[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.020]
I think I've been sent out of Bob had a dream.

[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.560]
Bob had a dream.

[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.960]
Well I want to thank you very much again and if there's anything I can do for you please

[01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.980]
feel free to give me a call.

[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.220]
Okay Renee have a great life.

[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:01.960]
You too.

[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.020]
Bye bye.

[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:06.060]
That's Renee from BS button lovers of Crossbrings with a

[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.000]
mechal kinds of neat buttons.

[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.520]
She's the one that sent me the ban.

[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.000]
Ilyan buttons here.

[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.580]
Which are not personal for the little kid of course you understand.

[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:13.480]
Do you understand that?

[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:13.680]
No.

[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:14.620]
Well think about it.

[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.280]
There's a little message in there.

[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:20.840]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.680]
Jimmy and Danny and alien and Danny and Jimmy and alien and all a whole bunch of illegal aliens.

[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.500]
And you wonder why I want-

[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.040]
I just you just stop and you look yourself in the mirror.

[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:32.880]
Yeah.

[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.240]
What is this all about?

[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.160]
What is all this verbiage of this incision?

[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.860]
Bap bap bap bap bap bap and how come it's like Manastana Halala Halala Halala.

[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.200]
Why is this night any different from any other night?

[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.340]
Why is this kid any different from all the other kids?

[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:49.860]
Why is that?

[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000]
And I think the answer is obvious because this is the banana republic.

[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:54.660]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:58.740]
I mean if people to wash up on the shores are like most other places like in Maine since I

[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.120]
mentioned Maine before and since it's a coastal state.

[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:02.940]
Would he have-

[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.420]
There have been a big stimulus about it there?

[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:04.620]
No.

[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.300]
I don't think so.

[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.180]
Only in the banana republic baby.

[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.260]
Only in Miami.

[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.280]
I mean you know the INS would have decided.

[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.040]
The courts would have decided and it wouldn't have been a big stink and a big son of dancing.

[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.100]
Whatever they decided because case of Ross or Ross.

[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.760]
The worst day would have come in and sang it for him.

[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:17.780]
But not here.

[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.400]
Here we got to go through all of this agony and twisting and turning and churning and

[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:30.040]
politics and crap and 85 Michael Putney shows and here's Joe Basuto and Joe Conroyo and Mayor

[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.920]
Penga Pagania and all these other uh, lung kids.

[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:33.880]
Lung kids.

[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.200]
And they've already spent over quarter million dollars by the way in Dave County.

[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.840]
They probably want to be in a half a million maybe a million dollars in the county and especially in the

[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:45.960]
city that's scouring desperate looking where they're going to find the next nickels to rub together.

[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:50.020]
Maybe we can get Mike Nichols and Steve Nichols and rub them together.

[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.440]
Here's a mobile and lighthouse point.

[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:52.720]
Hello.

[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.020]
Hey Neil, how are you?

[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:54.500]
Pretty good.

[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.980]
Neil regarding the kid.

[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.360]
Which is subject and you talk about legalizing pot?

[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.140]
What do you want to say about it sir?

[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.280]
It should be legalized.

[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.480]
You know okay great thank you.

[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.420]
Yeah let's talk about legalizing pot.

[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.800]
It should be legalized yeah.

[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:18.360]
Yeah I agree and and and five six seven oh five do we all can we all agree anybody with a brain on that?

[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:18.860]
Yeah ma.

[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.060]
Okay next subject.

[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.180]
Oh man and I think we're less than four out of your kids who might be playing hooky today.

[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.140]
Don't smoke bad weed you'll get just like that guy.

[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.440]
You wind up with a mentality just like him right?

[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.000]
Yeah ma.

[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.640]
Here's West Palm Beach hello.

[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:38.060]
Hey Neil I just want to share an observation that my daughter me I had to pick her up.

[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.540]
You're away pal.

[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.020]
Sheer away.

[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:39.960]
I had to pick her up from.

[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.320]
Maybe we can get some closure on this.

[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.760]
That this happens to do with the worst team.

[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:44.820]
Well don't even go there.

[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:49.760]
Well can I tell you real quick yeah I had to pick her up from school it was about 955 when we got

[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:55.100]
in the car so I clicked on the radio to you know to start to listen to your show and they were still on

[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.080]
and we listened to about maybe a minute two minutes of those guys.

[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.620]
These kids my rear end yeah here's what my daughter says okay she says that

[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.820]
those guys sound like the three studes.

[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.300]
Yeah exactly.

[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.580]
And nine year old.

[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.400]
And the nine year old girl making that up.

[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.140]
Even a nine year old girl is perspricateous enough that we got the three studes on in the

[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.380]
morning on the station yeah.

[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.900]
Another thing I'd like to say I don't believe that boys ever go

[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:23.460]
although I believe he should go back I don't believe he'll ever step foot back in Cuba.

[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.560]
You know what I couldn't care less I mean I agree.

[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:31.000]
As long as uh look he's in a no lose situation except that he's got to go through all of this

[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.440]
crap but in the end ultimately if he stays here he's going to be a hero and be treated like

[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:39.520]
royalty and if he goes over there he'll be one of the privileged few over there already

[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.300]
Fidel has been whining and dining daddy and maybe even the grandma and all

[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.960]
and he got nothing to lose.

[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.600]
Did you see Larry King last night?

[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.880]
Yeah I'm still sick over.

[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:52.040]
Did you see where the one uh the the the the niece or the cousin

[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.940]
that we've already talked to him and he told us he doesn't want to go back.

[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.060]
The valley girl of Cubano yeah.

[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.680]
And then the other guy said well you know most six year olds if you ask him to go to bed

[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.980]
they're not even going to want to go.

[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:03.180]
Right.

[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.220]
Of course why he's here and they got him the puppy and take him to Disney World

[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.320]
and he they got all these material and glitchy things.

[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.800]
Oh yeah this is good this is good I think I want to stay here you know.

[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.780]
Yeah well that's all I got to say.

[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.060]
And have a great thank you.

[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.460]
See it's pretty simple.

[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.280]
And but in the meantime there's so hypocritical they're saying oh well what's going to go

[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.980]
all the propaganda over there and how they're brainwashing over there.

[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:26.580]
And in the meantime they're brainwashing over here wishbone just think of this kid as a human

[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.120]
wishbone.

[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.720]
I told you that two weeks ago and I was uh as usual correct am I right?

[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.220]
Absolutely correct.

[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:33.280]
Thank you.

[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:40.000]
A human wishbone being pulled and yanked and twisted by a divergent interest most of

[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.360]
whom don't give a flying crap about him couldn't care less about alien.

[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.360]
Here's Fort Lauderdale hello.

[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.220]
Yeah Neil um I thought one of the guys was going to mention this morning on this day show

[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:57.940]
but uh when they have that attorney for alien that egg you got with uh the one with a schmata

[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.120]
honest yeah yeah yeah yeah one who never heard of a uh do you let Ray do yeah

[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:07.120]
but the real honest one you know um uh who got uh who got up there and said uh they had a

[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.860]
woman who went to Cuba who does Cuban studies who is I guess she's American citizen

[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:17.200]
he said there's a law on the book that stops local politicians from doing what that judge did

[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:22.220]
so if I and this wants them forced that they could steal from that boy back on the fourth day.

[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.200]
Yeah I don't know how a local court can uh yeah right

[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.140]
right that's it I mean a federal court which they you know they're going to try to go to federal

[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:35.120]
court but a local court judge is going to issue a ruling over to uh overrule the INS I'm sorry

[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.980]
I'm not buying it yeah and even they're not buying it really they they realize they're on thin ice

[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:45.360]
and my my big question is is this judge Cuban? No she's uh Puerto Rican. She's Puerto Rican

[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.020]
yeah. So if you're a teacher like Puerto Rican. I have to ask the question because all of the

[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:53.400]
sudden where was she a couple of weeks ago she just jumped up in the end and made this ruling on

[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.360]
her own mind. Didn't you didn't you didn't you see she had like a switch plate sitting next to

[01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:01.380]
where they're on the on the dius up there she has a switch plate. This is one thing I want to say is

[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:09.880]
that uh uh the only thing this is really going to do is make every every black Anglo-Gorean

[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:16.440]
patient and every other viadamian mentality in just like full cinema on the next election.

[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.180]
If they've got an election coming I want to see how they want to stand for that question

[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:24.380]
that they were saying on the screen. Okay well let's see if it happens man. Okay I'll go but I'm

[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:29.060]
in Broward like you. Okay see you. In fact I'm going to send in that thing I got that voter

[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:32.160]
registration card by Arnold Brock-Buy. I'm going to fill out and send it in this week just to

[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.040]
make sure I don't miss out because even though we can't vote in date there's still our people like

[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:41.480]
uh you know senators we've voting for you anti-Conny Mac right there you go

[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:48.300]
President Day little minor things like that. Only I've said it before it's interesting in this

[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.940]
country the politicians who affect our daily lives the most the local and state politicians

[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:57.140]
the least amount of interest is in and the president of course who's uh as this

[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.480]
and as can be and really doesn't affect our lives directly as linearly as much that's

[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.760]
where all the interest is because it's a big thing that's what father said he's got a big thing.

[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.620]
26th after 11 at 560 WQM. Kim Volkhafford talk sports. Oh right.

[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.980]
Use the club. Oh no. I can't even lift this thing and hurt my wrist.

[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.400]
Go to the gun. He's going to the gun. Let me try something.

[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.880]
Hey hey hey Mr. Bad guy. Drops the darn gun.

[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.400]
Thank you. The new series begins tonight on the world's most threatening cops.

[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.400]
Okay. It's 11 30 at 5 60 WQM. The Hank Goldberg show from Cool.

[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:55.400]
Am I right about that? It is too them confused about what it is. Cool city at two o'clock.

[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:58.820]
Big-side Boogshambi. I know I'm right about that at six o'clock.

[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:02.620]
Her cool basketball at Seen Hall. Wow. Anybody going to be listening to that?

[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.520]
Oh. Seven o'clock tonight at Kaplan after the game.

[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.080]
Here's a mobile in sunrise. Hello.

[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:13.120]
Neil. Yes sir. Uh two or three points are like to make them get your reaction to them.

[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:16.440]
Go right ahead. Uh first of all uh the mother died.

[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.560]
Doesn't the son belong or the father?

[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.900]
One would think so but there are extended waiting circumstances anyway.

[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.100]
Oh I mean this one. Well first of all let's let's slow down because there are many many people

[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.420]
who are here and in fact I heard them sing on King Liza.

[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.380]
Well a lot of us have relatives back in Cuba. Well my question will be why?

[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.300]
Do you know what I'm saying? Why? Why are they still back there?

[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:40.040]
Why aren't they here? Why would you abandon your relatives and come here?

[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.460]
You follow what I'm saying? Yeah I understand that. I just

[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:46.960]
I just I just so if that argument is legitimate that he needs to be with his father

[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.440]
then how come it's okay for a whole bunch of people to be so called exiles to be here

[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.820]
and yet they still have relatives over there and people would respond to that by saying well

[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:59.380]
if you can get out you get out. Well uh it is a young boy so let the father raise him

[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:03.540]
and then when he's 18 he wants to be a baby. Well the people with these these people's response

[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:06.860]
that that would be that the father will not be raising him. If he'd dela will be raising him.

[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.080]
But that's you know a little bit hysterical. Yeah right. I mean like I said it's a waste of time

[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.540]
to debate should he stay should he go back there you can make a great case for either one.

[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:22.800]
It's a waste of time and why how does that affect our lives? It doesn't. Right. So I just you know

[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.400]
the common sense is that the mother dies you should be with the father that's just my thinking.

[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:32.720]
Okay. Second point I want to make is uh we're talking the last two or three weeks about

[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:37.000]
everybody pointing the finger at Danny pointing the finger at Danny and Jimmy pointed at Danny

[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.820]
Jimmy Danny Jimmy Danny. Well I'll tell you what. Well we were at next on Saturday I said in

[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.980]
Georgia every so far I pointed the finger with Danny but wasn't the same Danny. That's today.

[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.400]
Look at that. He said I don't care. Not anyway. Danny showed what he could do in high fourth quarter.

[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.120]
He showed the power. Okay. I have a great day sir. Call the sports here. I don't want to talk

[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.560]
about it. I'm not interested. They beat a girls team. It's uh it's ridiculous this town. The so-called

[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.980]
sports fan and a so-called sports columnist like Eddie DePope who was writing just three four weeks ago.

[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:07.640]
Oh playoffs. Why even bother? Why even wasted time and now we got a shot. We got a shot.

[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.640]
They mean I'm going to tell you see I probably couldn't have beaten Piper high on Sunday. All right.

[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:18.720]
Oh yeah but we got to have hope. We have a quit living in a delusionary world okay especially

[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:25.100]
you nerds on that morning show. God. Especially number 80. Here's South Beach. Hello.

[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:30.780]
I knew. I didn't want to date your son. Okay. What was that? Hello. Is this a real voice?

[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:37.500]
Hello. Hello. I guess I cut him a shot into me like a phony voice didn't it?

[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.080]
Does it sound do you like a phony voice yet? 5670560.

[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:47.480]
560 on the AT&T wireless level. We'll live without it. Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.060]
Hey Neil. Yes. I got a Cuban fellow working for me. A great guy. I'm a Cuban fellow. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:58.200]
And he uh. Yeah. I got a Cuban fellow working for me. And he and and uh every time he's

[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:05.900]
hit a beard and one in in in the Cuba talk. Yeah. There's always a mob of half a million people

[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:10.640]
watching and I said to George how is it that all that he's so hated and yet there's so many people

[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.940]
watching his speeches and he told me because the local communist leader goes around all the shops

[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:22.760]
and tells them they got to be at this rally or else. Well that's that moment. That part of it is

[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.840]
true but what a lot of people here don't want to admit and it's very aggravating them and they're

[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.740]
afraid it's going to happen this kid here is that from the time that they I mean they do a great

[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:35.560]
job of brainwashing just like we do over here only even better. So the idea that most of those people

[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:40.340]
despise Castro and they can't wait to get rid of them. That isn't true. Right. That's not true. I

[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:47.860]
agree. Well what I was getting at is is this guy's girlfriend works at radio station 670WWE

[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:55.380]
and this guy WWFE radio FAY. Yeah. 670. Right. It's about 6 watts. Yeah. Right. And his girlfriend

[01:17:55.380 --> 01:18:00.600]
works here with a station manager when this thing was going on told everybody in a station let's

[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.560]
go. We're going down to the street and this girl she didn't want to go down there but you know

[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.640]
she ended up down there. So the same damn thing just you know in reverse. So in other words he

[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:14.160]
was a political exactly exactly but the culture has given us a lot of great things you know guy

[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.200]
of bearish shirts cocaine and fattening. Okay. No they did not give us cocaine. 567.0560.560

[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:25.740]
on the AT&T. I bet you the Spaniards had grabbers before the coupons. Am I right? Okay thank you.

[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:34.120]
Sure. Ask Emily Kay he'll tell you. Don't give you a look. 567.0560.560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:39.320]
But that hoarset me now we're talking. Isn't that what it's all about? Oh I'm sorry. You're not

[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.860]
afraid. I'm sorry about that. Hello. Hi, Mell. Yes. Yes. This is not a fake voice. I called

[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:49.040]
you early from my NEP. Okay. It sounded like Margaret to me. And I went a big kiss in here. One point

[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:56.260]
that no one like I said. How is it that my premonition is so good? Thanks a lot Margaret. Are you sure?

[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:06.480]
567.0560.560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's the mobile in D'Areal. Hello. Hello. NEO. Yes sir.

[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:14.520]
Point I don't know if anyone's brought up. If he were sent if he were allowed to stay

[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:20.240]
wouldn't that cost him type of international incident which the United States could be held for.

[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:24.160]
Well what incident with that? But you know cash there's always threatening he's going to do this.

[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:28.140]
He's going to have bigger demonstrations. You know what? Let him demonstrate. Who who gives a crap?

[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:33.420]
Are we impressed by that? No who cares? No no no no. I'm not referring to I'm not referring to

[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:39.500]
Cuba. I'm referring to the international community basically. Like who's going to be captured

[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:44.960]
about that? Well I mean you're not. The name me one country in the world that's going to be

[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.720]
interested in this. Okay but the point is that I know no no no no no no no. Okay it's not a name of a

[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:54.700]
country. Give me the name of one country in the world that's going to be interested in this dispute

[01:19:54.700 --> 01:20:01.740]
over immigration. Okay think about it and call me back okay I don't know where's that on the map

[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.840]
I don't know. That would be a good habit in Castella routine. Where's the I don't know on the map

[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:10.760]
I don't know. Right next to okay. Oh I'm for who's on first? What okay?

[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:19.740]
5 6 7 0 5 60. Oh man. Yeah like like Mr. Putin there in Russia that's going to be his first

[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:23.580]
act. No bomba we're going to drop bomba if you don't do the right thing by that kid. Is he going

[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:29.700]
to worry about that? No. No. He's to worried about what they're going to do with that old god damn

[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:59.680]
Yeltsin guy how they're going to keep wiping the snot off his the push. They keep

[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:12.540]
doing it. Oh great memory Ricky Martin Ricky. It's 1141 at 560 WQAM on a great Tuesday. Well I

[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:16.320]
got to go home this afternoon after my stress test I got every doctor yankin me in different

[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.620]
directions. I'm going to do my stress test for about two seconds by the way. See I we've had

[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:24.900]
problems in this building. We've had two people in this building who've had relatives draw a

[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.980]
die on the treadmill doing those stress tests because cardiologists with my good friend doctor

[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:33.340]
Dick happens to be a cardiologist. He's a good guy but they're always looking for your heart. You

[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:36.940]
know what I'm saying? They're always looking for a heart thing so they're big on stress test.

[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:42.300]
Oh keep going. Oh keep going. Thank you but I'll keep pulling it in the way. I'm not going to drop.

[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.220]
I'll do it for like about 30 seconds and that's it and then tomorrow of course it's

[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:51.500]
tonight after I get home after my stress test then I got a drink that good crap. What is it called?

[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:59.480]
Flora. Flora something. Oh God. It puts you on the floor or something soda. It's made by the

[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:06.400]
Brackdom people. Oh seriously what is the name of that begins with a D the brand name that's

[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.820]
all they make is like animal stuff. You know about when you have to go do for an exam what the

[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:14.840]
name of that thing? Oh it's you. Somebody will know. Can't believe I forgot that. Isn't that

[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.760]
something? What a crappy business. That's all they do is make Brackdom stuff.

[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:22.180]
But you got to drink that with your Gatorade so you have a little bit of electrolytes in the

[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:26.460]
sodium and potassium left in your body because it really claims you have to be busy. Don't be

[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:30.640]
calling me this afternoon and this early this evening. It's really real busy and then maybe I'll

[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.580]
watch that leaves Bruins game in a way the leaves are plainly I'll be really busy.

[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:39.820]
So they're and then they got to get up tomorrow morning and do the same damn stuff again drink the

[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:46.080]
rest of that stuff and then go do all that stuff. Let them put the tube down my throat enough my

[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:51.020]
Brackdom and see if they see anything in there. See anything? No. No. It's like when Greg

[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:55.840]
Reed went for the brains game. They see anything? No. Here's a mobile and Miami Beach. Hello. Yeah,

[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:01.840]
hi Neil. Great show. Yes it is. Great show. This is Mike. Yes Mike. They had a judge rule that if

[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:09.480]
the kid went back to Cuba he could put in physical emotional and mental abusive situation.

[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.640]
But nobody brought up the point about this mother putting this kid on a wiki boat. Uh-huh.

[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:18.600]
Across the ocean. Right. Both thinking what kind of abuse is that on the mother? Yeah,

[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:22.380]
what kind of irresponsible bitch was he that I would certainly agree with that. Exactly. And the other

[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:26.740]
the other people on the other side of the coin would say oh but look how desperate that they

[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:31.080]
were willing to risk their lives for freedom and yadda yadda yadda. See that is exactly what they would say.

[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.180]
There's more but many money that would risk a 60-year-old kid's life on a leaky boat. I have to

[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:38.440]
wonder what kind of parents she was. You know this woman was willing to risk her life. I do believe

[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:43.240]
that but if I have a child and I'm a mother or a father the word you're responsible. I'm taking

[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.780]
my dog with me. Yeah. You understand what I'm saying? If I move to the park and I'm taking my

[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:52.560]
dog with me and that's the way it is. I would take my little dog with me. I hopefully leave him behind.

[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:56.860]
Anyway the other thing is I can't understand why these Cubans are fighting a revolution over here

[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.060]
in the street United States and they don't take it back to Cuba and fight this revolution.

[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:13.220]
Oh Shane have a great day. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a lady

[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:19.620]
it's an abomination the whole thing. I sit up at night pulling my hair out trying to figure out

[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:25.140]
like what do you do in a situation like this. The only thing I think this family is interested in

[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:30.200]
is the money for this little boy. They'll be movie rights they'll be but there's free school

[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:37.000]
there's everything. There's free schools. Oh school. Oh school like you said. Somebody's going to

[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.780]
help make a movie and also their money and it's been about giving him citizenship.

[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:49.720]
So we've got people that come here the right way way go to school they're proud to learn to

[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:55.500]
become an American. Yeah. They have to wait for citizenship. I really am set up. I'm set up

[01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:01.660]
with the way they proud the streets think the man's right it's it's an abomination. Yeah.

[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:06.880]
What do you think? I think I yeah I just would like to wait up to bar morning and it's all

[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.280]
over. I would like it to be. It's like this intestinal crap I've been fighting for the last

[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:16.980]
week. I know I heard I was trying to think of the medicine that's just taking to I had the test.

[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:24.080]
Is it? Oh now tell me how bad it was. Well truthfully honest they they said Twilight and that

[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.160]
they were going to knock you out Twilight and I looked at the doctor I said do something I swear

[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.820]
to you. I went to sleep I woke up I never knew they were near me. Oh right. I swear to you.

[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.320]
Great. See because they're going to knock me up pretty good because they're going to go

[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:40.120]
away. I left one end and they went down the other meal. You did both you did the end

[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:44.360]
doctor. I did all the same. Oh right. Great. Well that's what they do with me. They're

[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:48.900]
turning me around into going in both ends. That's it. I hope I hope for the different tube by the way.

[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.560]
Pardoning? I say I hope for the different camera. Oh well my husband said the same thing

[01:25:53.560 --> 01:26:01.760]
that they do the one end of it but the tube. Oh. Oh. I'm not I'm sleeping but I don't know

[01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:08.820]
have a great day. Thanks for the reassurance. Okay. Oh it's not with indeed it's with an F it's

[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:13.720]
called I should have asked here I can't do the name of the as soon as I say it you would know it okay.

[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:22.140]

[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.420]
the uh what trim out house downtown and they had one of those false alarms in hotel which is always

[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:29.880]
fun and of course you got to run outside I think it was like in the time of the year when it wasn't

[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:35.380]
to warm up there which is anytime except two weeks in Boston and when we went outside there was

[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:39.340]
a fire truck in front which showed up then good this unlike here when we had our false alarm to

[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:42.440]
the fire truck show up and it was about a block and a half a wall no there too busy playing

[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:48.000]
pinocled on there or playing with each other or sliding up and down degrees pole but anyway I

[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:56.020]
remember very a very a very a vividly he was vandent and I was vivid walking out the front

[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:59.560]
through where the trim out house there on trim on street in Boston and I looked out there and I saw

[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:06.000]

[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.640]

[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:54.400]
she would never answer him her first uh I am wants to say she understood the feelings of the

[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:59.840]

to take away her january no blow up the all must be

[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.260]
but it's not something about separation of powers i mean these politicians to

[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:07.120]
me inside it

[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.940]
as much of these people down there as as the situation itself

[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:14.240]
yet with the media with the it let me say it again for six seven and ten

[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.180]
right for six seven and ten keeps saying it over and over again

[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.680]
if they wouldn't have made such a big to miss out of it there would have been

[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.380]

down here i mean it's no wonder we have a problem i think i think that

[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:49.420]

[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:12.060]
south florida panders to the entire Latin community what we're going to know why do you say the entire

[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:16.560]
Latin community do you really believe that non-cuban latins care about alien or

[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:20.720]
media guns out whatever's name is uh no no that that's not what i was referring to

[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.220]
you think port are weekends and the caragwins and people from all of the public in a

[01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:27.780]
conno there's another chance uh do you think that they're all i embroiled in this and that they

[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:31.540]
were out there in the street that of course not they couldn't get to do this exactly they

[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:34.680]
have to get one what really incensed they couldn't even give a little

[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:38.740]
right what really incensed me the other day is when um that uh

[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:44.840]
w n d a team named their team the souls yeah which was you know uh

[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:49.020]
that's what i remember you asked you seriously though is that the kind of thing that you really

[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:53.480]
worry about that at all but i first of all a w n b a team here is as laughable as

[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:57.740]
having somebody playing partizian your backyard in the middle of a snowstorm in the Toronto you know

[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:01.100]
i mean what what differences are made absolutely it's just it's just more of the same crap

[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:04.700]
they're desperate don't you understand that they're desperate and of course you know as well as

[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:08.180]
i do we're looking at the marlins and every other sports franchises this town that's attempted

[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:13.200]
to pander to his panics they've all gone the same way of the wind okay i'm sorry i'm surprised

[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.740]
the only thing that's still going strung are the highly a cock bites i'm just surprised

[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:21.460]
they didn't go all the way and just named the team the aliens oh that's a good idea they'd

[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:24.440]
have probably gotten at least two they'll sit two three hundred people out there absolutely have

[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:31.380]
a great day back to it five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:37.080]
come on let's hear about the uh fleet enemies let's hear about colonoscopy let's hear about all

[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.880]
these people out there sick with the same way see one thing about you doctors out there they're

[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:46.200]
a little bit slow something new comes along and they like uh well uh where it's kind of unusual

[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:50.120]
for something to linger that long even in my reading you know i disease books which is a lot of fun

[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.400]
to sit around read disease books because no matter which disease you're reading about oh yeah that

[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:59.880]
sounds like me i got that but it says a lot of viral infections can last two to six weeks commonly

[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:06.320]
i'm only today beginning my uh this is three weeks this is the end of the turd today you turd right

[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:13.520]
but you're talking to doctors and then well uh we don't know and of course when you have all

[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.500]
of this you're hoping that that's all it is because obviously once they start looking inside you don't

[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:24.140]
want any like forty pound rocks inside you rolling around here's a lady in high alia hello

[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:30.560]
and you yes man yeah uh first of all i want to wish you well what you can't i've had it done

[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:35.840]
and unfortunately for me the doctor chose to bring in a bunch of students who were like 20 years old

[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.640]
what the hell is that like five young guys and oh the doctor brings in five young guys from

[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.720]
my procedure i'll say oh right yeah we didn't work for me oh well what do you mean they did the

[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.600]
procedure yeah they did they did the colonoscopy with no they didn't see how they did yeah we

[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.720]
could they do that it was very embarrassing i didn't know they were going to do that but did it come

[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.660]
out all right so to speak well the end the end so to speak in the end yeah yeah uh so you had five

[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:07.320]
young 20 year old guys looking inside your rectum wow rolling away and uh oh my god yeah

[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:12.220]
so yeah i'm getting excited just thinking about it okay good for you maybe Daniel be there

[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:18.140]
and Jimmy i just have a couple comments okay if you can bear with me go ahead the first one is that

[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:23.580]
this judge yeah which hearing this illian thing is under investigation by the state of attorney's

[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.960]
office should not have been in family court to begin with she was transferred because she's under

[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:34.680]
investigation for campaign finance fraud so you know she didn't belong there and then another man

[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:40.240]
put it like i was going to put it the mother that put that child on the boat yeah she's the one

[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:44.440]
who put the child in imminent danger right you know well we can't we can't do much with her because

[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:49.720]
she sleeps in the fishes now yeah but you know the guy i don't know did you read it i'm thanks

[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:54.660]
getting when when they brought this kid in that supposedly the man she was either married to her

[01:35:54.660 --> 01:36:00.020]
with was the one to organize the whole trip no yeah well i was near thanks even thank god i was

[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:04.480]
so far away okay well the article i was in a real country with living and breathing people oh gosh

[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.780]

[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:14.400]
don't know the result of the interwet this stepfather was the one who organized the trip and was

[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:20.520]
charging people thousands of dollars for this trip and if you survive he probably be on trial

[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.880]
come on the other one he was basically another one of these illegal smugglers jobs it goes on all

[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:29.700]
that and the other woman who left her child behind so she's glad she did it you know miss Horta

[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:34.400]
right the other one who survived she was really glad that she left the child so if anybody put

[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:39.060]
this child in imminent danger it was her and and they're making her look like some kind of a martyr

[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:44.380]
she sacrificed her life for his freedom now she wanted to stand by her man you know it's what it

[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:48.860]

pound five sixty on the eighteen t wireless line as we tried desperately

[01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:14.950]
to extricate ourselves from this

[01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.610]
crap

[01:48:18.670 --> 01:48:20.270]
here's hollywood hello

[01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:21.270]
no yes sir

[01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:24.290]
how you doing okay what do i start right at the beginning

[01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:28.550]
okay i'm watching that the alien thing last week in the news the news guys are

[01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:32.150]
upon the tower from the from the truck and they say

[01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:35.890]
we're only here because the public wants us here

[01:48:35.890 --> 01:48:39.150]
nobody did not we didn't want them there i almost fell out of my head there

[01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:41.830]
because they were they didn't want to miss anything because they were

[01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:45.430]
explored every uh... situation every device a bunch of crap every tragic

[01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:49.330]
situation that comes along that it was exploited you're right and uh... secondly

[01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:54.510]
had a sigmoid on to be done about four weeks ago that's uh...

[01:48:54.510 --> 01:48:55.830]
uncomfortable man yeah

[01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:58.030]
let me tell you something you put that thing up there

[01:48:58.030 --> 01:49:01.570]
because i'm just gonna go a little bit deeper i'm gonna go around the corner

[01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:05.650]
man i thought i was gonna come out of my skin yeah

[01:49:05.650 --> 01:49:07.010]
that was the most

[01:49:07.670 --> 01:49:09.470]
uh... that pain is unbelievable

[01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:11.390]
that's because you're not sedated

[01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:13.770]
now yeah you're right you're wide awake

[01:49:13.770 --> 01:49:16.690]
my friend you know the guy friend of mine had the uh... well you're gonna get

[01:49:16.690 --> 01:49:18.530]
done he said the cake won't you know you give it a little

[01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:21.390]
sedative you're relaxed he said it's a cake walk

[01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:26.250]
the only one of the really good things about getting all this stuff done

[01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:28.830]
yeah the medications cheap the cost you like three dollars

[01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:33.230]
you get that bottle of uh... sodium whatever i got that already i got a

[01:49:33.230 --> 01:49:35.990]
waiting for this afternoon all right for you

[01:49:36.730 --> 01:49:41.130]
that that that's that's just uh... part of life it's uh... gods mysterious plan

[01:49:41.130 --> 01:49:44.630]
well that bottle was like what a dollar fifty two ninety nine

[01:49:44.630 --> 01:49:47.870]
right then you get the all green then you get two to fleece right those are uh...

[01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:49.190]
i don't have to i don't have to do that

[01:49:49.190 --> 01:49:51.510]
how you know no that was the most that was the fun part

[01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:53.870]
but then know that see that's only for the signal and asking for

[01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:58.610]
oh really no no that that's uh... that's child's play this stuff really just

[01:49:58.610 --> 01:50:02.150]
like an h-bond you did you won't have anything inside you when you get done with

[01:50:02.150 --> 01:50:04.330]
including your organs fall out

[01:50:04.330 --> 01:50:08.830]
you got a drink the green stuff first right now you have to mix this with gatorade

[01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:12.110]
or diet soda that's the only thing but then there's nothing else after that

[01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:14.310]
not yet no there's something after that

[01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:18.530]
so we're not required for the evening another thing i thought i would tell you

[01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:23.370]
that you probably think was comical my uh... my wife was out of town when all this got

[01:50:23.370 --> 01:50:28.270]
done so uh... you know you have to give yourself the uh... the fleet you know if

[01:50:28.270 --> 01:50:32.770]
no one else is around so uh... there i am laying on my bathroom floor

[01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:37.070]

[01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:53.950]

[01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:59.530]
oh god no please don't five six seven oh five sixty in pound five sixty on the

[01:50:59.530 --> 01:51:01.330]
eighteen t wireless line

[01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:06.850]
here's my amie hello hi Neil yes sir you know i hope everything goes very

[01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:11.190]
well and very smooth with the medical situation no problem i got a question

[01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:16.910]
i hope so we'll see and if not case a rosser i you know it'll turn out just fine

[01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:21.710]
i got a question for you what kind of a message do you think the president

[01:51:21.710 --> 01:51:23.810]
spending these disruptors

[01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:29.130]
when i'm doing what when he rewards people who also disrupted the peace with

[01:51:29.130 --> 01:51:32.830]
bombs and terrorism with the uh... get out of jail card like he did with the

[01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:34.730]
in prison portarecon territory yeah

[01:51:34.730 --> 01:51:38.970]
and i think the message is you get a year away when you react with violence in

[01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:43.010]
uh... disruption how is he how is he uh... rewarding the people who are uh...

[01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:46.010]
disrupting the community here what he done uh... on their behalf nothing

[01:51:46.610 --> 01:51:51.010]
nothing no hopefully he won't join the uh... pissing contest and sign something

[01:51:51.010 --> 01:51:54.890]
that's gonna let all these people who were arrested out of jail i'd be really

[01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:57.430]
surprised if he did that because first of all you gotta understand he's never

[01:51:57.430 --> 01:52:00.910]
gonna run from political office again so he's got nothing to gain by it he you know

[01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:04.650]
it's much better for him to stay on the sideline and he's got nothing to gain

[01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:08.810]
i agree but i still think it's a bad and of course there's vice president of

[01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:12.330]
courses running in ram running desperately who of course is in their socket around

[01:52:12.330 --> 01:52:17.070]
heavy duty now yeah but it's a bad message because people who did the same thing at

[01:52:17.070 --> 01:52:22.030]
an even worse level are uh... let out of jail just because uh... he feels like uh...

[01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:25.490]
yeah but you're forgetting they had to get out of jail car free card you're forgetting that

[01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:29.030]
with a free card that was given to them by the president get out of jail card right

[01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:33.590]
so that that that tells you disruptors uh... works for them works for us let's get

[01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:37.690]
roudy let's do something that's gonna uh... long before he ever let any a

[01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:41.150]
port of a can't ever stop this is the going on here for a hundred years for forty

[01:52:41.150 --> 01:52:42.050]
anyway have a great day

[01:52:42.630 --> 01:52:43.970]
going on since the beginning of the

[01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:44.690]
uh...

[01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:51.030]
of time five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight tn t wireless

[01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:54.610]
line in addition to which the president doesn't make these decisions we have

[01:52:54.610 --> 01:52:58.370]
laws we got the rns we got the guy to him federal courts and that's it

[01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:02.990]
but of course uh... are you just for all of those things out because those

[01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:06.690]
thing actually have to do with the u.s. government and this date county of

[01:53:06.690 --> 01:53:09.110]
eighteen to a u.s. government not last time i checked

[01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:15.210]
here's a lady in my army hello hello new yes ma'am yes uh... i'm a cuban american

[01:53:15.210 --> 01:53:20.730]
and of course i'm a family oriented person and the boy should be with his father okay

[01:53:20.730 --> 01:53:26.270]
then uh... that's this is my opinion those people that were protesting they don't

[01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:30.170]
represent the majority of the cuban community and i think that's

[01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:35.150]
fact that to the president to be represented to everybody but they don't

[01:53:35.150 --> 01:53:39.730]
those people don't represent anybody here they were only groups of people they

[01:53:39.730 --> 01:53:43.090]
expected the one million cubans to come out they didn't come out

[01:53:43.630 --> 01:53:46.570]
so they use those to do all the noise

[01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:52.210]
and i think that you have picked them to jail before they did they waited too long

[01:53:52.770 --> 01:53:56.430]
and now they're sending the people over to the civil liberties union

[01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:58.930]
to fight complaints against the city

[01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:03.290]
because the federal cost is a lot more because then the city's gonna have to

[01:54:03.290 --> 01:54:06.290]
defend against those that are one of the one of costing us millions of dollars for

[01:54:06.290 --> 01:54:10.590]
this now let me tell you because you don't know these because this they would they

[01:54:10.590 --> 01:54:15.430]
did a lot of you know things like we can't be on the spanish tv and guess who gave

[01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:19.730]
it again that poppy that is coming on tv every day now

[01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:23.570]
the poppy yeah who gave it to him the sbalard

[01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:28.250]
the link in the sbalard rhymes with oh man i wonder how many

[01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:34.070]
i can't stand him no he ought to be local with Jose basulto the two of them

[01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:36.050]
go and be able to play and shoot each other in the foot

[01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:38.750]
those two are worse and costal they're exactly

[01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:45.630]
do me well thank you for the opportunity okay bye bye bye i asked to

[01:54:45.630 --> 01:54:50.250]
if you don't have any five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the

[01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:54.150]
AT&T wireless line as we continue digesting this and chewing on it and

[01:54:54.150 --> 01:54:55.570]
spitting it out and like uh

[01:54:56.230 --> 01:55:00.590]
like that too although we have had a lot of good breakfast oh

[01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:04.070]
mock today a lot of people out there have had these tests and had those

[01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:06.650]
fleet animals in that fleet possible soda and uh

[01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:09.250]
a lot of you know in their lives

[01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:14.810]
here's four Myers hello hey Neil how you doing okay

[01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:19.890]
all right i say if alien once your alien step once it backs okay

[01:55:19.890 --> 01:55:22.530]
you should pet a lot about half way and we'll drop them off

[01:55:24.190 --> 01:55:27.550]
fine that was from four Myers i just mentioned again five six seven oh five

[01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:31.870]
sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line eight seven seven seven eight five

[01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:34.870]
sixty three forty five on our world line infamous line

[01:55:35.370 --> 01:55:38.670]
eight seven seven seven eight five sixty three forty five we get one more

[01:55:38.670 --> 01:55:40.350]
call like that i might just not come in tomorrow

[01:55:41.610 --> 01:55:45.330]
of course am i coming in tomorrow anyway no i'm going to be busy i'm going to be

[01:55:45.330 --> 01:55:49.230]
busy see i i find it the very bizarre about the woman calling in before about the

[01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:51.430]
five twenty-year-old guys sticking the tube in her

[01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:52.650]
recto when i call anoscopy

[01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:58.890]
from what what although i do realize that they do bring medical students in

[01:55:58.890 --> 01:56:02.670]
to observe and to do procedures but don't they do that like in uh

[01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:05.710]
schlepper hospitals they don't do that like in a real place do they oh yeah

[01:56:05.710 --> 01:56:08.250]
they do it doesn't matter if i think the real or the more likely it is

[01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:13.410]
the better hospitals are the teaching hospitals yeah so it increases your likelihood of having

[01:56:13.410 --> 01:56:18.730]
having a a student body probing it well then i'm probably i'll be a little bit more

[01:56:18.730 --> 01:56:22.330]
wide awake i would think that and of course i better check back there and see just exactly

[01:56:22.330 --> 01:56:28.250]
what's going on five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight because the answer is

[01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:32.050]
no i don't care what you look like pal no they don't have a way not for this kid

[01:56:33.010 --> 01:56:38.150]
here's a mobile in Miami hello Neil yes sir give me the perfect lady and i just wanted to give you

[01:56:38.150 --> 01:56:42.770]
a perspective from the other side of the sigmoids scope from the inside from the other side

[01:56:42.770 --> 01:56:47.530]
many moons ago as a medsted and i had the pleasure of being on the other end of that scope and it's

[01:56:47.530 --> 01:56:52.830]
no pleasure no pleasure from that side either yeah i'm sure what we would do is uh

[01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:56.750]
these are the women didn't we didn't have any problem with which yet let maybe a homophobic

[01:56:56.750 --> 01:57:01.530]
public guy in there and uh usually cracking jokes if there was sarcastic we would just put a little

[01:57:01.530 --> 01:57:07.570]
less k y in the scope and let him have a dry so you want to be careful you want to be careful

[01:57:07.570 --> 01:57:12.270]
that office tomorrow okay the standard joke was uh we would tell the patient we were almost

[01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:16.070]
about and we kind of moved the scope so it would jab on though we would tell the patient we were

[01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:23.930]
just looking for our wedding ring okay how good was it thanks oh my god i think i'm going to bring

[01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:29.510]
a good case you know i think maybe uh chuck testons got a good point five six seven oh five

[01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:36.250]
sixty pound five sixty on the ht and t wireless line did it remember why i asked what kind of a person

[01:57:36.850 --> 01:57:41.090]
what kind of a human being wants to be a proctologist for example

[01:57:42.450 --> 01:57:47.430]
where all you do is looking people's rectums you know well what what what is that all about

[01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:52.010]
there's money in that somebody with an aesthetic or there is big money in it and then of course

[01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:57.210]
they can always sell you those magnetic uh things for your feet i thought i want to mention names

[01:57:57.210 --> 01:58:03.010]
on the arrow i probably should have at the time yeah there's some proctologist offices in this

[01:58:03.010 --> 01:58:06.790]
down probably plenty of medical offices in this time you walk in the open the door and you hear

[01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:12.870]
these strange quacking sounds why you have to do is quack the door here's a mobile and candle hello

[01:58:13.670 --> 01:58:19.110]
i want to lay your fears about your procedure when did you find out you had to get your head to

[01:58:19.110 --> 01:58:23.930]
have this oh yesterday oh really because i didn't hear the beginning of the show i've had a colon

[01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:28.690]
ask to be each of the last two august yeah something to look forward to i guess in the calendar

[01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:33.270]
what i said it's something to look forward to on that calendar absolutely i can't wait

[01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:40.850]
i saw the worst part of the entire thing by far is drinking that fast low soda oh that's

[01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:45.910]
today but at least i'll be at home it's i'm not talking about the result of this soda i'm talking

[01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:52.250]
about the consumption of this soda oh it is well beyond your wildest imagination but the

[01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:57.910]
the procedure i woke up they they put something in the ivy i went to sleep i woke up 45 minutes

[01:58:57.910 --> 01:59:04.430]
later and 45 minutes later i was on my feet going home i never had the slightest cramp or the

[01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:10.990]
slightest twinge of pain in either one yeah not one so as far as pain goes you don't have to worry

[01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:22.230]
so i guess this afternoon after i drink that stuff will be the cramps without the am huh you'll get

[01:59:22.230 --> 01:59:28.570]
i asked you to try to get in that jimmy and daddy number two that that that George

[01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:33.490]
played that game excellent time no problem that was fantastic okay you got it all right

[01:59:33.490 --> 01:59:40.110]
thanks to the good news okay i'll see you on far out there's a guy with some serious

[01:59:40.110 --> 01:59:45.470]
experience with his rectum what sounds like five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[01:59:46.370 --> 01:59:50.770]
well you know something they get very upset and washin in there about this anal limb and that's

[01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:56.290]
part of life you know that's part of life i mean i'm not the one who invented this the guy that

[01:59:56.290 --> 02:00:00.270]
you people are always hacking a trantic about he's the one who invented this anatomy of yours

[02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:05.290]
not nature although last time i checked the dog has got a rectum and a cat rectum and a monkey

[02:00:05.290 --> 02:00:10.890]
rectum anybody else too yeah even a even a hook war i guess if you look close enough has probably

[02:00:10.890 --> 02:00:19.890]
got a rectum somewhere because the world is full of crap it's got to go somewhere here's four

[02:00:19.890 --> 02:00:23.450]
tails of these anal adventures that's there in the s out of me i had a uh

[02:00:23.890 --> 02:00:30.610]
barium endama which was uh an experience all right and i'm looking forward to the flexible

[02:00:30.610 --> 02:00:35.910]
sigway doskype in uh two and a half weeks and then next month that's not too much fun off there

[02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:39.470]
that's uh a little lami it's not the worst thing you'll ever do but it's a little uncomfortable

[02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:44.430]
now it's not as bad as the barium endama i felt uh did you have one of those

[02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:49.770]
yeah many years ago where they put the the thing in your in your button and then they blow

[02:00:49.770 --> 02:00:55.610]
the thing up and then uh they they hold the bag up and uh it goes you have two quartz oh no i

[02:00:55.610 --> 02:01:01.910]
never had that two quartz oh however much it left out like two quartz i don't know my colon was

[02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:07.210]
filled up i was watching the scope as they took the clip off and the liquid went in and i felt

[02:01:07.210 --> 02:01:12.410]
like i was going to explode and then i started cramping and i thought i was exploding and they were

[02:01:12.410 --> 02:01:19.750]
just they just kept on rolling me around looking in the skull for taking x-rays probably having a

[02:01:19.750 --> 02:01:25.670]
i hope the flexible sigway doskype is not as bad as as that no i won't be as bad as that not

[02:01:25.670 --> 02:01:30.170]
not like i said not something to look forward to but uh you'll go over as long as i don't feel like

[02:01:30.170 --> 02:01:35.730]
i'm gonna explode no so that's that's that's good and then just take a gun take a loaded gun

[02:01:35.730 --> 02:01:39.450]
just to be sure you know let's see if that's okay it just hold it up in the you know

on there like two or three hundred here's Miami hello hello Neil yes sir how are you doing today

[02:06:07.090 --> 02:06:12.410]
so okay i just have three quick things i wanted to say um in regards to a giveaway he calls you

[02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:17.430]
about 20 minutes ago saying how the people that are protesting is just a small fraction of the

[02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:23.510]
Cuban population in Miami yeah i agree with that 100 percent i hope that does not you know reflect

[02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:26.730]
pad on the rest of us that we're not pulling well let me say it again in case you missed

[02:06:26.730 --> 02:06:32.550]
it earlier channel 10 and Michael putt the Sunday morning they had a pool and uh 74 percent of

[02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:37.690]
the general community was opposed to the slowdowns and the uh the civil disobedience and 68 percent

[02:06:37.690 --> 02:06:42.530]
of the Hispanic community agreed so like overwhelmingly almost everybody agrees to the same viewpoint

[02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:49.390]
that's a crap um number two um my girlfriend my mother has a sister who lives in the

[02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:55.590]
town where they were protesting in Cuba yeah well she went to the rally but she went ahead and she

[02:06:55.590 --> 02:07:01.130]
said that they were um to go to the rally of course the government told them to go and the the

[02:07:01.130 --> 02:07:06.530]
government also gave everyone that went to the rally a free t-shirt with aliens faith on it right

[02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:14.910]
you get sardines oranges crackers wow so that's something that you know to think about i'm going

[02:07:14.910 --> 02:07:18.110]
to the next one here i thought all of the party people were at nixon sir they must have been

[02:07:18.110 --> 02:07:23.570]
some of them down there too i guess so and the third thing um some people have been saying that

[02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:29.490]
the Cubans are favored more than the Haitians as far as people coming into the us yeah and that

[02:07:29.490 --> 02:07:34.950]
might be so but i also want to throw out there to all the listeners the fact that um the united

[02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:41.290]
states they go into Haiti over through whoever was there put there with the Haitian people wanted

[02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:47.850]
and um nothing worked out on the contrary um the us has not done that with Cuba i think it would

[02:07:47.850 --> 02:07:53.170]
be fair if the us could do that um and that's why i just want that for people to listen in here and

[02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:58.290]
okay i'd about good luck you pound don't hold your breath five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[02:07:58.290 --> 02:08:02.750]
sixty on the AT&T wireless line i thought it was pretty uh i'm for George to say last Thursday that

[02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:05.970]
the reason that they're not letting the Haitians in is because the Cubans smell better i thought

[02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:11.610]
that was very poor taste pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line although he may have a point

[02:08:11.610 --> 02:08:16.630]
here's a mobile in Miami hello and no how you doing okay sir i have a

[02:08:17.090 --> 02:08:21.470]

Uh-huh 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:13:32.590 --> 02:13:34.150]
Here's a mobile in bokeh. Hello

[02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:40.290]
Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey about the colonoscopy. Don't get it worked out ahead of 10 about a year ago

[02:13:40.290 --> 02:13:42.830]
Why did everybody think I'm all worked up about it?

[02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:47.510]
I know you know what the worst part about it for me was the day before when everybody was telling me how bad it was

[02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:51.470]
Yeah, and you get there and I was out of freaking out and it's really really nothing. Yeah

[02:13:52.410 --> 02:13:55.430]
Yeah, you go to sleep. I give you the demo whatever it is

[02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:58.230]
Next thing you know you wake up on a bed. I don't know what happened

[02:13:58.230 --> 02:14:02.110]
But right in no pain you don't know what was in there, but at least it don't know what's in there

[02:14:02.110 --> 02:14:06.890]
But it wasn't that and that's fluid that they give you the drink today before that's pretty nasty

[02:14:06.890 --> 02:14:12.330]
But it's I mean, you know, it's just a little unpleasant and you know, it'll make you smit. Yeah, that's yeah

[02:14:12.330 --> 02:14:17.470]
And besides that we and you shared for a certain time the same pathologist

[02:14:18.990 --> 02:14:21.150]
I'm talking about you the mag at chance

[02:14:21.150 --> 02:14:23.590]
Yeah, you see they're pretty good jar on me and in the back

[02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:28.830]
But I end up saying 50 bucks and now I have two magnets that hold up notes on our refrigerator

[02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:35.770]
And that's a very very easy good guy. I mean, you can push him on me anything

[02:14:35.770 --> 02:14:40.310]
He just talking about him. I happen to have this pain on my hip and he goes shut these on and see what happens

[02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:43.290]
And I say okay, so I paid for them and obviously they had truly nothing

[02:14:43.290 --> 02:14:47.370]
Yeah, you know, if they didn't make it worse like it's like like like it happened to you, but

[02:14:47.370 --> 02:14:52.690]
The arm are fidgeting now for the expense of a note holder on our refrigerator. Okay

[02:14:52.690 --> 02:15:01.530]
That better you than me have a rate they've taken that's a great magnet if anybody out there want no five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[02:15:01.530 --> 02:15:06.950]
Oh, do we dare take another call from Fort Myers? Hello? Hey

[02:15:07.810 --> 02:15:14.490]
Yes, sir. Yes, I am. Hey, how you doing? Okay? I got two questions or one question one statement

[02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:20.870]
The legal regum of ramifications if this kid was to get killed or get hurt seriously

[02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:26.950]
Would his dad be able to sue and would he be able to draw social security?

[02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:32.010]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line the out of town life

[02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:36.150]
They must be really bored in four Myers today man. That a lot of spare time on their hands

[02:15:36.630 --> 02:15:38.890]
We're about some real bad predicaments

[02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:46.030]
877 7 8 5 6 3 4 5. I'm just worried about the Keith and Derek Brewer right now myself and where can they be found?

[02:15:46.690 --> 02:15:48.110]
Here's a lady in high a Leah hello

[02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:53.130]
Yes, Neil. Yes, ma'am. Okay. I wanted to make a comment on the alien

[02:15:54.070 --> 02:15:57.430]
subject see okay the Haitian saying that

[02:15:57.990 --> 02:16:02.270]
They didn't see any Cubans protesting the other day when they sent that boatload of

[02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:07.290]
Haitians back to Haiti. Yeah, I don't see any Haitians protesting in the Cuban protest fever

[02:16:07.290 --> 02:16:11.830]
They should get off well up there and protest themselves. They were out there protesting man

[02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:16.210]
Well, then they better just don't come blame it on the Cubans just because they're out

[02:16:16.210 --> 02:16:21.630]
Oh, see but the difference being the Haitians weren't blocking the roads and slowing down traffic and disrupting the community and they never do that

[02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:24.450]
They were out there demonstrating peacefully

[02:16:24.450 --> 02:16:31.010]
Well, yeah, but I think that just by getting the police out there that kind of like a hike stuff the crowd even more

[02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:33.070]
Well, what does that mean? Hipes up the crowd?

[02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:38.090]
What are they just supposed to let them do just to go out there and block off traffic all day the police did a hell of a job man

[02:16:38.090 --> 02:16:41.890]
It hipes up the crowd. Yeah, let's blame the police. Let's blame everybody

[02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:47.390]
But the assholes who were out there slowing down traffic and blocking everybody and disrupting everybody's else's life

[02:16:47.390 --> 02:16:51.790]
The answer is no no man. No, my heart asked Cuban lady the answer is no

[02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:54.870]
on freaking acceptable and

[02:16:55.870 --> 02:17:02.670]
There is any responsible underline responsible person in this community who will say anything different responsible

[02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:08.530]
We're not talking about Jose basulto. We're not talking about a professional agitators or rabble rouses or Lincoln

[02:17:08.530 --> 02:17:14.970]
The S. B. L. or any other goddamn exploitative politicians. We're talking about responsible people which there may be a few of us

[02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:21.530]
Including those two great editorials in the Sun Central from Saturday and again this morning, which I read the early on the show

[02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:23.270]

[02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:31.550]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line and there were a few Cuban politicians to make it look good

[02:17:31.550 --> 02:17:35.910]

[02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:41.130]
Ballard was out there in a couple of other people say I say we never did feel afraid to aim but in the meantime, let's get back to the alien

[02:17:43.490 --> 02:17:46.210]
Oh my god now. What is this man doing on this line? Hello?

[02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:52.510]
First of all, I don't feel better man. Yeah, I don't feel like bad today to be honest with you

[02:17:53.390 --> 02:17:56.230]
If this thing has been the every other day kind of an illness

[02:17:56.670 --> 02:18:01.350]
I'm not talking about you. I said that rich feel better. Oh fat rich. Yeah

[02:18:01.850 --> 02:18:06.090]
Like he's listening now. I don't think he's listening. No, you don't think so. No, I think he is

[02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:09.290]
He's better. He's doing magic tricks for the nerves. He's an intensive care

[02:18:09.970 --> 02:18:13.710]
Is he? Yeah, or he was last night to put a stand in you had to

[02:18:15.210 --> 02:18:21.290]
That's intensive care. I'm surprised. He had two angioplasty and they're fun. Oh, okay. Okay

[02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:23.890]
Anyway, I don't know if you remember I used to sell

Scopes for about two years. Yeah, you were you were a real rectum expert. Yeah, I remember that and let me tell you what there is

[02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:31.990]
Always said you were a little anal

[02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:34.830]
There is nothing worse than a synoscopy

[02:18:35.310 --> 02:18:36.810]
Have you ever had that done? No

[02:18:37.410 --> 02:18:40.750]

Oh, and those job

[02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:47.650]
No, no jobs for this kid. What are they? What are they? What are they looking for with that?

[02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:53.790]
Second for blockage and the sinus any kind of infections anything where maybe coke is blown out of

[02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:57.070]
Sinus cabbie anyway, I demoed it in the doctor's office

[02:18:57.070 --> 02:19:00.330]
Did me up against the door and shove four feet of it up my nose

[02:19:02.010 --> 02:19:06.490]
Yeah, you're probably looking for the orange rinds. I've got a little hint for you tomorrow a little trick

[02:19:06.490 --> 02:19:09.010]
Okay, and now this is really fine would

[02:19:11.250 --> 02:19:16.410]
This is purely scientific if you're gonna if you're gonna be awake for the procedure

[02:19:16.410 --> 02:19:20.150]
I'm not gonna be awake make sure you shave around your anus in the back of your tent

[02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:23.470]
No, I don't I don't shave my anus or my testicle. Well, he vetted your castella

[02:19:24.030 --> 02:19:27.830]
Okay, because that'll get caught up in there and pull and it's very just uncut. No, it will not

[02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:34.910]
I don't have a real hairy no no more so than any you know ordinary guy. Well in closing. Yes

[02:19:35.370 --> 02:19:35.810]
Good

[02:19:39.930 --> 02:19:40.370]
Oh

560 pound 560

[02:19:46.970 --> 02:19:52.490]
18d wireless line and that out of town line if we can hear from some real places instead of our losers and four Myers today

[02:19:52.490 --> 02:19:54.970]
God, they are really desperate over there. Wow

[02:19:55.530 --> 02:19:59.410]
Talk about out of material talk about Yahoo village man

[02:20:00.030 --> 02:20:02.550]
Yeah, they would have just drowned in that kid out there

[02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:11.850]
877 785 6345 one thing about four Myers don't take this personally unless you want to because we got a lot of nice people over there

[02:20:11.850 --> 02:20:16.550]
Listen, but there are some of you folks over there and our sentiment generally speaking is this I don't want to you know

[02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:18.690]
Make a wild generalization, but I think I'm being fair

[02:20:19.490 --> 02:20:20.910]
We're glad you're there and we're not

[02:20:23.950 --> 02:20:26.570]
877 785 6345

[02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:29.110]
Here's a mobile in poppano. Hello

[02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:37.530]
Mobile in poppano. Oh, yes, yes, sir. Yes, it is yes, you know I've done a week of writing home my first time call

[02:20:37.530 --> 02:20:41.390]
One time this and I was gonna be the colon off

[02:20:41.390 --> 02:20:44.210]
Yeah, my first topic to call you about but

[02:20:44.810 --> 02:20:48.470]
My wife had just had that a few years ago. Yeah, that'd be good to have

[02:20:48.910 --> 02:20:54.990]
First come out positive that when she found out she had cancer colon cancer right and she's been back

[02:20:54.990 --> 02:21:00.010]
She had surgery then she had a year chemo and she had to go back every year for three years

[02:21:00.010 --> 02:21:05.270]
Have to keep going back and everything was clear that doctor did the perfect job in surgery

[02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:09.610]
Right, but the colon off three was the one that you know brought it out and showed that she had to go

[02:21:09.610 --> 02:21:13.670]
Yeah, and now I have to go for I just found out the other I have to go for that signal

[02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:18.630]
So why that they call this signal from this signal I heard you mentioned before

[02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:22.030]
Sigma anoscopy. Yeah, sir. Yes, that's that's why I have to go for that

[02:21:22.030 --> 02:21:25.130]
That's a little bit uncomfortable, but these people are getting a little carried away

[02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:30.510]
You know you kind of like twist it you kind of twist and turn there while you're lying here because you're not knocked out

[02:21:30.510 --> 02:21:35.770]
You know, but it's not the worst thing you'll ever encounter you've got to go for the colonoscopy or the colon

[02:21:35.770 --> 02:21:40.010]
Ask to be and the endoscopy there you're checking both ends just to be on the safe side. Oh boy

[02:21:40.010 --> 02:21:44.630]
Yeah, and like I said, I hope they use different tubes. Yeah, I think she had a perfect doctor

[02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:47.170]
I mean, he's a real good doctor. Girl Springs real good though. Yeah

[02:21:47.950 --> 02:21:53.110]
What doctor was that it's called doctor bitten. Oh, yeah, that's the same office is my doctor. Oh really?

[02:21:53.430 --> 02:21:56.650]
He's with my doctor. He's a dream and I go with her every time

[02:21:57.630 --> 02:22:02.670]
And he's really dream she's in 45 minutes and she recovers for 45 minutes and right and run away home

[02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:09.110]
No problem with whoever excellent. So take care. Thank you very much. Thanks. Good luck. Bye five six seven oh five

[02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:13.350]
60 pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line that out of town line man

[02:22:13.350 --> 02:22:18.630]
It's springing off the hook isn't it today? Oh no strictly a four Myers and the call we had from Palm Beach was pretty weak too

[02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:20.870]
Remember that one really bad really really bad

[02:22:23.050 --> 02:22:23.450]
8777

785 6345 you get George again tomorrow. How do you like that?

Here at George is going to be loaded with good material. I bet you don't want to talk about that. You know what tomorrow

[02:22:30.770 --> 02:22:32.470]
Don't be talking about your anus

[02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:35.070]
Don't be talking about my rectum okay

[02:22:35.890 --> 02:22:37.370]
Until we get the inside story

[02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:43.690]
Here's a lady in Bay Harbor Island. Hello. Yes. Hello. Neil. How are you? Okay. That's good

[02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:46.590]
The midday news just finished on channel 10

[02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:51.010]
I thought I'd let you in on this breaking story. I'm Michael putt me

[02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:55.210]
He has uncovered information that the judge

[02:22:55.890 --> 02:22:57.590]
Rosa Rodriguez in fact

[02:22:58.350 --> 02:23:00.110]
In her past has made

[02:23:00.730 --> 02:23:05.830]
Money has exchanged $42,000. Yeah, somebody fast me then. I had no way to confirm it

[02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:09.890]
So I was watching it in $7,000. They don't know if

[02:23:09.890 --> 02:23:13.390]
This gentleman gave it to her or she maybe she was paying on a bill

[02:23:13.390 --> 02:23:18.570]
It was to the PR man who in fact is the PR man of

[02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:19.750]
Ileon Rodriguez

[02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:25.330]
Ileon Gonzalez's family and he happened to be sitting in the front row

[02:23:26.010 --> 02:23:32.750]
During the court hearing and let me just read the facts that was sent to the channel 10 was reporting in a bulletin that the Miami judge

[02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:39.230]
Who just ruled in favor of a leon as recently received $42,000 from family spokesman of the family toward her

[02:23:39.230 --> 02:23:48.150]
Relection fund will that be an accurate way of describing it? Well, they didn't want to say who gave if she the judge gave to the PR man or the PR man

[02:23:48.750 --> 02:23:51.370]
And his wife actually there were two contributions

[02:23:51.370 --> 02:23:59.530]
Money's exchanging 7,000 once they said on television and 42,000 another and she also had used him

[02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:03.710]
I guess is a PR person because she was involved or is in fact well

[02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:05.930]
I wasn't didn't she disqualify herself

[02:24:05.930 --> 02:24:13.030]
Well, that's what the University of Miami law professor who Diane Putnam brought then on the air to ask

[02:24:13.850 --> 02:24:16.330]
If in Putnam, Michael Magnum

[02:24:17.450 --> 02:24:23.870]
Diane Magnum, right. Yes, and they asked and professor did say that the judge

[02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:26.230]
Rodriguez should have at least

[02:24:27.010 --> 02:24:32.610]
acknowledged that she was familiar with someone affiliated to this case and in closing

[02:24:34.290 --> 02:24:38.310]
Yeah, I'd like to say one thing and I know I couldn't have been the only one that saw this

[02:24:39.130 --> 02:24:44.710]
Yesterday after the ruling when you could see the judge walking back into her chambers

[02:24:45.310 --> 02:24:48.210]
If you if they showed to them all the way

[02:24:48.210 --> 02:24:53.170]
You notice a little smile on her face and on the left side of her face is she's going to her chambers

[02:24:53.170 --> 02:24:54.890]
And I swear to you she

[02:24:55.550 --> 02:25:00.450]
I'm a face. I mean she had a stroke is like the like off to this like John Critchin

[02:25:00.450 --> 02:25:04.210]
Well, that was the profile I saw and then she gave a wink to someone

[02:25:04.210 --> 02:25:10.650]
Did she give like a white power salute? Well, that's not normal. I think for judges really to wink at the courtroom

[02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:13.070]
Well, it depends on what they look like. Yes. Okay. Thanks

[02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:15.170]
Whoo the plot is getting

[02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:18.770]
Say this sign right here

[02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:22.110]
Well, maybe she's learning to fly

[02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:28.210]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line 12 57 to Q a m

[02:25:28.770 --> 02:25:37.330]
We got with the first piece your role kept the bar as the key goal team we've been horned to six only on sports radio 5 60 Q a

[02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:47.890]
It's the one to two hours

[02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:55.710]
On the other football

[02:25:55.710 --> 02:25:57.150]
They are doing

[02:25:58.270 --> 02:26:00.510]
Grace hold the key to the ground

[02:26:01.330 --> 02:26:03.110]
You got a bag of your fire

[02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:07.250]
He's also smiling to through the river the palm of the ground

[02:26:07.850 --> 02:26:09.410]
Will they kill him?

[02:26:09.870 --> 02:26:10.850]
I don't think they

[02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:14.630]
Have hidden further with you

[02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:18.350]
You're saying all is well a little coach you have

[02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:20.410]
It's all up to tag me up

[02:26:20.410 --> 02:26:20.490]
Whoo

[02:26:20.490 --> 02:26:24.650]
Now even private half Hell or�

[02:26:24.650 --> 02:26:25.450]
All the ground

[02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:34.350]
The best you till selfao

[02:26:39.010 --> 02:26:41.010]
Criminal they

[02:26:41.010 --> 02:26:47.050]
But the balls the rapin mother

[02:26:47.050 --> 02:26:52.870]
They all laugh as long as they can feel the bleachers.

[02:26:53.170 --> 02:26:55.270]
They fill out something's gain.

[02:26:56.370 --> 02:26:59.810]
The Loucades who get spotted off his van make the money

[02:26:59.810 --> 02:27:02.130]
and the land is like you do the way.

[02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:06.530]
He behead you for a day or an hour brown.

[02:27:07.170 --> 02:27:09.910]
The wood will be for he on the ground.

[02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:12.130]
Be your man and the town.

[02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:12.550]
Be your man and the town.

[02:27:13.370 --> 02:27:15.110]
Be your man and the town.

[02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:18.970]
Be your man and the town.

[02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:21.990]
Be your man and the town.

[02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:25.450]
Okay, 102 at 560 W.

[02:27:25.530 --> 02:27:28.790]
I can't believe that.

[02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:30.330]
That's a first-year-old mistake.

[02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:32.810]
Five, six, seven.

[02:27:33.250 --> 02:27:35.490]
One thing that doctors don't like to tell you

[02:27:35.490 --> 02:27:37.290]
because they do like you to come back over and over again.

[02:27:37.290 --> 02:27:37.910]
And which is okay.

[02:27:38.570 --> 02:27:40.030]
And they do like to prescribe a lot of pills

[02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:41.850]
to make it look like they do something because we're all impatient.

[02:27:42.410 --> 02:27:45.230]
But viral infections guess what boys and girls?

[02:27:46.690 --> 02:27:48.570]
Do antibiotics make them go away?

[02:27:48.690 --> 02:27:48.830]
No.

[02:27:50.110 --> 02:27:52.210]
So if you have a lingering viral infection

[02:27:52.210 --> 02:27:53.550]
which a lot of people do these days,

[02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:55.470]
you could pop all the guy they had pills in the world

[02:27:55.470 --> 02:27:56.250]
and they will go away?

[02:27:56.390 --> 02:27:56.550]
No.

[02:27:57.010 --> 02:27:59.190]
And it's like Linda Blair said in time.

[02:28:00.090 --> 02:28:00.790]
In time.

[02:28:01.310 --> 02:28:01.490]
Right.

[02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:03.210]
Or maybe not as the case may be.

[02:28:03.410 --> 02:28:05.090]
It'd go on for a very long time.

[02:28:05.530 --> 02:28:06.830]
Like from here to maternity.

[02:28:07.410 --> 02:28:08.910]
And by the way, where the hell did Eric?

[02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:10.470]
Where did the, what's your name?

[02:28:10.970 --> 02:28:11.990]
What's your name, Marlena?

[02:28:12.490 --> 02:28:14.170]
Well, you don't know the days of our lives, do you?

[02:28:14.290 --> 02:28:15.970]
Well, you know when you're home sick, Larry, now,

[02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:17.910]
and then you start watching, oh my god,

[02:28:18.030 --> 02:28:21.250]
and there's Bill Hayes and Julie and the old lady on

[02:28:21.250 --> 02:28:22.810]
the town of the conflict.

[02:28:22.930 --> 02:28:23.970]
Oh my god, look at that.

[02:28:24.110 --> 02:28:25.910]
They brought them back, daughtering old folks from the,

[02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:28.290]
from the soap opera old folks home.

[02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:32.490]
Man, old man, Jean-Rabern just missed out a chance to come back.

[02:28:32.490 --> 02:28:34.110]
And if you would have just hung on.

[02:28:34.170 --> 02:28:36.530]
You know, Jean feels it, both shouldn't be.

[02:28:36.530 --> 02:28:38.610]
Well, and Julie, I can't believe it from the gaze of our lives.

[02:28:38.730 --> 02:28:40.330]
So anyway, Marlena's son, Eric, on it.

[02:28:40.430 --> 02:28:41.670]
You know, anybody in this audience, no Eric?

[02:28:41.810 --> 02:28:42.030]
Uh-huh.

[02:28:42.570 --> 02:28:44.910]
Let's get that number two, along with the aburwa twins.

[02:28:45.450 --> 02:28:47.110]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:28:47.530 --> 02:28:49.510]
0.5, 60, see when you're home alone,

[02:28:49.850 --> 02:28:52.190]
watching the soap operas, even when you're sick on a deathbed.

[02:28:52.470 --> 02:28:54.290]
You watch this stuff and it makes you feel a little bit better.

[02:28:54.410 --> 02:28:55.490]
It makes you squeeze once or twice.

[02:28:55.810 --> 02:28:56.250]
Not too hard.

[02:28:56.930 --> 02:28:57.470]
Here's Miami.

[02:28:57.630 --> 02:28:57.810]
Hello.

[02:28:59.750 --> 02:29:00.070]
Miami.

[02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:00.970]
Hello.

[02:29:00.970 --> 02:29:01.890]
Buenos dias.

[02:29:01.970 --> 02:29:02.610]
Buenos dias.

[02:29:02.830 --> 02:29:04.570]
Do you see me first time calling?

[02:29:05.130 --> 02:29:05.450]
All right.

[02:29:05.650 --> 02:29:06.250]
All right.

[02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:09.550]
And I wanted to share a dream I had with you right now in my last break.

[02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.410]
Yeah, okay.

[02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:12.390]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:15.410]
We don't talk to a phony people who got a sock over it and their phone too.

[02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:17.030]
With their mouth full of something.

[02:29:17.850 --> 02:29:18.490]
Probably transmit.

[02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:23.990]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:29:24.090 --> 02:29:24.790]
Isn't that his name, Eric?

[02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:26.850]
Marlena's son on the, uh, that's one of the days of our lives.

[02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:28.110]
I'm going to have to start watching that again.

[02:29:28.270 --> 02:29:28.910]
Very closely.

[02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:30.190]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:29:30.190 --> 02:29:30.510]
Hello.

[02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:31.830]
North Miami.

[02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:33.130]
How you feel?

[02:29:33.310 --> 02:29:33.590]
Yes, sir.

[02:29:34.110 --> 02:29:35.190]
I promise only time, caller.

[02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:35.690]
All right.

[02:29:36.090 --> 02:29:36.590]
Two comments.

[02:29:36.910 --> 02:29:42.610]
One, you can tell the Spanish lady, I think the patient did try to block 79 street and get the,

[02:29:43.090 --> 02:29:45.350]
you know what, kicked out of them 10 years ago.

[02:29:45.530 --> 02:29:46.110]
Oh, 10 years ago.

[02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.950]
Well, they learned their lesson.

[02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:48.250]
Yeah, they have to have that.

[02:29:48.250 --> 02:29:53.910]
And you notice by the way that after they arrested 50 people down there, I'm viscane and, uh, by the port,

[02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:57.490]
that that area was very conspicuously absent.

[02:29:57.510 --> 02:30:01.070]
In fact, they had the he came there last night and there were like two stragglers wandering around.

[02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.570]
And that was it.

[02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:02.270]
There was no disturbance.

[02:30:02.370 --> 02:30:02.750]
Oh, no.

[02:30:03.470 --> 02:30:03.830]
Yeah.

[02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:09.710]
And the last comment is, um, why hasn't anybody thought on the, uh, one of our government leaders to, uh,

[02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:16.650]
simply sue these people for disrupting public in maybe bankrupt a couple of these outfits like they do to other organizations.

[02:30:17.850 --> 02:30:18.950]
And then they might not be able to make it.

[02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:19.850]
Maybe we can make it bankrupt.

[02:30:19.870 --> 02:30:20.770]
Brothers to the rest of you.

[02:30:20.770 --> 02:30:21.390]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:30:21.390 --> 02:30:22.470]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:27.210]
Or the personal leaders and when they go to that hassle, maybe they'll realize what they're doing.

[02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:27.550]
Yeah.

[02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:32.090]
Or maybe just put them in a slimer for a couple of years for, uh, squalting civil disobedience, etc. and so on.

[02:30:32.470 --> 02:30:35.010]
Well, they shut down a lot of unions that way.

[02:30:35.310 --> 02:30:35.550]
Okay.

[02:30:35.970 --> 02:30:36.490]
Thank you.

[02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:36.870]
Thanks.

[02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:41.110]
5-6705-60, 05-60 on the AT&T World of Slot.

[02:30:41.170 --> 02:30:41.870]
Let me say it again.

[02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.890]
That was a great pull.

[02:30:42.970 --> 02:30:44.770]
Nice job there, Michael Putney on Channel 10.

[02:30:45.810 --> 02:30:47.970]
If there wasn't such a noxious news case, there were 10.

[02:30:47.970 --> 02:30:49.890]
I would start watching them because 4-6 and 7.

[02:30:49.890 --> 02:30:52.110]
Oh, that's exactly what they make me want to do.

[02:30:52.350 --> 02:30:53.030]
Oh, they're so bad.

[02:30:54.410 --> 02:30:58.990]
But they got to, you know, Dwight Lauderdale, but that, uh, since he shaved us off the mustache, nobody likes him anymore.

[02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.150]
No.

[02:30:59.410 --> 02:31:00.450]
We used to like you better with a mustache.

[02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:01.270]
Grow up back to white.

[02:31:01.710 --> 02:31:03.370]
It looks like it aged 80 years overnight.

[02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:06.190]
Here's a mobile in candle.

[02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:06.550]
Hello.

[02:31:07.610 --> 02:31:08.030]
Hey, Neil.

[02:31:08.170 --> 02:31:09.890]
I'm breaking up listening to you talking about colonoscopy.

[02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:12.130]
Let me tell you a funny story real quick.

[02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:12.630]
Yes, sir.

[02:31:12.970 --> 02:31:17.290]
When I was in the, when I was in the army about 25 years ago, I had that done.

[02:31:17.290 --> 02:31:18.930]
And I was a senior officer in the army.

[02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:22.270]
So these young doctors, you know, they wanted to really pick it through, you know.

[02:31:23.250 --> 02:31:24.530]
So they took me into do that.

[02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:26.050]
They didn't give me anything to knock me out.

[02:31:26.250 --> 02:31:29.990]
And then they didn't have TV cameras now and all this other stuff like that.

[02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:31.090]
They had to look through these scopes.

[02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.810]
Yeah.

[02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:36.510]
So these two guys are sitting there and I'm dying, you know, because I'm awake, you know what I mean?

[02:31:36.610 --> 02:31:39.810]
And I'm certain that all this other stuff and I, and I hear them talking, you know.

[02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:43.930]
And then talking back and forth and I said, what does this look like in there?

[02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:46.950]
I think I said, well, it looks like a tunnel.

[02:31:48.130 --> 02:31:49.030]
You want to take a look?

[02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:54.450]
And I said, yeah, I've been up there a couple of times before when I had my head up my butt,

[02:31:54.510 --> 02:31:55.810]
but I don't know what it looks like.

[02:31:55.930 --> 02:31:57.370]
You know, I think I said, that he has me to scope.

[02:31:57.450 --> 02:31:58.990]
He handed you the tube. How do you like that?

[02:31:59.250 --> 02:32:00.970]
And you looked up your own rectum.

[02:32:01.090 --> 02:32:02.470]
And I didn't have anything I'd pass on that.

[02:32:02.690 --> 02:32:05.070]
I'm looking up my own thing, you know.

[02:32:05.490 --> 02:32:07.370]
And what it looked like.

[02:32:07.470 --> 02:32:08.850]
It looked like the Hollanderer delinquent tunnel.

[02:32:10.050 --> 02:32:12.270]
It's like a gray Hollander tunnel, you know.

[02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:16.990]
And these guys are laughing and joking and, you know, and that thing's taking the turn, you know what I mean?

[02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:20.430]
And I'm saying, you know, boy, was this a big mistake, you know.

[02:32:20.610 --> 02:32:23.590]
Senior officer going here for two young army doctors, you know.

[02:32:24.590 --> 02:32:28.010]
But now they see that, they put it on the camera and all of a sudden,

[02:32:28.170 --> 02:32:29.730]
you could probably get a video tape off of it.

[02:32:29.790 --> 02:32:32.110]
I wouldn't be surprised if I wind up on like candid camera.

[02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:35.690]
But you could get a video tape, take it home, show it to your friends, you know.

[02:32:35.930 --> 02:32:36.110]
Right.

[02:32:36.850 --> 02:32:38.030]
In fact, we'll just have a word.

[02:32:38.210 --> 02:32:39.970]
Our next appearance will just show it to everybody.

[02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:41.330]
Take a look inside the old rectum.

[02:32:41.330 --> 02:32:42.590]
You know, get everybody on the floor.

[02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:43.110]
Yeah.

[02:32:43.490 --> 02:32:45.250]
All these guys are having a ball, you know.

[02:32:45.330 --> 02:32:47.370]
And they laughing at me, you know what I mean?

[02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:49.470]
I mean, this fucker's taking the turn, you know what I mean?

[02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:50.230]
When it takes the turn.

[02:32:51.070 --> 02:32:53.570]
And that's a lot of guy say that I'm turning it right now.

[02:32:53.770 --> 02:32:56.590]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 5, 60.

[02:32:57.790 --> 02:33:00.230]
On the ATA, well, it felt like a finger anyway.

[02:33:00.670 --> 02:33:02.310]
AT&T wireless line, whatever I'm talking about.

[02:33:02.530 --> 02:33:03.810]
Or did I take our friends from Bacardi?

[02:33:03.930 --> 02:33:05.750]
I promised that the fine young man from Bacardi.

[02:33:05.950 --> 02:33:08.550]
I would mention him being that our appearance on Saturday at Nixie Garst.

[02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:11.770]
He was a very fine young man who's a big fan of the show too, by the way.

[02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:12.930]
And those Bacardi girls.

[02:33:13.210 --> 02:33:15.810]
And the Bacardi girls, I took a picture with them, didn't notice them too much,

[02:33:15.890 --> 02:33:17.490]
because I was paying more attention to him, but nevertheless.

[02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:18.970]
And how's Danny doing, by the way?

[02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:21.450]
Not Danny from Danny and Jimmy.

[02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:25.050]
Now, if we could just find some good-looking guy in the audience named Jimmy,

[02:33:25.530 --> 02:33:26.930]
or we could have our own Danny and Jimmy.

[02:33:27.010 --> 02:33:27.550]
How do you like that?

[02:33:27.630 --> 02:33:27.950]
Yeah.

[02:33:28.590 --> 02:33:30.010]
Forget about these other guys, they're ugly.

[02:33:30.810 --> 02:33:34.250]
Sorry, Danny, but you know, those Batman lips just don't make it.

[02:33:36.010 --> 02:33:37.150]
Nine minutes after one.

[02:33:37.150 --> 02:33:38.670]
I know it's not the bads of the Joker lips.

[02:33:38.810 --> 02:33:39.270]
That's what he's got.

[02:33:39.350 --> 02:33:39.830]
Like a Joker.

[02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:44.770]
And he was, no, that's too recent for a Bokobron, the Joker.

[02:33:45.790 --> 02:33:47.610]
Here's the gacky stock, so carry.

[02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:58.070]
Oh!

[02:33:59.690 --> 02:34:03.210]
We got the however it's you, bids of me and y'all me.

[02:34:08.330 --> 02:34:09.170]
Yes.

[02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:14.310]
You would request our demands or we'll get angry.

[02:34:15.550 --> 02:34:19.550]
And we're short to flexing traffic in the street.

[02:34:21.330 --> 02:34:25.750]
We know that today is a new day from the finger island.

[02:34:26.370 --> 02:34:30.950]
But with the most important people in our minds.

[02:34:31.950 --> 02:34:32.730]
Hey, Leon!

[02:34:34.310 --> 02:34:35.990]
Hey, the G-Sat!

[02:34:37.130 --> 02:34:38.230]
Hey, Leon!

[02:34:39.390 --> 02:34:41.070]
Hey, Leon!

[02:34:41.070 --> 02:34:43.970]
And we'll get angry and dance we will get saved.

[02:34:45.130 --> 02:34:49.210]
We've been sous guide all the way for the violin kilometers

[02:34:49.210 --> 02:35:06.250]
And we'll get negative play any minute.

[02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:07.410]
Yes.

[02:35:09.250 --> 02:35:11.050]
And do we know what is validea and anything but the music

[02:35:11.050 --> 02:35:13.450]
I have 60 WQM, at least he's in the right order of the good juice, I guess.

[02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:16.570]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, the out of town line, forget it.

[02:35:16.650 --> 02:35:17.310]
We don't care about them.

[02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:18.750]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:35:18.890 --> 02:35:19.010]
Hello.

[02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:20.770]
Yes, hi, Neil.

[02:35:21.010 --> 02:35:21.350]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:35:22.310 --> 02:35:27.630]
First, I want to say that I just started listening to your show very recently and I think it's

[02:35:27.630 --> 02:35:27.750]
great.

[02:35:27.770 --> 02:35:28.650]
I'm a first time caller.

[02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:29.130]
Thank you.

[02:35:29.390 --> 02:35:32.510]
And it was my boyfriend that just me answer you guys.

[02:35:33.330 --> 02:35:35.010]
I'd actually like to send a greeting to him.

[02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.690]
His name is Johnny.

[02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:36.610]
Hi, Johnny.

[02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:41.210]
And first, Eric Brady is a cutie, isn't he?

[02:35:41.370 --> 02:35:42.210]
Some days of our life.

[02:35:42.270 --> 02:35:44.470]
Eric Brady, Jesus, where the hell did he come from?

[02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:50.150]
I haven't watched that show since Jesus was a baby in 100 years and you turn on the show

[02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:51.190]
Marlene is still the same.

[02:35:51.270 --> 02:35:52.350]
She looks exactly the same.

[02:35:52.650 --> 02:35:53.770]
And then they brought back to God.

[02:35:53.890 --> 02:35:57.190]
It used to be like the ranch hand on the show and all of a sudden he's Roman.

[02:35:57.870 --> 02:35:58.950]
Who are they kidding?

[02:35:59.390 --> 02:36:00.910]
He was on a show for 10 years ago, huh?

[02:36:01.210 --> 02:36:05.130]
Actually, what's even funnier is when John and Marlene came back from their honeymoon.

[02:36:05.130 --> 02:36:06.630]
They're told it's 10 years older.

[02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:09.430]
And oh, well, see, it happens on guiding light.

[02:36:09.430 --> 02:36:11.490]
The kids one day they're 12 the next day they're 20.

[02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:12.050]
I know.

[02:36:12.350 --> 02:36:13.190]
Yeah, it's amazing.

[02:36:13.890 --> 02:36:16.130]
And Stefano, he's only died 55 times.

[02:36:16.370 --> 02:36:19.370]
I was just telling Johnny all about that, my boyfriend.

[02:36:19.570 --> 02:36:21.290]
He's like 900 lives, huh?

[02:36:21.610 --> 02:36:21.870]
Exactly.

[02:36:22.490 --> 02:36:25.250]
But I also wanted to comment on that alleys thing.

[02:36:25.390 --> 02:36:26.410]
It is so awesome.

[02:36:26.770 --> 02:36:30.650]
I mean, just send him back to his father and leave us alone.

[02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:33.370]
He must be the most important person on the face of the earth, you know?

[02:36:33.470 --> 02:36:34.450]
And what all the coverage he's getting?

[02:36:34.450 --> 02:36:35.150]
I know.

[02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:36.450]
And do you know what?

[02:36:36.550 --> 02:36:40.970]
These people would stop protesting if the press did not glamorize them.

[02:36:41.070 --> 02:36:41.230]
Yeah.

[02:36:41.590 --> 02:36:43.590]
I mean, that's all there is to it.

[02:36:43.610 --> 02:36:46.370]
Just remember, we're channels 46, 7 and 10, antichrist.

[02:36:46.610 --> 02:36:47.090]
Oh, geez.

[02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:48.570]
One snatches.

[02:36:48.730 --> 02:36:50.270]
I mean, rich snatches.

[02:36:50.370 --> 02:36:50.770]
Snatches.

[02:36:50.770 --> 02:36:51.270]
Snatches, yeah.

[02:36:51.470 --> 02:36:51.870]
Please.

[02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:53.030]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:36:53.230 --> 02:36:53.770]
Oh, man.

[02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:54.490]
Thank you.

[02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:54.850]
See you.

[02:36:54.990 --> 02:36:55.210]
Bye.

[02:36:55.350 --> 02:36:56.290]
Don't call me, pal.

[02:36:56.650 --> 02:36:56.890]
Pally.

[02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.390]
Hey, pal.

[02:36:58.110 --> 02:36:59.750]
By the way, where's the fat boy lately?

[02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:02.030]
Not that I miss him or anything like that.

[02:37:03.610 --> 02:37:04.510]
Oh, God.

[02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:07.650]
And if you stay home during the daytime, if you're sick and you turn on the soap operas,

[02:37:07.690 --> 02:37:11.630]
even if you think soap operas are for pansies, a lot of beautiful people on air, male, female,

[02:37:11.650 --> 02:37:12.730]
some are really not too sure.

[02:37:13.310 --> 02:37:14.730]
Like Billy there on Guiding Light.

[02:37:14.830 --> 02:37:15.710]
We're not too sure about him.

[02:37:15.870 --> 02:37:17.910]
But here's a mobile in Boca.

[02:37:17.970 --> 02:37:18.190]
Hello.

[02:37:19.150 --> 02:37:19.510]
Male.

[02:37:19.770 --> 02:37:20.130]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:21.110]
Am I on?

[02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:22.730]
It sounds exactly like you.

[02:37:23.210 --> 02:37:23.610]
I'm on.

[02:37:23.810 --> 02:37:24.110]
I'm on.

[02:37:24.450 --> 02:37:24.910]
What do you want?

[02:37:25.790 --> 02:37:30.010]
Hey, two quick comments and I'll hang up to listen to your response.

[02:37:30.270 --> 02:37:30.590]
He's done.

[02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:31.110]
Okay.

[02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.770]
All right.

[02:37:33.130 --> 02:37:35.170]
Oh, I'm this alien thing.

[02:37:35.770 --> 02:37:35.770]

[02:37:36.470 --> 02:37:37.050]
Yes, alien.

[02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:37.930]
Alien.

[02:37:38.610 --> 02:37:39.610]
We got to be able.

[02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:43.270]
We got to be the laughing stock that put up with this.

[02:37:43.390 --> 02:37:44.210]
Yeah, but we're used to that.

[02:37:44.310 --> 02:37:45.410]
And we're used to that.

[02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:46.090]
Oh, yeah.

[02:37:46.090 --> 02:37:47.910]
Always the laughing stock, at least we're conceited.

[02:37:48.270 --> 02:37:48.410]
We're confused.

[02:37:48.410 --> 02:37:49.310]
We're pond in this game.

[02:37:49.410 --> 02:37:49.570]
Yeah.

[02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:51.030]
We're pond in this game.

[02:37:51.130 --> 02:37:51.490]
We're pond.

[02:37:52.190 --> 02:37:53.710]
Oh, yeah.

[02:37:54.010 --> 02:37:54.450]
Oh, pond.

[02:37:54.450 --> 02:37:55.910]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:56.330]
We're still on.

[02:37:56.330 --> 02:37:57.150]
We're going to be like shellfish.

[02:37:57.150 --> 02:37:58.270]
It's a little behind cluster.

[02:37:58.270 --> 02:37:59.250]
draw but anyway.

[02:37:59.310 --> 02:38:02.630]
And yeah, have a great day.

[02:38:02.770 --> 02:38:02.910]
I can't.

[02:38:02.970 --> 02:38:04.070]
He's just too much stammering.

[02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:04.430]
You know what?

[02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:06.350]
I understand it when you're on a phone.

[02:38:06.350 --> 02:38:07.670]
It's a little bit difficult sometimes.

[02:38:07.890 --> 02:38:10.390]
It is a little on the hard side, but in his case, I doubt it.

[02:38:10.650 --> 02:38:11.710]
But I mean, stammering.

[02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:12.810]
I'm just not thinking of stammer.

[02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:14.170]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:19.310]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&T wireless line.

[02:38:19.410 --> 02:38:22.410]
See, my philosophy in life is that it's a good advice to live by.

[02:38:22.430 --> 02:38:22.890]
When it's out.

[02:38:24.750 --> 02:38:25.390]
Spit it out.

[02:38:26.910 --> 02:38:27.870]
Here's the Palm Beach.

[02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.110]
Hello.

[02:38:29.550 --> 02:38:30.250]
Palm Beach.

[02:38:31.490 --> 02:38:32.230]
Going once.

[02:38:33.450 --> 02:38:34.150]
Going twice.

[02:38:34.930 --> 02:38:36.790]
What is it about Palm Beach and four Myers?

[02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:38.790]
Where all of those people they...

[02:38:39.290 --> 02:38:40.270]
Off their feet, man.

[02:38:40.690 --> 02:38:41.310]
Something about it.

[02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:42.570]
Here's a mobile and Delray Beach.

[02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:42.870]
Hello.

[02:38:44.210 --> 02:38:44.210]

[02:38:44.390 --> 02:38:44.690]
Yes, sir.

[02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:46.770]
Yeah, I just wanted to give you some good news.

[02:38:46.770 --> 02:38:47.070]
Here it.

[02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.630]
Ah!

[02:38:47.810 --> 02:38:48.370]
Yeah, I'm sorry.

[02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.550]
That's okay.

[02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:50.250]
Maybe too.

[02:38:50.310 --> 02:38:51.010]
Just a little bit.

[02:38:51.150 --> 02:38:53.790]
But like you, we've got a small and a large dish.

[02:38:54.290 --> 02:38:54.490]
Yes.

[02:38:54.490 --> 02:38:57.890]
And last week I had a occasion called that link, our service provider.

[02:38:58.050 --> 02:39:00.110]
And they said we could get the networks on the big dish again.

[02:39:00.870 --> 02:39:03.610]
You can on the big dish immediately sign up for them.

[02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.990]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:04.130 --> 02:39:05.910]
I got prime time heast.

[02:39:06.190 --> 02:39:07.830]
And I also got the Denver 5 foot.

[02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:09.130]
Oh, you mean the...

[02:39:09.130 --> 02:39:10.090]
How is that possible?

[02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:11.150]
No, no.

[02:39:11.290 --> 02:39:14.550]
They said that there was some action signed by the president last week.

[02:39:14.810 --> 02:39:17.530]
And they were now able to provide that service again.

[02:39:17.530 --> 02:39:19.470]
And I signed up for a heartbeat.

[02:39:19.890 --> 02:39:20.030]
Yeah.

[02:39:20.370 --> 02:39:22.150]
Just took no photo.

[02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:23.430]
I'm not just talking right now.

[02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.610]
It's great news.

[02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:27.410]
I was extremely excited because like you, I can't stand the local...

[02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:29.250]
There's nothing like all of the Orthodox state.

[02:39:29.290 --> 02:39:30.890]
There's nothing like having two set-editious, man.

[02:39:31.310 --> 02:39:31.870]
You got it.

[02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:33.010]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[02:39:33.470 --> 02:39:34.070]
Yeah, I was great.

[02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:37.730]
About three years ago, they tried to take the networks away and they...

[02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:39.170]
Yeah, the people who are in our lives.

[02:39:39.730 --> 02:39:42.730]
Yeah, I said if you can give us a reason why not...

[02:39:42.730 --> 02:39:43.390]
Stayed it here.

[02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:46.590]
And I just said, how can I pretend I'm not here if you make me watch local TV?

[02:39:46.930 --> 02:39:47.070]
Right.

[02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:48.930]
And I thought that was a pretty good response.

[02:39:49.250 --> 02:39:49.910]
And I heard back from them.

[02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:50.930]
Well, thanks for doing a great job.

[02:39:51.070 --> 02:39:51.670]
I'm sure you did it.

[02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:52.590]
You put us over the top.

[02:39:53.070 --> 02:39:55.570]
I'm proud to be a participant here.

[02:39:55.650 --> 02:39:56.250]
Okay, thank you.

[02:39:56.350 --> 02:39:57.670]
Thank you.

[02:39:58.810 --> 02:40:00.490]
Damn woman, it's my mother, Eric.

[02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:03.090]
I'm just taking a photo.

[02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.850]
Come on.

[02:40:04.250 --> 02:40:04.670]
She's cute.

[02:40:05.290 --> 02:40:05.790]
Well, there you go.

[02:40:05.930 --> 02:40:06.450]
It's something for everyone.

[02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:07.810]
Not as pretty as him though.

[02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:09.230]
We got to admit, he's pretty in tune.

[02:40:10.170 --> 02:40:11.150]
He's real pretty.

[02:40:12.450 --> 02:40:14.050]
Eric, don't faint out, Eric.

[02:40:14.590 --> 02:40:15.350]
Oh, sorry, too late.

[02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:17.810]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:40:18.390 --> 02:40:21.070]
I don't have woman by life for all these goddamn soap operas.

[02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:24.330]
Okay, except guiding light, which I've been watching for now, longer than I'm carrying

[02:40:24.330 --> 02:40:24.690]
to admit.

[02:40:25.270 --> 02:40:27.310]
Do you have any idea how long I've been watching that now?

[02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:29.590]
41 years.

[02:40:32.410 --> 02:40:33.210]
41 years.

[02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:37.990]
Do I dare to tell that boring story about how I used to come home from lunch from high

[02:40:37.990 --> 02:40:38.210]
school?

[02:40:38.490 --> 02:40:40.870]
And it was on 15 minutes and 12, 45 after search for tomorrow.

[02:40:41.150 --> 02:40:42.070]
Would Joan Macherville update?

[02:40:42.370 --> 02:40:43.130]
Do I dare to tell that story?

[02:40:43.350 --> 02:40:43.530]
No.

[02:40:43.690 --> 02:40:43.790]
No.

[02:40:45.270 --> 02:40:46.070]
41 years.

[02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:47.990]
And guess what Bill Bauer just died, huh?

[02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:49.570]
Had that story last week.

[02:40:49.570 --> 02:40:49.930]
Boy.

[02:40:50.290 --> 02:40:51.870]
And Vanessa's in a goddamn coma again.

[02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:52.950]
Jesus, she's in.

[02:40:53.090 --> 02:40:53.410]
She's out.

[02:40:53.570 --> 02:40:56.290]
She's like the Jeff Cohen of soap operas in and out, in and out.

[02:40:58.210 --> 02:40:59.610]
What am I, I'm rambling now?

[02:40:59.670 --> 02:41:00.930]
I think Eric put me over the edge.

[02:41:01.090 --> 02:41:04.330]
Maybe Eric will be staying there on my bedside tomorrow when I have my colonoscopy, huh?

[02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.970]
Right.

[02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:06.730]
Don't get too close, Eric.

[02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:08.970]
Here's the mobile in Hollywood.

[02:41:09.130 --> 02:41:09.330]
Hello.

[02:41:10.010 --> 02:41:10.950]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.350]
Pretty good.

[02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:14.330]
Look, unfortunately, I'm an expert on colonoscopies.

[02:41:14.430 --> 02:41:15.310]
I've had about 10 of us.

[02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:15.570]
Really?

[02:41:16.050 --> 02:41:17.970]
Yeah, I've got the old sort of collidance.

[02:41:17.970 --> 02:41:19.730]
I have to have one every year, year and a half.

[02:41:19.930 --> 02:41:21.790]
OK, now what is all that I have last week?

[02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:23.350]
What is all sort of collidance?

[02:41:23.390 --> 02:41:23.950]
What are the symptoms?

[02:41:25.490 --> 02:41:30.490]
I'm very frequent bowel movements with mucus in there and urgency.

[02:41:31.130 --> 02:41:31.350]
Yeah.

[02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:33.730]
And I mean, I haven't had it for a couple of years.

[02:41:33.730 --> 02:41:34.650]
And that's all?

[02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:35.510]
That's all it is?

[02:41:35.970 --> 02:41:39.210]
Well, don't say it's all it is because you can go 30, 40 times a day.

[02:41:39.690 --> 02:41:41.430]
30, 40 times a day.

[02:41:41.610 --> 02:41:41.610]

[02:41:41.810 --> 02:41:44.210]
So as soon as you stand up and start to walk around.

[02:41:44.290 --> 02:41:44.970]
You see how to trouble?

[02:41:45.530 --> 02:41:46.270]
Yeah, sure does.

[02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.630]
Yeah.

[02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:48.490]
30 or 40 times a day.

[02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:50.890]
You can just like twice an hour.

[02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.710]
That's correct.

[02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:54.130]
And during your waking hours, more like two and a half times a day.

[02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:56.590]
That's a question of how do you do it a half a time?

[02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.690]
When it's active.

[02:41:57.870 --> 02:41:58.510]
Now, here's the thing.

[02:41:58.750 --> 02:41:58.870]
Yeah.

[02:41:58.990 --> 02:42:00.870]
You're taking the prep that you're going to take.

[02:42:01.810 --> 02:42:03.010]
Good news and bad news.

[02:42:03.490 --> 02:42:03.650]
Yeah.

[02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:06.870]
You're going to take your day up to drinks like the one glass bowl.

[02:42:07.570 --> 02:42:08.810]
And it's like dynamite.

[02:42:09.070 --> 02:42:09.270]
Right.

[02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:10.470]
And it'll clean it out.

[02:42:11.010 --> 02:42:13.290]
But it rips the hell out of your stomach.

[02:42:13.470 --> 02:42:14.630]
I mean, it really rips you.

[02:42:14.890 --> 02:42:15.510]
Oh, great.

[02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:20.430]
But if they gave you the regular prep, which is coal light,

[02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:23.410]
you have to drink a four liter container.

[02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:26.050]
That's like a gallon of that car.

[02:42:26.770 --> 02:42:27.070]
Oh, man.

[02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:29.250]
And you have to drink it every 10 minutes.

[02:42:29.450 --> 02:42:30.190]
Take me a year later.

[02:42:30.350 --> 02:42:31.090]
I'll pass on that.

[02:42:31.450 --> 02:42:32.230]
Yeah, it's no fun.

[02:42:32.390 --> 02:42:34.550]
I think you might as well endure the pain.

[02:42:35.050 --> 02:42:36.510]
Now, as far as the coal enough to be itself,

[02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:37.470]
you're going to lay on the table.

[02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:39.510]
They're going to have the inner veneous line.

[02:42:39.730 --> 02:42:41.330]
And yeah, the guy's going to come.

[02:42:41.570 --> 02:42:43.110]
And you're going to get number one.

[02:42:44.030 --> 02:42:44.390]
Yeah.

[02:42:44.910 --> 02:42:45.670]
I was your hope nod.

[02:42:46.030 --> 02:42:46.330]
Yeah.

[02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:48.890]
This is starting to sound a little kinky to me.

[02:42:50.590 --> 02:42:53.370]
You're going to get demoral and first said.

[02:42:53.850 --> 02:42:54.190]
And why?

[02:42:54.970 --> 02:42:56.490]
First said, CEO, FED.

[02:42:57.090 --> 02:43:00.030]
That's what they use for the local.

[02:43:01.330 --> 02:43:03.730]
And once they inject it into your line,

[02:43:04.190 --> 02:43:06.430]
you'll have five anywhere from five to 10,

[02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:09.730]
very pleasant seconds, beautiful floating,

[02:43:09.890 --> 02:43:11.370]
better than the best pot.

[02:43:11.690 --> 02:43:12.430]
I'll be floating again.

[02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:14.150]
And then you're completely out.

[02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.530]
Oh, good.

[02:43:14.990 --> 02:43:17.670]
Now, some patients they ask what you like to see it

[02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:18.110]
on the TV.

[02:43:18.450 --> 02:43:18.550]
No.

[02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:19.930]
And if you want to see it on a TV,

[02:43:20.450 --> 02:43:21.870]
instead of giving you like five millimetres,

[02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:23.490]
it'll give you two or three.

[02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:25.230]
And then you're awake watching the TV.

[02:43:25.390 --> 02:43:27.490]
No, I'm watching my own TV right here right now.

[02:43:27.690 --> 02:43:27.870]
I don't know.

[02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:29.290]
It'll be the pictures when you're done.

[02:43:29.450 --> 02:43:31.310]
Because when they do the coal enough to be,

[02:43:31.810 --> 02:43:32.850]
there's a camera in there.

[02:43:33.130 --> 02:43:35.150]
And they click the camera and you get pictures.

[02:43:35.650 --> 02:43:37.270]
And as soon as they go, well, let me ask you this.

[02:43:37.390 --> 02:43:38.910]
If they find like a polyp way up in there,

[02:43:38.970 --> 02:43:39.650]
they'll stick it out.

[02:43:39.930 --> 02:43:40.870]
They stick it right then.

[02:43:41.450 --> 02:43:42.110]
They'll snare it.

[02:43:42.210 --> 02:43:42.950]
And they'll take it out.

[02:43:42.950 --> 02:43:43.990]
They snare it.

[02:43:44.370 --> 02:43:45.090]
They snare it.

[02:43:45.510 --> 02:43:46.590]
Yeah, with a snare.

[02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:48.590]
Now, are they using the rompopio pocket fisherman

[02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:50.070]
to do this at the same time?

[02:43:50.510 --> 02:43:51.690]
They snare it?

[02:43:51.850 --> 02:43:52.830]
Well, it all depends.

[02:43:53.050 --> 02:43:53.830]
It all depends on you.

[02:43:53.890 --> 02:43:54.710]
Who's your doctor anyway?

[02:43:55.110 --> 02:43:55.830]
Dr. Diamond.

[02:43:57.290 --> 02:43:58.010]
Not the lawyer.

[02:43:58.090 --> 02:44:00.310]
He's a bitman's partner in Crowley's very good.

[02:44:00.890 --> 02:44:01.270]
Oh, okay.

[02:44:01.410 --> 02:44:03.010]
So they say, I'll let you know if he's very good.

[02:44:03.230 --> 02:44:03.910]
Now listen to me.

[02:44:03.990 --> 02:44:04.590]
One other thing.

[02:44:05.390 --> 02:44:07.410]
With that, when you're on that thing there.

[02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.850]
Yeah.

[02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:11.850]
Make sure if you're awake when they start doing the coal

[02:44:11.850 --> 02:44:12.430]
with the ash could be.

[02:44:12.670 --> 02:44:14.790]
Make sure both of his hands aren't on your shoulders.

[02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:16.330]
Yeah.

[02:44:16.830 --> 02:44:17.150]
Okay.

[02:44:18.290 --> 02:44:18.950]
That's what you're doing.

[02:44:19.350 --> 02:44:20.390]
I've read those stories, pal.

[02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.950]
Thanks a lot.

[02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.810]
You'll be fine.

[02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:22.510]
It's a piece of cake.

[02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.910]
Okay.

[02:44:23.450 --> 02:44:23.770]
Thanks.

[02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:25.130]
I wish I could have a piece of cake.

[02:44:25.250 --> 02:44:25.890]
Anything today?

[02:44:26.010 --> 02:44:26.170]
No.

[02:44:26.290 --> 02:44:27.730]
No, this is yum kipper today for me.

[02:44:27.850 --> 02:44:28.430]
Can't eat the thing.

[02:44:29.070 --> 02:44:30.830]
You could eat breakfast today on a prep day.

[02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:31.530]
But do I eat breakfast?

[02:44:31.650 --> 02:44:31.790]
No.

[02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:33.270]
So what's the point of eating it in the first place?

[02:44:34.170 --> 02:44:35.090]
Let's look at a head start.

[02:44:35.210 --> 02:44:36.050]
Might win a dot start.

[02:44:36.270 --> 02:44:36.930]
You're cleaning it out.

[02:44:37.050 --> 02:44:37.150]
Yeah.

[02:44:38.730 --> 02:44:39.970]
Sounds real pleasant to me.

[02:44:40.110 --> 02:44:40.330]
Doesn't it?

[02:44:40.330 --> 02:44:41.850]
But like I said, this is the way God.

[02:44:41.850 --> 02:44:43.070]
He works in mysterious ways.

[02:44:43.290 --> 02:44:46.530]
You know, that's why we got all that plumbing and those strange things and those tumors and

[02:44:46.530 --> 02:44:47.310]
God only knows what.

[02:44:47.610 --> 02:44:51.050]
And then of course, how come everybody's only calling about the...

[02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:51.370]
Bracto.

[02:44:51.530 --> 02:44:54.730]
But I've only had water to cause about the endoscopy where they stick the tube down your throat.

[02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:58.550]
And like I said, they wash and off first after they pull it out of the other end.

[02:44:59.390 --> 02:44:59.510]
Yeah.

[02:44:59.510 --> 02:45:00.270]
I'm getting both ends.

[02:45:01.810 --> 02:45:05.390]
Boy, when they get through with me, they'll have pictures of a matchstick man by the time

[02:45:05.390 --> 02:45:06.090]
they get through with me.

[02:45:06.090 --> 02:45:09.130]
I mean, everything, every little nook and cranny.

[02:45:10.010 --> 02:45:10.670]
Five stick.

[02:45:10.770 --> 02:45:12.330]
All we're going to do is call from St. Petersburg.

[02:45:12.690 --> 02:45:12.850]
Hello.

[02:45:13.130 --> 02:45:13.870]
Hello, Neil.

[02:45:14.130 --> 02:45:14.290]
Yes.

[02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:15.990]
Good luck at the doctor tomorrow.

[02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:22.050]
Also, the last gentleman before this guy here about the net length and the networks being

[02:45:22.050 --> 02:45:24.050]
restored is absolutely correct.

[02:45:24.390 --> 02:45:24.930]
Absolutely correct.

[02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:27.510]
What a great piece of news that is.

[02:45:27.750 --> 02:45:28.350]
And he was right.

[02:45:29.250 --> 02:45:33.770]
And not it's just one of the few you went on that and you have a loyal listener here

[02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:36.590]
and keep up to good work and all listen to you on Thursday.

[02:45:36.890 --> 02:45:37.530]
And God bless you.

[02:45:37.730 --> 02:45:38.090]
Thanks, Neil.

[02:45:38.190 --> 02:45:38.470]
Thank you.

[02:45:38.650 --> 02:45:39.710]
There's a call from St. Petersburg.

[02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:41.910]
And that goes a lot better than our four Myers callers today.

[02:45:42.090 --> 02:45:43.670]
Don't take it personally for Myers.

[02:45:43.770 --> 02:45:47.410]
We had a lot of wonderful people, but they're busy and they're trying to make a living so

[02:45:47.410 --> 02:45:50.250]
they can buy out to want to be pleased and do something productive with their lives.

[02:45:50.970 --> 02:45:53.350]
But boy, some of those calls from four Myers man.

[02:45:53.470 --> 02:45:54.230]
All you can say is.

[02:45:55.170 --> 02:45:58.430]
What the hell is going on over there and did the sheep run away over the weekend?

[02:45:59.250 --> 02:46:03.070]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:46:03.070 --> 02:46:04.230]
We're deciding today.

[02:46:04.410 --> 02:46:04.910]
Can he stay?

[02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:05.570]
Can he leave?

[02:46:06.330 --> 02:46:06.690]
Okay.

[02:46:08.250 --> 02:46:09.030]
Shall he stay?

[02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:09.630]
Shall he leave?

[02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:10.590]
Not really, I'm necessarily.

[02:46:10.830 --> 02:46:12.250]
We'll find somebody else who will take a vote on.

[02:46:13.890 --> 02:46:15.350]
Who else can we take a poll on?

[02:46:15.450 --> 02:46:16.850]
Should he stay or should he get there a lot of here?

[02:46:19.570 --> 02:46:20.750]
That's going to be a long list.

[02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:21.410]
Yeah.

[02:46:21.570 --> 02:46:23.430]
I was thinking over 20 or 30.

[02:46:23.650 --> 02:46:25.330]
It was rapidly flashing through my mind.

[02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:28.010]
Most of the sales department flies through their real fans.

[02:46:29.250 --> 02:46:30.570]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal.

[02:46:30.570 --> 02:46:30.810]
Hello.

[02:46:31.430 --> 02:46:31.670]
Hello.

[02:46:31.670 --> 02:46:32.270]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:32.450 --> 02:46:32.970]
Hi, Neil.

[02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:36.110]
You have a very good entertain show.

[02:46:36.410 --> 02:46:36.750]
Yes, I do.

[02:46:36.750 --> 02:46:38.030]
I listen to you all the time.

[02:46:38.090 --> 02:46:38.850]
It just never called you.

[02:46:39.270 --> 02:46:42.370]
But I want to say something about the formal Miami.

[02:46:43.930 --> 02:46:46.470]
You know, I believe in to it.

[02:46:46.570 --> 02:46:50.990]
And it really gives a bad name to all of all the Hispanics like me.

[02:46:51.150 --> 02:46:52.950]
And I'm actually white.

[02:46:53.170 --> 02:46:54.830]
But you know, it's coming in Spanish.

[02:46:54.830 --> 02:46:55.670]
I think we're Spanish.

[02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:56.250]
We are race.

[02:46:56.750 --> 02:46:57.250]
I think white.

[02:46:57.390 --> 02:46:59.130]
So you do white black Asian.

[02:46:59.410 --> 02:47:00.210]
And anyway.

[02:47:00.690 --> 02:47:03.630]
I think what we're going to have to do in this town is start making everybody take a blood

[02:47:03.630 --> 02:47:05.830]
test to find out what their family tree is.

[02:47:06.430 --> 02:47:06.730]
Yeah.

[02:47:06.910 --> 02:47:08.110]
But it was people down there.

[02:47:08.110 --> 02:47:09.150]
They should have been up in a tree.

[02:47:09.490 --> 02:47:10.110]
Listen to this.

[02:47:10.210 --> 02:47:17.210]
I was looking to a registration in Spanish Jose and they were saying where was Rome or

[02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:20.150]
Martinez and where was Regalato and where was Venezuela?

[02:47:20.690 --> 02:47:22.190]
I mean, they're doing their job.

[02:47:22.370 --> 02:47:23.410]
You know, they're commissioners.

[02:47:23.590 --> 02:47:24.230]
They're mayors.

[02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:26.270]
They, you know, that's the job.

[02:47:26.270 --> 02:47:27.590]
Well, I don't know what they're saying about Regalato.

[02:47:27.710 --> 02:47:28.070]
He makes that.

[02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:30.310]
Regalato was down there in a middle of it like he always is.

[02:47:30.450 --> 02:47:31.790]
He's an exploiting piece of crap.

[02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.470]
Yeah.

[02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:34.510]
I mean, you know, why would it be?

[02:47:34.510 --> 02:47:37.550]
You know, I have to be at the mayor's office and being in Martinez.

[02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:41.830]
I really don't understand why would they have to do screening and doing all these.

[02:47:41.930 --> 02:47:46.510]
Mayor Martinez is busy out there in the streets of highly, a beaten up midges and keeping

[02:47:46.510 --> 02:47:47.690]
the streets clear for traffic.

[02:47:48.150 --> 02:47:48.450]
You're right.

[02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:54.430]
I'm just calling to, you know, I hope, you know, you can't even consider that.

[02:47:54.930 --> 02:47:56.210]
No, his fans, I would say.

[02:47:57.730 --> 02:48:02.130]
We know it's the same old agitators over and over again in their brainwashed little punky

[02:48:02.130 --> 02:48:04.550]
kids who got nothing better to do than be a bunch of wine zasses.

[02:48:04.710 --> 02:48:05.270]
Go out in the street.

[02:48:05.290 --> 02:48:06.550]
He said, that's really sad.

[02:48:07.410 --> 02:48:08.230]
You have a good show.

[02:48:08.350 --> 02:48:10.710]
I don't always agree with everything you say, but it's very entertainment.

[02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:11.390]
Thanks, pal.

[02:48:11.790 --> 02:48:12.130]
Take care.

[02:48:12.510 --> 02:48:13.090]
I'll be there to you.

[02:48:14.170 --> 02:48:15.950]
126 at 560 WQA.

[02:48:15.970 --> 02:48:19.390]
I'm, how can the Doug and Julie be back on Jesus' great?

[02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:23.230]
And I think Tom Horton's wife, I thought she died a while ago and she came back.

[02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:24.130]
I mean, in real life.

[02:48:24.990 --> 02:48:28.910]
I'm so popular sometimes they die and they come back, but she like died for real and

[02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:29.410]
she's bad.

[02:48:29.930 --> 02:48:32.930]
But, Garrett, for Alice Horton or whatever, her name is Goddamnit.

[02:48:32.930 --> 02:48:35.770]
This is 560 QAF.

[02:48:35.970 --> 02:48:36.450]
Neil Rogers.

[02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:36.770]
God.

[02:48:38.690 --> 02:48:43.670]
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale of the bearded comedy stuff.

[02:48:44.110 --> 02:48:48.450]
Whose machine puts over a dropping aisle South of Florida.

[02:48:48.450 --> 02:48:53.910]
They ran from the big fat two-win man who conquered their island hold.

[02:48:54.490 --> 02:49:00.950]
Which three to five-sour will be new when the rest have to take a post or build a rap

[02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:01.690]
and float.

[02:49:01.970 --> 02:49:02.210]
Yes.

[02:49:11.790 --> 02:49:17.390]
I'm, you've been taught to get it back quickly, gave it up.

[02:49:17.410 --> 02:49:22.230]
I've been given the Bay of Pips and Trials the Air Force didn't show up.

[02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:31.510]
They float even to my early end when the competition's in place like Bay of Venus and Suarez

[02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:33.110]
and Suarez.

[02:49:37.570 --> 02:49:41.970]
I'm a baby.

[02:49:43.250 --> 02:49:44.070]
I'm a baby.

[02:49:46.730 --> 02:49:48.010]
I'm a baby.

[02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:49.690]
Okay.

[02:49:49.970 --> 02:49:51.470]
1.31 at 5.60 WQ.

[02:49:51.610 --> 02:49:55.890]
I'm almost gagging here because somebody faxed me a whole description here.

[02:49:56.050 --> 02:49:57.490]
Hopefully this is very old by the way.

[02:49:58.190 --> 02:50:00.510]
About the medical procedure with colonoscopies.

[02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:02.610]
It's two nights before the procedure.

[02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:08.710]
Patient takes 60, whatever that is of magnesia and one night before hand takes either two

[02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:12.830]
ounces of caster oil or ten ounces of magnesium citrate orally.

[02:50:13.330 --> 02:50:14.350]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:50:15.010 --> 02:50:18.990]
On the morning of the exam, mechanical cleansing of the sigmoid and left colon is curated out

[02:50:18.990 --> 02:50:22.110]
by two tap water animals until fluid return is cleared.

[02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:26.790]
Alternatively, commercially prepared solutions such as go lightly.

[02:50:28.430 --> 02:50:30.950]
Maybe used with the curivular results without the need for animals.

[02:50:31.570 --> 02:50:35.230]
And that goes on about 50 gallons of, oh, gee, that's God.

[02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:36.550]
Thanks a lot, Jethro.

[02:50:38.770 --> 02:50:39.810]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:50:39.970 --> 02:50:40.130]
Hello.

[02:50:41.230 --> 02:50:41.510]
Hello.

[02:50:41.770 --> 02:50:42.070]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:42.670 --> 02:50:44.770]
Hey, Neil, I just wanted to ask you a question.

[02:50:44.910 --> 02:50:46.950]
I'm a long time listener for San Carlos.

[02:50:47.070 --> 02:50:47.370]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:47.370 --> 02:50:51.950]
I wanted to ask you, what is the difference between what the Cubans are doing?

[02:50:52.610 --> 02:50:55.950]
And I don't think that they should block the roads.

[02:50:56.190 --> 02:51:01.250]
But what is the difference between what they're doing and when an airline strikes?

[02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:06.210]
In other words, you know, the pilot strike and they hold up the whole nation on all these fights.

[02:51:06.210 --> 02:51:06.950]
What's the difference?

[02:51:08.270 --> 02:51:11.950]
Well, I mean, you know, you're, well, how about any union, any union?

[02:51:12.130 --> 02:51:15.670]
No, I agree with that, you know, but I know what you're saying.

[02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:17.530]
But there's no difference.

[02:51:17.770 --> 02:51:20.670]
The difference is that this is the American way.

[02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:21.150]
Is it not?

[02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:22.070]
No, no, it is not.

[02:51:22.290 --> 02:51:24.610]
I mean, people or members of unions have a right to strike.

[02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:26.950]
People are just ordinary people with a grievance.

[02:51:27.130 --> 02:51:34.570]
If every time somebody group of people gets pissed off about something and they go out and start disrupting traffic and slowing down and making threats to block,

[02:51:34.910 --> 02:51:38.110]
see the people who go on strike like the airlines.

[02:51:38.530 --> 02:51:41.650]
They have a specific grievance that has to do with the airline itself.

[02:51:41.650 --> 02:51:46.510]
These people are taking out on people that have nothing to do with their grievance, all their problems.

[02:51:46.810 --> 02:51:48.390]
The public has got nothing to do with it.

[02:51:48.450 --> 02:51:49.790]
What the hell does the airport have to do?

[02:51:50.090 --> 02:51:53.010]
Slowing down the airport for people who want to live their lives.

[02:51:53.290 --> 02:51:57.410]
What if that had to do with whether Ali and Rodriguez stays in Miami or goes back to Cuba?

[02:51:58.110 --> 02:51:59.250]
Oh, no, no, I agree with that.

[02:51:59.390 --> 02:52:02.810]
I mean, I agree that you shouldn't want the airline to go on strike.

[02:52:03.330 --> 02:52:05.710]
It's not specifically done to punish the consumer.

[02:52:06.050 --> 02:52:06.970]
The people who want to fly.

[02:52:06.970 --> 02:52:12.270]
But it's done to bring pressure on the company that they work for to settle their grievances.

[02:52:12.510 --> 02:52:13.630]
Yeah, but it's still great.

[02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:17.250]
But people who are trying to drive on a street to Miami, they can't settle those grievances.

[02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:20.010]
Yeah, but they still bring grievance on the consumer.

[02:52:20.370 --> 02:52:21.930]
You know, those pilots, when they fly.

[02:52:21.930 --> 02:52:22.490]
I agree.

[02:52:22.850 --> 02:52:23.790]
I couldn't agree anymore.

[02:52:24.410 --> 02:52:26.290]
Okay, Neil, I hope everything works out.

[02:52:26.450 --> 02:52:26.890]
Good for you.

[02:52:26.970 --> 02:52:27.570]
Okay, thanks.

[02:52:27.710 --> 02:52:28.070]
Thank you.

[02:52:28.470 --> 02:52:29.970]
Hope it all comes out in the end.

[02:52:31.170 --> 02:52:31.170]

[02:52:31.170 --> 02:52:34.570]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:35.870]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:52:35.870 --> 02:52:36.130]
Hello.

[02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:37.810]
Yeah, how you doing this afternoon?

[02:52:37.930 --> 02:52:38.390]
Okay, sir.

[02:52:38.550 --> 02:52:40.350]
Yeah, that's what I say that I am at this point.

[02:52:40.530 --> 02:52:43.730]
I am totally indifferent to the alien crisis.

[02:52:44.050 --> 02:52:44.410]
Really excellent.

[02:52:44.810 --> 02:52:46.170]
That's the best way to look at it.

[02:52:46.210 --> 02:52:46.550]
Look at this.

[02:52:47.310 --> 02:52:50.350]
One of the things I wouldn't talk to you about a touch base with you on his desk.

[02:52:50.930 --> 02:52:54.930]
You know, trying to try and improve your quality of life and all Americans' quality of life.

[02:52:55.210 --> 02:52:55.790]
Tell me this.

[02:52:56.010 --> 02:52:59.490]
What do you know, as I spoke to George, I used to the other day of our trip.

[02:52:59.490 --> 02:53:00.330]
But I know not much.

[02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:02.110]
Yeah, about Alan Keyes.

[02:53:02.670 --> 02:53:03.570]
What do I know about him?

[02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:03.950]
Yeah, I know.

[02:53:03.950 --> 02:53:05.110]
I know he's a self-hating sparcer.

[02:53:05.250 --> 02:53:05.630]
I know that.

[02:53:05.730 --> 02:53:06.850]
Hold on, Karen, I know.

[02:53:07.050 --> 02:53:11.890]
He reminds me of the log cabin Republican fags, the people with a death wish.

[02:53:12.250 --> 02:53:13.410]
Here he's like Jews for Hitler.

[02:53:14.250 --> 02:53:18.130]
In addition to which he makes Gary Bauer look like I look like Ted Kennedy.

[02:53:18.270 --> 02:53:23.830]
That's how with his moralistic bull crap and values and guts, he's a bull crap artist, Alan Keyes.

[02:53:23.830 --> 02:53:25.450]
Let me just explain this to you now.

[02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:26.350]
This isn't reality.

[02:53:26.650 --> 02:53:30.970]
The man that's talking about basically reuniting our nation.

[02:53:30.970 --> 02:53:34.530]
They should be bringing a nation back to the principles and which the nation was found.

[02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:35.130]
And what was that?

[02:53:35.270 --> 02:53:38.490]
I'm sticking their nose in everybody's all else's business and being a goody-two shoes.

[02:53:38.610 --> 02:53:39.090]
That was fun.

[02:53:39.390 --> 02:53:43.030]
It's about self-enpowerment, you know, less government, morality.

[02:53:43.350 --> 02:53:44.830]
You know, he's not for self-empowerment.

[02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:48.090]
He's another one of these right wing lunatics that wants to govern in your bedroom.

[02:53:48.210 --> 02:53:48.550]
No, no, no.

[02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:49.510]
That's not something to tell you.

[02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:50.110]
Yes, yes, yes.

[02:53:50.310 --> 02:53:51.250]
I listen to those debates.

[02:53:51.290 --> 02:53:52.550]
I hear the crap he's feeling.

[02:53:52.810 --> 02:53:55.130]
This man really picks the hands off the post.

[02:53:55.230 --> 02:53:57.170]
He wants to give more back to the people.

[02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.830]
Yeah.

[02:53:57.830 --> 02:54:02.610]
And in other words, you let the other candidates in turn know what they have to offer.

[02:54:02.890 --> 02:54:04.390]
They would, they don't have anything to offer.

[02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:09.330]
Alan, because of the fact that you have to be black, therefore you like Alan Keyes.

[02:54:09.350 --> 02:54:09.670]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:10.390]
Because he's black.

[02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:11.870]
Is that what you're telling me, sir?

[02:54:12.130 --> 02:54:12.850]
I mean, that's ridiculous.

[02:54:13.050 --> 02:54:14.370]
No, because I'm a supporter of Bill Clinton.

[02:54:14.610 --> 02:54:15.630]
That has nothing to do with it.

[02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:17.630]
So what did he got going for in this guy?

[02:54:17.710 --> 02:54:18.950]
He's just wasting everybody's time.

[02:54:19.110 --> 02:54:21.770]
He's going to get one percent of the in the primary.

[02:54:21.930 --> 02:54:22.950]
And in exact, that's a problem.

[02:54:22.970 --> 02:54:24.370]
He doesn't have the main recognition.

[02:54:24.730 --> 02:54:27.730]
Otherwise, this gentleman's ideas, values, and principles.

[02:54:27.730 --> 02:54:31.210]
That far exceeds any of the other candidates that I saw on that stage.

[02:54:31.410 --> 02:54:33.290]
I couldn't disagree with him more.

[02:54:33.450 --> 02:54:34.350]
He did, to me, he's the worst.

[02:54:34.590 --> 02:54:35.910]
He's even worse than Gary Bauer.

[02:54:36.170 --> 02:54:37.490]
He's the worst than Papa Bauer.

[02:54:37.690 --> 02:54:40.770]
Yes, and did you hear George Bush or Gary Bauer's speak?

[02:54:41.310 --> 02:54:41.690]
Come on.

[02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:46.310]
You know, George Bush could hardly put together our comprehensible sentence.

[02:54:46.490 --> 02:54:49.430]
Didn't you hear George Bush say, I heard it.

[02:54:49.850 --> 02:54:51.910]
You know, George Bush is running on his father's name.

[02:54:52.210 --> 02:54:53.310]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:54:53.470 --> 02:54:56.350]
I'm not going to defend any dealers because they don't have one candidate.

[02:54:56.350 --> 02:54:58.190]
And that's worth the price of peanuts.

[02:54:58.350 --> 02:54:58.970]
I agree with that.

[02:54:59.110 --> 02:55:01.190]
But Alan Kees is a wasted time, sir.

[02:55:01.530 --> 02:55:06.190]
And when candidates start getting up and moralized and talking about bringing us back to the values,

[02:55:06.310 --> 02:55:08.310]
and all this other crap, he's talking to Kaka.

[02:55:08.530 --> 02:55:10.510]
He ought to go to the ministry, he can make a fortune there.

[02:55:10.690 --> 02:55:13.470]
He ought to start a television ministry and stop wasting this time with his crap.

[02:55:13.810 --> 02:55:19.090]
What kind of, who do you think it's been the idea of the candidate of the end of his isn't participating?

[02:55:19.370 --> 02:55:21.070]
There isn't any good candidate.

[02:55:21.270 --> 02:55:21.690]
Neither party.

[02:55:22.990 --> 02:55:24.350]
No, I'm not being able to.

[02:55:24.350 --> 02:55:26.650]
Why? You asked me a question. I'm talking. I don't like any of them.

[02:55:26.910 --> 02:55:28.210]
Well, I know what the reality is.

[02:55:28.350 --> 02:55:29.370]
I like Mario Cuomo.

[02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:34.050]
You need to pay attention a little bit more with the politics and understand what these people are trying to bring across.

[02:55:34.250 --> 02:55:35.150]
Because let me just say that.

[02:55:35.170 --> 02:55:38.030]
Well, in other words, I need to pay attention more.

[02:55:38.130 --> 02:55:39.950]
I've been watching those debates, even though I'm a Democrat.

[02:55:39.950 --> 02:55:40.990]
I've been watching those debates.

[02:55:41.270 --> 02:55:44.130]
And because I don't agree with your perception of what he says,

[02:55:44.390 --> 02:55:45.710]
therefore I'm not paying enough attention.

[02:55:45.950 --> 02:55:46.950]
No, that's ridiculous.

[02:55:47.170 --> 02:55:48.310]
No, I'm not saying that one thing.

[02:55:48.370 --> 02:55:48.970]
What are you saying?

[02:55:48.970 --> 02:55:51.690]
What I'm saying is this. The guy has some great ideas.

[02:55:51.730 --> 02:55:53.490]
I don't agree with you. I think he's full of crap.

[02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:57.870]
And you can keep staying it over and over again and just wasting your time.

[02:55:57.890 --> 02:55:58.750]
Have a great day, sir.

[02:55:59.050 --> 02:56:01.210]
And stop trying to pedal a guy. It's not going to get 50 votes.

[02:56:02.210 --> 02:56:03.270]
He's got great ideas.

[02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:05.090]
Oh, we got to go back to morality.

[02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:08.170]
And I'm setting this pledge to keep the facts out of the military.

[02:56:08.650 --> 02:56:09.610]
And we want to do this.

[02:56:09.670 --> 02:56:11.010]
And back into church and spirits.

[02:56:11.010 --> 02:56:12.470]
Well, he talks crap.

[02:56:13.290 --> 02:56:14.170]
Let me say it again.

[02:56:14.170 --> 02:56:17.490]
He makes Gary Bowers seem like a raving left wing like Omaha,

[02:56:17.650 --> 02:56:18.490]
Nista, almost.

[02:56:19.170 --> 02:56:21.890]
And Gary Bowers got his card with a swastika on it.

[02:56:21.970 --> 02:56:24.270]
That's how that's how raving part of the right disguise.

[02:56:24.630 --> 02:56:25.150]
Alan Keys.

[02:56:26.090 --> 02:56:29.010]
Just like fags, the logger cabin Republicans,

[02:56:29.450 --> 02:56:32.750]
rich spoil like Alice Rantell, rich spoil little faggots who can't

[02:56:32.750 --> 02:56:33.690]
leave the Republican party.

[02:56:34.450 --> 02:56:36.470]
Because that's the way mommy and daddy brought him up.

[02:56:37.210 --> 02:56:37.670]
Pathetic.

[02:56:39.350 --> 02:56:42.050]
22 before two with five 60 WQM.

[02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:46.570]
Oh, Panthers host the islanders with tonight at National Card

[02:56:46.570 --> 02:56:47.070]
Result Center.

[02:56:47.630 --> 02:56:49.270]
Join the new voices of the Panthers,

[02:56:49.430 --> 02:56:50.790]
Chicks, McDonald and Randy.

[02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:54.250]
Oh, hey, God, Laratha, the capture of the crowd.

[02:56:54.410 --> 02:56:59.650]
Panthers preview starts at seven here on sports radio five 60 Q.A.M.

[02:56:59.870 --> 02:57:01.110]
Neil God.

[02:57:01.450 --> 02:57:02.590]
I'm John Rockers.

[02:57:02.970 --> 02:57:04.850]
You know, when him left this major league baseball,

[02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:07.890]
pinko bag told me I couldn't swing his ball in a burn in cross.

[02:57:07.890 --> 02:57:11.670]
Well, sir, I decided to open my old God damn Christian style restaurant.

[02:57:11.670 --> 02:57:13.510]
Rockers, barbecues.

[02:57:13.850 --> 02:57:17.290]
As Rockers barbecues, we got a full menu and down hole cooking.

[02:57:17.670 --> 02:57:20.110]
Like pop some stew and leg meat grills.

[02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:21.830]
No roasted over a spin.

[02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:25.270]
And ever Friday night, we go Brazilian.

[02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:28.130]
Yeah, that's the raw sashay around the mouth.

[02:57:28.290 --> 02:57:32.190]
They were addressed in love, my skewer, a meat on your table.

[02:57:32.450 --> 02:57:37.410]
We don't let big-sour diggers and Jews in Rockers barbecues.

[02:57:37.990 --> 02:57:38.210]
No.

[02:57:38.610 --> 02:57:40.310]
Okay, it's a 142.

[02:57:40.410 --> 02:57:44.210]
Now, the last call, he was a classic example of what's wrong with a lot of cars.

[02:57:44.410 --> 02:57:46.470]
And he's probably thinking, oh, that's a bitch hung up on me.

[02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:49.110]
I hung up on you because first of all, it's only a four-hour show.

[02:57:49.530 --> 02:57:52.090]
Secondly, you said the same thing over and over at least ten times.

[02:57:52.410 --> 02:57:54.730]
And thirdly, you're trying to sell me something and I'm not buying.

[02:57:55.430 --> 02:57:56.550]
You're entitled to that opinion.

[02:57:56.810 --> 02:57:58.110]
You can elope with Alan Keys.

[02:57:58.310 --> 02:57:59.070]
I'll pack you a sandwich.

[02:57:59.250 --> 02:57:59.650]
I don't care.

[02:57:59.890 --> 02:58:00.590]
Have a great life.

[02:58:01.210 --> 02:58:02.070]
I don't like him.

[02:58:02.110 --> 02:58:02.970]
I don't like what he says.

[02:58:03.330 --> 02:58:05.790]
He's another, not even a friend.

[02:58:05.930 --> 02:58:07.370]
I wouldn't even call him a fringe candidate.

[02:58:07.370 --> 02:58:10.470]
He's not existing except he's in there bugging everybody over here.

[02:58:10.610 --> 02:58:12.570]
He's a perennial waste of time.

[02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:14.750]
So what's the point?

[02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:15.330]
Is there a point?

[02:58:15.710 --> 02:58:16.030]
No.

[02:58:16.370 --> 02:58:16.730]
Thank you.

[02:58:17.250 --> 02:58:19.290]
The point is that Bill Hayes looks really bad.

[02:58:19.290 --> 02:58:20.370]
They're on the gaze of our lives.

[02:58:20.390 --> 02:58:21.330]
Oh, she was to snap.

[02:58:21.430 --> 02:58:22.010]
Oh, my God.

[02:58:22.110 --> 02:58:22.870]
And that bow, huh?

[02:58:23.430 --> 02:58:23.570]
Bow.

[02:58:24.830 --> 02:58:25.830]
17-till-two.

[02:58:25.970 --> 02:58:28.830]
We got Hank Goldberg from Kool City at two, Bougshaabie at six.

[02:58:29.130 --> 02:58:31.750]
Hurricane basketball against Seaton Hall against the girls team.

[02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.830]
Seven o'clock tonight.

[02:58:36.470 --> 02:58:37.270]
Here's Pompey.

[02:58:38.010 --> 02:58:38.650]
Yes, sir.

[02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:39.510]
How are you doing?

[02:58:39.810 --> 02:58:39.950]
Okay.

[02:58:40.170 --> 02:58:40.630]
Turn it down.

[02:58:41.130 --> 02:58:41.670]
Turn it down.

[02:58:41.750 --> 02:58:42.190]
Turn the radio down.

[02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:43.190]
Turn the radio down, Dan.

[02:58:43.250 --> 02:58:44.210]
Turn the radio down.

[02:58:44.290 --> 02:58:44.830]
Do you do it back?

[02:58:44.970 --> 02:58:45.130]
Yeah.

[02:58:45.450 --> 02:58:45.670]
Nail.

[02:58:46.050 --> 02:58:46.350]
Yes, sir.

[02:58:46.890 --> 02:58:49.670]
I just want to tell you, man, you are right on every point.

[02:58:50.330 --> 02:58:50.410]
Okay.

[02:58:51.510 --> 02:58:54.850]
And I remember I'm a third generation Miami.

[02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:58.030]
I remember when there were no coupons in Miami.

[02:58:58.150 --> 02:58:58.310]
Yeah.

[02:58:58.530 --> 02:58:59.530]
Except gardeners.

[02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:01.950]
And it was people.

[02:59:02.110 --> 02:59:04.210]
And the sparks just stayed on their side of the tracks.

[02:59:04.210 --> 02:59:04.970]
Got love them.

[02:59:05.610 --> 02:59:06.150]
You know?

[02:59:07.410 --> 02:59:09.650]
Oh, like I said, Palm Beach and Fort Myers.

[02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:13.110]
And if you forget about Jimmy and Danny, we got four Myers and Palm Beach, Palm Beach and

[02:59:13.110 --> 02:59:13.590]
Fort Myers.

[02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:16.470]
What are we going to do with both of them?

[02:59:16.990 --> 02:59:17.350]
Wow.

[02:59:18.430 --> 02:59:19.530]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.

[02:59:19.610 --> 02:59:21.470]
Now, what is it that he usually says that voice?

[02:59:21.630 --> 02:59:25.330]
He usually says, I'm trying to think of which one he is.

[02:59:26.650 --> 02:59:27.710]
So that red, necky voice.

[02:59:27.870 --> 02:59:28.570]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:59:29.050 --> 02:59:29.290]
Uh-huh.

[02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:31.150]
Yeah, he usually says basically the same thing.

[02:59:31.930 --> 02:59:36.150]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:59:37.770 --> 02:59:38.470]
Here's plantation.

[02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.930]
Hello.

[02:59:39.530 --> 02:59:39.730]
Hello.

[02:59:39.990 --> 02:59:40.590]
Yes, I'm Neil.

[02:59:40.810 --> 02:59:41.030]
Okay.

[02:59:41.310 --> 02:59:44.690]
I love what if you think that the dolphins are going to have a higher run?

[02:59:44.810 --> 02:59:45.690]
Oh, there's an aerosol.

[02:59:47.250 --> 02:59:55.310]
Oh, it looks like those lips have had a lot of practice, Eric.

[02:59:55.430 --> 02:59:56.070]
I don't know what they've been doing.

[02:59:56.650 --> 02:59:58.090]
5, 6, what are you laughing about?

[02:59:58.090 --> 02:59:59.510]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[03:00:00.010 --> 03:00:03.750]
See if some guy who's on TV, for example, or in a way, is pretty, they're right away.

[03:00:03.850 --> 03:00:04.410]
It might have caught him.

[03:00:04.490 --> 03:00:06.710]
You know, but that doesn't make him some kind of a fag.

[03:00:06.810 --> 03:00:08.670]
There are pretty guys who are straight, one or two.

[03:00:09.230 --> 03:00:11.070]
I can't name any at the moment, but, huh?

[03:00:12.610 --> 03:00:15.810]
And I like Nigel, our buddy, McGill, in there who was kind of enough to head.

[03:00:15.870 --> 03:00:17.850]
By the way, Joe Castello was out on Saturday.

[03:00:19.170 --> 03:00:19.930]
Pussy, pussy, pussy.

[03:00:20.290 --> 03:00:22.750]
Mr. Auto racing, Mr. Macho Auto racing guy.

[03:00:23.010 --> 03:00:24.910]
Did he show up there at Nick's flagrest race?

[03:00:24.970 --> 03:00:25.230]
No.

[03:00:25.230 --> 03:00:26.390]
No, was he was threatening to do?

[03:00:26.990 --> 03:00:27.870]
And you want to know why?

[03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:29.110]
Because he was probably a scared.

[03:00:29.530 --> 03:00:32.750]
Just like Volka Bryant came in here and said, well, I'm a scared of those procedures you're

[03:00:32.750 --> 03:00:35.090]
going to go, what kind of a pussy are you, man?

[03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:39.230]
You're like one step away from John Penis who was hyperventilating and passing out that

[03:00:39.230 --> 03:00:40.810]
he had a came in here and drew blood out of my arm.

[03:00:41.770 --> 03:00:42.490]
Yeah, that's right.

[03:00:42.570 --> 03:00:43.250]
A real man here.

[03:00:43.430 --> 03:00:46.530]
Like, I just yesterday stayed through blood again in my doctor's office.

[03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:47.550]
Some young sparts are ladies.

[03:00:47.550 --> 03:00:49.070]
He's a nice job, too, by the way, sweetheart.

[03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:52.430]
We're going to have just a little, as opposed to the usual, big black and blue.

[03:00:52.490 --> 03:00:53.950]
You can barely even see that little prick.

[03:00:54.630 --> 03:00:55.810]
And then what am I armed to?

[03:00:56.930 --> 03:00:58.330]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[03:00:58.590 --> 03:00:59.130]
Here's the facts.

[03:00:59.370 --> 03:01:00.510]
Are you off the Atkins diet?

[03:01:00.750 --> 03:01:00.970]
Why?

[03:01:01.290 --> 03:01:01.930]
How about Nanya?

[03:01:02.250 --> 03:01:02.310]
Huh?

[03:01:02.430 --> 03:01:03.350]
Nanya got them business.

[03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:05.030]
Was I ever on the Atkins diet recently?

[03:01:05.290 --> 03:01:05.430]
No.

[03:01:05.690 --> 03:01:07.170]
I love these people that keep calling up.

[03:01:07.370 --> 03:01:10.150]
But, you know, I'm talking about fish food and all the crap we eat in here.

[03:01:10.270 --> 03:01:11.730]
What is wrong with these people?

[03:01:11.890 --> 03:01:11.930]
Huh?

[03:01:12.190 --> 03:01:13.230]
What is wrong with them?

[03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:17.770]
If you're on the Atkins diet, I'm on a great diet today.

[03:01:17.890 --> 03:01:19.410]
It's called the starvation diet.

[03:01:19.770 --> 03:01:23.090]
It's called the water and gatorade and the fuck it makes you crap.

[03:01:23.090 --> 03:01:23.930]
You're brain's out, Dye.

[03:01:24.170 --> 03:01:24.990]
That's it today.

[03:01:25.510 --> 03:01:27.790]
And I guarantee you, tomorrow I'm going to get on that scale.

[03:01:27.790 --> 03:01:29.110]
It's going to be sensational.

[03:01:30.230 --> 03:01:31.530]
It's going to be like a miracle.

[03:01:31.770 --> 03:01:33.830]
When it's out, clean it out.

[03:01:35.930 --> 03:01:37.010]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[03:01:37.170 --> 03:01:37.310]
Hello?

[03:01:38.450 --> 03:01:38.730]
Yes, sir.

[03:01:39.030 --> 03:01:39.790]
Yes, Nanya, how are you doing?

[03:01:39.950 --> 03:01:40.130]
Great.

[03:01:41.070 --> 03:01:42.850]
This is my, I'm a first time caller.

[03:01:43.030 --> 03:01:43.830]
I'm a Cuban American.

[03:01:44.170 --> 03:01:48.830]
And to be quite honest with you, I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these self-serving,

[03:01:49.170 --> 03:01:51.250]
Cuban political ex-alleaders.

[03:01:51.250 --> 03:01:51.770]
I'm coming.

[03:01:52.490 --> 03:01:53.170]
I'm coming.

[03:01:53.650 --> 03:01:53.970]
Right.

[03:01:54.370 --> 03:01:58.590]
Showing their ideologies and their self-righteous beliefs down everyone's throat.

[03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:59.770]
Doubbing it down our throats.

[03:01:59.930 --> 03:02:03.110]
You know, I mean, when first, it was the Orioles going to Cuba.

[03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:04.350]
And then it was Los Bon Bon.

[03:02:04.350 --> 03:02:05.330]
Los Bon Bon, right?

[03:02:05.750 --> 03:02:09.770]
And it's not full of their bunch of hypocrites because I mean the Orioles can't go to Cuba,

[03:02:09.770 --> 03:02:13.890]
but yet every Pepe and Ofeli and Hialeah can go and take American dollars to Fadel.

[03:02:14.090 --> 03:02:14.210]
Right.

[03:02:14.290 --> 03:02:15.810]
And what's the purpose of the embargo then?

[03:02:16.010 --> 03:02:16.150]
Right.

[03:02:16.290 --> 03:02:20.470]
Then you got Los Bon Bon coming and they're playing and then people just want to go and enjoy the music.

[03:02:20.470 --> 03:02:21.890]
and they got a bunch of people

[03:02:21.890 --> 03:02:23.090]
and they're not out there

[03:02:24.090 --> 03:02:26.110]
I said this last week and I'll say it again

[03:02:26.110 --> 03:02:29.730]
how can the same people who have no concept of what freedom is all about?

[03:02:29.890 --> 03:02:31.610]
be out there in the streets, you know, lead back that

[03:02:31.610 --> 03:02:34.810]
lead back that when they have been standing in a way for years now

[03:02:34.810 --> 03:02:37.590]
a real liberty and date counting and turning into a banana republic

[03:02:37.590 --> 03:02:42.150]
where they judge and permit whatever they like and whatever they don't like can't be here

[03:02:42.150 --> 03:02:44.770]
that's not liberty, that's fascism which of course they know a lot about

[03:02:45.470 --> 03:02:48.490]
Exactly, and we'll deal with that basically all I had to say

[03:02:48.490 --> 03:02:50.510]
and I'm a first time call and I love your show

[03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:51.270]
keep up the good work

[03:02:51.270 --> 03:02:52.390]
Alright pal, I'll pray for us

[03:02:52.390 --> 03:02:52.750]
Take care

[03:02:52.750 --> 03:02:52.950]
Thanks

[03:02:53.470 --> 03:02:56.530]
Come on Baruch, I taught him I'd barre-sheet, Baraha, I have a barre-sheet

[03:02:56.530 --> 03:02:57.630]
what kind of a statement is that, huh?

[03:02:58.230 --> 03:03:00.830]
They knew they're barre-sheet in the Bible, those hebrus

[03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:03.130]
That's what it says in the beginning

[03:03:03.130 --> 03:03:05.850]
Barre-sheet, Baraha, I don't know what whatever that means

[03:03:06.530 --> 03:03:06.890]
Harret?

[03:03:07.950 --> 03:03:10.410]
Hey, I know my damn Bible crap that hebrus stuff

[03:03:10.410 --> 03:03:11.930]
huh? A bunch of garbage is what it is

[03:03:11.930 --> 03:03:12.650]
Silly stuff

[03:03:13.590 --> 03:03:14.850]
Fairy tales for adults

[03:03:14.850 --> 03:03:17.570]
In the beginning God created a deep, the Buparaya right

[03:03:17.570 --> 03:03:18.630]
and it was good

[03:03:18.630 --> 03:03:20.710]
Well if it's so good, how come they got to go look at my

[03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:22.550]
uh, breakfast tomorrow, huh?

[03:03:22.870 --> 03:03:24.610]
If it's so good, he saw it was good

[03:03:24.610 --> 03:03:26.030]
I hope they see it's good

[03:03:27.850 --> 03:03:32.130]
No seriously, what kind of a person will believe in about all the disease in the

[03:03:32.130 --> 03:03:34.590]
uh, the suffering and the crap and the world

[03:03:34.590 --> 03:03:37.550]
Oh, God, he has a plan like Roger Nielsen says

[03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:40.490]
You know, I wish you luck Roger, but stop talking a religious crap, okay?

[03:03:42.290 --> 03:03:45.090]
He's got a plan for me and whatever it is I can accept it

[03:03:45.090 --> 03:03:46.850]
Better be, Baraboya, okay Roger

[03:03:47.710 --> 03:03:49.670]
And by the way, we don't want Wendell Clark

[03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:52.550]
Here's Miami, hello

[03:03:53.610 --> 03:03:54.370]
I'm going to you

[03:03:54.370 --> 03:03:55.950]
Yes, how are you doing?

[03:03:56.250 --> 03:03:58.490]
I'm doing pretty good, my buddy Erickson right now go ahead

[03:03:58.490 --> 03:04:02.510]
Yeah, I just wanted to, uh, I don't know if the Cubans

[03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:05.150]
all they have to say about the protesting and stuff

[03:04:05.590 --> 03:04:07.490]
is how did this country come about

[03:04:07.490 --> 03:04:10.570]
of protesting on the Tea Party protesting but hey

[03:04:11.090 --> 03:04:13.570]
I mean, I don't know what I mean, I'm waiting

[03:04:13.570 --> 03:04:17.890]
Wait a minute sir, you're talking about people who are fighting for their freedom

[03:04:17.890 --> 03:04:19.450]
against the tyranny of the British

[03:04:19.450 --> 03:04:21.390]
What exactly are you going to say?

[03:04:21.630 --> 03:04:21.730]
What?

[03:04:22.050 --> 03:04:23.670]
That's it, that was the second I was going to say

[03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:26.330]
People were protesting for freedom in the United States

[03:04:26.330 --> 03:04:29.290]
Yes, now you have all these Cubans, Pidot, fly chopping Cuba

[03:04:29.290 --> 03:04:32.110]
Wow, they have to run, wearing Cuba, no here

[03:04:32.110 --> 03:04:32.490]
Right

[03:04:32.490 --> 03:04:37.190]
And knowing to people that really, I mean, uh, on Camilo

[03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:40.990]
If you wanted to do it a bit of a tyrant like, supposedly a Pidot

[03:04:40.990 --> 03:04:45.350]
Sir, he's not going anywhere, he's not leaving, he's not going

[03:04:45.350 --> 03:04:49.810]
No, my message is that the 200 Cubans that the 200

[03:04:49.810 --> 03:04:53.050]
The 200 Cubans that were protesting is if you want to go rid of Pidot

[03:04:53.050 --> 03:04:54.990]
Go to Cuba and go rid of Pidot

[03:04:54.990 --> 03:05:00.430]
Because Pidot is just laughing his eyes off looking, you know, just looking at the kind of claps they're doing over here

[03:05:00.430 --> 03:05:03.410]
He's looking at crap, okay, thank you sir, a lot of people looking at crap this week

[03:05:03.410 --> 03:05:06.350]
That seems to be what it's all about

[03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:08.430]
A lot of people looking at crap

[03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:29.130]

[03:06:28.810 --> 03:06:32.130]
I call it a retro virus, 1042 at 560 WQM A.

[03:06:32.130 --> 03:06:34.690]
Only one South Florida radio station.

[03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:37.670]
You're the thing to do it.

[03:06:37.870 --> 03:06:42.910]
A Goldberg weekday afternoon to 2 sports radio 560 QAM.

[03:06:43.190 --> 03:06:44.170]
A find out for Friday.

[03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:46.710]
Swing clubs swing and unsaturday night.

[03:06:47.470 --> 03:06:49.590]
The price is admission, $150.

[03:06:51.150 --> 03:06:53.670]
Vodalabacardi rum, $17.99.

[03:06:54.110 --> 03:06:55.510]
When it's on sale at Albert's,

[03:06:56.330 --> 03:06:57.290]
Consura-acceptives,

[03:06:57.330 --> 03:07:00.470]
three, the look on Jocoscillo's face.

[03:07:00.730 --> 03:07:03.290]
When he sees a pair of an old man's losing balls,

[03:07:03.630 --> 03:07:04.770]
hovering over his face,

[03:07:05.490 --> 03:07:07.390]
Christlitz, Master Nation Guard.

[03:07:07.770 --> 03:07:09.870]
It's everywhere a race car driver wants to be.

[03:07:10.370 --> 03:07:11.290]
If he can't drive a stick.

[03:07:11.690 --> 03:07:12.130]
All right.

[03:07:12.290 --> 03:07:12.830]
What timing?

[03:07:13.010 --> 03:07:13.370]
All right.

[03:07:13.570 --> 03:07:14.490]
I told you we could even.

[03:07:15.470 --> 03:07:15.710]
Woo!

[03:07:16.210 --> 03:07:16.610]
Heavy!

[03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.670]
Duty.

[03:07:19.730 --> 03:07:20.210]
$155.

[03:07:21.850 --> 03:07:23.490]
I wish you could see yourself in a mirror.

[03:07:23.630 --> 03:07:24.670]
George just turned purple.

[03:07:24.670 --> 03:07:25.010]
Wow.

[03:07:25.350 --> 03:07:26.350]
You had to have been there.

[03:07:26.670 --> 03:07:27.110]
Yeah, okay.

[03:07:29.390 --> 03:07:30.130]
$155.5.

[03:07:30.130 --> 03:07:30.710]
$50.00.

[03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:31.770]
I don't want to be there.

[03:07:31.850 --> 03:07:32.270]
Believe me.

[03:07:32.770 --> 03:07:33.210]
Trust me.

[03:07:33.710 --> 03:07:34.690]
Now if Eric might have been there,

[03:07:34.850 --> 03:07:35.510]
like over in the corner.

[03:07:36.470 --> 03:07:37.770]
Here's a mobile and four-later Dale.

[03:07:37.890 --> 03:07:38.030]
Hello.

[03:07:38.730 --> 03:07:39.010]
Dale.

[03:07:39.250 --> 03:07:39.370]
Yes.

[03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:41.430]
Two quick things on the,

[03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:43.850]
I was talking about the Panthers about May,

[03:07:44.010 --> 03:07:44.630]
but first,

[03:07:44.930 --> 03:07:45.850]
like the Panthers.

[03:07:45.930 --> 03:07:46.550]
I remember them.

[03:07:47.050 --> 03:07:48.250]
Before that, I could talk to them,

[03:07:48.350 --> 03:07:49.250]
a quick thing about aliens.

[03:07:49.770 --> 03:07:52.150]
This kid does not need the courtroom.

[03:07:52.410 --> 03:07:53.670]
He does not need Disney World.

[03:07:53.670 --> 03:07:54.830]
Let's get him on the field.

[03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:57.050]
If he could drill the ball over a thousand hours,

[03:07:57.310 --> 03:07:58.670]
he can't take the Panthers.

[03:07:58.750 --> 03:07:58.890]
Okay.

[03:07:58.990 --> 03:07:59.870]
Moving out of the Panthers.

[03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:01.750]
Panthers, go Panthers.

[03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.610]
Okay, great.

[03:08:03.070 --> 03:08:03.950]
Here's D'Arral.

[03:08:04.090 --> 03:08:04.250]
Hello.

[03:08:05.130 --> 03:08:05.530]
I knew.

[03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:06.070]
Yes, sir.

[03:08:06.530 --> 03:08:07.690]
I have a little question for you.

[03:08:08.410 --> 03:08:08.530]
Okay.

[03:08:09.090 --> 03:08:11.830]
I want to buy the best of Neal Rogers in 1989.

[03:08:12.290 --> 03:08:12.510]
Uh-huh.

[03:08:12.870 --> 03:08:13.530]
I saw the CD.

[03:08:13.970 --> 03:08:14.650]
I'll sell, I'll sell it.

[03:08:14.670 --> 03:08:15.030]
I'll sell it.

[03:08:15.310 --> 03:08:16.170]
On the 24th.

[03:08:16.210 --> 03:08:19.710]
I've got to buy from center one.

[03:08:20.130 --> 03:08:21.170]
I've got to buy from center one.

[03:08:21.310 --> 03:08:21.450]
Right.

[03:08:21.450 --> 03:08:22.930]
How do I go about doing that?

[03:08:23.630 --> 03:08:23.950]
954.

[03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:25.030]
954.

[03:08:25.950 --> 03:08:26.270]
563.

[03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.310]
563.

[03:08:27.790 --> 03:08:28.110]
3600.

[03:08:28.490 --> 03:08:30.630]
Or you can also get it right off our website,

[03:08:30.750 --> 03:08:31.510]
Neal Rogers.com.

[03:08:31.650 --> 03:08:32.490]
You can buy it off our website.

[03:08:32.950 --> 03:08:33.270]
Okay.

[03:08:33.730 --> 03:08:33.730]

[03:08:34.250 --> 03:08:34.570]
That's all.

[03:08:34.650 --> 03:08:34.950]
Thank you.

[03:08:35.430 --> 03:08:35.750]
Thanks.

[03:08:36.030 --> 03:08:36.390]
Thanks a lot.

[03:08:36.910 --> 03:08:37.470]
There you go.

[03:08:37.810 --> 03:08:39.710]
I should mention that more often than once at the end of the year.

[03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:41.010]
Comes, the thing is all over.

[03:08:41.070 --> 03:08:42.650]
You can still get them there on Neal Rogers.com.

[03:08:42.750 --> 03:08:44.230]
Which Eric does a great job on, by the way.

[03:08:44.370 --> 03:08:45.010]
Thank you, Eric.

[03:08:45.910 --> 03:08:48.370]
Or you can just call center one or even go right to center one

[03:08:48.370 --> 03:08:49.110]
and pick it up there.

[03:08:50.390 --> 03:08:51.010]
Here's Miami.

[03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.330]
Hello.

[03:08:51.790 --> 03:08:52.470]
Hi Neal.

[03:08:52.590 --> 03:08:52.910]
Yes sir.

[03:08:52.950 --> 03:08:54.470]
For a great time on Saturday.

[03:08:55.150 --> 03:08:58.030]
I was the person with the Zeta 4 picture.

[03:08:58.610 --> 03:08:58.770]
Right.

[03:08:59.110 --> 03:09:00.390]
With the bird and my brother.

[03:09:00.650 --> 03:09:00.830]
Yes.

[03:09:01.390 --> 03:09:02.270]
Thank you very much.

[03:09:02.310 --> 03:09:03.150]
You had a great time.

[03:09:03.950 --> 03:09:05.210]
And I don't want to cut it short,

[03:09:05.210 --> 03:09:07.590]
but I just want to say hello to my father.

[03:09:07.770 --> 03:09:10.010]
And why don't you go back to Brooklyn and stay there.

[03:09:10.250 --> 03:09:12.050]
And John Pean is like, oh!

[03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.970]
Oh!

[03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:18.190]
I would want to say, obsessed with the words of this guy.

[03:09:18.190 --> 03:09:19.210]
And his brother, were they obsessed?

[03:09:19.710 --> 03:09:20.270]
A little bit obsessed?

[03:09:20.650 --> 03:09:20.830]
Yes!

[03:09:21.210 --> 03:09:21.370]
Right.

[03:09:22.050 --> 03:09:23.410]
But you know, they met well.

[03:09:24.410 --> 03:09:25.430]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[03:09:25.710 --> 03:09:25.890]
Yes.

[03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:27.090]
I'm Neal. First time caller.

[03:09:27.310 --> 03:09:27.570]
All right.

[03:09:27.930 --> 03:09:29.110]
Hey, I just want to let you know,

[03:09:29.250 --> 03:09:31.010]
not all good looking guys are gay.

[03:09:31.170 --> 03:09:31.870]
I got his friends.

[03:09:32.170 --> 03:09:32.870]
Very good looking.

[03:09:32.930 --> 03:09:33.750]
Great as an arrow.

[03:09:33.930 --> 03:09:35.150]
I got a girlfriend every week.

[03:09:35.550 --> 03:09:37.010]
Tell her if I was gay, I'd date them.

[03:09:37.890 --> 03:09:38.950]
You know, just, uh, fun.

[03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:39.310]
Yes sir.

[03:09:39.570 --> 03:09:43.290]
This is a stupid stereotype that a lot of people think that if a guy is pretty,

[03:09:43.530 --> 03:09:45.530]
you know, pretty boys, well they must be, you know.

[03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:46.690]
Yeah, from where it's from.

[03:09:46.690 --> 03:09:47.490]
I'm pretty straight.

[03:09:47.770 --> 03:09:49.010]
So, but they're out there.

[03:09:49.230 --> 03:09:50.450]
So, women, you know, don't worry.

[03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:51.030]
Okay.

[03:09:51.130 --> 03:09:51.610]
I'll find you.

[03:09:51.690 --> 03:09:51.890]
Thanks.

[03:09:52.530 --> 03:09:54.370]
And of course, one thing about pretty guys, they're all available.

[03:09:54.490 --> 03:09:55.030]
They're all ready.

[03:09:55.130 --> 03:09:56.030]
They're all hot and horny.

[03:09:56.350 --> 03:09:56.570]
Uh-huh.

[03:09:58.110 --> 03:10:00.350]
And if not, uh, you know, just to keep trying.

[03:10:01.590 --> 03:10:04.350]
567-0560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T line.

[03:10:04.490 --> 03:10:05.270]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[03:10:06.730 --> 03:10:07.590]
Miami, yes sir.

[03:10:07.930 --> 03:10:08.950]
Yeah, first time caller.

[03:10:09.190 --> 03:10:09.490]
All right.

[03:10:09.690 --> 03:10:13.470]
And Dotscapee, I had one approximately four months ago.

[03:10:13.650 --> 03:10:13.930]
Okay.

[03:10:14.370 --> 03:10:15.350]
I found like you survived.

[03:10:15.350 --> 03:10:16.490]
Not until it.

[03:10:16.710 --> 03:10:16.830]
Right.

[03:10:17.410 --> 03:10:18.490]
So, you kind of put me down.

[03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:20.710]
I woke up, went home, went about my business.

[03:10:21.930 --> 03:10:22.590]
Good luck, buddy.

[03:10:22.810 --> 03:10:23.090]
Thanks.

[03:10:23.270 --> 03:10:23.490]
Thanks.

[03:10:23.730 --> 03:10:26.970]
See, it's a piece of cake and both of Brian's in here, hyperventilating and peeing all over

[03:10:26.970 --> 03:10:28.990]
himself, and he's not even the one that's going to go do it.

[03:10:30.030 --> 03:10:33.530]
That have changed his underwear two or three times after I told him, you know, uh, and you

[03:10:33.530 --> 03:10:35.110]
ought to be doing it all far like you.

[03:10:35.450 --> 03:10:37.970]
Not the end of us could be, but certainly the colonoscopy, yeah.

[03:10:38.810 --> 03:10:42.350]
After 40, you got to let him stick it in your rectum and that camera too.

[03:10:43.390 --> 03:10:46.370]
I'm telling you right now because better be safe than sorry.

[03:10:46.430 --> 03:10:46.770]
Rectum.

[03:10:47.070 --> 03:10:47.770]
Spread him.

[03:10:48.370 --> 03:10:49.670]
Is it book them or spread them?

[03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:50.410]
I forget how that goes.

[03:10:50.990 --> 03:10:52.590]
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach, huh?

[03:10:53.950 --> 03:10:54.130]
Neil.

[03:10:54.330 --> 03:10:55.730]
I think Jack Lourd used to say spread them.

[03:10:55.790 --> 03:10:56.110]
Yes, sir.

[03:10:56.650 --> 03:10:58.430]
Yeah, I just want to talk to your sidekick, George.

[03:10:58.710 --> 03:11:01.470]
You gave me some good advice on the club down there and I appreciate it.

[03:11:01.530 --> 03:11:01.730]
Yeah.

[03:11:02.230 --> 03:11:04.490]
Strap me in Fort Lauderdale outstanding.

[03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:05.210]
Yes, sir.

[03:11:06.210 --> 03:11:06.770]
I'm thankful.

[03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.430]
Okay.

[03:11:07.470 --> 03:11:08.170]
Thanks a lot George.

[03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.990]
Oh, you're welcome.

[03:11:08.990 --> 03:11:13.150]
You're a good time there and he was applying his hands out for everybody good, including I think Joe Castello.

[03:11:14.290 --> 03:11:15.030]
Okay, do we have time?

[03:11:15.250 --> 03:11:15.630]
Maybe for one.

[03:11:15.730 --> 03:11:16.790]
Here's a mobile in plantation.

[03:11:17.070 --> 03:11:17.230]
Hello.

[03:11:17.890 --> 03:11:18.430]
I knew.

[03:11:18.670 --> 03:11:18.970]
Yes, sir.

[03:11:19.310 --> 03:11:20.190]
He first time called.
