[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]
Present the Neil Rogers

[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.480]
John John

[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.920]
How to Neil call 566-70560 toll free for dated records

[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.600]
John John

[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.580]
Or round 560 on your cell phone

[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.980]
The opinions of Neil, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show did not necessarily reflect those of the QAM

[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.120]
Beasley read acquisitions or the Beasley broadcast group

[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.360]
Now, Neil Rogers on sports radio 566-Q-A-T

[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.920]
Arricite!

[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.800]
F***ing blow

[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.100]
I'm John Rogers

[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.880]
You know what Emma left us made to leave baseball, think ol' bag told me I couldn't swing it to fall in a fern and cross-wellsert?

[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.280]
I decided up on my own goddamn Christian style restaurant

[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.800]
Rocker's barbecue

[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.900]
As Rocker's barbecue, we got a full menu with down-hole cookin'

[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.620]
Like awesome stew and mega-need-grill

[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.440]
Full roasted over a sped

[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.900]
And ever-fried a night week over in Zillian

[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.800]
Yee-haw

[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.480]
That's where I'll sashay around to my favorite dress

[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.700]
And lock my skewer on meat on your table

[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.760]
We don't expect so diggers and Jews and Rockers, Barbecue

[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.280]
No

[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.040]
Okay, 10-1 at 560-WQ-A-M

[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.180]
Scumbags and the scumbags who had worshipped it and mired them

[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.400]
I told you that's gonna be the name of my new book

[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.120]
Kevin, I said that for many, many months now

[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.920]
I'm just gonna be saying it in my book

[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.800]
I should start working on it right away in the book too

[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.320]
This John Rocker thing, I mean this goes to show you

[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.660]
Two big stories on the same day

[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.400]
You got these two people, in fact, somebody fashed me just the bear facts

[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.520]
Because Rila Lewis wasn't implicated at that time

[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.680]
Leighton the show yesterday, I didn't bother with it

[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.560]
Because you know, a couple of murders after the Super Bowl

[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260]
We figured that's gonna happen probably most time

[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.000]
Sure, in America, that's you, Merck and F and Y, man

[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.200]
But now we find XUM star faces murder charge

[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.120]
All right, and we got some assholes on this radio station

[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.600]
Who are like, you know, oh no, that couldn't possibly be true

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.460]
Dumb Jack?

[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.260]
Yeah, I don't want to mention any names, Joe

[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.140]
Always looking to defend the defenseless

[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.580]
Oh, yeah, but he was a nice guy and he did never stole a freight train

[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.620]
Yeah, just like Cecil

[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.400]
Remember those days with Cecil, who was just trying to dip his wick

[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.360]
And then even after he finally confessed

[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.220]
And after the horse was out of the barn

[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.720]
And after they ran out of excuses

[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.640]
Well, he was just trying to take a look

[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.820]
All you kids out there

[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.080]
All you young guys, you see some hot paid walking on the street

[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.160]
Maybe living in your neighborhood

[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.660]
And you want to see what she looks like

[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.180]
Like naked in bed though

[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.860]
So she got a chance to like cover up a little bit

[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.860]
You just go there to the house

[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.760]
You know, in the wee hours in the morning when you're pretty sure

[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.080]
Anybody in the house is asleep

[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.320]
You remove the screen from the window, of course

[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.520]
And then you like bust in the window

[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.540]
And you go and you take a look

[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.480]
That's all

[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.000]
Or like if you want to fondle somebody out of the covers

[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.220]
I mean, that isn't really rapist

[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.400]
No, you just fondle

[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.960]
I mean, just because you start fondling

[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.420]
Doesn't mean you want to go beyond that, does it?

[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.640]
No

[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.980]
No

[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.920]
Just a little fondling

[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.620]
Which is, you know, maybe he was fond of her

[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.540]
He wanted to fondle

[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.280]
And the people come on this radio station

[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.480]
And they defend this schmit, this crap

[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.580]
This walking excrement on legs

[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.280]
Most of the sports nerds on this station

[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.000]
And you want to know why

[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.820]
Because they are pandering to the sports nerds out there

[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.860]
The ones who say, oh, we don't care how much of a scumbag he was

[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.720]
Just like Latrine Spreeweller

[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.920]
There's another good example for you

[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.940]
We don't care what kind of a scumbag he was

[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.520]
Or how many times he tried to choke the coach

[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.400]
Or what how many girlfriends this one beat up

[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.800]
Or Lawrence Phillips or any of these people

[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.580]
We don't care

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.800]
If they can win us a game

[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.480]
It makes us feel better about ourselves

[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.000]
And maybe even cash a bet

[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.840]
It's tragic

[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.560]
I'm embarrassed, I really am

[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.640]
I mean, I'm embarrassed to be on this radio station for many many reasons

[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.220]
But most of which have to do with a beastly and grey greed

[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.620]
With the fact that these are such a bunch of bogus broadcasters

[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.260]
With this cheap horseball equipment

[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.220]
And the fact that because they got absolutely no competition

[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.660]
I mean, like clear sailing

[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.880]
That, you know, somehow they're able to hang on

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.180]
So I'm embarrassed about that

[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.480]
Not to a verse like Larry Lujack said years ago

[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.960]
Not to a verse to take the money which I'll take gladly

[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.160]
Because I earn it

[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.320]
But embarrassed for what a bogus bunch of

[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.040]
I mean so many of these people

[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.100]
And how many times have I told you that this is part

[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.200]
Of the fraternity slash sports mentality in America

[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.220]
That women are sex objects you can do whatever the hell you want

[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.160]
You can get away with murder, with rape, with anything you want

[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.060]
Drugs, I mean, forget about that

[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.080]
That's not even a contest

[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.060]
And forget about how many people in the NFL now

[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.160]
The National Felon League are scumbags

[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.420]
And murderers and whatever else there

[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.180]
Forget about that

[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.120]
How about the guys like Mark Dupur for example

[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.700]
Anybody seen him lately?

[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.000]
No

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.020]
Guys know they get out

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.860]
And what do they do? They go into a life of a, you know, peddling drugs

[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.880]
And whatever they can get away with

[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.680]
Irving Spice, how's he doing seeing him lately?

[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.920]
No

[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.300]
And so that whole philosophy

[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.940]
It sure worked well for Jimmy, didn't it?

[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.120]
I never met a criminal I didn't like, didn't that work real well?

[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.300]
No

[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.360]
Didn't work out, didn't it?

[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.220]
How's the meat your son downward?

[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.960]
Oh, let's take a stab at that one

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.340]
How's he doing?

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.140]
I mean, there's no question that in all walks of life that there are scumbags

[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.280]
But generally speak like, like if you're a carpenter

[00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.740]
If you're a plumber

[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.320]
If you work for the phone company

[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.920]
And you're a rapist

[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.040]
Nobody's going to make excuses for you

[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.060]
Nobody's going to say, oh gee, but now give them 20 or 30 more chances

[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.840]
Is anybody going to make an excuse?

[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.180]
No

[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.560]
But if you wear a uniform

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.940]
Like a priest, for example, a child molesting priest

[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.320]
Which I mean, God Almighty yesterday was just the 8 millionth in an ongoing series of never-ending stories

[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.160]
Nobody cares

[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.100]
Because you have to have at least 40, 50 more chances

[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.320]
If you have that uniform

[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.120]
But especially if it's a sports uniform

[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.900]
Oh yeah

[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.100]
Because you can run fast or jump high or throw the ball or cat

[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.540]
I heard a little dog in there this morning talking about and him and Geldy both

[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.260]
Oh, maybe the best little linebacker in the game

[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.480]
But maybe who gives a crap?

[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.480]
Who gives a crap?

[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.900]
And yes, he deserves his day in court

[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.640]
But what kind of a story is this?

[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.760]
And what kind of a legacy is you of him left by the way?

[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.640]
Wow

[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.620]
Man, oh man, what a lineup we could have with those, with those conducts, huh?

[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.100]
From UM, the Heracunes

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.820]
And by the way, guess who was started all of that?

[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.060]
Yeah, guess who started all of that?

[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.200]
It wasn't Danny

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.180]
It was, don't say it

[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.340]
Yeah, with those fatigues there, I'll never forget that, you know, the gangster team

[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.460]
That whole mentality

[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.520]
Let's round up all the gangsters and we'll win a bunch of games

[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.700]
We're gonna win, we're gonna win

[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.700]
Make us feel a lot better about ourselves and make a lot of money through the university

[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.720]
Because America respects scumbags

[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.800]
So long as they're the athletes scumbags

[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.120]
You've heard of student athletes, we've got athletes scumbags

[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.760]
And so here's John Rocker who gets suspended until May the 1st, which is the, you mark my words, the union will win on this

[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.960]
They're gonna go back him

[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.400]
And I have no love for the union in any of these sports because they're killing them

[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.080]
They're destroying them with these ridiculous salaries

[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.960]
And baseball's all done anyway

[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.160]
I mean, when a little puts with all the respect that Joe Costello was gonna get a psychotic when I say this

[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.460]
But Derek Geter, he's a very good ball player

[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.320]
Just a minute

[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.120]
Are you gonna sit in there with a straight face

[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.220]
And even though you don't have your Yankee jersey on today and tell me Derek Geter's worth $15 million a year

[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.520]
Nobody is

[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.500]
Nobody is

[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.820]
But I mean, even in the context and perspective with what the other salaries are

[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.180]
It's ludicrous

[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.120]
It's ridiculous

[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.520]
And they're saying, oh, if you think that's something, wait till you see what Griffey's gonna get in Alex Rodriguez

[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.020]
They keep screaming about everybody's losing money and nobody's showing up anymore

[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.820]
And in Marlins you might as well forget about them

[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.040]
All of these sports

[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.920]
And it's like they got some kind of a compulsive death wish they can't give away enough money

[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.500]
Here's this asshole, Paul Taglia, boo-boo, by the way

[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.720]
Who's even dumber than Bud Sealeg

[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.000]
I mean, Bud Sealeg's got an excuse, he's presiding over a dying sport

[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.460]
But as you saw the other night with a Super Bowl, which was record breaking ratings

[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.260]
So as it turned out in the fourth quarter to be hell of a game

[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.920]
People are it, it's alive and well, the NFL

[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.660]
But here's an asshole who's making eight million dollars a year

[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.480]
So of course he's gonna cover off his tracks

[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.120]
He's gonna say whatever's a speeding at the moment

[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.960]
Which I got all of his quotes here

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.480]
But John Rocker is a moron, he opens up a mouth, says bigoted things and by the way, let's face it

[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.780]
How many of you have said the same things that he says all the time

[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.020]
About niggers and fags and Jews and whatever it is

[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.380]
He was just stupid enough to say it in an interview

[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.120]
And he's gonna get suspended until the first of May and lose out on that salary

[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.940]
Because he gave an ugly opinion and pissed people off

[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.640]
Whatever happened to freedom of speech

[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.860]
He's got, he has the right to be an asshole

[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.360]
I think that we ought to make the 11th Amendment to be, you know, or that we already got

[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.760]
What would be 27th, whatever we got now

[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.520]
I'm talking about the Bill of Rights

[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.540]
An additional Bill of Rights, you should have the right to be an asshole

[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.000]
Can anybody argue with that?

[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.300]
No

[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.820]
No

[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.960]
Because God only knows if there's something criminal about being an asshole

[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.920]
We're gonna have to start building a whole lot more jails

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.000]
Just listen to this show yesterday to find that out

[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.560]
Or most days

[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.260]
We got assholes on parade out there

[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.280]
So John Rocker, he's gonna be, we gotta make it look good, see, for baseball

[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.920]
But he looks like we really want to reprimand this guy because these things he said

[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.280]
Or reprehensible, we don't want to piss off Hank here anymore

[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.040]
But all he did was give an ugly opinion

[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.820]
Shared by millions of people out there, by the way

[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.720]
And here we got these murderers and scumbags

[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.620]
And we got people on this radio station making excuses for them

[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.040]
Yeah, he was just trying to dip his work, he was just trying to, well, yeah

[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.440]
Take a look

[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.740]
Things that any adult should be embarrassed to say or think

[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.080]
Embarrassed, humiliated, degraded

[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.200]
Dom Jack

[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.260]
10 past 10 at 560 WQM

[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.640]
Only one South Florida radio station has a number

[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.200]
And you're listening to it at Goldberg

[00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.560]
Weekday afternoons at 2

[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.180]
Sports Radio 560

[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.860]
Q-A-M

[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.000]
Freedom embarrassment

[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.380]
I broken through her bedroom window

[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.220]
All right, all right

[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.300]
And why they don't keep getting out of here

[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.200]
And what I did I knew was critical

[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.440]
But that it doesn't do if you play for the fish

[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.600]
Against my girlfriend for rocker kill me

[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.400]
That is how the bitch went support of his wife

[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.360]
Oh, man

[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.820]
Her surname of her was B. N. N. Wilson

[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.240]
And I found out that it changed me with a knife

[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.340]
Why didn't that bitch tell me?

[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.340]
It was due to our Q-Series

[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.260]
She be in bed with her husband

[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.560]
And that's how the bitch goes down

[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.520]
10 past 10 at 560 WQM

[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.920]
And I'm picking back at that OG business

[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.140]
Especially because he's here in town

[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.260]
We watch you out here, OG

[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.840]
Get down a lot, we hate you like poison

[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.160]
You'll be able to live in any neighborhood down here

[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.240]
I guarantee you that right now

[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.180]
But guaranteed

[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.500]
Unless you move in maybe with SCRWAN and her family

[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.320]
But at any rate

[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.620]
There's another classic example

[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.720]
All those people see there isn't one person in America

[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.540]
With an IQ larger than their small digit

[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.180]
It doesn't know that OG Simpson murdered those two people

[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.340]
Everybody knows that

[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.920]
And he got away with it

[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.880]
And in spite of that

[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.960]
We still have all of these people

[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.040]
Who admire him

[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.520]
All these people that want his autograph

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.400]
All these people that suck up to him

[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.200]
Including several in this radio station

[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.220]
People are obsessed with him

[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.620]
People have his pictures up on the walls in their orifice

[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.040]
Let me say it again in their orifice

[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.540]
Backed him

[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.200]
Yeah, that too

[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.020]
And they don't care

[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.060]
Now like I said if it was the plumber

[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.580]
If it was a guy that came in here on the construction job

[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.260]
And was murdered two people

[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.360]
They say, oh my god

[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.680]
How can you, I'm not coming to work tomorrow

[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.060]
Unless you get that person out of the building

[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.860]
Wouldn't any normal person say that?

[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.320]
Right

[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.680]
And I sure as hell don't want that person living in my hood

[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.700]
But because it's an extract who wore a uniform

[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.480]
And after all, it's in a hall of fame

[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.240]
And Cat Tonto, Ohio, no less

[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.920]
I mean, was there ever any consideration to taking his ass out of there?

[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.060]
No

[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.060]
Even after he was found guilty in the civil trial

[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.840]
He was found responsible

[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:40.740]
No

[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.140]
No

[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:41.740]
Of course not

[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.820]
So this is part of the sickness of American culture today

[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.940]
The glorification and admiration that history

[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.580]
Over the scumiest, trashiest people on the face of the earth

[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.660]
I bet you a Ted Bundy would have been NFL player

[00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.720]
He had gotten a lot more chances

[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.240]
You know, he'd probably still be alive, do you think?

[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.880]
If he could have just, you know, throw it

[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.540]
Maybe he was kind of a small guy if he could have just kicked the ball

[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.000]
He kind of looked like a Linda Murray now that I think of it

[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.020]
With a larger penis is what Joe says

[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.280]
Of course that could have been anybody

[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.660]
Yeah, if he could have been like, you know, a field goal kicker

[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.660]
He would have gotten a lot more breaks

[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.560]
Ravens Lewis arrested after Atlanta slangs

[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.240]
Let's hear it

[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.560]
A few M-star faces murder charge

[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.720]
Police charge Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis

[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.860]
With murder late Monday in the slangs of two people outside in Atlanta nightclub

[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.100]
Hours after the Super Bowl ended

[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.840]
Lewis, a former University of Miami standout

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.320]
Oi

[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.240]
Now with the Baltimore Ravens was charged after a day of investigation

[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.060]
In the slaying at the Cobalt Lounge in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood

[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.000]
Very fancy, fancy neighborhood by the way

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.420]
About 4 a.m. on Monday

[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.780]
Very upscale

[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.780]
Lewis had been thought to be on route to the Pro Bowl game in Hawaii

[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.320]
Was taken into custody, was expected to appear in court today

[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.860]
Two men were stabbed during a fight that broke out just as the party was ending at the club

[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.440]
Witnesses said six men had fought and argued with the two victims

[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.300]
The men left the scene in a black Lincoln 220 navigator limousine leased by Lewis

[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.860]
As several shots were fired

[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.060]
From inside the vehicle

[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.460]
Police said the limousine had Maryland license

[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.480]
Placed was leased from a Baltimore company called all stretched out limousine service

[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.260]
When in doubt, we're all stretched out

[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.200]
The vehicle was found in a parking lot behind a hotel near the shooting scene at Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley

[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.700]
Said, Quigley and Georgia Bureau of Investigations spokesman John Bankhead

[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.000]
Both said it could not release the tales of the investigation

[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.600]
Reached by the Baltimore Sun before he was charged, Lewis said

[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.680]
I cooperated fully as for the situation

[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.900]
I be having no comment

[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.360]
One man died of the scene, another victim died of grading Memorial Hospital

[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:45.480]
The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office identified the victims as Jacinta Baker, 21 and Richard Lawler, 24 both of Atlanta

[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.580]
The 24-year-old Lewis from Lakeland became the second NFL player this month charged with murder

[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.040]
Not just like armed robbery, not like cocaine, the traffic and murder

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.500]
Of course, it's still pending, you do understand that

[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.400]
The bodies are still almost warmed

[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:08.560]
On January 4, Caroline of Panthers, while receiver Ray Caruth was charged with first to be murdered on the shooting death of Cherika Adams

[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.440]
Who was pregnant with their son

[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.920]
That was one of my all-time favorites

[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.180]
She was pregnant with their son

[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.400]
Of course, were they married?

[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:16.680]
No

[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.260]
No, but that also was the American F and Way

[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.400]
Especially in certain segments of our population, I don't want to mention no ethnic or racial things here

[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.460]
You know, a lot of deadies and a lot of mommies and not necessarily a lot of weddings

[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.420]
Just last Friday in the state of the NFL Address

[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.660]
Commissioner Paul Tangany of Boo Boo commented on the recent rash of criminal charges against current NFL players

[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.860]
Can we separate ourselves from society? He asked of course not

[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.960]
We can't predict what NFL players will do anymore than we can predict student shootings

[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.360]
Other students shooting other students or workers shooting fellow workers

[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:53.820]
The son reported that Ravens officials as well as fellow players were concerned about the friends Lewis had become acquainted with during the past three months

[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.320]
On December 6, the salt charges were filed against Lewis after an incident in the Baltimore County bar

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.980]
According to a police report,

[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.580]
Cautrice Parker, 24 of Baltimore, said Lewis Drucker on the left side of her face and she fell into the bar

[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.660]
Lewis is expected to stand trial on that charge early next week

[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.800]
So he got to be busy

[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.100]
I don't think he's going to make it out to Hawaii, do you know the Pro Bowl?

[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.360]
No

[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.240]
He got to be too busy

[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.820]
And here's his comment, this is my favorite

[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.180]
This is the best right on the heels of the God Squad

[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.540]
Pointing out that Super Bowl in the last couple of minutes on Sunday

[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.480]
Lewis, when asked about the incident, said about the two incidents, says

[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.880]
The devil is busy always after God's children

[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.520]
He is always trying to get you one way or another

[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.200]
Yeah

[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.400]
Think on it long and hard

[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.980]
Let me say it again

[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.800]
Because those are words of great wisdom

[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.720]
All your kids out there

[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.580]
This from the upstanding U of M graduate Ray Lewis

[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.400]
Great NFL superstar from the Baltimore Ravens

[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.280]
He says, the devil is busy always after God's children

[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.540]
He's always trying to get you one way or another

[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.940]
When asked about whether he was concerned about his friends and his relationship with the Ravens Lewis said

[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.500]
It is something I'll discuss with him but not something I can be talking about now

[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.500]
End of quote

[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:14.620]
And in this long story by the way, somebody facts me from the internet on the MSNBC webpage

[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.900]
Ken Rosenthaw, who is also a comments for the Baltimore Center and writes for MSNBC

[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.640]
writes about all these things

[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.080]
And basically says that Paul Tagley, who is a bullcrap artist that he's just trying to cover up

[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.720]
He says, according to a book published last year, Pros and Cons, where did we hear about that?

[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.960]
See, I remember having those guys on and talking about the book and encouraging a lot of you to go out and buy it

[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.800]
And I kept wondering, how come the, say, I mean, this isn't the sports show

[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.380]
How come this is a sports station

[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.620]
And all he talked about here is basically football anyway

[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.560]
And here's a very provocative book about the NFL and the scumbags who are playing in it and have played in it

[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.860]
And I'm the guy that had him on the ear

[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.320]
The authors did this book and I'm the one that's talking about it

[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.560]
And the rest of these people are trying to cover it up

[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.060]
Just like the hockey people who do their best to cover up that book that I talked about also

[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.200]
They don't know, we don't want to read that

[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.860]
No, because there's too much truth in it

[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.780]
There's too much truth about guys with uniforms who are given the entitlement to rape and abuse

[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.540]
And beat up that crap out of women out of their women, so to speak or any women they come across

[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.240]
And I said, come across

[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.040]
Squirt, Squirt, right

[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.620]
And he just, he just want to get a look

[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.840]
He just want to take a little look

[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.780]
And basically do whatever the hell he wants

[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.860]
It's the fraternity mentality

[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.620]
Boys will be boys and women are just sex objects

[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.040]
That's all to be used and abused and beaten to crap up

[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.440]
It's the pimple mentality

[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.900]
Use them and abuse them and lose them

[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.120]
It says according to a book published last year, pros and cons, the criminals who play in the NFL

[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.080]
21%

[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:52.120]
21% that's a little more than one out of every five NFL players have been charged with serious crimes ranging from domestic abuse to murder

[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.220]
21% and Paul Tagli-Bouss

[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.140]
Oh, well, we're doing a lot better than the regular population out there

[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.980]
Do you know any murder personally?

[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160]
Do you know any murders?

[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.620]
Anybody who's murdered somebody?

[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.220]
No, I don't

[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.840]
And I've lived a lot longer than you have

[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.700]
I never, I don't know anybody who, at least to my knowledge, has murdered anybody

[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.780]
I don't know anybody who's raped anybody

[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.760]
I don't know anybody who's beaten up their wife

[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.260]
Personally, I mean, you know, maybe

[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.900]
That I know of

[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.180]
And anyway, this column by Ken Rosenthali says

[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.320]
In the trend certainly doesn't appear to be diminishing

[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.220]
The shocking crime that led to Karuta's arrest made national hit line

[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.940]
And the day after Karuta was found hiding in the trunk of a car

[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.460]
Limey Rookie Rob running back

[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.600]
Cecil Collins with charge with burglary

[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.300]
How do you like that?

[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:41.820]
Hi!

[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.420]
Tennessee Cornerback, Denard Walker

[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:51.220]
The player beaten by Isaac Bruce for the winning touchdown catch in Super Bowl 34 is on probation after being charged last summer for assaulting a former girlfriend

[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.160]
And let's not forget St. Louis Linebacker Leonard Little

[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.260]
Who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter last summer after killing a woman as a drunk driver

[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.800]
Little sentenced to 90 at night in jail, 90 nights in jail

[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.260]
A thousand hours community service in four years probation played in the Super Bowl

[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.200]
Oh, right!

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.900]
It says to think Louis has always represented everything that was right with the Ravens

[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.100]
He was one of their first two round picks in their inaugural season

[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.080]
They're leading Tackler almost from the moment he joined the team and undersized Linebacker who made it big

[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.880]
Louis plays with unmatched passion, breathtaking speed and terrific strength

[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.820]
He's the kind of player who inspires fathers to save their sons, that's how you play the game

[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.640]
But as associations began raising concerns among his teammates this season

[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.640]
The Ravens gave Louis a four-year, listen to this, this will make you up-chuck

[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.320]
You know, those sandwiches you're reading in there that you will puke your guts out

[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.460]
The Ravens gave Louis a four-year 26 million dollar contract

[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.040]
with a seven million dollar signing bonus when he was 23

[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.300]
It was the correct decision from a football standpoint, but who knows, maybe it was too much too soon

[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.680]
Two players charged with murder in two months, whether Tackleable admits it or not

[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.940]
The NFL has a problem that says Ken Rosenthal and MSNBC this morning

[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.000]
And in the Baltimore Sun

[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.320]
A big fat fricking problem they got, disgusting, embarrassing, humiliating

[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.980]
That statistic again, 21% of the NFL players have been charged with serious crimes

[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.740]
Ranging from domestic abuse to murder

[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.540]
And these people on this radio stage now others, and of course they have scumbag

[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.420]
Listen to this sports nerds

[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.200]
Well don't tell us those things, we don't care, we don't care

[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.640]
All we can care about is if they can play ball

[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.780]
There's a whole separate, different set of rules for athletes

[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.280]
It's like when they go to college, do they have to go to class?

[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:37.540]
No

[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.300]
Do they have to buy a textbook?

[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:38.560]
No

[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.720]
Do they have to get any real grade?

[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:39.960]
No

[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.140]
Do they have to take any real courses?

[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:41.420]
No

[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:41.920]
No

[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.860]
What a hypocritical buncher schmit

[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.740]
And we're always hearing people with this, you know, because it's politically correct

[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.000]
Even though they don't really give a crap

[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.620]
All the education is so bad, our kids are going to school

[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.060]
They've got them quonsed up if they really cared, it wouldn't be like that

[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.060]
But they don't really care

[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.400]
Just like that Tyson thing they have a knife

[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.980]
Just another classic example

[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.660]
Here is one of the, I mean I can't find enough adjectives to describe what a scumbag

[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.420]
This guy is

[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.420]
And no matter how many chances he gets, he goes out and does some other aberrant thing again

[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.420]
It's just a matter of time

[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.660]
And when he was over there in London, just goes out of his way to be obnoxious

[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.680]
And they can ask a lot of himself and abuse and do whatever the hell he can

[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.640]
And there's still outside his hotel, outside his big hotel suite there

[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.620]
It comes out on the balcony like the frickin' Pope

[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.260]
And there's cheering out there

[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.680]
And then he goes out and beats some fat tub of crap

[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.880]
In about two and a half minutes and gets eight million dollars for it

[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.280]
AHHHHH! You people out there are subsidizing it, you love it, you can't get enough of it

[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.900]
And it makes me sick

[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.680]
Makes me learn a barf

[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.860]
Makes me wish that sports, as much as I love my hockey, I would be willing to sacrifice

[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.280]
All of it would just go away

[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.400]
This society would be vastly improved if sports would disappear from the landscape

[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.520]
And we get back to the business of having a brain and educating people

[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.400]
And having our priorities straight on top, as opposed to upside down

[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.440]
I think I could survive

[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.700]
I think life would go on somehow

[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.780]
Because it's already self-destructing anyway because of the rampant never-ending greed

[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.760]
I mean, it's just crazy

[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.480]
Direct-gater, fifteen million dollars a year

[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.900]
Oh, we're so concerned about education but of course those school teachers

[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.260]
You know, they go to High Line in the summertime

[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.560]
And they only work nine or ten months out of the year

[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.460]
I mean, I hear the worst crap from people over these years I've done these shows

[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.380]
So you expect somebody to go and put up with all your brats and take all the abuse

[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.900]
And no support from the parents for forty or fifty grand a year or whatever they're making now

[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:47.880]
How much?

[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.000]
Around thirty

[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.340]
Like I said, slave wages

[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:58.260]
To try to do the jobs that you're either too incompetent or too terrified or too stupid to do with your kids

[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:05.400]
And yet these dumb, scummy, jocks, the lowest scum on the face of the earth

[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.640]
No matter how much they make you not only encourage it and approve of it, you subsidize it

[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:16.020]
Subsidize it, look at all every time I'm Tyson and I'm gonna have a paper review bum

[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.060]
No matter who it is

[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.380]
And then, and then their favorite thing is to call in the next day

[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.120]
Oh, we were robbed, it was a forest, it was a fraud, it was fixed

[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.680]
And they still come up with their forty or fifty or sixty bucks

[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.660]
It doesn't make any difference

[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.680]
And you want to know why?

[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.320]
That's the American fucking way

[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.140]
Well said, sweetheart

[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.540]
1027 at 560 WQF

[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:41.180]
We've got with the first team, Joe Rowe, Jeff DeParis, and Steve Goldstein, we've been running to six

[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.260]
Only on sports radio 560 QAAM

[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.360]
Floridian, dumb ab dirt

[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.940]
Don't forget the news, get it out

[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.140]
And you have a gap, down in my tunnel, down

[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.400]
Yes, I did

[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.220]
A piece of a knife, and now it's got a thing in it

[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.240]
The piece of us, and the piece of us

[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.120]
And the piece of us, and the pieces of us

[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.520]
So it took more gas, and I've got a contract

[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.400]
Another radio, you beat me on MCD

[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.940]
Yes, yeah

[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.140]
And what is the piece that I thought feeling?

[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.360]
Lost a piece, a son of a, why I found a way?

[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.620]
Why I found a way?

[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.980]
What makes you money, is a connoisseur, we think about money

[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.500]
It is so silly, yummy, you think like we do?

[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.900]
A voice is something that I forget I share it

[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.500]
Your future is brilliant

[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.180]
I'm telling you here, I'm staying in touch with you

[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.960]
Curfee, dog, gas

[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.720]
The cups of a no-no, I can't say customs

[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.540]
We think so, I'm stupid, but no one can tell

[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.500]
Your people too, but only dog can hear us

[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.440]
People come to our concepts

[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.980]
And we are made to know, you're not touching me

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.820]
Curfee, dog, gas

[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.080]
Okay, come down

[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.280]
Pension 31 and 560 WQ, I'm happy Tuesday too

[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.060]
Whatever the hell it is, 560, 560, 560

[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.360]
We just hired Ray Lewis for our sales stand

[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.100]
Here at QM Greg was in with a breathless announcement

[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.740]
And as soon as Cecil gets up, he's going to be next

[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.520]
Oh, yeah

[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.000]
What else wrong with that? Why not give these guys a 20 and a 30?

[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.860]
And guess who's in back in town this week?

[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.280]
I want to mention his name on the air

[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.660]
Bring up those old stories about that golf tournament

[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.960]
He's back in town, I wouldn't be surprised if he'd be looking for a job too

[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.140]
I mean, here's a guy that comes on here and says he's looking in the floor to be caught

[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.340]
I mean, talk about stupid

[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.320]
Because they can't garnish you your wages here

[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.980]
And so I'm coming on here and saying, you know that, not a way that I beat the murder rap on the first one

[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.580]
But the civil trial where they said, oh, they're all those millions of dollars

[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.020]
Well, guess what, I'm coming to Florida so I can beat that

[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:00.760]
Oh, yeah

[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.900]
Nice going there

[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.860]
God, well, we're going to have somebody big and tough to replace

[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.240]
Roy

[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.340]
He's had that little old running back, he got in here, God, that guy's about two feet tall

[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.700]
5'670, 5'60, 05'60, on the AT&T wireless line

[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.220]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.420]
Mobile in Miami

[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.340]
Our first call of the day and it doesn't sound like it's going to be too successful at this point

[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:28.680]
Hey, Neil

[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.180]
Yes, sir

[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.340]
Hey, man, I'm rockin' man, he doesn't have refined sense of race

[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.280]
Like some people we notice on the radio stations

[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:37.640]
Uh-huh

[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.860]
And on OJ

[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.220]
What does that mean? So, he doesn't have the right to say it?

[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.080]
You've got the right to say it, but he's got to refine it more

[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.600]
And then sort of get by people that complain about it, you know, like some people we know

[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.260]
Made it study it

[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.200]
Oh, that's right

[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:52.940]
Yeah, that's right

[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.680]
On OJ, man

[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.720]
I swear time at home, I study of all kinds of literature

[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.500]
How do you like that, a Ramsey's living next to you?

[00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.360]
Is that right?

[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.220]
That Ramsey's okay to move in next door

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.580]
Absolutely not, no way

[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:02.880]
All right

[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.400]
Hey, man, why are you not black people to make a lot of money on sports, man?

[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.760]
Okay, let me ask you, is Derek Geter black?

[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.760]
He's kind of like a, you know, a-

[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.220]
He's got a moment

[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.340]
First part of the day

[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.740]
How about my piazza? Is he black?

[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.020]
First part of the day and you get black

[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.240]
Get outta here, jackass, other professional sports, and go away, man

[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.540]
I don't have time in my life to waste with professional ethics like you, okay?

[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.980]
I don't have time for that crap

[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.240]
Is Bobby Cox black?

[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:27.540]
No

[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:27.920]
No

[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.740]
But the fact is in you to see it's the same, it was the same with OJ, same thing

[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.600]
If one of our, Joe and I were talking about this off the air yesterday

[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.500]
It's really interesting

[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:44.420]
And I'm not saying that it never happens, but I don't notice like when Ted Bundy was convicted

[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:49.600]
Were there a whole bunch of white people saying that it was a racist thing and that white people are, you know, get a bad image from this

[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.420]
I don't remember anybody saying that, do you?

[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:51.600]
No

[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.100]
When John Wayne Gacy was convicted

[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.420]
Were there a bunch of gay people coming out and saying, oh my god, this is homophobia

[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.260]
And this is just like a witch hunt

[00:28:59.260 --> 00:28:59.380]
No

[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.360]
And Jeffrey Dahmer the same thing, anybody say that?

[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:01.540]
No

[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.860]
But because you're such a professional ethnic

[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.080]
Every time a black person is accused of anything

[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.780]
Oh my god, here we go again

[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.200]
It's the old Jim Crow back again

[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.460]
Or is it John David Crow? What team you be on?

[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.180]
I mean, you're gonna have to grow up and start being like an adult

[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.660]
Not like a juvenile between your ears, okay, sir?

[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.120]
Always pick it on black people

[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.720]
And I guess I'm responsible for the fact that Rih Lewis is black or that Cecil Collins is black

[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.380]
And the fact is that there happen to be any enormous number of black players in the National Football League

[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.320]
Is that correct? Right

[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.200]
I'm responsible because Latreans free well be black

[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.460]
Even though the overwhelming majority of players in the National Basketball Association are black

[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.140]
So I'm responsible for that

[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.920]
So that makes me a racist

[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.340]
And because I defend John Rocker's right to speak just like Reggie White

[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.580]
I defend his right to be a bigot

[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.960]
And he was still playing for the Packers at the time he was running around with all his homophobic remarks

[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.180]
And making all these obnoxious disgusting comments

[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.480]
We can call him an asshole, okay?

[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.740]
Just like John Rocker

[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.500]
He's also an asshole

[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.520]
Was Reggie White suspended or fine?

[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.340]
No

[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:08.340]

[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.260]
See, and this is just like the thing with his spanic community

[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:13.980]
It's the same thing

[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.340]
Liberty, Liberty, Liberty

[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.600]
You have the freedom to say whatever you want

[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.180]
As long as it's okay with us

[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.280]
But the moment you say something that pisses us off, then you got a problem

[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:31.000]
John Rocker is just as much a right to be a bigot as David Duke or anybody else

[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.020]
How about this?

[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.260]
Bobby Bird, the Senator from West Virginia

[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.720]
He used to be a member of the Ku Klux Klan and has been the senator for about 100 years

[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.580]
How about him?

[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.620]
You just don't understand it, do you?

[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.420]
You may not like it

[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.260]
It's one thing to like it

[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.220]
Maybe you can despise John Rocker while you want

[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.680]
I just think he's another dumb joke

[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.320]
I mean, there's so many of them, how do you differentiate?

[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.700]
And I wouldn't be surprised if he'd get slight like to say with Mark Furman

[00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.880]
There's another classic example of the hypocrisy of America

[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.240]
Oh, you had the audacity to say the N word and we got you on tape, got you baby

[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.320]
And the reason that he had the nice thing is because it's unacceptable in America

[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.880]
You can't say nigger in America

[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.140]
You can't say it

[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.420]
Even though people say it all the time, including black people in their music

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.220]
And to each other

[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.660]
I think it's time to strip away the BS from IBS

[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.160]
But it's not going to happen in this country in our lifetime because this is a country of phonies

[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.480]
Everybody has to posture and be politically correct and say those things in public

[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.420]
That they don't believe in, never would say in private

[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.280]
Here's West Palm Beach, hello

[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.500]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:41.860]
Great

[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:46.380]
Well, first of all, it's a shame that you get ripped for just being honest, you know

[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.920]
He can rip all he wants, okay

[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.440]
I just don't have to listen to this book, grab because he's a professional ethnic

[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.380]
And no, kidn

[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.900]
Two things, first of all, have you seen Bob and Tom live?

[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.240]
No, well they're coming 24th and 25th of a comedy corner

[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.600]
Yeah, I heard four comedy clubs in the country

[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.800]
I just want to let you know

[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:09.680]
Yeah, anyways, it's just a real shame if you took my piata and you took like Shaqil

[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.600]
Now you're making fun of Italians again

[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.320]
Oh no, I'm going to give them a shot

[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.900]
So just for their salaries, at their jeeter

[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.180]
Yeah

[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:19.340]
And you add to the three together, it'd be almost a half a billion dollars

[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.860]
If how many school stuff can you build for that?

[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.920]
Nobody cares about school

[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.160]
Nobody cares, nobody cares

[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.240]
It's a dumb country, we don't care about school

[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.520]
If we talk about it because it sounds good once in a while we talk about it, then nobody cares

[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:36.480]
Yeah, just flip it, give the professional athlete the school teacher salaries

[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.560]
And then just flip over the money, you know

[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.940]
Okay, I will see you

[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.840]
Okay, hold your breath

[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.520]
Just flip it, just rub it

[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.040]
Yeah, that too

[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18 and 2 wireless light

[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.780]
Everybody gets all whipped up into a friend's e-mail sound like that

[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.320]
And nobody gives a crap about those things

[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.600]
Because this is a country of dummies

[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.760]
This is a country where being an egghead is sprung upon, we're having an intellect

[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.700]
This looked on, just take a look at the presidential candidates

[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.840]
Take a look at them, if you've got a strong stomach, if you've got the New Hampshire primary tonight

[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.360]
We've got any great scholars in it?

[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.940]
Oh yeah, Bill Bradley was a Rhodes Scholar

[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.680]
You know something big, the Aladdin 40 cents on buy them a half a cup of coffee

[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.600]
He's got a personality like a dead frog

[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.960]
Like Don I miss on a bad day with a head cold

[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.240]
I mean, do we have anybody like it like a Roosevelt, like a Kennedy, somebody who's art

[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.860]
And I'm going to talk about their politics

[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.300]
Whether you like to, didn't like those people

[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.940]
I'm talking about somebody who's got leadership quality

[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.200]
Somebody articular, somebody like Mario Cuomo God forbid

[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.080]
Can you just even forget again about his family tree

[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.800]
And all the other things that he's nervous about

[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.960]
Can you imagine a debate with any and all of these candidates in both parties

[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.620]
And Mario Cuomo just him against all the rest

[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.960]
No content, no little contentory

[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.220]
Forfeit before the end of the first round

[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.820]
Oh, but he's too liberal

[00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.480]
Oh, I'm sorry

[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.100]
And he don't like the death penalty so I guess that just qualifies him right

[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.440]
Uh-huh

[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.620]
Okay, next

[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.360]
How about Donald Trump? There you go

[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.860]

[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.100]
Or look us up on the web at f***ingclean.com

[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.840]
And f***ing clean it up

[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.280]
Okay!

[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.500]
1044-560 WQM

[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.320]
Tonight's Hurricane Pittsburgh basketball game

[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.280]
See, we got Hurricane's and Panthers up the old yin-ing tonight

[00:34:59.280 --> 00:34:59.680]
Correct them

[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.140]
That too

[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.580]
7 o'clock on QAM, we got the pregame for the Panthers and Hurricane Gubb

[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.300]
Hockey game

[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.360]
And, because we got that going on, we got to put the basketball game someplace else

[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.480]
So we have the pit Panthers, mommy, Hurricane basketball game 8 o'clock in progress

[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.340]
In progress on 790 AM

[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.440]
The game can also be heard in its entirety on the internet on the HurricaneSports.com

[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.460]
Okay, got that?

[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:25.880]
No!

[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.640]
Let me say it again, I won't say it again

[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.160]
We got Panthers and Hurricane Hockey, we got Panthers and Hurricane basketball

[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.000]
We got Panthers and Hurricane's up the old 560-560

[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.360]
Pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.900]
See in America, I know this comes as a great shock to a lot of you dummies out there

[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.560]
In America you've got to write to be a bigot

[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.040]
And express it in public

[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.880]
And people have got to write to say you're an asshole or they agree with you or you shouldn't have said it or

[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.860]
Whatever they want to say

[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.560]
That's what diversity is all about, that's what this is supposed to be all about

[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.840]
But of course that's only in theory, just like a freedom of speech is only in theory

[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.400]
Here's West Palm Beach, hello

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.740]
Hey, you know how you doing?

[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.020]
Great!

[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.440]
Good, this is a black guy and his Jewish friend on the island as well

[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.080]
Oi!

[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.560]
Two things on the cover with you

[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:17.100]
Well, first I do believe in, in free speech I think what Rocker said was to speak in his mind

[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.720]
You can't punish him for it, I mean if we start punishing him, they're going to punish everybody for sanding and everything

[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.340]
So I don't give a crap by what he said, doesn't involve me personally

[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.680]
And you're right, I mean, you know, we use it in our music and we say it to each other all the time

[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.660]
We should be desensitized to the world by now

[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:39.180]
I mean you show me a heterosexual male in this country that doesn't use the word Fag all the time

[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.360]
and it doesn't talk about niggers and I'm going to know who that person is going to be, I can't imagine who it might be

[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.800]
I've never encountered that person

[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.360]
I mean if that word is still called as hatred or hurt or whatever, you've got to be like so far behind the times

[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.040]
It's just ridiculous

[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:57.920]
Right, and thing number two my friend, we're up in Palm Beach and we can't find the key chains anywhere

[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.980]
You're not going to find them anywhere, they don't exist anymore

[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.960]
Oh, you can't

[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.780]
I hate to break the news to you but President Lincoln's got a bad headache sir, you're a little bit behind the signs

[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.280]
They've been gone for ages, we ran out of those back in November and December

[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:16.040]
My friend's gone down to Hollywood and down to Broward and he couldn't find them anywhere

[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.040]
Well, he won't

[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.680]
Oh, dude, alright man, you have something good with it

[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.600]
Okay, alright, touch it later

[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.720]
Sorry about that, we could have sold another two, three, four thousand of those, good way

[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.320]
But that's a, you know, water under the bird speaking of OJ

[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:32.300]
And when Greg was in here, I should have asked him about the other 1150 bucks for a center one, anybody ever find where that went?

[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.520]
No

[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.300]
You know, anything about it?

[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:34.540]
No

[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.320]
And nobody cares

[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.820]
See, nobody cared about that either, I thought that was like a major issue, even forgetting about that golf tournament and our fundraisers

[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:45.500]
Just in general, and nobody cares because like I said, how many people really have any principal?

[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.400]
When you come right down to it

[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.540]
They wanted to go out there and play in that golf tournament most of these clubs, not all of them but most of them

[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.580]
So they could rub elbows with a bunch of marginal x-jocks and then of course once OJ showed up

[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.780]
They either ran like crazy and got out of the head, any principal at all, or they went over and sucked up to them

[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.720]
And had their picture made and got his autograph

[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:02.960]
Oh

[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.340]
And of course Greg Reed, who was in here only a moment ago, he knew about that whole deal at a time didn't he?

[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:20.900]
Like I said, the embarrassment factor, they have got to pay you, if you're a talent, if you have something going for it, if you bring something to the table in this market on the radio

[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:28.420]
They have got to pay you an extraordinary amount of money to come and work in this place, to compensate for all of the other things

[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:36.900]
It's just unbelievable, it's mind-boggling. I said to Joe the other day, I said if and when I do write that book about my career in radio and especially in this market

[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:44.740]
It won't be about KET, WSNEWS, WINS, ZATA and IOD about any of those places, the entire 600-page book will be about this place

[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.880]
And I'm sure a very very large chapter devoted to the infamous OJ golf tournament

[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.740]
Anybody care about that? Have all these scams going on in the name of a charity?

[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.900]
No, no, because the charities don't care, because they'll take you if you throw them a little bone, it's like your dog

[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:08.460]
Throw them a little bone, they'll be happy and wag their tail, that's how charities are, it's tough to raise money for charities these days, any of them

[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.540]
So they'll go along with a scam no matter what it is

[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.660]
And the people will participate, like I said, they don't really give a crap, they're not going to take the time

[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:23.640]
Well how much money is really going to charity if they don't care, I can go in here and pay my money so I can smooth rub elbows with a bunch of dumb jokes

[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.260]
Here's a mobile in a four-letter, hello?

[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.600]
Good morning, Neil

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.160]
Yes sir

[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:35.500]
I just have one thing, 99.9% of it when you're on, I agree with what you say

[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.820]
But the only one, it's not even a butt, I just wanted you to try to clarify for me

[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:48.960]
When you're saying that we're the ones out there that subsidize the athletes, what they may go into the games, the only problem I have is when

[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:58.820]
with the Panthers at 15,000 in the game or the heat of 12,000, there's empty seats everywhere, then you can't get on the air next day and say we're a bush town

[00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:59.780]
What are you saying?

[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.380]
Let me answer this, how many murderers are on the Panthers? How many gangsters on this team?

[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.200]
In the Panthers I guess maybe are bad example because we don't have that with the Panthers

[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:15.040]
But I guess with the contracts and just what these guys are doing in every day you have

[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:20.180]
I've already said that, I'm way ahead of you, I've said the NHL is catching up with the other sports and they're starting to pay ridiculous amounts

[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:25.740]
And you have all these four Canadian franchises and big trouble, Buffalo's and big trouble, Pittsburgh almost went under again

[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:33.360]
I mean, you know, it's just a matter of time and when the collective bargaining agreement ends in four years, whatever it's going to be, they're going to walk out for a year

[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.600]
There's going to miss a whole season because it just got to stop

[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:49.480]
Right, and maybe you'll just take, if you take that there's 14 or 15,000 people at these games, maybe it's catching up to, you know, those four or five or six thousand season ticket holders finally say, hey, I'm not going to do it anymore, I'm not going to subsidize the entire season

[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.400]
Well, I have said that, I do appreciate the fact that people are being raped and that the prices are ridiculous

[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.660]
And also the fact that, you know, Wayne, it wasn't enough for him that the county was going to build a mistake out in Arena for him

[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:04.340]
But he instead of having like 17,500 seats, which would have been plenty, plenty

[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.460]
Now we have to have 19,500 so we can have thousands of FECs every day

[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:13.060]
And so a whole bunch of them can be undersized and uncomfortable and the ones in the corners are like little baby seats

[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:18.280]
Because they just don't give a crap, he could add the same number of sweets and the same number of boxes and the same number of club seats

[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.180]
And still rape the public for all he wanted without having 19,000 plus seats in there was ridiculous

[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:27.800]
And not even, I mean, it's not even, you know, it's not even the usual amount of what you pay for tickets

[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.160]
I mean, 10 bucks for a beer, 15 for a hot dog

[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.600]
Like I said before, drink your beer and eat your hot dog someplace else

[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.580]
Neil, kind of should question

[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:40.120]
There's nobody holding a gun you're head saying that you have to keep running back and forth to subsidize the concessions stand

[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.840]
Especially in that place, my dog wouldn't eat most of that food

[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:48.540]
Right, Neil, as far as the best of Neil, we're who do we call the yes-centre one?

[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.720]
5, 6, 3, 3, 600

[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.540]
Or you can just go to the website, NeilRounders.com

[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:54.660]
3600

[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.100]
Right

[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.480]
I'll see that in a minute

[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:56.760]
Have a great day

[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:02.280]
But I didn't just get to say a minute ago that if all sports disappeared tomorrow, I could go on with life

[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:09.280]
Did I just say, I mean life goes on, it's not the most important, unlike a lot of the sports nerds who listen to and subsidize this radio station the other 20 hours today

[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.040]
There are more important things, hopefully, in life besides some stupid goddamn ballgame

[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.440]
But America has become so vacuous, why do you think that Quyshow is so big now that radio show? Is that a good show?

[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:19.720]
No

[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.160]
Marginal! Marginal at best

[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:27.800]
Because I've been around long enough to see the really good Quyshow is the one that we're exciting and dramatic and entertaining

[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.040]
This is a, you know, just a slap together piece of turd

[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.940]
But I mean, oh, it's exciting and everybody's talking about it

[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.000]
Yeah, it's happening

[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.440]
So everybody must do it because people feel as big vacuum in their lives

[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.500]
Just like in this town, I keep asking, what is it that goes on with these people?

[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.280]
What is there in the...

[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:46.800]
I have no life

[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.660]
Yeah, that's the answer over and over again

[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.240]
I have no life

[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.980]
Or somebody at least convinced them that they have no life

[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.620]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.340]
Here's Halondale, hello

[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.940]
Yeah, everybody is associated with you, I'm sure you've taken up this show

[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.980]
Okay, great, too bad we had that big buzz online

[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.800]
He said everybody associated with you, M should be taking out and shot some stupid thing like that

[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.480]
Probably Tony Cigarette or doing a voice

[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.300]
Don't tell me line 4 is screwed up again, not after Greg Reed was in here earlier with him

[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.260]
Huh? Oh, listen to that

[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.600]
Oh, listen to that, if you're applying for it today, then what did I just say about the embarrassment factor working on this radio station?

[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.540]
Listen to that

[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.060]
Here we go again

[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.200]
Day after day after day after endlessly

[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.940]
How about line 7? Is that when we're working there?

[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:36.200]
No

[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.000]
Because I took a look at all and now please don't tell me you're going to just echo this bottle on full sound on here because I noticed that

[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.380]
Yeah

[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.480]
You seem to be having another phone problem here at QAM

[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.780]
See, what I don't understand is how can anybody, I don't care how stupid they are

[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.020]
Believe me, we've got some real stupid people in this place

[00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:02.540]
I don't care how stupid you are, how can you be that unaware, that indifferent, that unfazed, unconcerned

[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:11.420]
That you can allow this schlock to go on day after day after day and dilute yourself into thinking that people are just going to come back and keep fighting this day after day

[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.880]
Without finally winding up dragging your ass into court and saying yes, what?

[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.620]
I just spent a month, five weeks sick because of you when you're stressed in your bull crap

[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:22.340]
And they're saying look at that, they're wanting to like you hear that? I'm not even touching a phone line

[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.200]
We just had a phone click on a year

[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:30.440]
Just like three times in the last week that we've had line 8 go on spontaneously without anybody touching it and the line either

[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:38.140]
Setting new lows in broadcast history Greg Read and the wannabeed lease

[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.660]
I think we should leave that on till two even during the spots

[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.180]
If you guys can make it all, who's that?

[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.360]
No, no, they're doing it

[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.540]
You'll be doing somebody on there and this is the best thing

[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.400]
There's somebody actually on there trying to get on saying hello, hello

[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.240]
And we got the recording and we got the plus

[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.780]
Let's hear it

[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.520]
That may be a first

[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.380]
That was special, that was sensational

[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.980]
We just had a three way right here that may have been the first three way in a history radio

[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.280]
Eat your heart out Howard

[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.880]
How do you like that?

[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.600]
We had somebody desperately like a little voice in a can that a million miles away

[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.180]
Hello, hello, can't like Alexander Graham Schwartz

[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:50.140]
And then we had the big buzzing on and then the operator was hang on to make a call, hang up the stupid piece of crap and try it again but it probably won't work

[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.220]
Let's hear it

[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.720]
Alright, WQAM

[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.420]
The best fake make-believe radio station in the history of the human race

[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.800]
Even Mark Coney is sitting there just spitting up blood, he's life and so hard

[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.220]
He is, he's spitting it up

[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.560]
Squirt, squirt and the blood too

[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.680]
Well, give it a shot, you never know you might get on one of these lines and we might actually be able to hear you

[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.940]
5'6, 7'0, 5'60, pound 5'60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:18.900]
See, I have to take part of the responsibility because if I had any balls I would have walked out a long time ago

[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.000]
And had my attorney who's too busy being a big shot printing his back newspaper

[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.960]
I would have had him notify them that when they want me to come back, put in a phone system that works and I'll come back into a talk show

[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.080]
If I would have had any balls

[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.020]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.060]
And I do have balls but not quite that big yet

[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.820]
But I guarantee you toward the end of the week I think that's going to be it for a while

[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:44.920]
10-56 at 5-60, WQAM

[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.100]
Hey, take it to the bank

[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:47.540]
Joe

[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:55.280]
And we want to be great if George is still sicking, I'll come the end of the week that we have Joe Castella doing motor sports Saturday on

[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.160]
Oh, hey, hey, hey

[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.120]
Come on George, put away those drugs please

[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.640]
Or like I said, get him out

[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.500]
Head cap with no discords

[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.440]
Starting at 10, 7'11, 10, 10, 10

[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.480]
Here, week night, only on sports radio 5'60, QAM

[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.120]
WQAM

[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:17.040]
My heavy, 40-bottomed scale

[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.860]
Laurence, now that I got caught, boy, he doesn't just be gone, don't be

[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:31.800]
Ooh

[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.260]
The farmer is in the back

[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.120]
Had a hundred bucks worth of crap, don't be

[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.500]
Yeah

[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:48.060]
He was extremely active just like the D.P. cocaine

[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.160]
I like to cry, help me, I can be fine

[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:56.760]
Okay

[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:04.620]
Two, three, three

[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:09.120]
One of the Allen's stars, my wife of me, I'm fine

[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.920]
We're cocaine

[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.660]
My daughter is got caught, is in the back of my e-bott

[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.120]
So, okay

[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:27.480]
They play ball and ball on ground, got it wrong, do we have cocaine?

[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.300]
11-11 at 5'60, WQAM, happy Tuesday for my, your friends here at Criminal Radio

[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.760]
And of course this place is a crime, is there a crime about that, is there?

[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:35.960]
No

[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.320]
Okay

[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.240]
5'607, oh fuck, come on, let's get that line 4 on again, the audience likes her in here

[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.600]
I said it's any, oh I love it

[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.260]
Hmm, I'm gonna pause on, let's see who I am

[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:48.400]
WQAM

[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.320]
Thank you

[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:11.440]
Thank you

[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.380]
5'607, oh 5'60, pound 5'60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.940]
This is like putting somebody on an assembly line and Detroit, you know, to make automobiles

[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.440]
Only if there's no parts coming down the line, you know what I'm saying?

[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:28.720]
No torches, no, no nothing, no equipment, and just standing there like, oh, fuck, make me a car

[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:30.660]
That's the beastly FN way

[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:32.960]
Here's Fort Myers, hello

[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.220]
Hey, what's going on

[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.060]
Oh wait a minute, I'm hearing like this line isn't so great either, go ahead sir

[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.020]
Hey, how's it going? You were talking about the, I don't want to stray from topic too much, I really don't want to talk about sports stuff

[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.240]
Anything you want, anything you want

[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.580]
Okay, you were talking about education and George Bush and everything

[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.940]
Okay, first of all, I think, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.800]
Bush, well I don't have to-

[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.780]
What did I mention George Bush?

[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.300]
Well here's what I'm saying, okay, you were talking about real bad, real Bradley, right, you know, both scholars?

[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.720]
Yeah, I don't know the source, but I had heard somebody say, one of these puns didn't say that George Bush had higher AT scores than Bill Bradley

[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.480]
George Bush is proud of the fact that he was a very average C student in school

[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.900]
Okay, I don't know the source, I don't know-

[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.260]
Hey, and what does it make, he's still eminently unqualified

[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.820]
Well I know, I don't agree, I don't think that George Bush anymore qualified in John McCain, I'm a Democrat

[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:14.720]
And I would-

[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.100]
John McCain is just a wise guy as all he is

[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.300]
Well you got to figure it out, I've been spent five years as a POW, I mean that's-

[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.080]
So what does that mean, does that mean to make him qualified to be president?

[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.120]
Well, Commander-in-Chief definitely, I would think, this is my opinion

[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.720]
He's qualified to be Commander-in-Chief because he was a prisoner of war?

[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.960]
Well, more so, I would say, well, I said I don't want to straight-

[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.320]
Well, where's the logic in that?

[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.240]
Well, I mean at least he's sensitive to the issue that's going on in the military

[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.120]
Well, I'll tell you what, we probably got some 90-year-old people who were in concentration camps during WW2

[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.120]
Should we bring them back? I mean they knew all about misery and suffering

[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.820]
I hear you, but here's-

[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:48.820]

[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:49.140]
Here's-

[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:53.980]
As long as that is qualification to be president, to be a leader, to have a brain, to have courage, to have the right ideas

[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:54.940]
Well, that's-

[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.620]
No, I'm not saying that's not important, I'm just saying he is that-

[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:04.780]
That at least because the Constitution says that your policy commander-in-Chief, at least you have some sensitivity and knowledge to the issues that was going on in the military

[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.980]
Yeah, I mean-

[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:08.960]
So what are we talking about here?

[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.540]
Anyways, okay, here's-

[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.280]
About this education thing, I don't-

[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.080]
I don't know where I-

[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.320]
It's purposely where I stand on vouchers right now, but I mean I've heard-

[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:21.000]
I heard George Bush say something interesting, he said the way the system is right now, without the vouchers,

[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.680]
these schools have no incentive to try to improve their system, and that's one argument that he gave that's why-

[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.940]
Oh, no, brother of course has got to bring away, and that is that they get a failing grade, but we'll do it's penalized them so they can be even worse

[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:32.680]
Right.

[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.580]
I mean that's just double talk, that's bull crap.

[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:41.020]
The fact is that all young people in this country deserve an equal and a quality education, and this bull crap about they have no incentive,

[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.480]
that's just garbage, it's nonsense, on the face of it, it's ludicrous.

[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.400]
It seems to me that-

[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.940]
Isn't any commitment to great education in this country, and anybody with a brain knows that?

[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.800]
It seems to me that the Republican kind of-

[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:59.480]
vouchers are just an excuse for the right-wing lunatics like the Bushes for example, just an excuse for them to face out public education as we know it,

[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:04.000]
and to give more money to prokial schools, that's what that's all about, it's in a leadist mentality is what it is.

[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.160]
I don't know, it seems-

[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.260]
I do know, and that's why I'm telling you, that's what it is.

[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.780]
It seems to me that the Republican kind of-

[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.900]
I'm not going to start subsidizing religious schools with my money, no way Jose.

[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:15.180]
It seems to me that the Republican kind of the way they would do way with the Department of Education.

[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:19.480]
Well, sir, you're very perceptive, they've already said that, and they've tried their best to do it.

[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.360]
There's a guy that's really on top of it, isn't he?

[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.800]
No, it seems to him.

[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.320]
Woo! I'd rather go back online forward here than to hear that.

[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.860]
Oh listen, this sounds pretty good, I've actually got somebody's on here.

[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.800]
I think I've been trying again.

[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.860]
Is there somebody on this line?

[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.880]
Hey, how's the line going down here?

[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.240]
Hello!

[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:40.780]
It's ringing.

[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.040]
Hello!

[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:47.500]
Can we speak to Paul Taglibo, please?

[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.880]
Oh, he's in the middle of breakfast, I'm sorry.

[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.600]
Okay, that was the end of that.

[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.660]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, but at least, like I told you,

[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:00.140]
would Joe Costello's on his board amazing things happen on this show?

[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:05.240]
Never fails, you're betting a thousand, even Derek Geter, who's like, yeah, a little bit black and a little bit white and a little bit something else.

[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.740]
I think line 4 just called line 8.

[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.460]
Line 4 just called line 8.

[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.840]
Let's pick up line 8.

[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.480]
Hello, what we're going to have?

[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.340]
They're applying it, which just called line 4.

[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.380]
Did you know what this is?

[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.000]
You heard of line 8, this is line 8.

[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.680]
It's contagious, it's worse than the freaking hours.

[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:23.980]
Who has thought about these things?

[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.400]
What's happening now?

[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:30.840]
These are lines that are spontaneously calling each other, and this disease is spreading.

[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.640]
Better call a god damn 4, 6, 7, and 10, tell me, forget about that little kid.

[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.500]
We got line 8 disease here on the radio.

[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.620]
That was special.

[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.140]
That was really special.

[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.500]
It was lovely.

[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.960]
Don't forget speaking a special mad dog, Mandit.

[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:47.200]
Yeah!

[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.420]
We in for Hank this afternoon between two and six, tell a real story about what Cecil was doing in that bedroom.

[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:56.820]
Then at six o'clock we got big old, big, big, big, big, big as he used to be.

[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.720]
A monster in the sports, but in this, he'll be here from six to seven, if he'll have breach.

[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.840]
And then like I said, 7 to 10, 13 Panthers at the Carolina Huracun.

[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:07.180]
And if you want to turn over to YXC at eight o'clock in progress, they pit Panthers at a Miami Huracun.

[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:12.940]
Just to be kind of novel and unique, and you can hear that whole game on the internet, Hurricane Sports Commons, Entirely.

[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.560]
Hurricane Sports Commons.

[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.620]
And maybe even Ray Lewis will have something to say on here.

[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.280]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.160]
This would be good, man. This is great.

[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.940]
Ask me if I care. Do I care?

[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:26.440]
No!

[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:26.700]
No.

[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.940]
I've been here too long to care anymore. They don't care why the hell should I.

[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.380]
Just give me the check, just give me the money.

[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.900]
Get a lot of spots on here, and we're just bumbler away along.

[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.640]
We don't care. We're proud of it. We do not give a crap.

[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.560]
Here's Oakland Park. Hello.

[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:40.880]
Hello, Neil.

[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:41.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.800]
Neil God speaking.

[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:47.340]
Yes. I'm a friend of Brian's and in sales.

[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:53.440]
And I just wanted to say thank you very much for the t-shirt and the autographed picture.

[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:54.840]
Whatever.

[00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:59.080]
And I just wanted to say...

[00:54:59.080 --> 00:54:59.800]
Yeah.

[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.340]
Make a shameless request.

[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.000]
No, shameless request is not saying something.

[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.740]
I wanted to say something. You don't want to say anything.

[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.560]
Well, I wanted to say that Al Gore is a douchebag and...

[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:12.920]
Yeah.

[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.560]
No, Bradley for present.

[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.160]
Well, Bradley ain't going anywhere. I hate to break the news to you.

[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:17.300]
No.

[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:17.840]
Bradley, no.

[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:18.940]
No.

[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.860]
You'll find that out staring tonight. He's not going anywhere.

[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.180]
Any shameless request?

[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:23.560]
No.

[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.240]
5, 6, 7, 05.

[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:29.320]
You already got your autographed picture in your t-shirt and your other Brian sucked around all that.

[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.480]
We're going to give him a request.

[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:30.760]
No.

[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.300]
Not all requests, too, they've got some very important problems we have to solve before two o'clock.

[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.760]
Or else...

[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:43.240]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T line, the out of town line, 877, 785, 63, 45.

[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:50.040]
I'm still astonished by the guy in four of Myers who had the first becassion to think that maybe the Republicans want to do away with the Department of Education.

[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.260]
I don't even like that, huh?

[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.120]
Wow.

[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:55.760]
Like that's a big secret.

[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.060]
Like the Republicans want a lot of tax cuts for the rich.

[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.500]
Like that'll be next, man.

[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:07.500]
See, I would benefit from tax cuts that the Republicans want to put in.

[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.380]
Not that I'm rich, but I do make a very substantial amount of cash.

[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.960]
I would benefit, but do I want them in?

[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:14.520]
No.

[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:14.780]
No.

[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.660]
Because sometimes you have to put other interests, other concerns ahead.

[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.960]
I would just your own selfish, monetary self-interest.

[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.880]
Like those so-called log cabin Republicans, which is very exactly the same as Jews for Hitler.

[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.800]
9 minutes after 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]
Jim Mandage toss sports.

[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.600]
Oh, a land right here.

[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.680]
On sports radio 560 Q8M.

[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:37.300]
And beat that Gator meat.

[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.460]
Oh.

[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:57.480]

[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:59.660]
Why the hell don't you go home?

[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.700]
Ain't that all I never wanted?

[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.840]
Rumble the crazy Julio.

[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:09.580]
Go back to Cuba with your pop ball.

[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.320]
Where you can play in the mud.

[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.820]
We'll pack your things and end the lot of.

[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.120]
Just go away, we're all fed up.

[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.320]
Hey, the young Gonzalez.

[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.540]
Why don't you go home?

[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.900]
Hey, the young Gonzalez.

[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.900]
Go home and beat us all alone.

[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.280]
And you only see I don't want to go back.

[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.640]
I like shopping for three toys better.

[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.660]
You've got your Pokemon, T-shirt.

[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.460]
And you're making out here.

[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:55.920]
You've had your fun.

[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:57.000]
Now start packing.

[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.120]
So they can get you out of here.

[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:03.720]
It's at the point where we can stand in.

[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:10.020]
Everybody's had enough of all the Julio's crackers.

[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.520]
Who put the gun in front of us?

[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:14.560]
Oh.

[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.320]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, young Gonzalez.

[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:19.700]
Why don't you go home?

[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.860]
Hey, the young Gonzalez.

[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.160]
Go home and beat us all alone.

[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:27.680]
And you only see I don't want to go home.

[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.140]
They're giving away three SNH green cards.

[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.140]
Can I have one?

[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:40.420]
This is called the place of fact you are equally asking.

[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.000]
Here's the main fact from Enrique.

[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.680]
Obviously nothing right in the case.

[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.580]
It's not the basis of several times where your phone lines are always busy.

[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:48.380]
Yes, sure.

[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.660]
FYI, National Airlines started flying to Vegas on January 21, 2000.

[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.360]
Guess what, Enrique?

[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.840]
I'll be back on the 27th day started flying.

[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.400]
And then he's got the schedule which I already gave on to you several times.

[00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:58.820]
Etc.

[00:58:58.940 --> 00:58:59.380]
And so on.

[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:02.200]
He says, I know because I work for a company that provides your line of information.

[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.380]
Thank you, Enrique, but we already got the right information which you won't have there.

[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:06.440]
And we already gave the times out.

[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.140]
And Hank will tell us to the model, hopefully.

[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.600]
We're going to help you back on Thursday.

[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:10.740]
Why are we going to be back?

[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.600]
He said he was coming back.

[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.360]
He said he went out on Delta and he's coming back on National maybe tomorrow.

[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.300]
Why don't we just come back and let us know just how they are.

[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:26.020]
And so anyway, speaking of alien on its interesting now that they put this big fence up out there with or without the construction permit in front of that house.

[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.300]
See, they want to have it both ways.

[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.500]
And of course, the excuse being from Armando, but he has all we never would have gotten all the national publicity.

[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:36.000]
And a kid wouldn't still be here if it weren't for the fact that all these people were out there every day.

[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:43.180]
See, they could have had a lot more people at the INSP building, not blocking the streets, but just out there demonstrating lawfully and legally and protesting.

[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.920]
Of course, they didn't have a lot more because nobody else showed up.

[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:49.980]
It could have done that and gotten just as much publicity and found other ways to do it.

[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:56.360]
But no, the excuse was, oh, we had to keep those toothless 100 people outside the house because then it kept everybody focused on the house on the issue.

[00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:03.880]
But now that it got slapped on the wrist by the judge and judge who will have told them in the return he cut the crap that Schmott had attorney cut the bull crap.

[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:11.880]
And now because the kid was crying, didn't want to go to school again yesterday and starting to show the effect of being a basket case in the middle of the three ring circus that they've been putting on.

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.580]
Now all of a sudden, oh, Armando, good of you.

[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.760]
This is asked immediately to give alien the family some space until February 22nd hearing.

[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:30.500]
Fred Graham has got another great column in a hero today by the way, alien showed on could get ugly. He says, didn't that exactly what I've been saying could get really ugly, which I'll get into later on.

[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:36.920]
Nice going again. Fred Graham. There's the one guy who consistently writes good stuff. Nice going there Fred because this town's getting mighty grim.

[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.560]
How's line four doing by the way, just for a little novel here.

[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.200]
Okay, I'll sound a little bit of the picture right there.

[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.360]
Look at that line eight is ringing. I picked up line eight. And guess what? Hello to me. It's line four.

[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:57.560]
Every look at it. Let's hang up. Let's do this one more time. Everybody watch. Keep your eye on the little thing on your radio there on your dial. Okay, here's line four.

[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:06.880]
I just picked it up and I have a feeling as you go these ghosts are telling us on the radio that any more of now, I think they start waiting because it's going to be coming to pick up line four.

[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.600]
It's our line eight to pick up line eight. It's making the same sound. How about that? You like it?

[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:30.360]
Nothing works that time. Damn it. So it's kind of like this. Bantic. All right. You don't just line eight. Me just ring spontaneously every none like it has been less than weeks also. But the good news is or I'm sorry it's the bad news. It was a memo I wasn't supposed to read on the year not for broadcast yesterday from George Corsair or sometimes in junior, which we don't see them very often because he's busy going by the pages.

[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.260]
Blue and Scotch tape.

[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:44.160]
The memo was well at the system. In fact, how come Greg reading come in here instead of giving me a song and a dance about the FCC and that fine and all of a sudden, the bull crap that nobody cares about, including the local media. How about talking about this phone system that you promised.

[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:52.020]
I didn't need say in blood. Did you give us a blood oath? Yeah, that's the 14th of February that new phone system would be in here. Is it going to be in here on 14th of February? No.

[01:01:52.020 --> 01:02:05.920]
No, because we were given a memo from tickers to ever to a Duff Lindsey, the chance viewers truly from George Corsair that's as well, they're shipping at some time between the middle and the end of February. So obviously we won't be putting it on for a 14th because we never do anything here on time.

[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:15.780]
How's that construction project coming out there in the halls and those particle board desk and that direct out there? Is it done yet? No. No. The five year that won a beastly way.

[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:24.140]
And by the way, all you people out there that this company owes money to that's our message. Okay. We'll pay it when we feel like it.

[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:31.100]
I'm going to start doing the same thing and see how long I can get away with that like FPL and the phone company car payments insurance.

[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:39.520]
It's amazing. It's astonishing, but they must have the magic touch. You know, I'm maybe because they walk around looking like they just called out of a sword.

[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:47.520]
And maybe all their creditors feel sorry for more yet. Oh, Schleppers. Look at them. Look at the way they dress. They can't afford to pay their bills. Let's cut them some slack. Give them a few extra years.

[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:58.780]
So if you want to contest by the way, power 96, I just hope you're very, very young. See, that's the good thing about that. They say, you know, a young demographic. You want a contest when you're 16. Maybe you'll have to be 50 when you may be collect the prize.

[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:05.180]
Look at that. Four and eight. Aren't they interesting? Conspicuously looking at here's line eight.

[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:14.260]
What was it again? I like the way it rings in the back. Maybe eight will ring up for this time.

[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:18.640]
No, but I do hear a. Oh, geez.

[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:26.940]
Not good for your nerves. Not good for your IBS. I'll tell you that. I've been feeling pretty damn good. And the pizza yesterday from Godfather's was

[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.700]
sensational. And Joe Castella said the sandwiches they brought so they brought a crap load of food yesterday. It was great.

[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:42.880]
And did I get myself sick over it? And you notice I didn't I did the smart thing yesterday. I ate one slice. And then I ate like another one, but not just the topping.

[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.020]
And then I ate some of the topping that was like all munged up there in the middle of the box, but not with any crust.

[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:53.480]
Which is still was too much factor for what I've been going through, but didn't the bottom in the least.

[01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:04.480]
But it's going to be a while, Joe. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. Hello, Neil. I'm so happy that I was able to get you.

[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:17.180]
I will like to tell you that you are super good and exceptional person. I never heard anybody with so much guts and telling the truth.

[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:26.700]
Right. Like it even my doctor said my balls are the size of an epipodermist. Whatever it is, how big they are, I don't care. Maybe I'll send you one for long.

[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:39.020]
Well, something else I like to mention to you is that you make me laugh. I'm not a young girl anymore. And you don't know. I'm an old fart just like you.

[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:09.000]
No, no, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no. No, no

[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:38.980]
Let us see things.

[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:42.000]
give it a shot see what happens here. It's already and see just like I don't

[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.960]
know what it is. Maybe it's because I feel so much better and have so much more

[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.000]
energy after those five weeks of being really sick and my kiskeye twisted. But

[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.260]
boy these shows are just flying right by. I don't know even Joe would agree with

[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:56.340]
that. Of course he likes all that free food that came in and also what else did

[01:05:56.340 --> 01:06:00.460]
you take home yesterday? What about the fortune cookies? The fortune cookies,

[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:05.340]
the sandwiches. Yeah. We came away with a stack of good stuff here yesterday.

[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.780]
God bless Godfathers. It'll be another round. You know maybe after my vacation

[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:12.100]
well I think about once a month we'll have them come in here. Sounds real good to me.

[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.780]
It's a great place right by the Hess station there on I 95 not I 95 595

[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:22.360]
big road extension just south of 595. I say that very well and isn't there a big

[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.140]
boy over there like right just up the road from a kitty corner in the

[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.840]
mind these subs on the other side of the street I believe. But Godfathers is

[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.320]
connected to see some of these people are so slow like he's telling him Hess and

[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.900]
Godfathers all of their locations there together. You go outside and you fill up

[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.120]
your tank with gas and then you go inside and fill up your poop with more gas

[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.820]
and you got a smile on your post you're happy camper. Here's a mobile in the

[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:50.620]
keys hello. Yeah I just have to make it I don't understand what the big deal is

[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:55.140]
with this Ray Lewis thing. He had a rough year plan football. Yeah that's right.

[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.120]
He went out and had some fun with his friends. Yeah. Everybody's given him a

[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.060]
hard time. That's right. He was under a lot of stress that's right. What's the big

[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.620]
deal? Give the guy a break man. Let him play the friggin probe all right. Okay great

[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:11.560]
thanks. Yeah frig you. 5.6. That's where went to school was for you. Uh huh. 5.6.

[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:15.000]
They owe you a van. That's what they usually call it. Frag you. 5.6.7.0.5.60.

[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.060]
Palm 5.60 on the AT&T wireless line. And by the way Lawrence Phillips is

[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:23.060]
becoming a dinner by the way sir they want to get your daughter. Well she's not your

[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:28.640]
daughter. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Last night on PBS there was a

[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:34.480]
documentary on on Fidel Castro. Oh my god. I'm sure glad I missed that. I was at

[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.600]
the track last night having a great time at Pompadot Park so luckily I missed that.

[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:42.240]
I completely changed my mind about the Castro and the Cuban people. Why is that? They were

[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.360]
patriots. They beat the hell out of the invaders and the CIA was a culprit that

[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:53.520]
wanted to get this country into war. You know I have the highest respect for

[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:59.100]
President Kennedy. Yeah. The fact that he did he didn't take take the bake. Yeah.

[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.880]
And the Cubans got the police. He had better taste and bubbly boy. Well he screwed around at least

[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:09.240]
to the women. Look good. And the Cuban Julios got their ass kicked in. Yeah. And I saw the films

[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.680]
of them shooting down the planes. Well why don't we ask you why why are you concerned about that?

[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:18.560]
Now it's 2000. This is stuff that happened 40 years ago. Why do we care about that now?

[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:22.200]
Well I mean we should be better having documentaries on the Spanish Inquisition

[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.580]
and the Crusades because it's certainly much more timely and appropriate than in terms

[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.980]
of what's going on in the world today. Well that's still going on.

[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.840]
I'm going to hell of a lot more. That's correct. So maybe you're right. Okay. Okay.

[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.820]
Don't do it again. Thank you. Okay. Don't waste your time watching that crap.

[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.540]
Because we don't do we care about that? No. No. We just don't care. It's a little measly

[01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:42.480]
island down there and nobody cares about it. Even the gell told me that this morning.

[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.940]
So nobody really cares. Five, six and of course they were all whipped up and we're friends.

[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.940]
The I say Tommy for President. I have to mention that this morning. We should have been so

[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:54.400]
proud of Tommy. Lid into Joe Rose this morning in the hallway. I thought they were going

[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.920]
to have a fist fight which wouldn't have come out too good for Tommy. But nevertheless

[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:03.260]
he lit into him. He said you phony mother scratch in son of a bitch. No good about this

[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:08.440]
Ray Lewis thing. And about how little dog as usual as the dumb jocks do on the station

[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.640]
trying to minimize it and cover it up and always said a good guy. I didn't believe it.

[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.040]
And the other thing about their kid recruiting up there in Orlando on the recruiting trip

[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.820]
and you know finally the girl and break it and all this other stuff.

[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.620]
And little Tommy there. He lit in him in a hallway. I have never seen such explosive days

[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.820]
since the day. Nice going there Tommy. You got my vote. I'm right now. I'm going to New Hampshire

[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:31.840]
right after the show. I'm writing your name in for President of the primary tonight.

[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:36.080]
That was one of the great. I was so proud of Tommy. There was phenomenal. We got at least one

[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:40.940]
other guy to building got a big set of all. Tell me dumb jock of thing or two. Phony

[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:45.920]
hypocritical stupid idiotic dumb jock. Too much football without a helmet. That's your

[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.160]
roses problem. Uh huh. All those jet fans. I think you got a point. I always looked

[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.300]
you know with some. Distain and those obnoxious theory or typical jet fans at

[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.520]
calling it morning show. I think they've got a good point. Talk about a thick neck blockhead.

[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:06.200]
That's him. Excuse makers WQ and the home of the excuse makers. No matter how many murders

[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.400]
are jocks commit. We'll go on a year and we'll defend them. F&A baby.

[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:17.720]
Here's Miami. Hello. Neil how you doing today. Great. That's good. Two things. Um

[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.080]
I had to cut my off. Oh national airlines. Why am I not there? I'm going to Vegas. March.

[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.820]
Very excited. It's been 10 years. That's a long way off. I thought you were going to tell me that

[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:30.000]
you just came back on there and it was great. No I'm just all excited. I mean 269 round trip.

[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.640]
How can you beat that? How can you do that? Not with the stand. That was a hot.

[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:38.560]
There are 757s. There are real planes almost you know. I'm looking forward to it. Very excited.

[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.400]
The parents want out there. Oh you're going to love that place. You're going to love it. It's

[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.840]
an astonishing place. It's breathtaking and it's beautiful. Don't do any gambling in there

[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.200]
because it's brand new and it's like sticking a vacuum cleaner in your wallet. They'll

[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:54.460]
suck the money out real quick. But you definitely picked the right place to go and see.

[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:59.100]
Where should I go instead to gamble? Then any of this tab is placed in any place.

[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.280]
Any place. People will tell you not to lie. You'll go downtown and gamble or go to the oldest

[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:08.820]
tab is places like the woman on the 50th 35 million at the desert in you know Sam's town downtown.

[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.500]
Okay. There are casinos that are good to gamble in and there ones that are glitzy and fancy

[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.440]
and they want you to picture it. All right good enough. I like to gamble. I can't

[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.340]
get a gamble in to be honest with you. It's a little on the older side but I love the

[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:23.720]
driver. Can I have a good luck in that joint? All right now my second reason I called. Do you

[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.300]
remember last week after the panthers lost that horrendous candidate? I sure do. And the last

[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:33.340]
caller on the the morning show and you got on the air and you ripped them because he said there was

[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:38.420]
a it was a talking about goodlings and badlings and bad loss. Right. That was an idiotic call.

[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.740]
Okay. Well that was me. There was nothing good about that loss. No. I wasn't. No. I wasn't.

[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.540]
Unfortunately I got on with less than a minute to go in the show. I didn't get a chance to

[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:53.380]
explain myself. Yeah. And it was not a lot. I wasn't. It was a damn good loss. Well it was a

[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:57.720]
damn good day. We came away from that came in. Nothing. Well, don't you think it was good that we

[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.040]
didn't get blown out five to one? Well why should we get blown out? I mean the Devils are

[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.880]
have been hot but for quite a lot. What's wrong with the Panthers? Are they chopped liver?

[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.140]
Oh no. Not a bad record. Well no but what I'm saying you look at the fact that the pan

[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:13.380]
and I go back to hockey all the way back to the old WHO. Please. Oh no. Please don't do that.

[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.880]
Please. But what I'm what I'm getting at is the panthers had a miserable record against the top

[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.140]
teams. Me. So yeah. And they got out there against the Devils and they did not get their asses

[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:27.240]
kicked. They played a very good respect and they get their asses kicked. I kicked I expected

[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.380]
them to win that game five to one. That was my. I would have loved to have seen it. I would

[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.460]
there would have been a great guy. I would have loved reason why we can't play with them. What's

[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:36.880]
the big deal with them? They got some nice young players and Broderon Broderlet and two

[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.700]
greasy goals in that game by the way. So we had no reason to blow that game. He gave us two

[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:44.400]
gift. They were gift wrapped. You're right. My only reason though for saying that it was a

[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.600]
good loss. I was just looking for something positive to pull out of there. And the only thing

[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.920]
positive is that they were a very Lewis murdered. If it wasn't him it would have been something else.

[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.840]
Now this is true. Okay. I have a great thing. Neil, I'll talk to you when I get back. Don't do it

[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:03.100]
again. Have a great time. Wait Neil. Yeah. He shoots and scores. Oh God. Is he back on

[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:09.200]
that Peter North kick again? 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. Squirt, Squirt on the 18 T. You know,

[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:12.400]
Peter North is 72 and still looks pretty good. Now you maybe don't look pretty good. I mean,

[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.180]
come on. Get him out of there already. Oh, we can still uh. Squirt, Squirt.

[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:25.080]
Straight 28 minutes after 11 at 5 60 WQA. I like the wea. One, two, uh, three. I made it through

[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:30.700]
college and average this. I have a lot of money. I'm not a bunch of a brain. I'm not supposed to use

[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:37.500]
voters who were justice laying. But I can say one thing that you can. My daddy is an ex-president.

[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:43.900]
I got money. Power and up into lose. I can do everything I choose. All right. The name of the

[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:50.800]
head of cash is all I need is to satisfy my ego and my career. An impulative marketing is all I

[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:57.640]
use. I don't have both for more rhymes just like you. That can school in the fun of the last.

[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:06.860]
I don't think I laugh that bad. Remember to vote for George Bush and those of you who don't. You

[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:12.200]
can kiss my touch. You see what matters to me about the presidency. Is that it makes a nice

[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:21.340]
conversation? I'm the king of denial too. I have no problem. I have to use. So why is it so important

[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:28.740]
for you to know whether or not I did blow a little bit of cocaine up my nose a little bit of

[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:34.260]
attitude a little blow when I'm like that I'll put it in the wall back when I put it up the

[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:47.140]
conscious straight. Yeah one more come on one more. No. It's 1132 at 560 WQM happy Tuesday to

[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:52.220]
end. God I feel great today you know. Because tomorrow's Wednesday and then after Wednesday is

[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:57.120]
Thursday and then once we get to the end of the week well don't go in. 5 6 7 0 5. No see that's

[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.200]
reason I keep coming in every day because if I work for a few days then there's another vacation

[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:05.500]
coming up. All right. Yeah that's what life is all about working a few days and going on vacation

[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:11.260]
for about a month. 5 6 7 0 5 6 8 where's buddy but tax and what we need them huh. I'm gonna be

[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:14.660]
frustrated. Yeah how about another seven month paid vacation sounds good to me. I say seven

[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:17.960]
months is good enough time for them to get a phone system and hear that work. Yeah that should be

[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.680]
enough. So this pay me like an advance or I'll give you a PO box you can send the checks to

[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.100]
and I'll take off and I'll just have months only this time I'll do it right.

[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:32.880]
Here's Fort Myers again hello. Well yes Neil I would like to thank you for your comment on education.

[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:38.540]
I can't understand people that would fall for this bovine scatology that these polish

[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:42.920]
traditions put out about what they're gonna do with our education. Yeah exactly.

[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:49.940]
Joe I have two kids a grandchildren in school. My wife assists at the school one day a week.

[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:55.580]
You have to be in there to see what's going on and it's a good education in our public schools

[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.780]
and so the governor to deny money from the school that they deemed this underperforming is just

[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:05.080]
totally ridiculous. How could any I want to say something to you since you brought this up and

[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.700]
I have a thing and especially since that dark and collected guy called earlier in the show

[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:14.080]
excuse me of being a racist. The greatest crime in education that goes on in this country.

[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:19.520]
The most racist the most institutionally racist thing that goes on in this country is allowing

[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:24.100]
black students to go to school many of them. I don't know what percentage but a very high

[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:29.340]
unacceptable percentage and not be educated. This is a national shame at a disgrace and unfortunately

[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.840]
because black people have very little power in this society nobody gives a crap. This is unacceptable

[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.000]
to have all these functionally illiterate. We have plenty of white functional literates

[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.280]
but a very high a terrifying percentage of young black people who can't speak properly,

[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:47.000]
who can't read, who can't write, who get social promotion. This is unething acceptable.

[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:52.280]
Well in school and educating in my opinion. How can you have a teacher and a principal who says

[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.100]
let me ask you a question. How can you have somebody in a position like that who can't even speak

[01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:01.260]
the language? Well you can't. You just can't. But you see education in this country I put higher

[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:05.420]
than police and fire protection and military defense. Yeah but you're you now you're the only ones.

[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:10.140]
Now are you apparently apparently so. It's like our line four and line eight you know they're just

[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:13.400]
making noises back at each other. That's what we're doing because nobody cares. All they care about

[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:17.740]
is you know some dumb jock that's making 15 20 million dollar a year for throwing a stupid

[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:23.040]
ball around. Exactly and while I again thank you very much and glad to know at least one other person

[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:29.340]
shares my view. We're the ones. Thank you. God bless us. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60. You go to other

[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:33.400]
countries all over Western Europe and they speak two, three, four, five languages fluently.

[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:41.240]
And here let me ask you something. Go into some of these supermarkets that I want to mention

[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:47.300]
which ones. I don't want to mention which one. And they got people working in there and not only are

[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:51.420]
they functionally illiterate but nobody even bothers to tell them take care of the customer. That's

[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.960]
your job. We're only getting paid 50 cent an hour whatever it is but take care of the customer instead

[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:01.420]
of standing there talking your crap. Oh does that frost my ass never happens in my public so I'll

[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:05.680]
tell you that. Nice going there Robert. They know how to train the people to take care of the

[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.820]
customers in a store like that. But you go into some of these marginal supermarkets and they're

[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:15.580]
talking crap back and forth and about this one's hair and they're sliding the stuff along. You

[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:19.860]
even know if they're scanning it or not scanning it or scanning it to five times and they

[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:23.640]
plopped the change in your hand instead of counting it out. I mean they couldn't give a crap

[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.240]
less about you. They're just putting in the goddamn time.

[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:35.480]
So national disgrace this grace and instead of Jesse Jackson running around worrying about God

[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.200]
damn Ray Rhodes getting fired because he's a black football coach. He ought to be worrying about

[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.140]
this kind of stuff. That's where he ought to be expending all of his energies.

[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:50.040]
Instead of talking his jivas rhyme crap that he talks he ought to be worried about the important

[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.240]
things like getting blacks educated in America so that they can speak and then we can say goodbye

[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:58.720]
to affirmative action forever and nobody gets pissed off about it because then you can

[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.840]
compete on an equal footing like it should be instead of just bringing in minority people because

[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.700]
you got a quota to fill because we got to have a little tokenism there to keep Uncle Sam off your

[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:10.900]
back. So it looks like we're doing something we're throwing a little bit of a little bone

[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.680]
near to the minorities. Yeah we're giving it in the bone all right. Reckon. That's where.

[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:23.100]
You know exactly what I'm talking about you go into retail places all the time and you hear

[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:26.820]
people talk and you couldn't if they held a gun to your head in some of them might. If they

[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:31.080]
held a gun to your head you couldn't tell anybody what they were saying you need an interpreter and

[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.740]
guess what they think they're speaking English. Are they speaking English? No. No way Jose.

[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:42.760]
I can't even tell you what they be speaking and these people somehow got through the education

[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:48.160]
system in this horse ball country. I don't get it and I also don't get how to sales department

[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.340]
thinks that they can keep playing fast and loose and bringing me a bunch of year and a half old

[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:54.400]
copy and thinking it's going to be out that I'm going to believe it's something new that they just

[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:59.480]
whipped up. You people down there on the second floor rhymes with a whore in the sales department

[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.400]
here at QIM. Just ask Joe Costella he'll tell you he ran out of your tear and his hair out by the

[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:09.320]
roots getting away from that goddamn job that he had even if it means only making 15 bucks an hour

[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:16.540]
a year every 10 years he'll put up with it because one thing he won't put up with is that sales

[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:21.160]
department here at QIM that really believes that they're pulling the wheel over my old foggy eyes.

[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:26.420]
Well you're not guys give me something new give me something to work with just like Gary Sarner

[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:30.780]

[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.880]
gave me plus the two hours we've been on this morning he could have written me a nice piece of

[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.800]
copy which I don't want to say what account it is that we had that piece of copy coming yesterday

[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.100]
like two minutes before we're supposed to go on a year with Ray we have no idea what he does

[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:48.520]

[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.340]
competency of the sales department here at QIM ladies and gentlemen because there isn't any

[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:07.240]

[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.180]
asked eight acts eight seven so and you notice nobody ever responds to that and you want to know why

[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:21.060]
because most of you white people you're very content to have the black the dark folks are

[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:27.200]
uneducated you're very happy aren't you you love it that's so that John Rocker can keep going

[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.540]
around and making those comments and a lot of people say oh yeah he got a point there you know he

[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:39.840]
got a point he'd be having a point right there in the top of his head I'm embarrassed humiliated and

[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:49.620]
degraded when I see so many young black people who can't speak a lick even a teeny tiny little bit

[01:28:49.620 --> 01:29:00.760]
of English here's bargate hello no yes sir yes on Sunday morning on CBS Sunday morning or

[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:10.680]
or equivalent CNN they had a piece on the that in the priesthood the hiv is very

[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:14.480]
very high about that a length yesterday you're way behind a present like in still got a bad headache

[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:19.840]
okay these those of you people out there you must listen to the show every day from 10 am to 2 p.m

[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.460]
I don't want to go back and talk about stuff we talked about yesterday in addition to which I

[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:28.660]
told you that long time ago did not about the bags in the goddamn church I love it these oh

[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:32.720]
guess what we just discovered you know Ben and Jerry's come out with a new flavor it's called fish

[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:44.720]
food wow better check that out four times the rate of the general population the hiv infection in

[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.480]
the priest at least that we know about not to mention of course all that we never hear a no

[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:51.760]
about and then of course we also found out that article yesterday that they lie about the

[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:55.460]
occupation and about the nature of the disease and do the best they can to sweep it out of the carpet

[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:58.880]
and then I have to laugh they had some jackass on her yesterday on the news last night

[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.300]
from the church another one of their henchmen saying well you know maybe this is a good thing

[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:08.000]
because now the church can you know we we can enlighten people more about hiv and talk about it

[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.460]
more freely I thought they were supposed to be celibate not a bunch of guy that perverted

[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:17.340]
hypocrite pedophiles is what was supposed to be all about celibacy or as Bulk of Brian says

[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:22.480]
celibacy is not what it's supposed to be about even though of course that that's the sickest

[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:27.120]
concept anybody could ever hear of the very notion that sex must be dirty and evil and if

[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.900]
you're celibate therefore you must be better isn't that right yeah because sex is dirty they so

[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:35.620]
dirty but do it a lot if you make a lot of babies because we like that it's dirty unless you're

[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:39.140]
making babies for the catalytic church the Pope likes that a lot and he also likes to watch

[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:49.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line and the out of town line man 8 7 7 8 5 63 45

[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:55.220]
you show me a man in a dress and I'll guarantee you you run like hell

[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:05.380]
here's a mobile and sunrise hello hello yes sir hey no I'm a black guy I just moved here about a

[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:11.480]
year ago I'm so sorry where did you come from New Orleans oh well like I said welcome to a better

[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:17.060]
place yeah exactly that's it that is I mean you talk about stupid the average IQ the average IQ

[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:22.300]
in New Orleans the in fact when you say hello to somebody they go like that every time gotter

[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:28.740]
they dumb yeah it is pretty dumb but the thing is as a black person in New Orleans the reason why I

[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:33.600]
can give you my view the reason why there are so many black people that are uneducated is because

[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:39.380]
their parents are their friends are and if you try to be any different you're considered white

[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:45.180]
so you're not cool if you actually go to school and pay attention isn't that pathetic isn't that

[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:52.060]
tragic it's horrible and I mean there's no value there's no moral I mean as not a fact I

[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:59.760]
went to church one day and I had gave a speech and in my speech it was teaching kids on how to

[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:06.560]
grow up and you know I have a moral yeah but I was like who cares what people think of you as long

[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.680]
as it's not you know negative or bringing you down and if it is don't worry about those people

[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.900]
because those aren't your friends anyway and the question of what people think of you it's

[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:21.960]
a question of functioning and succeeding in a competitive society you can't you can't succeed if

[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:28.820]
you're illiterate no you can't there's no what's what's the benefit there is no benefit sounds

[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:33.260]
like an excuse to me for a bunch of people being lazy and shifless in the stupid is what it sounds

[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:38.540]
like exactly well that's unacceptable well that's all material I have I just want to give you

[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:42.960]
that insight from back and don't unpack too soon because believe me they're saying no great shakes

[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:49.600]
either have a great time I came here from New Orleans where they say how's value oh man

[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:54.160]
I for the life of me I have no idea anybody wants to go there and look set the bunch of professional

[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:58.360]
drunks for drunks that's all you can go to key words if you want to get drunk it's a lot closer

[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:08.360]
all that's kind of a hairy ride down there they tell me but I mean what's the point have you ever

[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:13.920]
why is that because it's one of the who told you that several friends of mine who's been there

[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:20.360]
sore toilet septic tank those are the terms that come to mind when I think of New Orleans great jazz

[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:27.160]
now you ended jazz it's okay but is that like a big thing in your life I wouldn't try it down the block

[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:32.420]
no and drunk you can get like you down the block anywhere you're right in a building you can do that

[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:39.060]
so what's the point what is there to go there for tna no no because everybody's like passed out

[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:46.900]
on the street on bourbon street from too much bourbon cradads yeah cradads there you go and the

[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:51.260]

[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.880]
restaurants by the way before we before we do this spot before I do it I just want to mention

[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.980]

[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:50.380]
message for me here to show that he really cared about what he's doing but of course why should he

[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:55.860]
be different from the rest of our sales department right yeah Gary Sarner he's an asshole make no

[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:59.760]

[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.680]
all right

[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:37.560]
the fat time is let the food they scrape so you don't complain but that's not chicken in your chicken

[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:45.260]
chow mein seems to me I hold a sweet and sour pork but Garfield's on my phone it's

every day it moves like you can and you'll never know once they're out there I've been no voice

[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:05.440]
they tried real crisps in the old

[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:17.820]
chow mein asked if I wanted more as he was dying up his body at the old pet store said not today I

[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:23.860]

it and the tongues are too when I swear I've heard it me and that is where I knew

[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:39.680]
there's a cat in the kettle there's a teaching move think I got a stop feeding there it moves

[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:46.520]
they say that it's deep for fish or pork but it's perring there on my fork there's a

[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.500]
hairball on my fork

[01:36:53.400 --> 01:37:00.100]
all right it's a minute past 12 note at 5.60 w Q a m come on wait till the marmorning and

[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.980]

wanted to do was take a little peek maybe maybe you want to get inside to take a little leak maybe

[01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:17.060]
that's what Hank was saying little leak I thought he said peak yeah maybe he had to go of course

[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:20.260]
when you're outside 5.30 tomorrow you don't want to pee outside do you know because then you'll

[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:26.060]
be like Billy Carter and look at what happened to him 5.670560 we got some open lines here but I'm

[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:29.340]
not going to get too excited about it for obvious reasons because some of them they work and some

[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:35.040]
of them they don't and some it's just as well and the other timeline is open 8777 856345

[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:42.940]
here's Miami hello hello yes sir I agree with you about the education part of what's up black people

[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:48.760]
but do you really believe that we need to get rid of some of the action yes you really do yes I do

[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.720]
I mean you know you're just a banana carry public and you have all these yeah people who want to

[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:59.760]
speak English get in jobs yeah so what's our plan what's our plan for your level what is it

[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.680]
the weather plan for you know what do you mean level playing field see to me a level playing field means

[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.580]
that if you're qualified for a job you're going to get hired that's what it means to me level playing

[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:13.540]
field and you actually think they're responsible even if I'm smiling of education it's all about

[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:19.000]
education no racism I have to do with it nothing yeah I don't understand what you're saying it's

[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.400]
possible if you don't have an educational why is it that so many people don't have an education

[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:27.180]
I'm careful they are the education if you don't have an education why should you get the job

[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:31.900]
in a first place just because you're black or Hispanic or whatever you're a woman that's the way

[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:38.340]
it is I you know is my race is really kind of these lawsuits that's why they have all these

[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:43.980]
lawsuits yeah that you ask me my opinion that's my opinion whoever's qualified to do the job they

[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:50.080]
should get it period that's that's what I believe I keep up with the job okay I understand what he's

[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.400]
saying but I mean it has to come a time sooner or later and then if you're not going to take advantage

[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.920]
of education or if you're not going to scream and yell instead of screaming about OJ instead of

[01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:00.640]
screaming about the amuracist in the Jesse's screaming about a bunch of punks up there in

[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.200]
Decaturilla, Illinois who started to ride at a high school up there take care of the important

[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.100]
things take care of making sure that everybody is getting an education and by the way those kids

[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:12.140]
now are getting an education at an alternative school without disrupting everybody else

[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:17.780]
that's the important thing not being milleted walking around with a guy named chip on one

[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:21.880]
shoulder when a guy named boombox on the other one and that stupid guy named rap music which contributes

[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:26.000]
to a literacy of white and black kids something fierce and believe me on the last person to start

[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.500]
being a funny buddy about music and the outside you right now today they let Elvis swivel his hips

[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:35.320]
on the air that was the end of America right there uh-huh that's right anybody believe that no

[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:40.940]
now it sounds good though that's what Ed Solomon said I bet you that Joe Castello don't even

[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:46.180]
remember the Ed Solomon show five sick not only hasn't he been in the whirlwinds or Boston I mean how

[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:53.020]
could how could an Italian kid like you never be in Boston with little Italy would one of the

[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:56.100]
cities in America I'm trying I mean New York goes without saying because I got all the

[01:39:56.100 --> 01:40:03.500]
ethnic things but of all the huh New York where I think in New York I'm kidding no I said Boston I

[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:07.940]
said New York has got great Italian food because New York is so big and it got great whatever you

[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:12.300]
want but I'm saying of all the other cities outside of New York I would say Boston has got to I

[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:16.780]
mean the whole North end is all Italian restaurants it's great for while I mean dig I mean the Italians

[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:23.000]
greed are greeders I want to go and plus it's a great city and there's a living and breathing people

[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.980]
there too there's all the colleges and universities and they believe little schools and art de

[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:34.480]
farti whatever and MIT and whatever it's all they're dying to go Quincy a market some of the best

[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.620]
food you'll ever pop in your purse what a great play it's that is great food Boston has got great

[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:44.060]
food I'm on the line with my travel agency so if you know but seriously I would say it's about

[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:49.360]
the same distance it's about the 1,200 miles I don't know what it is to New Orleans but it can't

[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:53.720]
be much less about the same same distance so why would you want to go to New Orleans when you can

[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.740]
go to Boston the same amount of uh uh travel time and go to a place that's like more sophisticated

[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:02.460]
we're living and breathing people more your kind of people real people not a bunch of dumb

[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:07.520]
mugwomps like those idiots in New Orleans I'd rather go to Chicago the dumbest people I ever seen

[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:14.560]
be the people in New Orleans actually you've never been in Chicago oh oh I'm going home I just

[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:19.640]
give up would you rather let me tell you where I have this man just celebrated his 27th birthday

[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:24.540]
he has never been in Boston New Orleans which you're not missing nothing Chicago how about Detroit

[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:27.560]
you know I'm missing anything there he's been to Detroit well like I said you make it

[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.760]
with choices just oh that's right you were there bad choice and you survived and he came back

[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:38.500]
from Detroit alive there I was right which means you didn't go on 12th Street I'm assuming where did

[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:42.780]
you go in Detroit I just drove through on my way to Gross Fast that's good right to Gwore's Port

[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:46.500]
where all the safe white people are that's good drove by the stadiums though where both white people

[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:51.940]
are in Detroit in a gross point five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty oh you were in

[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:57.060]
Pontiac you drove by the Silver Dome was there too isn't that I see how smart those people in Detroit

[01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:01.680]
are they put the stadium about the 700 miles north of the city there just to make sure that they're safe

[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:06.880]
I'm going to go to the stadiums the new and old yeah the old one the old one is great you never

[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.880]
were in the old tiger stadium for baseball game no just drove by close up where you're like sitting

[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.180]
so close to the field you could practically reach out and say hey Danny McLean you're an asshole

[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:19.440]
you know you're just great it looked fantastic and by the way since we're talking about scumbag

[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:24.200]
jocks for all you sparkes I think that I'm a racist I just pick on dark folks how about Danny McLean

[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:29.960]
there's a guy he had it all how many times did this guy get a reprieve god damn freaking Danny

[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:35.120]
McLean 50 million times and he come on he still ripped off that god damn you and he's back in a slam

[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:42.500]

riots in Detroit that was the end you see I hate to break the news to you and I've said this

[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:07.760]

[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:43.560]
how come the overhead just to kind of like die or something?

[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.180]
so I don't punch you with it but it just strange

[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:50.000]
but I know I did was go out and take a little leak and then come back in the levels are all screwed up in here

[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.220]
but I don't really care do I care?

[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:51.560]
no

[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:54.100]
no. my philosophy is I'll do the best I can

[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:54.840]
it's all I can do

[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.280]
can't make these people in real broadcasters can I?

[01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.320]
no. do the best I can

[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.740]
anyway the first time in history it's a two-panther hurricane sports events

[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:04.820]
could never have happened before could it?

[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:05.420]
no. no.

[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:08.420]
Florida panthers at the Carolina Heracun hockey

[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:11.860]
seven o'clock per game sale game time seven thirty here on QM560

[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:13.860]
and eight o'clock we joined in progress

[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.920]
because they probably got some other sold piece of crap programming on that station at 790 Waxi

[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.520]
8 PM Miami Heracun

[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:21.880]
pit panther basketball

[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:27.320]
which that game can also be heard in its entirety as you just heard from Tommy in the very distorted spot

[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:30.280]
but we love you Tommy on the internet at hurricane sports.com

[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:34.900]
that Tommy boy I wish the audience could I wish we had a tape recording of that

[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:40.600]
it was sensational because you know Robert Grieper was wandering around probably stealing stuff from him

[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.000]
here again which he takes a lot of our cards

[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.940]
but he was head the door open because we weren't sure if George was coming in which you were just still sick

[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:49.000]
and so he says to me do you want to do it open or close?

[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.820]
I said I can leave whatever turns you on him

[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:53.720]
yeah and he walked away the door was opened

[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:57.680]
that outer door it into the hallway so I could hear like all the stuff the scuttle but you know

[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.940]
with the worst team producers and then Joe Rose could see one thing I don't understand about that

[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:05.480]
you maybe you can explain it to me I mean like just now I went out to take a leak or if I have to get up

[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.140]
and get it something out of the refrigerator or whatever

[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.540]
I get up a couple of times during a show but I'm doing a radio show

[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:13.200]
those guys and I realize they have much longer breaks

[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.780]
but they get up and they just wander away and then people

[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:18.880]
oh two minutes two minutes show two minutes D-fo

[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.220]
get gilded get off the crap for 30 seconds

[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:22.200]
what is that?

[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.320]
they're busy slapping each other with towels

[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:27.100]
oh that's what that's all about huh?

[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.380]
I wonder why Joe came and dressed like that every day

[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:34.920]
here's a mobile or West Palm Beach hello

[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:37.880]
hey Neil yes sir what's going on good looking

[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:40.340]
I was just saying Joe Rose is a panic you know

[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.100]
I like the wee wee

[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.260]
that's who I wanted to talk about that's funny

[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:44.800]
that's a long kid man

[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:47.080]
oh my god it is the a long kid

[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:50.360]
he did a morning he was saying that he doesn't believe

[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:51.420]
defending Ray Lewis

[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.260]
well now he said he doesn't believe that many cases of rape

[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:59.860]
that are committed by athletes go unreported

[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:01.660]
oh of course like a lot of them

[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:03.540]
like we know that all women in the K-Rapes

[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.280]
immediately call a police and tell all the friends

[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:05.720]
and put it on the table

[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:08.880]
yeah we even knew about Cecil the Diesel's problems

[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.480]
all these like they were all reported

[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.900]
and it's interesting how the Adolfan organization

[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:14.900]
covered up the other incidents that he had

[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:16.860]
it is complex where he lived the ones that happened

[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:18.340]
in the summertime before we decided to go in

[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.220]
and take a look in his broad house at 5.30

[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.780]
morning if he pulled off the screen from the window

[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.560]
and broke in the window isn't that interesting

[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.380]
that they had those all the other things

[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:27.580]
and there's something else I've been wanting to talk to you about

[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.600]
not that it was happening to have anybody's DUI

[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.900]
covered up on that organization either but I'll go

[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:32.640]
over that later yes

[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:37.500]
Hank Goldberg said right after that Cecil Collins

[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:41.320]
broke out in news he came out with his own little story

[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.200]
did you ever hear that?

[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.000]
of course I did and I've been ripping him ever since

[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.160]
and it was absolutely unacceptable

[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.500]
and then when finally Cecil made his confession

[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.480]
and when I ripped Hank again on the ear that morning

[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:51.220]
forth he came on an attack that afternoon

[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:52.880]
and kind of mumbled a few things under his breath

[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.800]
well he said he was just trying to take a look

[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.260]
and it's all over as opposed to saying

[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:01.180]
I was wrong and these guys

[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:03.260]
they always spread rumors about the woman she's always

[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:04.780]
the one that's tried to be made to be the loose

[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.680]
and obnoxious and the a perpetrator

[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:09.080]
and it was all about your lies and they interviewed all the

[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:11.080]
Dauphin players and I understand through rumors

[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.600]
by the way I want to mention Paul Castro

[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:12.640]
and I want to say that he's a very

[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:13.780]
nice person over Mr. Ripoff artist

[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:15.440]
I understand he's still defending

[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:17.400]
and making up stories about this woman and saying

[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.000]
she was banging all the players on the team

[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.560]
and all of a sudden a bullcrap which is

[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:21.700]
pantely untrue

[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:23.640]
probably to save his own safe

[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:25.720]
come back defending other scumbags

[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:27.920]
here I find a very reprehensible and unacceptable

[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:31.580]
and I'm not acceptable and I think Hank knows better

[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:32.180]
that was from

[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:34.400]
and that's the great thing

[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:35.180]
God bless us

[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:36.620]
okay you're out over and out

[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:37.980]
he's out

[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:40.600]
877-785

[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.760]
look at this it's 20 past noon already it's like

[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.620]
falling off a log doing the show anymore you know

[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:46.620]
and if we had a phone system I'd work with that

[01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:48.360]
it wouldn't be nearly as much fun because then we couldn't do

[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:49.020]
I'd like this

[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:50.820]
oh I love it

[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:56.020]
I think this is becoming an integral part of the show

[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:57.680]
I can raise our numbers by at least a half a point

[01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.160]
oh I love it

[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.480]
put that one on with this one

[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:12.720]
you know how they do the stories on TV news only on 7 only on 10 only on QA

[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.100]
and when you hear these sounds boys and girls

[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:18.500]
and once you just heard two yeah that's right we got it all over that

[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:22.280]
queer channel man so what was Peter Leiter talking about this morning we so say goodbye to me

[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.320]
across my fingers my legs is he leaving us too

[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:28.280]
because he didn't come in here and do his usual phony baloney suck up routine

[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.660]
I mean he's he is what he is you know

[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:34.540]
because that sales the bad revolving door is spinning like a draital down there

[01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:36.560]
at least this sales department to talk about a turnover

[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:40.000]
I did see guys with nice white coats entering the building when I came

[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.260]
good excellent and also we got the pharmaceutical reps have come in to try to

[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:46.160]
try to con Peter down a little bit they're going to have any success at all

[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:50.560]
no yeah I saw the riddle in truck back up to the door and downstairs

[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:54.240]
they're going to take him out of here and I got them straight jacket Peter Leiter

[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.700]
four Peter Peter pumpkin leader

[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:59.740]
and I understand before I came here it was like kind of a normal guy is that true

[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:04.220]
no I don't know maybe just go through the territory being a sales hole

[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:06.600]
maybe sales people have to be a little bit on a little bit of a little

[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:09.620]
way you side John penis wasn't a bad guy though I always like penis

[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:13.680]
and he's gone I was not interested in the only lines that aren't li-

[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:16.220]
we were not paying the fair attention one day

[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:17.780]
oh I like that that's better

[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:19.500]

[01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:04.340]
but not in the way you think what was that little blurb that you got before was that like a piece of copy thing

[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:27.600]
course I'm like the people on death row you know or the people waiting to get I guess the people

[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:31.040]
on death row aren't doing it but the people in prison for a long time they're counting down the days

[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:35.580]
you know with the chalk thing on a wall I'm doing the same thing at home right there on the wall

[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:40.120]
and the huge picture of who's that Julio singer that I got that big thing of on a wall

[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:44.880]
Joey uh no it's not Luis Miguel it's Jerry Rivera

[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:50.580]
well I'm sure it doesn't look that good anymore one of my good some of my buddies from our

[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:56.720]
the Spanish language news and stations many years ago came in this huge huge photo of a glossy

[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:01.880]
thing of Jerry Rivera and it's on a wall in my house not because it looks all that great just

[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:06.780]
takes up some good room plus when people walk in they say oh look at that bag it yeah oh yeah

[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:11.300]
plus I got the 2000 calendar with those twins up on a wall two right next to it which I got

[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:15.200]
news for a Jerry Rivera don't look that good I don't think anybody looks quite that good do you know

[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:19.480]
even Joe Castelo admit those twins look pretty good even you would admit that

[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.800]
what on this calendar back here you've never seen this calendar

[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:33.120]
oh yeah you don't worry about this in here because this is QA and we don't care this is good

because I love talking about sports talking about sports with my buddies and stuff you know because

[01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:50.700]
you know some of them they got wives and girlfriends stuff and I have a lot of chance to have

[01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:56.320]
oh sure when I'm with my buddies I talk about getting laid oh sure sure sure sure I had one of those

[01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:02.060]
I had that lay but but the mainly sports is what I know that's right I talk about sports all the time

[01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:08.820]
and then I go home because I got really my efficiency is a hot plate and then I sit in bed and

[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:15.900]
drop cracker crumbs in my underwear and that's all my life pretty much consists of I'm sat at sports

[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:23.900]
it was a boy side after all I got my life

[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.040]

[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:39.660]
okay 1231 at 560 W2M so speaking of Christina Aguilera which we were yesterday the word finally

[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:43.520]
came to mind I was driving home and it suddenly struck me what the word was to describe her in

[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:49.060]
one word which I despise in the the word is mousey she's mousey looking

[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:54.220]
besides the fact that she's short and trippy and weighs about a hundred pounds about 80 pounds

[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:59.360]
about 40 pounds mousey she was in the Mickey Mouse Club there you go now we understand why she

[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:03.720]
was in the Mickey Mouse Club because she's mousey looking like Christina baby she's a skank

[02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:10.220]
and can't sing for a Schmidt 5 6 7 0 5 60 5 60 on the AT&T line

[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:14.440]

[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:19.400]
for from the record company was Ed Schmidt and she said oh I can't sing for Schmidt

[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:25.200]

no she was good wasn't that ambitious buddy in fact maybe she knows the fruity gourmet it's possible

[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:53.200]

[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:37.020]
and make up his dumb schedule but of course being in management there's the one pony show it's

[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:41.220]
only Greg Reed and if I was him and I had a brain I'd be really embarrassed you know it of course

[02:01:41.220 --> 02:01:45.400]
he doesn't have a brain so he can't be embarrassed there's an old saying that fits this place perfectly

[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.720]
where there's no sense there's no feeling well if there were ever a line I mean I heard that

[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:54.780]
as in years ago but if ever there were a place that that fits right to a tee this is the place

[02:01:54.780 --> 02:02:01.540]
where there's no sense there's no feeling here's the Fort Waterdale hello

[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:10.620]

[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:38.760]
what kind of crap is that I have no patience for that crap you wanted to bait something that

[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:44.920]
took place on somebody else's show why in God's name why in God's name would you call a me in

[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:48.900]
the circuit and also because you know that maybe you'll get me to agree or you'll do it out of

[02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:55.940]
context or whatever I don't play that game sir five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on

[02:02:55.940 --> 02:03:01.920]
the AT&T line tool free line for the entire universe sport Myers Palm Beach Boston Chicago New Orleans

[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:07.400]
Niagara Falls all the places that Joe's never been to eight seven seven seven eight five sixty three

[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:10.660]
forty five now see you never haven't been to New Orleans and Niagara Falls you're not missing

[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:16.660]
anything Niagara Falls is just a tourist trap very very overpriced especially Niagara Falls Ontario

[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:21.760]
and what once you see the water pishing you can go to the lodge you and Vegas and see water

[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:27.680]
pishing you know at least have a good time but Niagara Falls is strictly not the place to go

[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.120]
all the way they do have a casino there now anybody in this audience been to the casino and

[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:37.280]
Niagara Falls let's hear about it never never don't on me there may be one good reason to go there

[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:43.680]
although I done it very very high price tourist trap the worst almost as bad as funnza but without

[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:48.580]
the beauty of forance Italy that's a beautiful place but what a tourist trap don't buy any jewelry on

[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.020]
you know up and coming radio I saw plenty of shleppers in Italy there weren't hot shots the people

[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:12.600]
that I saw there plenty of very marginal shleppers and I saw plenty of tourists they're back packing

[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:21.220]
and stuff like that back packing what's wrong with that I don't back pack oh excuse me you don't

[02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:25.980]
back pack in other words you don't want to go there badly enough that you would bring yourself

[02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:29.540]
down to that level you wouldn't resort you wouldn't lower your standards to go there like a

[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:33.780]
shlepper you have to go there like first class like maybe an allotalia like next to the Pope that

[02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:39.020]

[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:55.920]
That's why he won the elections.

[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:58.320]
They thought the solar was I like Kike.

[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:04.700]
See, and you got a puzzle look on your face because you have no idea what I'm talking about.

[02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:06.400]
You don't know Dwight Eisenhower.

[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:07.760]
Don't remember general Eisenhower.

[02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:08.780]
Like the Eisenhower.

[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:09.080]
I know.

[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:09.600]
Very good.

[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:10.700]
I like Kike.

[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:14.340]
5.670560, Pant.

[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:15.900]
Why is he the reason?

[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:17.060]
What reason for what?

[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:18.160]
Because he was illiterate.

[02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:19.380]
He had a lot of interest.

[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:21.300]
He was like borderline illiterate.

[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.300]
He was a fine general.

[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:23.680]
I guess he never saw a freight train.

[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:25.440]
He never messed around too much with the guys.

[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:27.520]
But he was a borderline.

[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:31.860]
He was a dummy and he ran against Adelaide Stevenson and egghead, a brilliant man.

[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:36.140]
A man who could speak, who could articulate, who was a scholar.

[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:38.540]
A man who could be respected.

[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:40.920]
And Eisenhower was like, wouldn't we live like that?

[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:42.340]
Dumb.

[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.820]
Not as dumb as zero four, but then again, who is?

[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:53.960]
In fact, you know, Gerald, they used to make sure that he spit out his gun before he went into the crapper's zero four because he couldn't submit and two gunmen at the same time.

[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.400]
Here's a pay phone in Hollywood, LL.

[02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:57.960]

[02:10:58.180 --> 02:10:58.440]
Hello?

[02:10:58.660 --> 02:10:59.300]
Even I like that.

[02:10:59.460 --> 02:10:59.820]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:01.360]
Neil, Buenos Pienes.

[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:02.040]
And back to you.

[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:07.220]
Hey, I called him because you've been talking about the absurdities of modern day sports.

[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:07.800]
Yes.

[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:15.740]
And I just wanted to add a quick observation of my own that I think may explain how we've gotten to the ridiculous point we're at now.

[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:22.960]
You know how for thousands of years people were basically kept dumb and happy with religion?

[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:24.720]
What do you mean more?

[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:26.100]
Is it like it's in the past tense?

[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:27.240]
Right.

[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:27.560]
Yeah.

[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:30.640]
But maybe not as many now as in the past.

[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:31.540]
Dream on, man.

[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:32.260]
But, but.

[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:35.120]
And I left out a pap you can, by the way, when I gave the list of great.

[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:37.840]
Oh, yeah, so pap you can and sorry, go ahead.

[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:44.860]
Well, what I think has happened is sports has replaced religion as the great opiate of the past.

[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:45.600]
That's right in there.

[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:46.240]
Yeah.

[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:48.860]
One thing you're missing in that is to these people is religion.

[02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:49.960]
It's a religion.

[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:52.260]
No, no, you're laughing, but it's true.

[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:54.460]
It is a religion is a way of life, especially football.

[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:55.140]
Yeah.

[02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:00.620]
You know, with this melodramatic view, you know, with the ABC and then Fox's got that whatever hell they're however there is,

[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:04.960]
goes this really melodramatic music like something important is going to happen and of course it isn't.

[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:05.940]
Yeah.

[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:16.480]
And if I can add one more thing, I think it's unfortunate that quite true that it's basically the nature of most people to just wire away their lives concerned primarily with, you know, trivia hours.

[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:38.260]
I think that's the kind of thing that I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think

I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I

my ass and biggest and have a good time doing it once in a very very wild win but not too

[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:47.140]
often. I don't care. I feel sorry for people who are compulsive gambling. I think it's

[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:50.360]
first. In fact, Hank made a comment yesterday that I thought at least it was an honest

[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:55.600]
admission. But somebody was asking him what it was a horrible call as so many of them

[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:00.180]
are. But he was asking the Hank Lynn along in Ponderous way, what team does he root for?

[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:04.060]
And he says, I don't root for teams. I gave up that a long time ago because Jimmy DeGreek

[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:10.900]
taught him that if you're going to have a financial interest, you can't be a fan. So see,

[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:14.000]
that's basically the sports coverage on this radio stage. Has that guy anything to be

[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.460]
the sports fan? It has to do with being a compulsive sports gambler. That's what it's

[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:23.660]
all about. Which I can't relate to that. See, as far as I'm concerned, they can eliminate

[02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:28.840]
all the sports teams except the Toronto Maple Leafs. And then you say, well, who are they

[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:31.340]
going to play? Well, they would never have to play it because then they'd be undefeated

[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:35.220]
because they'd be nowhere left to play. Ah, perfect season every year without all the

[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:39.580]
stress that goes along with those tough games, you know, overtime. Here's Carl Spring.

[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:43.600]
Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. You've been talking about the lowering of the calm denominator

[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.200]
in the educational system. Way back when when you had George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,

[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:52.120]
Benjamin Franklin, you had a larger pool of intelligent people to pick from. Yeah.

[02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:56.000]
Which brings me to my well, how is that possible when you had so, what was the population

[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:01.060]
back then about 500? Yeah, yeah. We got a hundred. We got 260 million people at

[02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:06.860]
least 220 of them are more on. You still have more glitterer people way back when. Isn't

[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:13.320]
that close enough? And it brings me to my rant of the day, which is the single most, most

[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:19.380]
unintelligent, biological group of people on the planet. Yes, sir. Pretty construction

[02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:23.760]
engineers. What the hell in Las Vegas, it took six months to go to New York, New York

[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:27.380]
casino. A year and a half to put up a traffic light in the divide or a troppo in Maryland.

[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:31.600]
Yeah. And he got in New York 15 years to fix the Pennsylvania River, New York, on the

[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:35.660]
Del Parkway. Right. Now here you've got all of this construction on sample road. I

[02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:39.200]
live in the West part of course. Yeah. Well, get used to it, pal, because it's not going

[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:43.060]
to change. Listen to this activity. Okay. Now people are getting more of it simple. They

[02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:46.560]
realize they got to go somewhere else. So if you cover from Boca, like I just did, you

[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:53.200]
get off its Southwest 10. I don't know if you know those. No, no, I stayed. Anyway, you

[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:57.220]
just got to fix example a major intersection along with the fact that there's a video about

[02:15:57.220 --> 02:16:03.040]
books. Yeah. But anyway, you think that they leave that side open. No, now they got

[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:09.180]
construction a par line. So you still can't get home. Yeah. Open up our road. The people

[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:12.680]
who are out there trying to make a buck. That is not the Florida F and Waster we don't

[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:16.420]
want to do that. We want to make it as inconvenient and stressful as we possibly can. Listen,

[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:19.320]
little, little, little, little, little and absolutely fabulous I agree with you want to

[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:22.960]
Well, it's not to like the weather sucks, but I mean I'm gonna start and you can't make a legal

[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:26.100]
left turn so anytime they got a go somewhere you gotta go completely around town

[02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:29.120]
Okay, I have a right-down C.I. Roe. I'll see you at the rotary. I bet okay

[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:32.220]
Have you ever seen a rotary by the way? Well, yeah, you've seen the Hollywood circle

[02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:36.500]
I guess cuz then you used to live in Hollywood or sure that's why I grew up Hollywood circle

[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:39.960]
You're very familiar with it. Yes, I am so they have a lot of those only in New England

[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:43.360]
They call them rotaries and also they have a lot of those in Rome too

[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:46.820]
So you go to Boston first and you go to the North and it eat something to tag your restaurants

[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:51.880]
And then you go to Italy and eat in real a tiny restaurant, but you'll see those rotaries which are like circles and

[02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:57.780]
Rome I just I'm sorry. I have no idea how those people drive right there are for the most part

[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:00.520]
There are no lanes marked on the roads in Rome

[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:04.780]
I mean if there are they're so old because the city is so old that you don't even see the lines

[02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:08.720]
It's just they make it up a single along and everybody drives these little teeny tiny cars

[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:13.400]
They can like almost put in your back pocket, you know and I just don't understand it that

[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:18.660]
It's a miracle that there aren't like zillions of crashes every day if you had the people from here

[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:26.000]
Driving in Rome if you had a thousand people from here getting in vehicles of any kind driving in Rome at the end of the first day

[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.700]
At the end of the first half of the day you have a thousand dead people and they'd be the ones from here

[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:32.780]
I wouldn't drive in Rome if they paid me by the

[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:39.480]
Block you already answered my question, but typically the vehicles in Rome are just horrible nobody has nice cars

[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:47.480]
There are some but I wouldn't say they're horrible, but they're all small because very few people drive large cars now in Berlin on the other hand

[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:53.240]
You feel drive a big car and you feel like it in Berlin, Germany. There's a lot of big cars of course. They may happen to make them so

[02:17:56.300 --> 02:17:58.240]
Have you been oh you haven't been to Berlin?

[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:03.640]
Yeah, beautiful city. How about Cologne? You've certainly been to Cologne, Germany. No

[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.520]
I'd like to get on that auto box. Have you ever been on the train to a 5 6 7 0

[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:14.680]
No, see I'm just saying these things so that like in future years when you stock up all the money that you're making from doing the show

[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:17.220]
Which like I said by the time you're 175

[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:23.140]
She I think that's very sad. I think that's and it's not as expensive as you think

[02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:26.340]
That's the problem a lot of people like you think oh gee

[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:30.220]
He's making all the big money and which is true. I can afford to go first class in the good hotel

[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:34.140]
You don't have to do that look at look at the thing with national airlines to Vegas

[02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:38.280]
2569 bucks or whatever it is round trip now granted you're in coach and you're sitting back there

[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:44.140]
But it's only for a few hours and then you go there and have a great time and they've got fantastic cheap deals as you know in hotels and Vegas

[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:49.700]
Don't you think they have like a three a three star hotels for example in the role and all these wonderful places

[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:51.640]
You don't have to stay in a five-hour hotel

[02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:59.480]
What it's not that I'm just suggesting it to you just something for you to think about

[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:05.440]
Vegas is totally different though then what Vegas is more affordable than Rome

[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:09.640]
It's not even no no how much money do you lose gambling in Rome?

[02:19:10.220 --> 02:19:16.480]
That is absolutely untrue. I air I the last trip that I made for the weekend to Vegas to weekends ago

[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.420]
I could have gone the two of us could have gone to Rome for a week

[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:23.380]
And spent less

[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:27.580]
True story

[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:31.760]
Because you know lose all that money gambling. I mean Vegas is wonderful. Don't get me wrong

[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:34.060]
But you're gonna lose your ass gamble. You know that oh

[02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:35.580]
I'm very sorry

[02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:40.220]
Just something for you to think about not try to be pushy

[02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:44.760]
But Italy if for an Italian guy like you you definitely must go there and understand what we look at into all about

[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:46.640]
Not those guitos that you're probably familiar with

[02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:48.640]
Here's Miami Beach hello

[02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:55.480]
Okay, sir. Yeah, I was calling about the education. I was driving and I was listening to you saying about

[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:57.160]
You know the colored people

[02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:06.180]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, you know, don't speak you know proper English. I agree with you through a little bit step one

[02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:07.100]
There is no why

[02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:12.800]
Call of people don't speak the proper English because um, I'm from New York

[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:18.940]
So well, they don't need her but anyway, I know but what happened is when I when I was in school

[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:24.260]
You know, I I have books in my hand and people look at me like I was a nerd

[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:28.640]
So if you if you want to do good at school, right, you know other blacks look at me

[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:32.680]
This has a nerd. Well, that's what somebody said that you're trying to be white if you do that in other words

[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:36.820]
But what an idiotic attitude that is in other words white people are educated and they can read and speak

[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:40.120]
And if you want to be like them go ahead, but then you'll be a whitey in a cop out and you know

[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:42.320]
We want to be a little bit I just I don't understand that

[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:44.520]
This is stupid remark. What kind of an attitude is that?

[02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:50.200]
I'm also on the other hand oldest politician that the black politicians are really you know

[02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:54.840]
Are really funny, you know, I said that they're really funny. Yeah, because they're not but these problems

[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:56.920]
Why they don't you know address it?

[02:20:57.240 --> 02:21:02.940]
So you know what? Hey, I you know, I have been hearing about you know, you know, black people don't know how to speak probably English

[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:08.540]
It was just something about it right instead of you know, we have but uh, instead of this damn uh, you know

[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:12.460]
Social promotion crap where people keep moving up from one grade or another when they can't even speak

[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:18.180]
That's got to stop now as in today. You see just see it's just got right anybody who says to me

[02:21:18.180 --> 02:21:21.940]
Let me be asking you a question that person has got to be back in kindergarten immediately

[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:27.320]
Not soon even if they're 50 years old. I know and also that was something else. I was listening to you while I was driving

[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:29.200]
Yeah, and it does make a lot of sense

[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:35.020]
I think if you if you speak proper English the best person was qualified to get the job amen

[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:39.600]
He doesn't matter if you're whoever race you are right because it just doesn't make sense

[02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:43.940]
All that because you're black. That's when you're supposed to get a job even though you know you're ignorant

[02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:49.680]
It has to do with the quality of service and the quality of life and the idea that we should accept unacceptable quality because some

[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:54.880]
Bozo needs to get pushed ahead of line. It's unacceptable to us and god bless you sir. Well said

[02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:59.560]
Did he say it well? Yeah, it's 1257 at 560 qm

[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:03.080]

[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:39.360]
How's line four to them? Maybe that's open up again, huh?

[02:23:40.380 --> 02:23:41.160]
What's so bad?

[02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:43.200]
What is that? Hello

[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:45.500]
Oh

[02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:46.280]
Now that's strange

[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:51.780]
The sounds of silence on line four hello. Oh wait a minute. Hello

[02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:54.800]
All right, Neil. There's somebody on line four

[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.340]
Yeah, oh my god. Wow

[02:23:57.340 --> 02:24:02.240]
Well, never go through that. I'm in shock. This must be the baby Jesus junior

[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:04.900]
There you go. Hey listen

[02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:13.080]
You were talking about the trips to Europe and I agree 100% with you and most Americans knew how affordable they are right

[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:19.920]
And how to run around the country in different areas. I tell you what I think they're visited more often

[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:25.540]
I mean it's a there are two there are two reasons that most Americans don't go to Europe number one

[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:30.120]
They're taking cost too much and number two the reason that the number one American destination in Europe for tourism

[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:34.460]
Is England is because they're terrified of the language they don't want to go somewhere where no speaking English

[02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:37.520]
So they're terrified and scared the crap. Listen, that's very sad

[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:42.760]
Yes, very sad bitches simple fact that I it's eventually you can become an

[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:44.040]
Universal around the

[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:47.800]
European world right all of northern Europe everybody speaks English

[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:51.040]
Exactly, I knew because it's mandatory in school and anywhere else

[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:56.180]
Even in France, I hate to say but even there in the service industry like in hotels and so on

[02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:58.600]
There's no problem. I never hand countered any difficulty

[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:02.580]
Functioning in English anywhere. I was there maybe using the few words of whatever language it was

[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:09.160]
Right, yeah, yeah, and I tell you what if they really check into some of the overseas on flight

[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:12.180]
It'd be amazing how cheap they can fly over there

[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:17.500]
I mean, I'm trying to get some of these people to broaden their horizons so they don't need to spend all their time and got them sweet

[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:20.700]
Water and odious you know go and see what the real world is all about they'd be amazed

[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:22.820]
Yeah, and you were talking about the roadries

[02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:30.100]
I remember I mean, I'm from New England from the Boston area. Yeah, I'm so we had the rotary phones. Yeah

[02:25:31.720 --> 02:25:32.440]
But anyways

[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:40.720]
Over in England we had to round about so only trouble was you had to figure out which way to go half the time because the signs were right on top

[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:45.020]
Those never been able to figure out which way to go. That's why somebody the max oh, pressy all the guys

[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:48.880]
They've never been able to figure out just like Prince and Prince Edward. He's got a problem figuring that out

[02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:57.400]
Wilson have a great day YouTube. I'll see you in the peninsula. Oh, no, not for me five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line

[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:00.100]
Line four was working maybe line seven now. Let's look dangerous

[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:05.000]
Now any of us when I did take a blind for that he was on there, but it never rang. You don't understand that

[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.720]
So they've been so

[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:06.940]
Oh

[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:14.740]
Yeah, the phones are really screwed up bad today really bad to make a difference to make a role in long singing the song in spite of it

[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:19.240]
Okay, Greg Reed bluff Lindsey George Corso the one of these these I don't care

[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:22.140]
I'm pulling right along in spite of you people

[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:26.680]
I'm not gonna sit back waiting for some miracle to happen in here. You cheap bastards. You slacker

[02:26:26.680 --> 02:26:29.780]
You you goofballs you pretenders you want to be

[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:31.980]
Makefully broadcasters

[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:33.720]
We don't get a crap

[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:38.140]
We're just rolling right along if the phone works fine if not I'll op your ass. I don't care

[02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:43.460]
Because I got a little bit old man. I'll tell you I lose a few pounds and all of a sudden I feel human again

[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:48.920]
I've got so much more energy back now that I'm like under 200 on a real scale like about 196 or five or something like that

[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:51.940]
On a real scale much and the friendly scale at home. It's fantastic

[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:59.240]
No, I got two scales at home. I have one. It's like pretty close to being a real scale and one. It's like a nine or ten pounds less

[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:03.220]
And when you get waiting on one at nine or ten pounds less psychologically

[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:10.260]
That's a real life you say oh my god. I'm done 186 185 all right holy crap. Yeah, and even though you're not

[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:12.760]
It keeps you going it keeps you

[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:14.580]
On the street in narrow

[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:20.120]
Or at least in my case the narrow here's Cleveland. Hello. Yes, I'm you. Yes, sir

[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.100]
You were talking about the casino in the agra. No way man. Let me ask his uh

[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:27.440]
I wonder if Joe's ever been in Cleveland. Have you been in Cleveland? No, he's never been there good move anyway

[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:30.040]
Go ahead sir. Yeah, he was talking about the casino in the agra

[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:33.100]
I like it because they have a non-smoking floor on the

[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:33.860]
the

[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:37.360]
Effectly floor the first floor and

[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:42.820]
The only thing I don't like about the casino there is you know when you change one of they take a percentage

[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:48.120]
And but yesterday I went to motor city up in decoy right and

[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:53.060]
It's places packed. I like it very much reminds me of the collage in Atlantic City now

[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:58.920]
Now where is the casino in Detroit? It's down here. No, the tiger stadium is sure this crumble as you can have it on about

[02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:07.140]
Naitable mile and then you'll see the parking garage. He make a light and I go right in and went to South Park and

[02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:10.280]
Went into the casino now are you from where you from? Oh Cleveland

[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:12.240]
I mean in Detroit. I would drive

[02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:18.000]
You're a year's pass when it used to be a great Polynesian restaurant called the Chintiki downtown on the corner

[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.320]
I'm right by bass and about bagelian castrates in Detroit. I don't know

[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:24.160]
Because usually I went out to the suburbs

[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:28.960]
But yeah, who'd how would want to go downtown? But this was a really great place

[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:32.800]
There was the Chintiki and then there was the London chop house all long going to Pinkers

[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:36.720]
Grand River you can't go back. They're all gone telegram. I think the chop house was the

[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.800]
The big one there that was the big one even that was so expensive

[02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:42.180]
They used to charge you even for the butter in there, you know

[02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:45.520]
Everything was like ala carte seriously. It was very expensive and not that good either

[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:51.300]
But this casino's temporary and it's I think it's nicer than the NGM really nice here than the NGM

[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:54.520]
It is you're getting a little carried away now

[02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:56.380]
nicer than the NGM

[02:28:56.860 --> 02:28:57.920]
NGM in Detroit

[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.660]
This is an MGM. Oh, I see I thought you meant the MGM in Vegas. You have the Vegas of course

[02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:08.640]
My brother was in Detroit. He says the MGM in Detroit is making more net income

[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:13.880]
Have you been to the MGM in Vegas? Oh, yeah, yeah, I don't like it. It's too big

[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:19.800]
But you don't like the MGM casino in Las Vegas? I stayed at Caesars, but

[02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:24.880]
I mean Caesars is okay for the shops and the restaurants the Buckinale and all those nice shops

[02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:31.500]
But you want to stay at Caesars? Why would you do a thing like that? Why I was pumped. Oh, I okay good move. Okay. Let's have a great day

[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:33.340]

[02:29:54.060 --> 02:29:55.160]

And he has no tickets that really just I'm astonished you better get a call before two o'clock from somebody in the Panther organization

[02:32:15.580 --> 02:32:20.840]
That sets you up and it would you need a firm offer two tickets for the Panther because they're gonna be plenty of seats for the available right

[02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:22.620]
Uh-huh, you bet like always unfortunately

These people wouldn't know any shack from root shack

[02:33:58.060 --> 02:33:59.580]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:02.060]
Yes, hello, Neil. Yes, sir

[02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:05.820]
Oh, blue wall back when I was in West Harlem and my in and now

[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:10.760]
Uh, you were talking about the operations. Yes. I know. I know the little speaking which down here either well

[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:14.600]
But anyway, uh, you were talking about the priest and the in celibate

[02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:21.000]
And they shouldn't be having sex with celibate doesn't mean that it doesn't mean the only thing celibate means is that you're unmarried

[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.660]
Yeah, and chases what that means is what the altar boys are

[02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:27.660]
Yeah, well, it's that news. It is

[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:32.560]
cases when you reform from sex but celibate means one thing. Yeah, unmarried unwitting

[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:36.420]
And I guess that's why the priest can justify having sex. Yeah

[02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:40.380]
Maybe that's why the Catholic churches again gave marriages, I guess huh?

[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:43.340]
All right, you got it. There you go. Okay. Thanks for the good news. Yeah

[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:50.400]
So what what you know, what was this guy really trying to say there's no fact in the church 5 6 7 0 5 60

[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:55.340]
We got some open lines that here that might actually work how about line 4 and how many that how we actually took one call in this line

[02:34:55.340 --> 02:34:56.500]
Make a big improvement here

[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:02.040]
I think that was just an act or anything because it's not sounding too promising to me right now

[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:19.740]
Thank you. I kind of like that. Is there any other show in America that's got those sounds? Oh, no

[02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:23.100]
I mean, we got some other interesting sounds like

[02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:24.320]
Yeah, and like

[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:26.820]
But these are new and exciting

[02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:29.280]

Man, now please don't tell me that see and they say well, you know, it's a bell-soft problem

[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:57.900]
If it's me and I'm any kind of a business person that's got a conscience and really cares about doing business as opposed to just

[02:35:57.900 --> 02:36:00.740]
Raping the customers under the clients if I care about it

[02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:03.040]
I get bell south and here and I threaten to sue their ass

[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:05.420]
I go on the year and I rip them and ask I run a campaign

[02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:09.640]

[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:18.380]
Mixing from southern bell and we raise some health with southern bell, but do we care?

[02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:22.680]
Do we care no we just pay and not even goodlips service weaklips service

[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:25.400]
That's right. We don't give a flying freshman

[02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:30.720]

[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:35.860]
Here's a mobile in Pemberck Pine. Hello. Yes, sir

[02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:38.300]
I did anyone share with you the

[02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:42.600]
FTC in the firming $35,000 fine. Yes, as you didn't

[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.160]
Beep out the Brian's side and we did it when we did bleep it out

[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:50.740]
It's the same now as it was back in the past and so they're gonna appeal it and it'll go on for another six months and who cares?

[02:36:51.180 --> 02:36:53.100]
Well, the the order says it's because

[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:59.300]
Because they've developed a body. How are you that has the FCC order on this which I only saw about two seconds

[02:36:59.300 --> 02:37:06.620]
When Greg read was in your going little like that. Oh, they posted it on the website. Oh, okay. I'll a couple of days ago. Yeah, I have a little slow

[02:37:06.620 --> 02:37:17.360]
Uh, basically what they said was because they've developed a body of law now since they uh, you know had many more opportunities to review and decent material

[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:22.700]
Oh, yeah, because it wasn't in decent back then it was only because they didn't have enough experience in dealing with what was in decent

[02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:28.780]
Well, they just learned what's in decent now. They just learned this is what it is. The word police up there. Exactly

[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:33.180]
Well, I have a suggestion for them. Okay, so yeah, that's for the FCC

[02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:34.900]
Just want to make sure you're seeing you

[02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:38.780]
I haven't seen it, but I heard about it and you know, ask me if I care all right

[02:37:38.780 --> 02:37:40.640]
No, have a great day. Thanks. Thanks for the goodness

[02:37:41.340 --> 02:37:45.860]
Yeah, let them pay it. Okay, just like Greg reads says we'll never pay it. We never pay any of our bills anyway

[02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:48.160]
So I let him try to get it from us. Are they gonna collect it? No

[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:53.760]
Now, no, it's the truth. I told him that I said you got a lot of experience not paying bills

[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:56.680]
So it ought to be like rolling off a log no problem at all and he said yep

[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:21.160]
Speaking of that. I don't want to say that the crowd up there in Pompato is old

[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:24.300]
I'm in the track last night my friend Derek says he gets parked in a parking lot

Just like all the millions are wasting it to my international airport that the hero keeps writing about and nobody is doing anything about just like that crap

[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.880]
You can have the school board down the ivory tower down pound and four-loader

How about that Ray Lewis? He's doing it

[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:48.380]
Of course, he's only accused you don't understand that don't you?

[02:47:48.580 --> 02:47:52.900]
Just like Cecil he was only accused. He just wanted to dip his wick. He wanted to dip his wick

He's the candleman you heard of the candy man. This is a candleman

[02:47:57.900 --> 02:47:59.780]
He wanted to light his fuse, baby

[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:03.780]
He was just in there to take a look. He just want to look around like oh, yeah

There's a leg over there and a breast over there and a rectum over there. Yeah, I just want to take a little look look

Money air and defend something so it's so idiotic

[02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:23.700]

Of course, I guess that's what Jimmy did to this town for all those four years didn't they pretty much like that? Uh-huh

[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:39.420]
Had it stuck way way up in there

[02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:41.120]

Equal opportunity needs to be dead right no more affirmative action, baby

[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:53.860]
We want some action now and hiring some qualified people who can give us good service good quality of life and help with all these other dumbos

[02:49:53.860 --> 02:49:58.020]
Can't do the can't do the job go back to a McDonald's in the order of burden. Absolutely

[02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:03.240]
I don't care if I speak with an accent if I cannot whatever this and the other

[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:06.380]
Doesn't matter if you can make yourself clear

[02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:12.120]
By the way, I need to make a complaint. Yeah, in Kendall. There is a public

[02:50:12.820 --> 02:50:17.560]
There's no wife and I just have been going there forever like six years

[02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:24.760]
And ever since they got these niggers there are the cash register ever since they got the niggers at the cash register

[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:26.740]
Yeah, it's a problem. Yeah

[02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:27.980]

[02:50:29.460 --> 02:50:35.220]
You like torch monkeys a lot because the back boy is gonna be a nigger of course. Yeah, that's terrible

Okay, I'll take your take your business have a great day pal. Get out of here. Oh, did he say nigger running out that was bad

[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:04.860]
I mean like I said before this John rocker business. It's just like it's just exactly like built Clinton with the blowjob

[02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:06.340]
It's the same exact thing

[02:51:06.860 --> 02:51:10.960]
hypocrites we got 50 50 trillion hypocrites out there in this country and I'm tired of it

[02:51:12.360 --> 02:51:17.740]
You show me one red blooded heterosexual male that don't want to get a blowjob and I'll show you something that's dead

[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:24.840]
Oh, but the president can't be getting blowjob's always on him. Well, what's wrong with taking care of uh, you know all that business at one time

[02:51:24.840 --> 02:51:31.100]
What's wrong with that burning both the candle at both ends or something like and now what the Cecil said you wanted to like the candle at both ends

[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:34.700]
Yeah, he had a wick on each end uh-huh

[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:37.800]
dumb spook

[02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:45.680]
I know seriously. I mean how dumb can you be just like this Ray Lewis? He just signed a deal

[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:49.560]
He just signed a deal for millions and millions and millions of dollars here

[02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:54.520]
Which most of you people most all of us will never make it in the lifetime with his damn uh idiot did

[02:51:55.680 --> 02:52:02.600]
And uh, well, uh, he's busy uh, maybe killing people maybe not but hanging out with scumbags and maybe beating up that broad in the bar

[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:08.060]
Oh, but we're supposed maybe he needs sensitivity training

[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:10.620]
anger management cord

Hey, by the way, anybody's seen pretty cannon lately. Oh, I bet you he looks real good now

[02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:32.200]
Nothing he had even back then he didn't look good. No

[02:53:33.540 --> 02:53:35.660]
Who that was it was Frankie Avalon you know

[02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:40.060]
He's got his eyes where his left ear used to be and I it's really sad when he bring back these aging

[02:53:40.780 --> 02:53:46.460]
People from the 50s and the early 60s and they're like 172 years old and their body parts are all moved around and his

[02:53:47.100 --> 02:53:50.600]
Rectome is where his liver used to be not a lot of pretty sight. Don't want to see that

[02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:57.920]
5 6 7 0 5 60 we got some open lines on here, then I can't imagine why I would think this audience would be bubbling over

[02:53:57.920 --> 02:54:01.700]
You have lines that don't work to get these lines filled up. We have been smoking here today, man

[02:54:01.700 --> 02:54:03.280]

[02:54:21.020 --> 02:54:25.100]
Oh Kenny he's an asshole. Yeah, huh? I said he's a hell of a guy that Kenny

[02:54:25.100 --> 02:54:29.580]
He knows you too from the racetrack, but anyway, that's the thought. How do you like that?

[02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:33.100]
Bob Mildfitch isn't that great headed number because he said Schmidt

[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:38.460]
You don't have to listen to anything are you something are you some kind of a pussy is that what you are?

[02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:39.000]

You reach over and flip that dial and turn on Martha Stewart or whatever crap you are or you make him sit there

Watch Oprah and watch his eyes glaze over, okay? I

[02:54:48.740 --> 02:54:50.480]
Have to say to me and listen to your Schmidt

[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:57.520]
See that that's the kind of gratitude you get in this time for coming on and doing an ass kick and show and being really

[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:02.560]
entertaining and amusing and hysterical and outspoken and full of it like I always am right I

[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:06.720]
Have to listen to your Schmidt another bitch another miserable bitch like I said

[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:12.740]
I'm so sorry for all you heterosexual males in its time because they they pull of available women

[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:19.280]
The pool of available available heterosexual women who anybody would want to even touch is so small

[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:21.740]
So miniscule I

[02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:27.900]
Mean throughout the size of Christina Aguilaras boobs. That's how small of it. That's small teeny tiny

[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:34.840]
All these star-pussed women out there. Ah yourself. Something is how disgusting. Don't you ever say anything nice?

[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:37.660]
You have a set of humor bitch. No, no, of course not

[02:55:39.020 --> 02:55:45.340]
And by the way I talked to Kenny at the track and he said you're nothing but a pain in the ass. You're real slut. That's what he told me bitch

[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:53.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line the other town line is 877 7 8 5

[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:58.380]
6 3 4 5 and he said by the way don't come back until you get rid of those crabs

[02:56:00.260 --> 02:56:04.620]
Here's North Miami. Hello, hey, Neil. Yes, sir. You were asking earlier if anybody

[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:09.280]
Been to casino, Niagara. Yeah, I'm down here from Toronto to frost. All right. Go leave school

[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:14.200]
Maybe we're kicking some serious ass tonight at Tampa Bay final score leaf 7 Tampa Bay 1

[02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:15.580]
That's right

[02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:20.940]
Hey, was your ass gonna bet the casino how are we gonna get Serge a beer isn't wake up come on Serge

[02:56:20.940 --> 02:56:26.180]

[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:32.260]
The three casinos up there casino nagro casino Windsor casino Ramma. They want three

[02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:39.060]
If you want something that's like really polatial real-class looking then it's probably casino Windsor. Okay, okay

[02:56:39.060 --> 02:56:42.500]
I want to go to Windsor. Oh boy. Oh, you know, yeah, but

[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:49.380]
Second place would probably be casino Niagara from the aesthetics point of view, but in terms of payoffs

[02:56:49.380 --> 02:56:55.640]
They seem to be a lot less frugal like casino ramma or the Toronto less frugal. Yeah, and the payoffs

[02:56:55.640 --> 02:56:57.940]
We know those Canadians are real frugal don't we?

[02:56:57.940 --> 02:57:01.880]
French can hey, hey, that's the French kidding. No, and I'm not just the French Canadians believe me

[02:57:01.880 --> 02:57:05.820]
I mean they're the more frugal those frogs, but don't we know the rest of you connects can be a little on the frugal side

[02:57:05.820 --> 02:57:10.280]
And of course what do you expect when your dollars worth 69 cent you know? Oh, if that I had to pay a buck 55

[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:13.120]
Connuck forever for every Yankee bugger brought down right?

[02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:17.820]
God almighty you were asking about the pot too where you were talking about pot there and

[02:57:18.860 --> 02:57:21.360]
Jamaican forget it. It's a BC super pot

[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:24.280]
Yeah, yeah, that's what they said

[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:30.640]
What was the blind kids name I keep forgetting his name is famous for about 30 seconds or the yeah the surfboarder

[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:32.480]
Yeah, not the surfboarder the the

[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:35.340]
Chin border whatever the hell he was

[02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:40.880]
Nobody knows his name he was famous for about 20 seconds and then because he smoked a little weed isn't that pathetic?

[02:57:40.980 --> 02:57:45.040]
Ross Rigblebooty or so that's that was his name. Yeah, I'm gonna shake your back. Don't do the yeah

[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:51.580]
Yeah, and on the subject of pot since I'm a foreigner and and a visitor could you play a smoke to join at some point?

[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:57.140]
I'll work on it. Okay, I have a great day. Thanks. See you around me. Okay, okay? Okay, nice to talk to you

[02:57:57.960 --> 02:57:59.000]
How's it going? Hey?

[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:03.340]
Love those Canadians baby. That's not the problem. By the way the frogs will be here tomorrow night

[02:58:03.940 --> 02:58:08.400]
See this is what it's all about. I mean, I said it's your earlier just like the John rocker business

[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:11.440]
They're suspending him. He never stole a freight train. He never killed anybody

[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:14.920]
He's a bigoted a lot of mouth asshole. So I'm oh he's got a right to be a jerk

[02:58:15.300 --> 02:58:17.280]
They're not paying him to be a goddamn spokesman

[02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:22.700]
And the same thing with at Patrice Breeze wall for the Canadians. Oh, I hope we boo the hell out of that frog tomorrow

[02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:26.480]
In fact, I'm gonna we're gonna work and did by the way did they call for your tickets yet? No

[02:58:27.660 --> 02:58:29.200]
I'm gonna raise a real stink

[02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:33.380]
I'm gonna tell you when my close best friend Rimmer gets home from the atripticaer line and when he gets home tomorrow

[02:58:33.380 --> 02:58:36.640]
I'm gonna make sure that Joe gets a couple of tickets for tomorrow night's game

[02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:42.380]
They got tickets up the old record sitting around over there and they're playing hard to get you phonies you scumbags

[02:58:43.860 --> 02:58:48.280]
But I'm gonna organize a group and every time number 43 for the Montreal Canadians is out there on the earth

[02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:55.640]
You're an effing frog breeze. Wow. Yeah frog almost rhymes with breeze. Why don't it? Yeah, you effing frog I

[02:58:57.180 --> 02:58:59.460]
Think he's kin to effing Zimbola's junior fax me

[02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:05.280]
Frog oh, yeah, he's crying about somebody called him a name then it's then like five minutes later

[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:09.640]
Some guy'll come out and spear a guy in the head keep conflian out 20 gallons of blood

[02:59:10.440 --> 02:59:15.680]
You know that kid got hit in the and the larynx with a puck the other day for Canadians and they thought it was gonna croak

[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:18.300]
That all that stuff is okay, but don't call me a frog

[02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:23.740]
God what a pile of crap what a big smelly oozing pile of

[02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:27.740]
God isn't that pathetic

[02:59:30.980 --> 02:59:36.320]
Yeah, I don't know what it is, but I listen to myself and I make so much sense you know everything I say makes sense to me

[02:59:37.880 --> 02:59:38.440]
I

[02:59:38.440 --> 02:59:44.080]
Listen other people talking at big but that is the lot of power crap the lie talking makes so much sense to me

[02:59:45.020 --> 02:59:50.920]
11 before two at five and sixty QA. Well, why the hell not? What's wrong with that?

[02:59:51.740 --> 02:59:54.800]
Only one South Florida radio station has

[02:59:57.960 --> 03:00:02.600]
Weak day after news at two sports radio five sixty Q a M

[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:04.420]
specialized pot in

[03:00:04.420 --> 03:00:19.660]
What did

[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:29.160]
Move

[03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:36.140]
Follow them red blue flashes lights, we're face looks somebody died

[03:00:36.140 --> 03:00:39.860]
And it's 4.6.7.1, we're watching 4.

[03:00:40.320 --> 03:00:44.420]
Don't tell us we don't give a damn, stop 4.6.7.10.

[03:00:44.680 --> 03:00:48.620]
Watch this nerve thing, something else going on

[03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:53.320]
Well, PT, part of us have been right and that would armor always wrong

[03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:58.120]
Come on, I went this action news, we know what you're trying to do

[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:02.240]
Don't make a laugh, they're all members of your staff

[03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:05.960]
In the town that's pouring a hell, why not make the news yourself

[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:09.920]
In it's 4.6.7, what are we watching for?

[03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:14.320]
Don't tell us we don't give a damn, stop 4.6.7.10

[03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:18.120]
Watch this nerve thing, something else going on

[03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:23.180]
Well, PT, part of us have been right and that would armor always wrong

[03:01:23.180 --> 03:01:24.440]
All right

[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:28.900]
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it

[03:01:28.900 --> 03:01:30.460]
These figures are like fish

[03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:34.140]
Okay, 154 at 5.60 QM

[03:01:34.140 --> 03:01:37.480]
So how come nobody brought up about this judge John Luzzle and Broward

[03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:40.500]
Took three tickets for the Marlins though

[03:01:40.500 --> 03:01:43.840]
I mean if you're going to take a little something on the side, Marlin tickets?

[03:01:44.060 --> 03:01:45.520]
I must be crazy, I must be nice

[03:01:45.520 --> 03:01:47.180]
Exactly, I could have said a bit of myself

[03:01:47.180 --> 03:01:48.620]
Anybody want a Marlin ticket?

[03:01:48.720 --> 03:01:48.860]
No

[03:01:48.860 --> 03:01:52.200]
No, we just want to pair a hockey ticket for Joe Costello with his lovely fiance

[03:01:52.200 --> 03:01:55.280]
Whatever she is this week to firm our night's game

[03:01:56.240 --> 03:01:57.520]
What's book of Ryallife and about?

[03:01:57.580 --> 03:01:58.640]
Oh, he saw what was going on here?

[03:01:58.740 --> 03:01:59.120]
Oh, okay

[03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:00.420]
When she was out of the room

[03:02:02.220 --> 03:02:04.860]
Anyway, yeah, I just can't believe how hard this is

[03:02:05.580 --> 03:02:08.440]
Now I'm beginning to understand those people who want to buy the damn tickets

[03:02:08.440 --> 03:02:11.760]
And can't get a hold of anybody over there and nobody returns the calls, nobody answers the phone

[03:02:12.100 --> 03:02:13.980]
We're trying at least to make it look a little better

[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:16.360]
Put a couple of more young asses in the seat there tomorrow night

[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:17.140]
So we get a respond

[03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:17.500]
No

[03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:17.700]
No

[03:02:18.940 --> 03:02:23.740]
As usual, I have to depend on the frugal rim man to come through on this again tomorrow when he gets back

[03:02:23.740 --> 03:02:24.560]
He'll take care of it

[03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:27.900]
You'll be there or I'm going to be really pissed

[03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:30.500]
I'm going to tell a real story about that DUI

[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:33.640]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood, hello

[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:34.680]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:35.300]
Pretty good, sir

[03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:36.640]
Let's go on

[03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:38.640]
Hello

[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:39.680]
Yeah, I'm listening, sir

[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:41.500]
Oh, okay, it's my big two-point one

[03:02:41.500 --> 03:02:43.540]
Come on, generally doesn't do it for me, but anyway

[03:02:43.540 --> 03:02:45.480]
On the worst team this morning?

[03:02:45.540 --> 03:02:45.900]
Yes

[03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:49.320]
Some shots actually called up and made a very pointy point

[03:02:49.320 --> 03:02:52.460]
He said that he likes John Hawker because he knows he's a racist

[03:02:52.460 --> 03:02:53.900]
He comes right out and says that's the best point

[03:02:53.900 --> 03:02:58.980]
That's right, he don't beat around a bush, he don't like bags, he don't like Jews, he don't like Coons, he don't like anybody

[03:02:58.980 --> 03:03:00.100]
And he came right out

[03:03:00.100 --> 03:03:02.540]
And it took crazy about Southern Rednecks like himself either

[03:03:02.540 --> 03:03:08.560]
And the other thing that you mentioned, the only thing about a casino or winters, you can piss there from Detroit, I think

[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:08.920]
Yeah

[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:11.560]
And not a good place to be pissin' from

[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:13.140]
Okay, have a good day

[03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:16.240]
What the guy said, but he was pissed off and fired up something like that

[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:19.580]
56670560, 0.560 on the AT

[03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:24.100]
Don't be saying that too much here because that's another model of his words that the FCC frowns on

[03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:26.560]
And we'll be getting another guy named Letterman Amal

[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:32.420]
Or somebody said the P word on here, I mean we're talking 2000, it's February 1, 2000

[03:03:32.420 --> 03:03:34.000]
And we still got the word police

[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.580]
And we got people out there who believe that this is a country of freedom

[03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:38.580]
Are you people out of your minds or what?

[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:39.460]
Freedom

[03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:41.220]
Free speech, my fat ass

[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:44.620]
Got a bunch of dottering old right wing assholes sitting up there

[03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:47.320]
We got the humor police, the word police

[03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:53.080]
People out kids are blowing each other's brains out all over the country into times of crap

[03:03:53.700 --> 03:03:56.420]
And we're more worried about did somebody say crap on the radio

[03:03:56.420 --> 03:03:59.740]
Now that's interesting, Lioney, what is that all about? I never punched it up

[03:03:59.740 --> 03:04:01.300]
Here's Miami, hello

[03:04:01.300 --> 03:04:02.040]
Thank you

[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:02.520]
Yes sir

[03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:04.180]
Hey, Leo, just a couple points

[03:04:04.180 --> 03:04:05.880]
I'm on automatic pilot now, yes

[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:08.600]
All right, the first on the Joe Rocket thing

[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:13.340]
I'm an immigrant and you know what? If the guy says what he says, let it be, you can't like

[03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:13.920]
Let it be

[03:04:13.920 --> 03:04:15.860]
Just like the Beatles said let it be

[03:04:15.860 --> 03:04:19.640]
Exactly, you know what I think I'm gonna point, why don't they play a show of Reggie White?

[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:21.280]
It's typical, it's typical

[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:24.760]
It's a point where they say foul mouth dumbo, a hate, a mongering Reggie White

[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:28.540]
Exactly, it's just whatever, he's trying to cover his ass but with the political world

[03:04:28.540 --> 03:04:31.140]
Whatever they tell him, he wants it because it's not so thick

[03:04:31.140 --> 03:04:34.760]
And I'm gonna tell you something, since Reggie White started opening up his dumb big stupid mouth

[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:36.640]
I'm not buying any more uptronky soup either

[03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:38.060]
All right

[03:04:38.060 --> 03:04:39.820]
And one more thing on you

[03:04:40.600 --> 03:04:42.820]
About all the athletes and the scumbags they are

[03:04:42.820 --> 03:04:45.180]
Yes, I don't know if you know, if somebody mentioned this thing

[03:04:45.180 --> 03:04:48.860]
I kid that was being recruited at the University of Florida went up there

[03:04:48.860 --> 03:04:52.540]
They mentioned it on the worst team this morning in Joe Rose Preset he didn't believe it

[03:04:52.540 --> 03:04:57.980]
He went up there and tried, he broke into some six apartment and got his hands out of the sheets and was fondling which of course is usually

[03:04:57.980 --> 03:05:01.560]
Yeah, he pulled the seat, listen to this, he pulls the seat of the column

[03:05:01.560 --> 03:05:01.960]
Right

[03:05:02.900 --> 03:05:05.320]
The University of Florida takes away their scar shit

[03:05:05.320 --> 03:05:07.340]
The University of Georgia takes away the scar shit

[03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:10.820]
Yeah, but guess what, Tennessee is there saying come on boy, we're waiting for you

[03:05:10.820 --> 03:05:14.020]
All right, you know a bunch of asses right here

[03:05:14.020 --> 03:05:16.440]
Exactly, have a great day pal

[03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:20.240]
How many chances did they get the athletes, the dumb jocks, huh?

[03:05:21.320 --> 03:05:24.900]
I guarantee a gym manager who's on next between two and six is he gonna be covering up for this crap?

[03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:28.040]
No, no, no, as a matter of fact he's gonna be bringing naked pictures of Ray Lewis on there

[03:05:28.040 --> 03:05:29.380]
To bet it's on radio

[03:05:30.700 --> 03:05:32.040]
Yeah, he said he ought to be hung

[03:05:32.760 --> 03:05:35.320]
And when you look at the picture you realize he ain't

[03:05:36.540 --> 03:05:38.220]
Here's the lottery hill, hello

[03:05:38.220 --> 03:05:40.040]
Hey Neil, I'm sure you're pretty good

[03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:41.700]
That's good, listen I gotta say

[03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:45.080]
I'm right to my opinion just like John Rocker's right to his opinion right

[03:05:45.080 --> 03:05:48.400]
Right, okay well John Rocker's the major A-hole when he's full of schmit

[03:05:48.400 --> 03:05:48.820]
Yeah

[03:05:48.820 --> 03:05:51.560]
And he's welcome to think what he wants to think about other people

[03:05:51.560 --> 03:05:54.980]
That's right, he wants to be an asshole, is there a log that's being an asshole that I missed on a book?

[03:05:55.100 --> 03:05:56.620]
No, no, you've got to write to be an asshole

[03:05:56.620 --> 03:05:57.620]
You've got that right now

[03:05:57.620 --> 03:06:00.460]
I remember that thing as dumb as you want to be, that you could Campbell song

[03:06:00.920 --> 03:06:04.220]
You got it, no thing I want to say to you buddy, because I know your show's almost over

[03:06:04.220 --> 03:06:05.220]
It's almost over, man

[03:06:05.220 --> 03:06:06.500]
Go Panthers

[03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:06.980]
Alright

[03:06:06.980 --> 03:06:08.100]
See you tomorrow

[03:06:08.100 --> 03:06:09.960]
Now we get the call yet for my canton
