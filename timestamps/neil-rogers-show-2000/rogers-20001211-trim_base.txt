His guests are followers

[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.100]
Does not reflect those of the beastly broadcasts

[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.160]
It's staff, advertisers, or agency

[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.940]
Now the Neil Roger Show on 560-AAA

[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.520]
After 12 days of counting, this is what we have

[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.620]
12,000 pistolful hearts, 11 butterfly ballads

[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.540]
Distant franchise voters, nine guys counting each vote

[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.240]
Captain Harris's makeup, seven pending lawsuits

[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.240]
Six freaking recounts, 25 electoral polls

[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.440]
Four simple chats, three disputes in counties

[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.360]
Two guys want to win, but only one can be trashed

[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.360]
That's trashed

[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.200]
Silence, heart, deadly heart

[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.240]
He can't tell your nose apart

[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.240]
You can't hear me, but he can tell

[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.260]
The stomachs are lifted by that awful sound

[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.520]
What the hell did you believe?

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.840]
It knows just right what he did

[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.700]
Silence, heart, deadly heart

[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.200]
I just wanted to take heart

[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.540]
I watched a woman's sex swim along

[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.060]
She was very considerable from

[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.580]
I walked right out of that play

[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.600]
It's a face I love my day

[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.980]
Silence, heart, deadly heart

[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.520]
You can't explain it

[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.120]
Silence, heart, deadly heart

[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.960]
You can't tell your nose apart

[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.260]
I just wanted to take heart

[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.320]
I just wanted to take heart

[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.580]
If you're in church when you do

[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.280]
You have to stay in your church

[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.220]
Silence, heart, deadly heart

[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.100]
You have to stay in your church when you do

[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.020]
I want to know who cuts the genius

[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.220]
Well, here we are again

[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.820]
Boys and girls, pick it up where we left off

[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.200]
I'm getting that, I don't know about you

[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.540]
I'm getting nauseous from this

[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.780]
I can't stand it anymore, I can't deal with it

[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.560]
Get it over with already

[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.860]
Ah!

[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.800]
Yeah, good, got on buddy

[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.520]
Left here at 2.15, he said he would hang till about 2.15 to 2.00 on Friday

[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.780]
Look like it was all over with

[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.060]
And then all of a sudden Saturday morning

[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.100]
All on guess what?

[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.620]
There are going to be recounting the votes

[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.700]
Yeah, 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon

[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.200]
Just an hour and a half after we thought it was all over with

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.520]
Oh yeah, let's just have a countenagant

[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.560]
And they're all screwing around

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.440]
And they're sitting around

[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.720]
They're holding the stuff up in the air

[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.860]
And they're looking with chads

[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.120]
And they're looking at holes and all this other bull cramp

[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.080]
And then Saturday like what the hell fam is it around?

[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.840]
Noontime 1245 something like that

[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.760]
Well the US Supreme Court says they're not too happy with this

[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.200]
Because it's getting a little bit too tight

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.340]
And now let's cut the crap

[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.300]
Cut counting the votes and cut the crap

[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.200]
And so we have more oral arguments

[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.880]
And more anal arguments

[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.500]
At 11 o'clock this morning in front of the US Supreme Court

[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.820]
The US Supreme Court, 2 S's in the air course

[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.340]
Here's a big thing

[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.800]
And are we going to be carrying that?

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.460]
No, they're going to have the recordings

[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.280]
We're going to get a 1230

[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.400]
I'm going to pass this time

[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.460]
I'm not no way

[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.640]
If you want to hear it go someplace else

[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.500]
That's my best advice to you

[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.440]
No chance

[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.580]
If you want to hear more anal arguments good luck to you

[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.460]
I'm not going to waste now and a half of this

[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.020]
Very, very important show

[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.200]
Especially on a Monday putting that crap on here

[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.940]
Even though it would be a good way to get out

[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.480]
Yeah, probably could leave here at 1230

[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.440]
Big piece in yesterday's sunset

[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.760]
And all floaters flawed election process

[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.620]
Yeah, cracks result in breakdown

[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.140]
Floaters antiquated decentralized election process

[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.000]
Needs an overhaul

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.980]
Well no shmit

[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.920]
Huh?

[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.140]
What a bulletin

[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.000]
This is a way to have a goddamn election

[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.820]
Put it out

[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.340]
See this is what happens with the media

[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.760]
I've been talking to this for a long time

[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.460]
They brainwashed the public into believing

[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.860]
That actually we're going to have a real outcome

[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.420]
Well regardless of what happens

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.640]
I say what's wrong with having a ceremonial present

[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.760]
For the next four years

[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.460]
I mean that's all he's going to be

[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.760]
Ceremony or president bush

[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.000]
Figurehead

[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.040]
Phase of the matter

[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.800]
What is this ribbon cutter

[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.680]
Oh speaking of that

[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.000]
George had a great appearance on Saturday

[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.320]
The bill side was done there in Miami again

[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.900]
Down in the

[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.060]
Whatever was no speaking in Glacetown

[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.700]
And the help done there

[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.120]
It's got up good thinking they're getting more creative each time

[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.720]
Next time it'll be a lot better

[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.420]
I have to tell many people they have show up there

[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.120]
He said be I

[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.700]
That's exactly about nine

[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.960]
But the help instead of just taking one sandwich

[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.840]
And thanks again to our good close friends from

[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.320]
Whatever it is Atlantic City, Subz and Hollywood

[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.600]
Instead of just coming to take in one sandwich at a time

[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.360]
Which you don't want to like put it all up in your arms

[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.820]
It's kind of advice that way

[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.840]
Yeah that's right I have to keep them back over and over again

[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.840]
But this time when you steal one of the QAM frisbees

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.420]
And then you can you turn it over and use it as a like a tray

[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.600]
And you can put a whole bunch of sandwiches in there

[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.620]
And they don't have to keep coming back and be embarrassed

[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.180]
You know associating with us

[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.460]
Or there's no embarrassment fact for that

[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.340]
I'm sure of that

[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.920]
One of the people asked what station we were from

[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.420]
As they were holding one of the frisbees

[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.200]
Loading it up with sandwich

[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.600]
Right

[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.320]
No it doesn't you know the call letters

[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.020]
They don't care about

[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.120]
Don't confuse them in the fact

[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.920]
I've had the deal like that

[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.880]
I know what are you guys doing here

[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.700]
What are you doing

[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.400]
All in fact member rich I don't want to say where

[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.180]
No I know

[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.900]
I remember

[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.420]
Yeah

[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.720]
What are you guys doing here

[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.620]
What are you doing

[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.380]
So this is all about spin reveal

[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.300]
Spin reveal

[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.440]
Come on spin reveal

[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.800]
What do I get?

[00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.560]
Spin reveal

[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.400]
Wow

[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.580]
Well we had over 1,200 people participating in our democratic

[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.580]
A crappic survey over the weekend

[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.180]
It was just all we got to go to that

[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.540]
And what

[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.780]
I was going to vote over the weekend

[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.340]
I got

[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.920]
Because uh

[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.080]
If you don't think I can vote on

[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.860]
All right see

[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.740]
Oh that's true

[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.640]
Well there's senator snatch from Utah

[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.900]
He said

[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.540]
The phone about

[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.500]
Yeah get out of here

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.280]
Blow it out your ass

[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.740]
You will fascist piece of crap

[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.800]
So anyway I'm not going to go through the results here

[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.160]
But the suffice to say

[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.360]
2554

[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.240]
Still gigantic

[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.620]
Still big

[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.760]
We'll still be getting that bonus

[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.180]
Uh huh

[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.220]
It's part of the crappie numbers

[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.280]
18 to 24

[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.660]
We had quite a battle going on between

[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.340]
The Spanic males 18 to 24

[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.300]
And non-Hispanic males 18 to 24

[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.240]
75 Julios and 79 Julios

[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.800]
Of 18 to 24

[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.300]
I'm not so sure I believe some of those numbers in there

[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.940]
But that's okay

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.880]
It's just for fun anyway

[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.840]
It has a much more important poll for today

[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.920]
And I changed the

[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.780]
C.I.E. Scratched off the one I originally had

[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.680]
I'm getting tired of asking polls about this

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.940]
God damn election already

[00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.720]
I don't know about you

[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.980]
But I'm getting real

[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.640]
Real sick and tired of it

[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.820]
It's like a hobby again

[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.400]
Like a hobby for people with no lives

[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.320]
Like O.J. and A.L.I.

[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.540]
Here's another guy, Dema Hobby

[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.520]
I'm sick of this hobby

[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.380]
Just like I'm sick of going to those stupid hockey games

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.880]
And seeing them lose every game

[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.380]
And then opening up the sports page

[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.420]
Like the heraldous morning

[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.680]
And David J. Schfarts are right in the stupid

[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.160]
Stupid

[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.600]
Stupid

[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.920]
Eddie out of column

[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.200]
Katz Murray feels the fans pain

[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.060]
Oh jesus

[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.080]
jesus Louise

[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.820]
Or is our key bunker when we need him

[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.860]
Oh jesus

[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.440]
Yeah that was one of the favorite things

[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:34.980]
You used to say

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.740]
I don't know where he said that

[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.020]
I'd use Alice

[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.320]
Alice

[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:40.760]
Edith

[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.120]
Well Alice was uh

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.260]
I had jesus with my line

[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.880]
Oh she did too by the way

[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.880]
I love her

[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.300]
See she the good uh the

[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.820]
Audrey Meadows

[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.620]
The good meadow she

[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.560]
Well I want to go through the hole

[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.780]
Custy down and he's still dead

[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.120]
It's just getting really ponderous

[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.280]
And then we can't blame the crowd

[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.680]
We had a good crowd over 15,000 people there on Saturday

[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.640]
With great expectations

[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.380]
And again was a little bit better than they had

[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.460]
But you know what they still lost

[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.600]
And it's getting really old

[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.400]
Just like the election

[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.140]
Getting the order and stale

[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.020]
Just like Patrick Leahy from Vermont

[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.300]
I'm not sure that

[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:10.460]
Yeah

[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.600]
Here's that poor question today

[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.920]
Who are the cheapest people

[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.200]
Jews

[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.360]
French Canadians

[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.680]
Or Cubans

[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.100]
Although the only reason I did this pull

[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.320]
Is because he told me about the Cubans

[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.500]
Yeah

[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.160]
That showed up

[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.480]
With the luxurious car

[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.300]
And all the jewelry hanging from every part of her body

[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.560]
And wanted to discount on the CDs

[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.460]
We're getting into the Jewish down

[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.400]
Oh I mean uh Cubans

[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.220]
We're Cubans now

[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.020]
We're giving you a discount

[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.220]
Get it up for now

[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.380]
Yeah, we'll give you a discount on that on Charmin

[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:37.860]
Bitch

[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.640]
So that's a good pull question

[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.660]
What was that?

[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.480]
Wrong number

[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.280]
Was that a mistake?

[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:42.800]
Yeah

[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.760]
Who was it?

[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.340]
I don't know

[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.780]
Oh that's good

[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.500]
Just people wandering around in the building

[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.400]
Who are the cheapest people

[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.100]
Jews

[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.460]
French Canadians

[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.120]
Or Cubans

[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.220]
That's tough

[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.600]
Yeah, it's up to the front

[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.220]
That's a good pull

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.920]
We do good pull on this show

[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.200]
Other than the demographic one

[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.520]
Which is right

[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.260]
I've got a very interesting

[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:01.860]
Well it's uh

[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.460]
We don't care where there was interesting for you

[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.620]
It's just out of curiosity

[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.200]
We found out we have very few Asians

[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.380]
But we had a whole bunch of Asians out there

[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.220]
The last survey we took

[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.420]
I think those raw phony votes are of the lifestyle

[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.440]
Very very few Asians

[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.240]
The person

[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.300]
10 past 10 at 560 WQM

[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.680]
No question the program maybe we produced

[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.660]
Without the express written permission of WQM

[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.340]
No, no, no

[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.580]
The process has group incorporate

[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.440]
It just keeps getting bigger

[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.540]
From a magic entertainment

[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.460]
Director Ron Howard

[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.200]
Presents an all new holiday classic

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.100]
Dr. Soussis

[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.140]
How the gorge

[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.880]
Stole Christmas

[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.660]
Mr. Gorge

[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.000]
Why are you stalling me a lesson?

[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.980]
Why

[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.340]
There's more ballots that must be counted

[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.420]
Than new lieu

[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.480]
If they're not

[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.240]
I'll just cry

[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.580]
Blue lieu

[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.360]
The sick Democrat lied

[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.660]
He made up a story

[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.780]
If he passed a detotion

[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.840]
Blamed it or I'm got a new watch

[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.660]
The house on the hill of Mount Cuppet is mine

[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.940]
Your seats in the room

[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.820]
My right is

[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.460]
Desire

[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.920]
He patented the head of the gun of a Bruce

[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.180]
And he knew who was known by any tool

[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.480]
He talked to him dead with us to a dead

[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.600]
And before he left

[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.760]
He dimpled to his Chad

[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.380]
You're a mean one

[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.640]
Mr. Gorge

[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.140]
You're guilty

[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.940]
Are you

[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.880]
You're a soulless politician

[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.800]
Who exhibits bloody

[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.560]
They can't Mr. Gorge

[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.760]
The three words that best describe you

[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.040]
Are as follows

[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.260]
And I quote

[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.280]
Big

[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.360]
That's right

[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:47.680]
Baby

[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.160]
15 at 5.60 W.C.M

[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:51.900]
Now this is beautiful

[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.420]
I don't have one call on the board

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.860]
And you're missing your golden opportunity

[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.980]
Because I'm so fed up with all the selection crap

[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.200]
And crap is the operative word

[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.040]
Crap was the word for all four candidates

[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.860]
Like I said

[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.440]
Gore and the Julie Berman

[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.480]
And Clinton and the guy with it was on the verge of death

[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.820]
Do I say Clinton? I mean, Bush

[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.780]
Whatever the hell it is

[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.940]
I just can't deal with it anymore

[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.540]
And here's your great opportunity today

[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.920]
I'm just going to sit here and listen

[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.780]
If you want to say anything about the election

[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.520]
About the courts, I won't say a word

[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.440]
This may never ever happen again

[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.580]
I'm just going to say like

[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.440]
Even no matter how nauseated and disgusted I am

[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.040]
And then when you're done, thank you

[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.620]
Bye bye

[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.260]
That's it

[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.020]
It's all political

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.360]
Don't let anybody fool you

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.340]
You got your floor to Supreme Court

[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.240]
That was all politics

[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.120]
And now you got your US Supreme Court

[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.000]
With a five fascist

[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]
That's all political

[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.180]
And that's what it is

[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.180]
That's what it boils down to

[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.980]
Because we don't know how to have a fair election

[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.740]
That's number one

[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.660]
And because number two

[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.540]
We have crappy candidates on both sides

[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.080]
If I try to, you know

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.020]
Force on me to pick death by

[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.480]
Hanging or death by the electric chair

[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.840]
And that's why I was like the fighter right down the middle

[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.340]
Because it was a brutal choice

[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.760]
It was an unacceptable choice

[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.480]
So we're going to get stuck with the four years

[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.220]
Like I said, of a ceremonial figurehead

[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.580]
So I'm a trouble can that chain you get us into

[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.620]
I mean the bush get us into

[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.900]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.740]
Pound 5 60

[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.860]
Here's the mobile in bulk

[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.260]
Hello

[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.740]
Yeah, you're very kind and calling

[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.040]
Bush a figurehead

[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.000]
I mean I think that's sort of

[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.560]
You know, being kind to you anyway

[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.580]
Yeah, Neil

[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.540]
Yeah, yeah, kind of calling Bush a figurehead

[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.300]
You just said that

[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.940]
How much of a force

[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.300]
Well, I didn't know it came true

[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.420]
Anyway, I, but let's not see a lot lately

[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.520]
I've had the pleasure because I'm on the road lot

[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.360]
And you know, so much of what you're saying

[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.540]
I just like you would look forward to the day

[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.820]
That we can open up whatever news there is

[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.360]
And not have the puke over it, you know

[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.940]
Just because your poll today hit me

[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.960]
That's why I put this call in for the poll

[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.140]
About who the cheapest is

[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.840]
There's a little trivia fact for your people

[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.020]
To think about before they vote

[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.540]
Let them think about the difference

[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.560]
Between a French Canadian and a canoe

[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.060]
A canoe will play

[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.840]
Okay fine, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60

[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.580]
On the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.320]
What if I always told you there's nothing

[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.720]
In the world worse, nothing worse than people

[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.760]
Who think that they're funny

[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.500]
And there are

[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.340]
The only thing worse than that is working in a studio

[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.820]
Where there are bugs flying around

[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.740]
Which I know is little tiny nets

[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.420]
Or maybe it's a trigger

[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.040]
Maybe there's a trigger in the wood pie

[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.400]
Do you think?

[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.600]
Yeah, a little bugs flying around in here now

[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.620]
Maybe they had a party in here over the weekend

[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.780]
Maybe the people from Bill Siles brought those sandwiches and hearingate them

[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.720]
And left it spoiling rotten under the counter

[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.860]
Anyway, that was a great first call for the week

[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.920]
How's the poll coming so far

[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.580]
Who are the cheapest people in the world

[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.300]
French Canadians 8, Jews 5 and Cubans none

[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.140]
So you wanted to put the Cubans on it

[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.660]
Just because George met a cheap Cuban bitch

[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.160]
Anybody that could be one in every group

[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.300]
But at least we want to spread it a lot more

[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.220]
But we put about 10

[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.160]
Anyway, I just want to say this to the French Canadians

[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.720]
Because I noticed the hockey game

[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.280]
That we actually didn't have some laundry room before the game

[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.760]
You can hear about them describing the party who get lost

[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.100]
We hate you like poison

[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.940]
Don't you understand

[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.160]
These are the slowest people on the uptake

[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.400]
First of all, I have no idea what you keep coming back

[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.240]
You're for because your money isn't worth the damn thing

[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.140]
I mean, even the English speaking Canadians

[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:05.980]
They're money ain't worth nothing

[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.260]
But we like them, at least I do

[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.980]
Most of them

[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.060]
But the French Canadians

[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.200]
We hate you like poison

[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.140]
They've been telling that for years

[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.040]
It's not humor

[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.400]
I'm not saying that to be funny

[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.220]
It's not to be sarcastic

[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:16.920]
It's just honest

[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.460]
We can't stand you

[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.300]
You're disgusting

[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.120]
You walk around around Hollywood beach with those speedos

[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.020]
On with your big fat puppets hanging out

[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.260]
Your cheap you don't tip

[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.820]
You're disgusting nauseating

[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.480]
The way you drive is enough to make even the people down here

[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.380]
Puked their guts out

[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.660]
And believe me, that's saying a lot

[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.100]
Because we got the worst drivers in the world

[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.540]
We can't stand you French Canadians

[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.040]
Go home now

[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.400]
Polly who go one way lost

[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400]
Get lost

[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.160]
That's right

[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.120]
North or east

[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.980]
Three of these would be good

[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:45.640]
That's okay

[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.280]
But everything's cheaper over here

[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.020]
Countrymen over there in France

[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.900]
Look at this little buzz

[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.580]
We got nets

[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.720]
We got a chigger in here

[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.400]
Goddamn it

[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.740]
Count 5, 60

[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.440]
On the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.960]
Oh, this could just be

[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.120]
The last day

[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.920]
The last day for all of us

[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.340]
You have no idea how that would please me

[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:11.940]
Here's Miami

[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.300]
Hello

[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.580]
How you doing, New York?

[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:13.860]
Okay

[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.200]
Listen, I want to ask you about the Nellis

[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.040]
What's going on with

[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.800]
They said he was switching over to every public in the world

[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.380]
No, he's not

[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.220]
Well, is he getting a position in what, if Bush wins or what?

[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.820]
Yeah, prone

[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.320]
Pown

[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.440]
Count 5, 60 on the AT

[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.800]
I can see we're not going to have any calls

[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.340]
They were just like Christmas music today

[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.240]
It's the 11th of December

[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.200]
It's officially closed

[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.300]
We'll play Hanukkah Karelz and Christmas music

[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.340]
Because these people I'm sure

[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.220]
I've heard this reported that I want to sit here and continue

[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.580]
Call up Sandy Payton and talk about bilingualism

[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:43.900]
Okay

[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.620]
I am not going to sit here

[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.200]
I keep talking about Dipper Chad

[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.500]
And pimple with all these assholes that are running around with their placards

[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.940]
And screaming and carrying on

[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.280]
Like we have some great choice there

[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.480]
Like one of these candidates is working in all of the stuff about which they're not

[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.400]
It's just not worth it

[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.640]
But because the media continues orchestrating these things

[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.380]
Because there's profit to be milked from it

[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.320]
Naturally, they always got these assholes

[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.060]
I'll look at this

[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.960]
We got your Florida legislature in action

[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.720]
They're singing virtually in New Boralos again

[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.240]
They're beautiful

[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.180]
Here's Dorao

[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:16.440]
Hello

[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.300]
Good morning, Neil Alia

[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.180]
I'm doing okay

[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.120]
Okay, you know, it's just a couple of points on this whole election thing

[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.560]
I'm just concerned that, you know, as far as the rest of the world looking at us

[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.720]
We tend to say that we have the best system and all this

[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.300]
Is the best we can do is

[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.520]
You know, they're looking at us and laughing at us

[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.660]
We're joking

[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.320]
This is getting to a point where

[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.680]
It's really concerned

[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.520]
And this is the big

[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.340]
Well, how come more people aren't saying that

[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.420]
How come more people are furious over the fact that we don't know how to hear the guy damn election

[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.640]
And then we're doing stuff from out of the stone age

[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.140]
I agree

[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.060]
I mean, we both that we have the best system in the world

[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.840]
And then we put a bunch of idiots out there and no one way

[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.900]
We came and hold an election

[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.220]
And this is going to go on for months

[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.180]
It seems like and we're the laughing stock of the world here

[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:56.660]
Yeah

[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.320]
So I don't know, I just, it's really gets cut to me

[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.600]
Oh, thank God I live in the Netherlands

[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.780]
It's all I can say

[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.700]
Okay, I'll go with you

[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.720]
Okay, thank you

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.220]
Let's hear you

[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.960]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3

[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.820]
Pound 5, 6, 3

[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.600]
Oh, you're not going to, well, we ought to take a poll

[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.000]
Maybe I'm doing a wrong thing

[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.620]
Maybe they want to hear those analoregiments

[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.120]
What do you think?

[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:14.320]
No

[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.800]
At 1230, wouldn't they replay it?

[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.460]
No, I'm not going to do it under any,

[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.480]
I don't care if everybody in the audience wants to hear it

[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.320]
I'm not going to do it

[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.340]
Because I know that they don't

[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.140]
It was, you know, it was a novelty the first time

[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.640]
It was the first time we actually had audio

[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.860]
from the USS Supreme Court

[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.180]
And that was interesting

[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.100]
And then I made the mistake

[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.460]
Even put on the float of Supreme Court

[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.560]
Our analoregiments

[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.360]
And the entire audience have vanished at that point

[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.700]
I'm not going to put it on there again

[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.480]
What are they going to say?

[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.080]
It was pretty interesting

[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.960]
Though that David Boyle is replacing the very lackluster

[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.280]
Lawrence Tribe

[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:45.880]
Huh?

[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.060]
Maybe they thought he was a member of the tribe

[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.240]
That might have been a long way to kick an insass out of there

[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.480]
And they're putting in David Boyle's to try to pull this thing off today

[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.940]
To argue in front of the USS Supreme Court

[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.900]
Maybe they figured the SS Supreme Court

[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.860]
Wouldn't be too sympathetic to a member of the tribe

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.080]
Here's a model in Miami, hello

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.520]
There, how's it going, man?

[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.060]
Okay, sir

[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.200]
All right, for all these damn Republicans

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.260]
These people have voted for Republicans

[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.180]
Good

[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.460]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:15.980]

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.080]
Uh-huh

[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.280]
560, 7.0560

[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.120]
Count 560 on the AT&T in Verizon

[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.580]
Wireless line

[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.640]
Welcome to South Florida

[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.140]
And you wonder why this states the place

[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.720]
Why these counties down here

[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.480]
To wonder if it screwed up the election you wonder

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.120]
I don't wonder, I know

[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.360]
These people wouldn't know which side was up

[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.540]
If he gave them a head start

[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.540]
There's a model in VOK, hello

[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.840]
Yeah, I know

[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.420]
Yes, sir

[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.120]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.500]
I have to decide, I want to change this so they

[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.880]
I think once you mentioned you were talking about

[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.660]
Honest racing, you have been

[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.780]
Honest racing stand, you work

[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.260]
Yes

[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.820]
No, I'm not a huge Honest racing stand, I'll tell you what

[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.580]
If you know

[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.900]
Who is the best driver you ever saw

[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.040]
For what kind of a conversation is there

[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.340]
That's like saying, what was the best car you ever drove

[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.540]
What was the best driver you ever saw

[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.020]
Francis over here

[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.740]
Francis over here

[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:07.580]
Yeah, there you go

[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.640]
Hey, we had a nice couple of nights out there

[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.600]
I was there Friday for the big drivers championships

[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.820]
at the Poppano Park

[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.820]
Nice event boys

[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.040]
Excellent

[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.000]
Had good crowds, handle over a million dollars

[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.900]
Both nights I think

[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.640]
Dave Polone, Luke Wollett

[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.060]
Wollockay Jr., Daniel Dubayne

[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.000]
Our own boys held their own

[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.240]
Maybe they were doing it

[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.340]
Kevin and Wally and Daryl

[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.340]
And whom I would even not

[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:28.860]
And Brucey

[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.260]
It was great

[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.860]
I see there again

[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.220]
There's an idea of a discussion about Honest racing

[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.920]
Who was the best driver you ever saw

[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.440]
Francis over here

[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.600]
He was a 70 year old man in Michigan

[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.960]
From flushing Michigan

[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.980]
Does he anybody in this audience know who that is

[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.180]
Oh, but he asked me a question

[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.100]
That's my answer

[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.820]
567-0560 and it's an honest answer

[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.440]
Here's a mobile and poker

[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:51.800]
Hello

[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.300]
Yeah, sir

[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.880]
You just said it perfectly

[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.320]
What other state in the union could cause us to happen except Florida

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.940]
Among attorneys

[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.440]
Florida has been known for years as a deadbeat state

[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:09.260]
This comes back from from from the years when when Florida had the lowest per capita income

[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.660]
When it was a

[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.660]
A state full of sunshine

[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.920]
And lots of people they couldn't find jobs

[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.140]
Just wanted to come out lay on the beach came to Florida

[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.760]
Right losers

[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.180]
As a Republican

[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.180]
It's a loser state

[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.220]
I am ashamed

[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.500]
I am ashamed of what my party is doing

[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.820]
It's so bad

[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.020]
That I've actually switched to becoming a to an independent

[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:30.580]
Okay

[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:31.860]
Yeah

[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.100]
Because it's it's it's pathetic it's to see

[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.760]
These people

[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.380]
Try to sound sanctimonious

[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.560]
When in fact they're trying to steal the election

[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.400]
It's embarrassed

[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.540]
What do you mean what do you mean they're trying to steal the election

[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.780]
What they're stealing it

[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.200]
Yeah

[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.780]
Why

[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:53.980]
You got it

[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.960]
You got it in for both credit for job well done

[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.480]
Why not let the votes be counted

[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.260]
We know lose

[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.660]
Let the votes be counted

[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.940]
That's the only fair way

[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.920]
When you have scorea

[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.280]
Who is a

[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.240]
Fervent general

[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.500]
Let me ask you this question

[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.680]
Okay, in all honesty since since you try to make it sound like there's some rational way

[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.180]
To uh, to conclude this thing

[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.000]
How do you really count the votes when you have 67 different counties

[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.040]
And 67 different standards and all these different people

[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.340]
And the photos of being court

[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.000]
Er continue screwing up

[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.260]
Just like when they said okay

[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.840]
Well, you know, we're going to extend the deadline

[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.840]
And they gave them like over the Thanksgiving holiday

[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.860]
To count all the votes and they knew it couldn't be done

[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.460]
Now they do the same thing again. Okay, start to count again

[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.160]
But there's no standard for what's the vote and what's not a vote

[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.960]
Well, how do you do that

[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.020]
The correct

[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.920]
The correct vote

[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.460]
How did I get sucked into this

[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:40.960]
I'm sorry

[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.720]
I really meant with

[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:43.760]
Hello

[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.240]
Yeah

[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.820]
The correct way of doing it

[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.000]
Would be to set a deadline for Florida to install

[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.240]
Reliable voting machines

[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.140]
And we vote the whole damn state

[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.720]
You're the whole thing over all right now you're talking let's hear it

[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.140]
Yeah

[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.880]
I said the deadline should be in about like so you know, November 5th 2004

[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.520]
Sounds good. Thank you for plenty of time

[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.180]
We can hold the get some pot luck suffers

[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.340]
Raise the money to be able to not cost a lot of money for that new tech movefangled technology

[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.960]
We can raise the money and buy those new computers

[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.820]
There are more

[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.320]
What's about these are fleas or something in here

[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.980]
What is this besides the toilet? Oh, I'm sorry. Can we have an exterminator coming here?

[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.600]
No

[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:24.880]
No

[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.900]
26 I think it's an only I think it's another act of God

[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.460]
Said another plague a plague of fleas

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.540]
Only in the banana republic, baby only in Miami

[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.400]
This holiday season get your gifts at Chick-repe arms

[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:45.180]

And no one can resist the chick-repe arms

[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.800]
Uncle teed in the shape of Monica Lewinsky

[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.580]
Chick-repe arms the place to shop for people you don't really care about

[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.560]
So thinking of that I got good news and bad news for me anyway the good news is we found a whole bunch more that

[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.660]
Carb solution stuff at publics bought it all out

[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.420]
Everyone every last bottle the bad news is

[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.140]
Got through another great and perfect and Friday

[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.080]
Went to the track Friday night I drank two bottles of that stuff or that was my supper

[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:26.680]
Got on the scale on Saturday morning and I had lost by four and a half pounds it all came back supper

[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.660]
What

[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.120]
You said supper supper and what about it? I've heard you say supper before

[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.660]
Then you used to make fun of people that said supper

[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.600]
That's why I said it. Oh, okay

[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.800]
Cheezess Christ what the hell did they do to you in that place on Saturday? Oh, you have no idea man

[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.920]
And then he went and got some stale cigars from some of all those railing and was trying to speak Cuban to him

[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:56.300]
But at any rate not Spanish Kima and they'll look at it another broad just flew up in my face here

[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:02.280]
What I hold these things coming from you look the bottom with you there knowing yeah, I brought them with me right in your pocket. Yeah

[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.460]
Well

[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.020]
Peace out so anyway

[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.360]
Our good up Saturday morning. You didn't hear what I just said the wait all came back

[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.300]
Yeah, I heard it. I had gone through this tremendous week. You saw you were witnessed at least during the show

[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.120]
I ate like maybe two meals during the entire week nothing

[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.040]
Lost four and a half to five pounds got up Saturday morning and it all came back

[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:30.780]
I

[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:37.100]
Realized there's a lot of fat in that stuff, but I mean let's get serious and isn't that can always pedaling this a BS about fat

[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:43.700]
Doesn't make any difference and now all these other low carb that oh fat. There's not words at it's those carbohydrates those killer carbs

[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.800]
And I'm depressed about it

[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.500]
So I guess the only answer is to get back on the treadmill and the bike

[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:57.900]
Get that metabolism going because I have a feeling mom. No, it's seriously my metabolism is so slow

[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.980]
That if I did did just rank water if I just went on a fast for 10 days. I still wouldn't lose anyway

[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:11.700]
I just mentioned that in passing so that our sales department doesn't feel so bad about how inept they are that they didn't the come up with any of that stuff for me

[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.500]
And then Gary sauna comes in here. You're a close personal friend Gary sauna

[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:21.480]
You're far business orthodox due friend Gary sauna who you'll be sucking up at the Christmas party tonight with

[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.500]
Comes in here. What do you know? What do I know that? How do you know? I'll be sucking around with it. You were sucking around with him this morning

[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:34.440]
I'm cordial with no you were cordial you were sucking his Jewish ass okay, and he's just like do Lieberman

[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.420]
He's not just Jewish. He's another one of those

[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.640]
They kosher the house. He's like yeah, he's

[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.560]
He was handing out some anti-Palestinian propaganda after I did that Israeli show. I'm sure of that

[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.540]
At any rate

[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:53.300]
So he comes in here wants me to a petal the rankings food stuff. Am I gonna do that? No, of course not. It's a crazy person

[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.360]
So you don't confuse ourselves the problem with credibility because they have no idea what the word means

[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.300]
And even as far as the cops solution stuff it may not help you lose weight, but it tastes great

[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:10.160]
No, at least it tastes good. Isn't that the part of the school of ice cream isn't that something? No, and you don't need a big school of ice cream the stuff is delicious

[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.820]
Here's a mobile and steward hello

[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.320]
Yes, people that call you and tell you that they're Republicans and they're gonna change the independent

[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.360]
First of all, we hope they do that because that'll just help us out more

[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.660]
Also, no Republican was upset with push did he really didn't do anything?

[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.720]
I mean whether you like the guy or not he doesn't vote they counted the votes

[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.080]
He was ahead they recounted him he was ahead no matter how many times they count him he's ahead. Yeah

[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.640]
Yeah, no team winning any sport would call up and say I know

[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.380]
We're not talking about a ballgame. So we're not interested in call one of the sports shows and talk ball games

[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:52.600]
No team. I keep hearing about that in that Baker that farbidden James Baker who just makes my skin crawl

[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.880]
Everytime well, you know like changing the rules of the game after the game has been started

[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.060]
We're not playing a ball game you moron

[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:05.200]
You've got them SS trooper you asshole you idiot you you farbidden the goi get out of our face

[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.600]
560 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 we're gonna be carrying the audio from the supreme court

[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.920]
Huh might as well these people got nothing to say today. It's Monday

[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:21.880]
Oh, that's right. I forgot. It's Monday. That's the excuse here in South Florida. There's Bill Schneider with Bill Singh. I we have you back. Yeah

[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.860]
Here's a mobile in the Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:33.080]
Hey guy. How you doing? All right. Hey listen, um, I have like a few opinions like on why we have this

[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:39.920]
You have a few opinion like okay, um basically when buddy McKay was ticked the senator

[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.260]
He wasn't the strongest candidate

[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.240]
When it was taken to be senator

[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.300]
And it seems to make George Bush maybe he was the strongest candidate

[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.000]
But there was a lot of the people that should have been like five grand

[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.440]
Florida would have a better shot than Al Gore and I think we're in this position

[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.440]
We're in now because we just didn't have the right players and okay wrong players there we go with that ball game stuff again

[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.400]
Call up the sports shows okay to be delighted here that we had the wrong players like the panthers

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.980]
The wrong players thank you sir

[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.640]
Like I said, I'll sit here and listen and go um, I maybe even once a while ago

[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.680]
In between trying to kill these damn little bugs must have a whole crap load of these

[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.140]
I don't know what I'm wasting my time trying to kill him for we must have 10,000 them in here

[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.280]
But of course we wouldn't want to get an exterminator in here because then that might actually cause great some money

[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.400]
Unless maybe we could trade it out since we got tradeouts for everything else in the world on the wrong at Christmas time

[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.680]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T line

[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.820]
Here's the mobile and by a bon adventure. Hello. I

[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.120]
Good morning meal. Yes, sir

[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:47.740]

[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.380]

[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.060]
Okay, I wanted to say just a few things first off

[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.900]
Let's just all be happy that we're we're healthy

[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.360]
We had a good year itself and

[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:28.860]
Where life is good, you know, all this junk is going on, but I just wanted to say that enjoy your show and

[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.800]
I just want to be positive today

[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.920]
Okay, all right and those bugs are because all the mung is on the floor when you guys are eating over there

[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.540]
I know that and we're not making it in here for days and we still got bugs. Okay. Good luck to you, pal

[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.160]
Okay

[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.080]
Yeah, there's though just to have a bunch of

[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.880]
Chiggers running around in here now. I guess maybe it's an EOE thing EO whatever they call it these days

[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.540]
5 6 7 0 5 6 1 what are you laughing about we have to have some triggers in the building? We're kind of like even it out

[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.640]
All that we do have kids scurry

[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.220]
5 6 7 0 5 6

[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.160]
The pound five what do you say should we do and put the supreme court or a

[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:09.600]
Arguments on or what I'm not going to do it. I wouldn't care if we got 40,000 calls saying oh we want to hear it the answer is still no no

[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]
No, it's terminal

[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.460]
Yeah, we were trying to wean you off of that crap already we knew away

[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.820]
22 to 4 11 at 5 60 WQ

[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.780]
The Neil Rogers show sports radio 5 60

[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.300]
Q a

[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:24.820]
M

[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.380]
Yeah

[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.360]
It's hard to be a Q on Chris man

[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.180]
Yeah

[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.860]
My friends were living born in any game

[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.840]
And I can't do Christmas on the decorate of Christmas tree

[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.820]
All these water out for root off of this something while we're being

[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.780]
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ is in a king

[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.340]
I'm a Jew

[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.940]
I'm only you

[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.260]
On Chris man

[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.780]
On a car is life for why is it

[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.740]
The set of sets of my house every year

[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.680]
And instead of beating time I have to recall your life

[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.800]
Instead of silent I'm singing new act of copy

[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.040]
And what the f**k is that we're fighting on the f**king center for me please

[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.420]
I'm a Jew

[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.260]
I won't meet you

[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.640]
I can't be married

[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.880]
Her time he grew on Chris man

[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.460]
Jesus

[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.140]
I couldn't help but near

[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.260]
The reason left out of Chris man

[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.500]
I couldn't save it

[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.700]
He shouldn't be sad

[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.800]
This is the one that you should be glad

[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.640]
He's just nice to be a true warbist

[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.440]
You don't have to deal with the things

[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.660]
No

[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.940]
You have to be on your best behavior

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.280]
Or give the charity

[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.660]
You don't have to go to grandma's house with your alcoholic family

[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.960]
I don't have to

[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.680]
You're also sick, sad, and sad

[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.940]
And I haven't been to big sad parties

[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.960]
I'm a Jew

[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.460]
You're a Jew

[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.960]
I'm styling you

[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.400]
It's a good time

[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.680]
To be a Jew

[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.240]
A Jew

[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.200]
A Jew

[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.320]
A Jew

[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.120]
A Jew

[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:54.540]
A Jew

[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.800]
All the bubble might see is all the time

[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.220]
And thanks to Robert at Power 96

[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.660]
One of our sales holes over there

[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.400]
Give us a check for 100 bucks for plan period

[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.100]
Thank you sir God bless America

[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.000]
How do you like that?

[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.220]
From Power 96 no less

[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.120]
Did most of our people come up with a check for plan period?

[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.480]
No

[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.580]
Did our sales department come up with a check for us?

[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:17.740]
No

[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.060]
Not that I want to embarrass our humiliate them

[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.160]
Or tell you what a bunch of cheap factors they are

[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.400]
Or how little help they give to our closeness

[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.500]
That was since we've been here

[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.980]
But that's just the way they are

[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.780]
Here's somebody that's got a great column by Marine Dowd

[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.920]
About the thing about what a pair of assholes

[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.340]
Basically what she's boiling it down to

[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.400]
Is what a pair of assholes we got running for president

[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.440]
Thank you very much

[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.580]
But don't anybody waste any more of our facts paper

[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.120]
With articles about this because like I'm trying to tell you desperately

[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.700]
I'm burned out I don't care

[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.960]
I just don't

[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.360]
In fact I want it to be over with

[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.060]
I want it over today

[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.640]
Get the oral arguments over

[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.740]
Get the anal arguments

[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.200]
Try them out there tonight Mr. Wooden stick

[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.080]
And just try to zass out and let them give us concession speech

[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.600]
And we'll survive okay

[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.940]
Enough is enough already

[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.760]
We know the election was stolen

[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.080]
We know he really wanted but who cares at this point

[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.460]
There's no way to prove it

[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.220]
You've got to hand it to one one thing

[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.140]
All those Republican themes this time

[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.520]
They did tremendous job

[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.740]
They threw up so much crap in so many different places

[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.040]
That they made it impossible

[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.180]
I've gone out there, Jeb

[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.580]
And your girlfriend too while you're at it

[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.940]
The secretary of Bush

[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.260]
How's the poll coming?

[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.460]
See the good part of this is we don't have any French Canadians in the audience

[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.880]
Now see that's good so all the Jews like me

[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.920]
We're voting for the French Canadians

[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.980]
Although, see I can only judge Jews being cheap by myself

[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:37.960]
Am I cheap? No

[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.440]
No way

[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.000]
I'm on the most generous Sun, I'm on the most gullible, I mean generous people

[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.860]
You'll ever find

[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.220]
So all those stereotypes that's just part of the whole business of anti-Semitism

[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.900]
The people like Georgia are always spreading around

[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.800]
But anyway even George thinks the French Canadians are cheaper what is outside it

[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.420]
That's quite an indictment if even a virulent anti-Semite like George says that

[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.660]
55 for the French Canadians

[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.820]
24 for the Jews only 10 for the Cubans

[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.260]
Who are the cheapest people in the fricking world

[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.740]
Here's the rabie, Jebel

[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.560]
Go over to the other side

[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.140]
Mobile in Miami, hello

[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:13.600]
Hello? Yes sir

[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.760]
You know I feel the same way you do

[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.480]
I don't care who gets in the white house

[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.560]
What I do care about is upholding the Constitution

[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.360]
Because the Constitution will be around before them, after them

[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.040]
You know

[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.080]
And they've messed up my portfolio

[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:29.740]
Yeah

[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:30.880]
You know

[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:36.700]
I thought my portfolio was all messed up too, I thought it was matured to do it

[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.120]
You know what? I'm going to tell you something else

[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.440]
If one of them really cared about the country they would have stepped down a month ago

[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:41.760]
Yeah

[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.340]
Well it makes you think either one of them cares about the country

[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.660]
That I'll look at about is ego

[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.580]
I would rather have someone off the street who's a small businessman run the country

[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.440]
You got it man

[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.600]
Some small business man like Bill Gates

[00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.160]
No I'm talking about you, Neil Roger for President

[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.580]
No thanks, or V Gates

[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.260]
567, 0560, 0560, 0560, I think I'm getting bitten by these damn bugs

[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.300]
And then of course this is the best

[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:14.040]
Bluff comes in here during the last commercial break and he's very concerned about the bug problem we got

[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.700]
Get off this instant

[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.440]
And I said well you know I never worked in a fricking radio station in my life that didn't have an exterminator

[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.720]
And he says all I think it has something to do with the building

[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.580]
That was his exact cruelty

[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.720]
He thinks it has something to do with the building

[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.460]
Yeah

[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.380]
Which is again his way of rationalizing that he works for a cheap prick

[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.620]
To locate us in exterminator coming here and for once a month

[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.400]
Remember at IOD we always had an exterminator

[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.500]
Whether it was the Cox IOD or the Pax IOD

[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.580]
Any radio station

[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.880]
Of course the KAT we want to have an exterminator because there were so many old people listening and working in a place

[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.740]
Exterminate we just not about well we didn't like the word

[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.840]
Here's Margate hello

[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.960]
Hi I have a question

[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.700]
Yes sir

[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.300]
I've had a problem with 560 with the marketing department for about two weeks now

[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.480]
I've had a problem with them for about three and a half years

[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.320]
Well you're going to laugh because I know you can get to the bottom of it

[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.680]
There's a book that you guys promote

[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.780]
It's two lines that will improve your repertoire

[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.880]
No one knows the name of it, no one knows the author of it

[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.760]
Wait a minute two lines that will improve your repertoire

[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.020]
Yes sir I mean it's actually funny

[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.520]
It's a book I wanted to buy for my wife for Christmas

[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.840]
And it's I've called the marketing department I've called the marketing department

[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.220]
What did you hear about that?

[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:36.360]
It's a commercial I've thought every single day on a on a Chubby show or a worst team

[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.360]
And I never get that I never get that they don't say the author and they don't say the title

[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.360]
So I've called the 305 number because this guy John I talked to a few times when I called 560

[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.740]
And he's like oh man just called the call the department

[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.580]
No one called me back for two weeks

[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.520]
Well of course not we don't want the audience to know

[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.840]
The same thing they won't give us the list of the numbers for their responses

[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.180]
People call George every day all day long

[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.520]
What's the name of that so and so what's the name of this place

[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.040]
What's the number of that restaurant and they won't give us the numbers

[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.380]
Well it's funny because I talked to my my long-haired friend Jeff Cohen the other day

[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.060]
And he told me he said yeah he said man I've heard it a couple times

[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:14.840]
Yeah

[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.540]
So I didn't say so often it's kind of nothing

[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.100]
So who will I call if I call the 305 number again again I'll have a review

[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.720]
What do you call the answer is I have no idea

[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.980]
So I get that way

[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:33.040]
So you have to sit there again get a cassette recorder out on paper one of the shows

[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.800]
Oh that's horrible I actually love your show and I hate bush and gourd

[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.920]
Okay good luck to you sir I mean I could lie to this guy and I'm going to

[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.820]
I could be embarrassed about if I work here and I take their money so I can be too embarrassed

[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.600]
They just don't care don't you understand

[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.920]
These I keep trying to tell these people I think I'm making a fun of it

[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.640]
I think it's a joke

[00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:00.360]
The people who run this place and the people in the sales department don't care about that

[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.460]
All they want is the money from the sponsors that's all they want

[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.060]
They're not interested in the results they're not interested in giving you people the number

[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.400]
They address the information that isn't part of their job

[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:17.340]
So I must have had some goal thinking they might help me even even just find a way to get a whole bunch of that car

[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.240]
Of solution stuff even if I was willing to pay for it even retail for quite a lot

[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.420]
Because that's got nothing to do with making them any money

[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.800]
Even though of course it would have been a great sponsor

[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.680]
But it's got nothing to do with making them any money

[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.460]
So how the hell can I have the girl I think they're going to be involved with that

[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.120]
There are people out there going oh he's got to be kidding

[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.040]
No I'm not kidding

[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.560]
Here's a mobile and West Palm Beach hello

[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.240]
Yes sir

[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.460]
And let them run your holidays and stay in a good mood

[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:50.700]
You wouldn't believe how many of these foolish Republicans that I've spoken to

[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.440]
And they told me that they definitely

[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:58.420]
5.670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.620]
Wasn't that clever?

[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.900]
That was real cute

[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.340]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale, hello

[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.920]
Oh yes here, okay

[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.060]
You know, a meal

[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:14.540]
I used to do going to listen to some remarks and I think I liked it I'm very nervous

[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.440]
I can't talk

[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.480]
But as much as we despise Republicans they hate us just as much

[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.500]
They'd like to if they could shoot our group

[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:31.940]
5.670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.200]
I have just when you think you've heard it all

[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.620]
When you think you've heard every stupid idiotic comment that you could possibly hear

[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.440]
And then she gets on her phone

[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.580]
Even the guy that was on before her was better

[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.160]
I mean, isn't there anybody out there with an IQ larger than their dim thumbnail?

[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.960]
Is there anybody out there that's got anything in their brain in this town?

[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.800]
Hello, and I bet on 25 years that I'm still I was gonna question

[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.500]
And you wonder why Florida screw up the election?

[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.520]
Florida could screw up a wet dream that's got a dim state

[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.600]
5.670560.560

[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.840]
of the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.340]
Here's a call and four Myers, hello

[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.180]
Neil how you doing?

[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:23.660]

[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.240]
Listen I was just gonna comment about what you were talking about a couple weeks ago

[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.880]
With you were talking about the mugwumps versus us

[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.500]
And I think that's the way you got to treat it

[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:39.440]
I mean it's basically look at the states like you said who voted for this guy

[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.780]
I mean we're talking about nine from the upper Midwest

[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.920]
And I'm proud of those people I'm proud of the people of Michigan, of Wisconsin, Minnesota

[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.600]
Yeah well we don't have the name law again

[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.540]
But I mean I'm just saying that those I wouldn't be that proud

[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.800]
You know it's not like we're talking about voting for somebody that's all that great

[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.840]
No I agree he may not be worth defending but the fact of the matter is who's the worst of the two

[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.400]
I mean don't you agree?

[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:04.820]
Yes

[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:10.700]
The way I look at it is like you said there's a I have what's called the trickle down theory

[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:16.160]
States where Dick Trickle is very popular are usually mugwumps states

[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.220]
So you're in one of them?

[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:25.060]
I'll tell you I thought that Florida, South Florida, the red necks were just in telehathy

[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:29.760]
This is like the dukes of hands are meets the steppered wives here

[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.200]
Yeah

[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.300]
This is horrifying

[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.300]
At least at least I'm sorry to look good though

[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.120]
Thanks a lot

[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.580]
Okay I have a rate to it

[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.620]
Well that's a testimony real fast

[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:41.020]
5.6705 see well it's true at least he looked good

[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:44.340]
I mean you know most of the mugwumps they don't look good, they don't smell too good

[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.240]
Here's a call from Miami, hello

[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.900]
They're a bad name

[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.440]
Yes

[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.960]
You want to hear some quick and few talk about play of me that want about Rudolph

[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.500]
The red nose rain there was sting dragon in the snow

[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.420]
You know that song that Christmas song you played about Rudolph

[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.680]
You said you want a Christmas song

[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.040]
I said you play about it

[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.080]
I said I wanted Christmas songs

[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.260]
Yeah at the beginning you should add one of I'd like to play Christmas songs today

[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.680]
And forget about this election president

[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.120]
Yeah

[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.360]
And I agree with this

[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.920]
You know dancing and dancing and dancing and dancing and fixing

[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.960]
Come it's the cutest sonner in Britain

[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.380]
What do you recall

[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:47.160]
The most famous raiding of all

[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.960]
Most well hung reindeer

[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.260]
Had a very lazy hoes

[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.200]
And when he got excited

[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.760]
It stuck out way past his nose

[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.280]
All of the other reindeer

[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.700]
Wanted what it's let wouldn't go

[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:14.320]
Turns out that Rudy's organ was getting stuck in the snow

[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:21.760]
Then one fucking Christmas scene with the Santa tune to say

[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.280]
Rudolph with your tooth alone

[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.600]
Won't you drive me home alone

[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.040]
All of the reindeer hate him

[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.440]
He's the favorite one because

[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.540]
Rudolph the well hung reindeer

[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.640]
Get to bang Mrs. Roy

[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.520]
I tell you what really is the assimilating about all his business

[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.300]
And they keep bringing the same desperate tired old people on

[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.380]
The former clerk to adjust the Scalia

[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.180]
And the former clerk to adjust this Kennedy

[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.200]
And here's Paul the Gallaghan

[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:56.980]
And here's this

[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.540]
Oh God

[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.780]
This seems like it's been going on for 100 years

[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.300]
Doesn't it?

[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.500]
It's been going on forever

[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:11.480]
The same old tired toll saying the same old predictable tired crap

[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.460]
How could anybody possibly endure it

[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.920]
I can't

[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.100]
But I sure hope you're having a good time with it

[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.460]
10.56 at 5.60 WQM

[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:25.520]
4.20.05.60 WQAM by heavy port letter L

[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.440]
Abesley Broadcast Group Station

[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.340]
WQAM.com or the world

[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.940]
Where are your fudge back in?

[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.180]
Locked up in a hotel at Bristol Nethan Choke Vacation

[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.820]
Are they put Robert Downey back into incarceration?

[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:57.300]
The cops say had to bust his ass because he was free based term

[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:11.460]
Well now they're going to send you to a truck free institution

[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:16.620]
Maybe you will get to go where Melanie Griffiths is saying

[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.420]
Last time didn't work so clearly rehabilitation

[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.040]
So much for rehabilitation

[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.400]
So much for rehabilitation

[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.860]
You know I'm looking at this Bob Hubard on the phone

[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.420]
People keep faxing me stuff and I tell you to stop faxing me

[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.980]
I'm not interested in going in a way

[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.720]
Spasked about this selection

[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.200]
But Bob Hubard from the New York Times does have an interesting term

[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.380]
He uses he calls this selection

[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.840]
They float a fiasco

[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.340]
I saw Bob as usual

[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.720]
And here's another one that almost has interest enough to read it

[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.460]
But I won't

[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.900]
Coral conspirators by covering Bush's post campaign

[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.360]
Is what politics is usual

[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.140]
The media are complicit in his attempt at theft

[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.480]
And media is sick and they talk bad

[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.900]
From the Boston Phoenix by a dead in Kinsey

[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.280]
Well I'm not going to read it on here

[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.160]
Stop wasting our fax paper

[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.020]
I don't care anymore don't you understand?

[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.460]
Here's some really bad news

[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.920]
National Airlines files bankruptcy

[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.280]
Oh!

[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.860]
National Airlines is seeking protection from creditors under chapter 11 of US bankruptcy laws

[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.620]
And reorganizes its business

[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.800]
The airline blamed its financial troubles on rising fuel costs

[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.120]
But they said its service will not be interrupted

[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.760]
Said they'd lost biggest-based airline

[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.260]
What a shame

[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:33.760]
Did a pretty good job

[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.760]
On July 27th the company weighed national headlines

[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.620]
When a 22-year-old man got under flight at JFK

[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:42.060]
And New York put a gun to a pilot's head

[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.340]
And began a five-hour standoff

[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.680]
I didn't know that was on national

[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.340]
Maybe thought he was on American

[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.920]
And wanted to know where the hand grenades were

[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.420]
National Office Service to Chicago Midway

[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.060]
Downloads for worth L.A. Miam in New York

[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.280]
New work rather

[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.980]
New York for the welfare of San Francisco Washington, BC

[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.760]
Two Chicago Hairskates will begin January 25th

[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.340]
How do you like that?

[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.760]
In September the company had its two-minute passenger

[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.880]
But they got real problems, they got tourists

[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.980]
5,670,560,050,560

[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.960]
Oh that's right, look at that

[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.540]
The oral argument to the needle argument to going on right now is we speak

[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.440]
They're not on the ear

[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:17.080]
And they will be releasing the audio tapes at 1230

[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.260]
Are we going to play those audio tapes?

[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:18.600]
No!

[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.120]
Just keep mentioning that over and over again

[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.540]
So if anybody feels let down

[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.440]
Don't just keep sticking with the needle 1230

[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.160]
Expect I'm going to put that stuff on the ear again

[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.160]
Because what's the point?

[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:26.900]
What's the use?

[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.900]
You've heard all the arguments before

[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:30.300]
The fix is already in

[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.340]
So what's the point of going through that exercise again?

[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.260]
I was thinking good air time

[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.280]
Then we can be sitting here

[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.820]
And keep giving the phone numbers again and again

[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.680]
Here's Helen Dale, hello

[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.040]
Hey, how are you doing?

[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:40.380]
Okay

[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.620]
I was just wondering if I was going to tell you

[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.660]
I'm quite excited about that lightning conspiracy going on over there

[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.600]
The two are going

[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.660]
And I'd like to tell you

[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.960]
We should be thinking about other things like

[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.880]
I really go out and pot and

[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.720]
I think that's better if I were calling the other one

[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.640]
Yeah, well, there are a question of bush gets in

[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.520]
You got a good chance for that

[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.980]
Just like if Gilbert had gotten in, huh?

[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.940]
5.670560

[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.440]
Pound 560 on the AT&T

[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.840]
And Verizon wireless lines

[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.540]
Out of town line like over on a West Coast

[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.760]
Well, we actually didn't have it like a real collar this morning

[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.640]
Do you notice that?

[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.700]
Like somebody who actually spoke like a living and breathing human being

[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.680]
877-785-6345

[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.920]
I mean, we've only had the line about two years now

[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:31.000]
And we finally actually got like a living and breathing person from four buyers today

[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:31.840]
Right

[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.320]
See, something's going to happen all right, it's not even noon yet

[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.320]
Here's Sunrise, hello

[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.320]
Yeah, Dale, how are you doing?

[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:39.660]
Okay

[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.620]
Good, I just want to let you know that I'm a big fan of listening for a while

[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.440]
And also I'm an excriminator, so if you need me over there, I can come

[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.040]
Okay

[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.520]
That's all I have today

[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.320]
Okay, thanks

[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.440]
And they keep sending me more articles on this fax machine

[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.160]
Here's what about the dimpled election

[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.040]
And here's what about the pimple election?

[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:03.880]
Not interested

[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.400]
See, of course we got no calls now because the audience thinks that we're going to keep talking about this

[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.760]
Just like after the early on thing, finally, when we reached the point that there was absolutely nothing left to say

[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.200]
Like how about the second day of it?

[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.760]
And it was like you had to start all over again

[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.160]
And go back to square one and start from scratch because you had a one-dimensional bunch of people

[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.520]
Just like that bitch that called earlier that I had a dump that's talking about a bullcrab

[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.980]
Here's a mobile and cruel spring, hello

[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:33.360]
Hey, have you ever heard the Chinese song from the five Rivers album?

[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.700]
Let me ask you something, do you have like a hobby?

[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.220]
Sir

[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:39.700]
What?

[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:40.980]
F-

[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.240]
That was great!

[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T

[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:56.160]
And Verizon, if you ever call the show before like in the last five minutes, don't call me again, okay?

[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.840]
I'm just trying to flush out at the end of the year we're trying to like flush things out

[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.540]
Like all these bugs around this toilet that we're working in here

[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.020]
When it doubt flush them out

[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:08.860]
That's my New Year's resolution

[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.000]
My New Year's resolution was I was going to lose a lot of weight and this was going to be the time

[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:12.580]
Is it the time?

[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:12.820]

[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:13.060]
No

[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.980]
Well I got to do blood tests this afternoon and Gary's going to suck some blood out

[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:20.560]
So I can't eat anything now

[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.060]
But you just get to the point where you're ready to give up, you know?

[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.680]
I thought I had an award-winning stellar week last week, I was very proud of myself

[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.200]
Get on the scale on Saturday morning

[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.420]
There it is, and of course they say well you know water waiting it

[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.720]
But I mean how much water?

[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:36.780]
And I'm peeing like a racehorse, you know?

[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.120]
That's supposed to be the key, it's the pee

[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.540]
Like a racehorse, your peeing your brains out

[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:44.580]
You figure out I'm going to get on the scale tomorrow morning and get another two or three pounds

[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.320]
Guess what?

[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.020]
Wrong

[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:52.820]
So my 849,000th diet is in the crap we're getting

[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.980]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello?

[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:56.320]
Yeah

[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.040]
Yes sir

[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:57.800]
Hi, how you doing?

[00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:58.240]
Okay

[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.420]
I would like to hear at 1230 those tapes

[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.260]
Yeah

[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.040]
You will kill an hour for lunch for you

[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:06.760]
Yeah

[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.800]
Why do you want to hear it?

[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.380]
I'm a big time busier with a supporter and I bought it for him

[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.440]
And you want?

[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:14.280]
You bought it for him?

[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.740]
No, I'll tell you what, after you learn to speak the language, come back and learn about it

[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.100]
He bought it for him

[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.240]
567-0560, pound 560 on the 18th

[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.420]
Oh, and the answer you're requesting?

[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:25.900]
No, we're not going to put it on

[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.360]
Absolutely, positively no under any circumstances

[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.320]
No, the answer is 9

[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.560]
Net, net, net

[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:38.780]
Eight minutes after 11 at 560 WQM

[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:43.540]
From all these productions comes the cutest little Arabs you've ever seen

[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:50.000]
Erifetz, Abdullah, Jerusalem, and Little Jericho, 102 Palestinians

[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.100]
This time the wicked Kurella Barak is trying to separate all the little Palestinians from their happy West Bay homes

[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:03.540]
It's one explosive situation after another with all those Palestinians scrambling for cover

[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:09.160]
Don't miss Walt Disney's newest animated feature, 102 Palestinians

[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.680]
Now showing in theaters everywhere

[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:11.880]
Oh!

[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:18.580]
Come on, it's after a lot of the 560 WQM Happy Monday, Happy Holidays to all of you from our very upbeat Neil Rogers show here

[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:19.780]
We don't give a crap on any of this

[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:23.680]
You want a little piece of philosophy for you, even though most of you aren't going to buy any of it, but I don't care

[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.680]
Because I keep telling you the truth for 25 years and most of you aren't buying it anyway

[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.780]
Although a little portion of your brain is a little message and they're saying you know he's right

[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:35.360]
But you just don't want to deal with it because you've been so brainwashed

[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:41.720]
And the fact is that if I were to do a talk show I would have to be paying like one million of the attention to any of this that I've been paying

[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:47.400]
But I have to do it, or I've had to do it for the last several weeks because this is all that's been going on

[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.380]
And preoccupied people that's all they care about

[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.980]
But the fact is that most of us, it's just like the thing with Barak yesterday

[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.620]
They're hawking the China with Barak, he's resigning in Israel

[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:59.800]
And we're supposed to be all worried, do you like care about that?

[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.000]
No!

[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:00.300]
No!

[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:02.400]
No!

[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:02.500]

[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:10.240]
The philosophy lesson is don't get yourself all wound up, don't get your shorts into a goddamn thing

[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:14.500]
All wrapped up around your ass because the things that really don't affect your life

[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:20.060]
And people tend to do that because the media, as I've kept telling you, they lead you by the nose

[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:22.620]
They tell you what's important, where you're supposed to get all whipped up about

[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.440]
This isn't important, any more than alien was important

[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.900]
Oh yeah, but it's about the next way, yeah right

[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.700]
They're all a bunch of themes, they're going to spend your money like it's come out of a faucet somewhere

[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.300]
And it doesn't make a hell's worth of difference because they both suck

[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:44.740]
But the Supreme Court hearings underway right now, they have an oral argument, they have an anal argument

[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.020]
Right as we speak, clearance Thomas is in the back of the room smoking a big fat one

[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:53.320]
That's right, and that's why he never asked any questions because he's preoccupied

[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.680]
He'd be smoking and talking in the back of the room, clearance be Thomas

[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.800]
He'd be doing it

[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.200]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:02.560]
Yeah?

[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.280]
Yes sir

[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:10.200]
Yeah, those cops, Lucien bars are really good, I went to a pub, and they had one left

[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.620]
So then I called that the company that whose number was on the bar

[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:14.940]
Right

[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:19.180]
They told me they're available at Walmart, Target and Kmart

[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:19.620]
Really?

[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:22.400]
Yeah, I went to the local Kmart, the shelves were full

[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:32.460]
And I didn't go to Target or Walmart, but I'm sure that their shelves are full as well

[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:36.000]
And then that was for cheaper than that then public does

[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.480]
Oh do they?

[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:37.460]
Yes they do

[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:44.820]
And also, I sent you that the non-toxic ant baits, some time ago, Uncle Albert

[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:48.780]
And if you want dust control, then you're placed non-toxic dust control

[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.080]
Yeah

[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.500]
They will get rid of whatever you got there

[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.460]
Yes, that's the way I do, I'm getting tired of slapping bugs here

[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.360]
And you put the, put me on with Georgia, I'll arrange it

[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.280]
Okay, thanks, hang on

[00:56:59.820 --> 00:56:59.840]
Okay

[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.580]
So there's the good news, the cops solutions, even though you may not lose anyway, but at least it tastes good

[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:05.280]
And maybe you will lose weight with it

[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:07.800]
Delicious stuff

[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.540]
Here's a mobile in West Palm, hello

[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:12.460]
Hello

[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.200]
Yes sir

[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:14.260]
How you doing?

[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:14.380]
All right

[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:14.800]
Okay

[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.020]
Listen

[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:22.720]
Everybody's blaming us for for really in the down here, that's all our fault, but we didn't cause

[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.640]
Is you're right, the media caused this, direct the post

[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.040]
But, push it, go or fight it

[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.660]
Okay, great, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60

[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:39.140]
On the 18t and don't confuse Alaska with the facts because obviously it wouldn't do any good

[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.200]
Like talking to a rock

[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.780]
Florida can't do anything right sir

[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.900]
We can't, we don't know how to do anything right

[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.220]
We don't know how to make a ballot right, we know we're in the stone age

[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:54.240]
And now all of a sudden the newspapers after all of this mess, after all this embarrassment

[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.400]
We're too out to be used to buy now, after all of this

[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:00.280]
Oh, I guess what, it's our cake and our motor not dated and something needs to be done about it

[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.480]
Wow, thanks so much for the great job you did ahead of time

[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:03.880]
Not

[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:08.760]
Punch card ballots

[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.540]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.900]
I do now, okay

[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:19.620]
And you say you don't want to talk about the election, I just want to, you know, I was watching one of these magazines

[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:28.940]
Show you the last night and they had this professor on that said he's here discovered a way, you know, to read

[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.940]
Brain waves for people

[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.780]
Nice job, that

[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.060]
You get that?

[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:33.320]
Yeah

[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:42.180]
And it's been introduced to Congress, by this Republican Senator Grassley I think

[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:42.440]
Yeah

[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:49.960]
And he's going to try to find a way to, you know, make it where you can use it in a criminal case

[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:55.920]
I mean that sounds like big brother to me, you know, I even afford somebody to watch that screen

[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.740]
When they close their eyes and they don't want to do it, what are you going to take their eyes over

[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:03.580]
And you can stop them up with the toothpicks like in Clockwork Orange, that's right

[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:08.020]
You know, I'm going to be, I say the first person we ought to check that brain wave fingerprint thing on his OJ

[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:13.500]
I mean, please, I'm a harder gun, I mean, it's issues there that's got to be discussed

[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:16.800]
I just sounds too much like big brother to me

[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.320]
Yeah, like a reading in your mind

[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.540]
All right, thanks

[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.360]
Okay, I have a great head, I did see that, pretty interesting

[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.940]
Let's strap OJ up and see if we can read his mind

[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.320]
Or let's just strap him up anyway

[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.920]
And just leave him there before we pull the switch

[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:29.860]
Can you imagine how long that line would be?

[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.520]
560.560.560 on the AT&T InfoWireless Line

[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:40.240]
Out of townline is open 877-785-6345

[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.220]
Bill Schneider is on the RNCN going

[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:43.780]
Ratering authority, if you want

[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:44.140]
Yeah, huh?

[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:47.020]
Here's Pine Quest, hello

[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.220]
Hey, how are you doing?

[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:48.600]
Okay

[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.000]
Just a couple of things

[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.200]
The punch cards are definitely archaic

[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.060]
We need to change them and I got a couple of ideas

[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.120]
Of course, he's talked about the APM type voting machines

[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.240]
Which I agree with

[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.040]
In fact, the good news is Hillsborough County

[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.580]
The ounces, while they were doing well through all the baloney on Saturday

[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.020]
When the vote counting was getting organized before they cut them off at the pass

[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.720]
They're going to go to all touch screens in Hillsborough County before the next election

[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.040]
Right, which actually they need to do nationwide

[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.360]
Right

[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.540]
Have a national day off for voting

[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:17.940]
Right

[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.820]
Have the Eastern time zone vote from 10am to 8pm

[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:26.420]
The Pacific time zone vote from 7am to 5pm

[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.760]
And at one time we'll know who the president is

[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.260]
And eliminate all this

[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:36.640]
Oh well, the Pacific coast makes a decision of what happens on the East Coast

[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.260]
And that's my idea, I don't know what to think

[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.320]
What makes a lot of sense?

[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:40.700]
Yeah

[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.920]
So it probably won't do it

[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.200]
Oh no, it makes too much sense

[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.000]
Okay, thanks

[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:44.820]
All right, have a great holiday

[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:45.380]
And you too

[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.460]
Yeah, see that does make sense

[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.580]
When does it complicated?

[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.800]
But of course, when you do things in a way that makes it make sure that it's accurate

[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.540]
And that it's fair and that it's equitable

[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:55.460]
Then you can't see elections like what's going on right now

[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.480]
And then Mrs. Upwater plans just like Cassio said

[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.060]
Then Mrs. Upwater my plans

[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.380]
Can you get them off the hook for all time's sake?

[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:03.580]
No

[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:04.440]
Can't do it, Sally

[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.180]
And don't call me Sally by the way

[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.100]
Yeah, that would have been a great line in there, don't call me Sally

[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:15.520]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T and VerizonWalk

[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.980]
Let's just play the audio from the Godfather for four hours

[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.440]
Be a lot more entertaining talking about this damn election crap

[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.380]
I'll tear that right now

[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.360]
God almighty

[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.400]
And of course you do realize that if the Democrat said any brains who a little bit of

[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.320]
Called in the street in the South

[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:34.420]
Don't call you

[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.440]
Exactly, but they didn't do it

[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.500]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 50, 05, 60 on the AT&T line

[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.620]
Our 10 minutes from now they're going to be playing the audio tapes of the Supreme Court oral and evil arguments

[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.380]
You want to hear those?

[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.800]
Not going to have it here on the show

[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.000]
You know what we have to do?

[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.300]
We have to pull a bait and switch and just put it right on there

[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:56.840]
What do you think?

[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.760]
Here's a Mabel and Fort Lauderdale, hello

[01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.520]
Yeah, I know

[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.880]
Okay, you have a great article from the bottom globe

[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.600]
Yeah

[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.220]
This was about the Canadian election right?

[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.880]
This was a little Saturday before the Canadian election?

[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:06.240]
Uh-huh

[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.060]
You know they had this guy named the Doc Weld-Dage running for a...

[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:09.220]
No

[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.860]
Okay, well the Canadian broadcasting broke this story

[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.580]
Now, it's paragraph

[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.600]
A conservative upstart who hopes to become a dragon's player in Canadians now

[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.540]
The national elections on Monday

[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.640]
Instead, finds himself being swayed for refuse

[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.580]
He believed that dinosaurs once ruled the earth

[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.040]
He's a fundamentalist Christian

[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.220]
But the Canadians have real press in their country

[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.780]
And they made him explain that they lost the election for it

[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.320]
It's right here

[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.960]
The dinosaurs became an issue at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Diggie

[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.460]
So if we hadn't media-elected that, they would go out to bush police and the same stuff these guys

[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.020]
What do you know?

[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.560]
It's got to be right here

[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.660]
He said, if dinosaurs strode the earth, they did it anything

[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.880]
They were with Adam and Eve

[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:46.140]
So when the meet-tree came across as a moderate just like George Bush

[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:50.320]
But the Canadian broadcasting corporation had the balls to make him say that they lost the election

[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:50.540]
Right

[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.700]
George Bush, please put the same crap in there

[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.720]
Do you have any Canadians who talked about the election on your show?

[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:55.200]
No

[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.800]
This guy was a real right-wing nut

[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.360]
I know that

[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.460]
I don't need to talk to Canadians about it

[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.140]
I read in the Toronto Papers all the time

[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.780]
But it shows if our meeting was like there in my view

[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.280]
Okay, thank you

[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.840]
That's the eight-time he said that

[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.080]
Isn't that the eight-time he said it?

[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.320]
That's the 24th time I agree with you, sir

[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.100]
But how many times can you say the same thing?

[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.220]
How many times can you see these same boring people on MSNBC and CNBC and CNN

[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.640]
and FoxBanks' network?

[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.340]
How many times can you see those same boring people on there?

[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.500]
Before you finally start winging from it already

[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.700]
Before you finally start puking out meals the eight-twenty-five weeks ago

[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:28.120]
God

[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.780]
So what did you just say?

[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.880]
No, Amy, he's got a great point

[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.280]
I think what he was trying to say was

[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.820]
The media is sick and need help, Patrick

[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.340]
But Jesus Christpal, have a nice day, eh?

[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.200]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.320]
Hello, Neil

[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:44.920]
Yes, sir

[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.840]
Hi, Neil, I'm not going to talk about the election

[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.740]
I just want to say there's no staggs in the church

[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.200]
Yeah

[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.320]
Okay, great, thank you

[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.240]
5670, what are you looking at me like that for?

[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.680]
This is what you've got out there

[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.460]
These are very creative clever people

[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.020]
This is the South Florida audience

[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.700]
The same people you and I have been talking to for a hundred years now

[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.800]
And this is their material

[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.460]
Don't you understand it?

[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.600]
Yeah, okay, good

[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.080]
So you're going to tell that thing?

[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.620]
I'll think about it

[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.240]
We'll play it by ear

[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.500]
As Ross Peroll used to say

[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.440]
We'll play it by ears

[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.020]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:17.420]
Yeah

[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.240]
Yes, sir

[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.700]
Let me tell you something

[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:22.220]
With those five sashes on the Supreme Court did Saturday

[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:24.560]
It's unacceptable, unconscionable

[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.480]
They stopped the hand count

[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.000]
Which was the most equitable for the hand job, yeah

[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.960]
The most equitable solution for this election

[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:34.840]
Okay, we will finally find out who won the election

[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.400]
No, we would

[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.460]
No, we would

[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.180]
No, we would not

[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.140]
We would not have found out who the election was

[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:41.620]
We would not

[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.460]
We would not

[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.640]
By what standards

[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.080]
We would not find what standards

[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:45.680]
By the standards

[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.740]
Oh, take two Tylenol and two mill-pounder calm down

[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:49.540]
Stop whining

[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.700]
Who the hell wants to hear people like that?

[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.800]
I'm getting odd to do just from the south of his voice

[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.300]
Not to mention the fact he makes no sense whatsoever

[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.640]
They're counting dimples in brow

[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.380]
But they're not counting dimples in plummage

[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.800]
Let me say it again to you

[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.320]
As soon as I'm at a who you voted for

[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.900]
No matter who you're pulling at for

[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.880]
The fact is

[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.220]
This is not the way to hold a God damn election

[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.840]
Don't you understand that sir?

[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:14.120]
No

[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.520]
No, he's still talking probably

[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.860]
He's still whining

[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.000]
Your whining is getting on my nerves sir

[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.980]
You're hysterical, you're psychotic

[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.240]
And like I keep trying to tell you

[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.860]
There was no God damn dimes

[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.920]
Where the difference between either one of these candidates

[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.600]
Between the four of them

[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.880]
A plague on both their houses

[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.780]
That's what I said before the election

[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.140]
And now I got lulled in a going there and voting

[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.700]
And thinking I was doing something worthwhile

[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.380]
And got sucked up into this whole damn thing

[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:46.420]
I'm just even two or two thousand four

[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.120]
I'm voting for him

[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.400]
Just before I get on the plane

[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.820]
I'm leaving my absentee ballot

[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.960]
Here's a mobile in pompino

[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:54.900]
Hello

[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:55.900]
God

[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.120]
Neil?

[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:57.740]
Yes sir

[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:58.700]
There we go good

[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.200]
The fact that the rest of the country

[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.700]
Is able to vote normally

[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.040]
And the fact that Florida

[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.240]
The incompetence down here

[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.180]
Just finding the decent mechanic is a miracle

[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.200]
Finding a real doctor

[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.960]
Finding a real anything down here

[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.900]
It's always like looking for a needle in a haystack

[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.560]
This is a land of its cracks

[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.160]
It's going to get in glasses last week

[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.580]
And the lenses are reversed

[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:24.540]
How difficult is it to get anything done down here

[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.440]
Right exactly

[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.180]
And the thing is when we're problems with us voting down here

[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.220]
We're all like oh yeah

[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.400]
You know no surprise down here

[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.960]
The rest of the country is a pause

[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.460]
Yeah

[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.720]
It's unbelievable

[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.760]
I'm going to say it again

[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.860]
The entire state of New York

[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.840]
With its 17 or 18 million people

[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:38.460]
Whatever they got

[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.460]
They don't start

[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.940]
They don't close the pause till 9 o'clock

[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:42.720]
On election night

[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.340]
We closed at seven most of the state

[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.000]
And yet by midnight they had

[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.860]
Every vote counted

[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:47.540]
They were all finished

[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.180]
Gone to sleep

[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.580]
And we didn't even have one vote

[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:50.960]
And they counted counted by midnight

[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.680]
Exactly

[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.740]
And someone had a good point

[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:53.880]
You know they got the dollar machine

[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.820]
Where you put the dollar in

[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:55.580]
If you didn't read it right

[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:55.800]
Right

[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.680]
That's it back out

[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.720]
You know that's not difficult

[01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.980]
When it's out spit it out

[01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.480]
That's right

[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.460]
One last thing

[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.040]
I think you ought to put the Supreme Court

[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:02.940]
Here and gone from last

[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:03.920]
We can play it all day

[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.860]
You'll have people turn in

[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:05.380]
Two minutes

[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:06.640]
Alright

[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.640]
See you

[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.040]
Okay

[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:09.900]
That's a good idea

[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.620]
I got the tape

[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.340]
They would know the difference we got the tape

[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.380]
Okay, stay tuned

[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.540]
See is it real or is it Memorax?

[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.760]
Here's Ruth Bayley Ginsburg

[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.360]
She's on the same as she was last week

[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.040]
Yeah, she sounded like she's sucking on a persimmon

[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.640]
That Ruth Bayter Ginsburg

[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.460]
And we're supposed to be big fans of hers

[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:28.980]
Oh yeah

[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.260]
This is Ruth Bayley again today

[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.100]
I really would rather have Carol O'Connor on there

[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:36.820]
I think we'd have a chance

[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.500]
Even though it looks like we're going to chop his foot off

[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.200]
He's got the diabetes out of control

[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:41.740]
Eat it

[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.960]
25 past 11

[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.260]
That's what his problem

[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.560]
Every time he saw something fattening

[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.180]
That's what he do

[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.380]
Eat it

[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.440]
And now they're going to have to chop his foot off baby

[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.380]
Poor Carol O'Connor

[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.220]
What's he going to say about that?

[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.280]
Ah, jeez

[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:54.800]
Huh?

[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.260]
What are you going to say?

[01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.180]
Oh, it was speaking to I.G.

[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.220]
How about ass jeez?

[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.180]
Anybody want to buy some of that for about four bucks a share?

[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.520]
Oh, how about Xerox?

[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.400]
How does that market doing as a matter of fact?

[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.760]
Now, old NASDAQ's up 84

[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.340]
And the Dow, come on, you can do it

[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.160]
Spend the thing there

[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.800]
We want to see this redneck fascist

[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.200]
And the Florida legislature

[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.840]
And the Dow's up 40

[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.000]
See, I'm making money just sitting here

[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.400]
Even if I weren't talking and making money

[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.300]
The meter is running

[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.320]
Why not?

[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.260]
Can't we be just as suffices those right wing fascists

[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.000]
Don't just like the guy that wouldn't give them

[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.520]
Wanted to give me the check after the election

[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.360]
That fascist from Philadelphia

[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.380]
26 after 11 at 560 WQM

[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.880]

i

[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:03.660]
i

[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:07.000]
way back in the summer time i was telling my friends that

[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.300]
the two candidates are cautious

[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.920]
yes and the quality of the process would be a compliment

[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.180]
i i would agree however i do think there is a difference

[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.500]
that should that may be important yeah

[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.720]

okay there's the token spartan on the U.S. Supreme Court clearance Thomas

[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.880]
twenty-seven before noon at qa I'm there speaking right now they're hucking a tronic

[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:11.040]
here's what it be some of the they start the votes again

[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.460]
oh

[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.020]
yeah let's start counting again what do you say

[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.780]
now let me ask you this you notice how they had them separated

[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:24.900]
in all those little boxes they were like shoe boxes they were cut off at the tops

[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.700]
because they had an improvised and they were marked roar bush no vote

[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.200]
whatever

[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.220]
and I'm curious now all the ones that they already went through like they did

[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:39.340]
four thousand of them in date and how come nobody's talking about the fact that

[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.460]
after four thousand of them were counted in date that go and the bush actually

[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:45.440]
picked up forty two votes in date count did you see that

[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.420]
you picked up forty two votes you gain ninety two and go again fifty

[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.760]
out of the first four thousand but of course being creative like they all

[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.940]
out there being really very smart not like freighter the big smart they probably

[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.420]
like Jan and all back together again

[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:04.180]
here's Cooper City hello yes sir how you doing okay

[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:09.160]
listen Neil I just wanted to let you know that I'm so upset that the Supreme Court

[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.240]
has decided to stop the hand count yeah it's like for the first time in my life

[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.060]
I realized that all those people who said over the years they listen you're about to

[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:20.180]
think out you're silly and I'm trying to convince them to yeah yeah go out and vote

[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:24.880]
you know what they will write yeah it doesn't count all right you know voting is

[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:29.300]
waste of time you know there's some people who are going to be by getting us to vote

[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:34.080]
it's by it's forcing us to legitimize an illegitimate system that's what they're doing

[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.480]
right and there's there's no democracy you know we always thought that we really

[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.840]
did have a democracy no we don't have a police day we are police day they they

[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.660]
think they grab the money out of our pockets whether we want to give it or not

[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.760]
and then they flush it down the toilet for all their friends and all their special

[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.960]
work and then we have nothing to say about it you know we think that we got

[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.080]
people studying that's increasing that's on the streets of this country right and

[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.960]
if we really did have democracy the person with the most votes would win right and

[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:03.660]
and the person with the vote most votes is not we he's just trying to count the

[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:08.680]
votes down here you know history is going to remember the Republican party as the

[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:13.180]
party that defeated democracy because if they truly believed in democracy they

[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:16.760]
would say hey listen our goal has most of the votes here he has

[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.000]
you were doing you were doing real good for bottom in the half there now you're

[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.780]
like you're looking yourself again well he has he has come back in the

[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:33.640]
real world sir he has come back in the middle of the

[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.740]
election and I will not legitimize your illegitimate system ever again never

[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:41.820]
never ever again although I will not get an exception like I said I just

[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:45.740]
lied I will like an exception two years because I will vote against Jeb

[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:49.600]
Bush if they're running out for the new men junior against Jeb Bush I go for

[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.520]
Alfred five times but other than that I will never ever here is a

[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.560]
cool cables hello and he'll yes sir listen to this show the past few days I was

republican so that he was alone next to me here's a mobile in Miami hello

[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:45.780]
hello yes sir hi how you doing look I want you to think in the banks better get rid

[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:49.740]
of the Republicans because those machines that count the money are very similar to

[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.760]
the machines that count the votes and you know those machines spit out dollars

[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.460]
that they don't think are dollars and what are we going to do just throw those off

[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:03.460]

space if he's on your penis go away Dave the cop five six seven oh five 60 pound

[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:54.420]
five 60 on the 18t and Verizon wireless line 21 to noon at five 60 WC what's your

[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:57.780]
name of that station again five six feet

[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.020]
you way out

[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:17.780]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor just like the ones I used to know

[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:29.780]
where the ones were trim and cars had rents so very long ago

[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:43.260]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor with every fossil sign I invite

[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:50.280]
pay your days be very and bright

[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:07.140]
and may all of you live forever be white

[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.340]
so Saturday morning we're watching this display going on up there in

[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:19.120]
Health World County and they're doing their using this software now from Dave County

[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:23.840]
to separate the other boats and on my stomach I didn't take the other boats and

[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.620]
separate them originally and put them on other envelopes they like put them all

[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.400]
together again you see that and so they're using the new software and what it does is it

[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.240]
puts the cards back in there and when it comes across one that doesn't register the

[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:40.460]
machine stops and they have to manually pull it out okay and I said you know I'm

[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:45.760]
really wondering what the deal is because if the chads fell off any of the

[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:49.860]
under votes whether we're just hanging before they weren't counted now the

[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.400]
machine is going to like push them on through they're not counting them again

[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:55.600]
keep in mind but they're going to push them on through so the number of

[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.920]
under votes will be different than what they were looking and just as I finished

[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.720]
saying that the woman the supervisor of election from Hillsboro came on and

[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.320]
said oh I wonder when I saw you people in the media and the people from both

[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.940]
parties don't be confused because I just want to alert you now that it will be

[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.740]
probably a different number of under votes because she explained just what I

[01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:24.020]
just said just what I had just said like seconds before so the idea that this

[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:29.320]
process was going to give us a real number if his ludicrous is the whole the

[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.020]
whole way floated in the first place as his ludicrous is the idea that bush won the

[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:38.060]
state but the horse was already out of the barn see that was the problem and I

[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.820]
have people trying to rectify it with a totally unacceptable or remedy it wasn't

[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:47.140]
acceptable because they could never come up with the right number and this is what

[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:52.620]
happens when you have paper freaking ballots and hanging chads and pregnant

[01:21:52.620 --> 01:22:00.920]
chads and subjective votes and wished for votes oh yeah I think that one looks

[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:06.620]
pretty good what he said yeah that's good enough this is somebody's idea of

[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.740]
having a goddamn election and like I said before thank God it's not really that

[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:14.720]
important five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 to the time I

[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:19.660]
got twenty five thousand open lines here we're waiting on you they're still

[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:22.740]
talking here they're talking to twelve thirty so there's not a damn thing anybody's

[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:25.640]
going to tell you they can have a good on there from now until hell freezes over

[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.620]
and she's still not going to tell you a damn thing until it's all over and then

[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.900]
they're going to play the tapes and you know what and there's still not going to

[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.660]
know anything because that was supposed to go back on pin needles again like we were on

[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:42.680]
Friday again am I going back into that mode no no I rather go on the come mode then back into that

[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:48.760]
mode here's a mobile and four-water deal hello yeah I need yes sir hi I think I

[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.120]
might have the answer on how they can fix the technology not to see her in Florida

[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:58.720]
but all over the country I know it's it's not practical financially for them to

[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.580]
put a terminal for everybody single person to vote in but if they got some sort of a

[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:07.120]
ticket reader like when you give the store to see your ticket at the jet

[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:11.680]
way and they didn't hand it back to you and that way if it doesn't go through right

[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.700]
they make you go to the end of the line they kind of cash out on your way out of

[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:18.740]
the voting place they have an instant number at the end of the voting day because it all

[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:23.320]
get down low to the immediately and networks wouldn't be stuck to having the pre-fork

[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:26.920]
we wouldn't have no why do they have to do that well we already have the technology

[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.440]
would be a touch screen whether what's wrong with that well I'm just saying I think the

[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.940]
touch screen is to have every voter use one of those that might be too expensive to have one of those

[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:41.980]
why why well I'm just saying that they're if they cry poverty on being too technical

[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:46.640]
for uh... it's a little bit supposed to be then important then why can't we find the

[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.340]
money we find the money for everything else

[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:52.780]
i agree with you i'm i'm coming up with the second answer when they didn't say they

[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.200]
don't have the money if we had one reader per station and everybody had to wait

[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.580]
long to check out i say i say let them find the money and get it right

[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:04.500]
i i'm with you but i'm just i'm going after the second uh... the second

[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.260]
report of what we don't have the money for the first let me say again let's find

[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:09.120]
a money into a right

[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:13.060]
yeah i felt like a dog chasing his tailer didn't forget to few seconds

[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:19.140]
there the money is there the money is there okay if we can find money if we can find

[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.200]
hundreds of millions of dollars to build empty arenas that nobody's going to

[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.840]
for ball games that we can certainly find a few billion dollars around the country

[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.300]
so that we can have the latest technology to get it right

[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:32.720]
so that instead of going through an embarrassment a disgrace like this

[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.900]
and have all these partisan political

[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.760]
frauds these dan judges with their black robes making political decisions in the

[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.620]
name of what is supposed to be interpreting the law instead of that let's get

[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.960]
it right and let's get rid of the infertile electoral college once and for

[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.880]
all and stop making excuses for because it's not acceptable

[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.220]
in fact that they'll be a great bumper figure states don't like president

[01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:01.060]
people do yeah what's wrong with that concept well

[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.400]
oh i forgot to turn american

[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:08.560]
here's for a lot of the whole new yes sir i want you to help me with my

[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:14.820]
thinking here okay i'll try i've often thought the supreme court was the

[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:20.960]
biggest weakness in our system because they're they're not elected they're

[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.740]
appointed by partisan presidents and they can take for life they pride for

[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:31.040]
life yes and they can take any case they want to make a reject in the

[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.960]
case they want and they're the ultimate authority yeah and so what we come

[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:42.140]
down to now is assistant like the Vatican has the the Pope points the bishops

[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:48.540]
and only the bishops can vote uh-huh that's a Vatican system yeah am I right

[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:51.700]
or wrong about that yeah well in fact i see some smoke coming out right now

[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:56.260]
look at that the smoke pouring out of the chimney five six seven oh five

[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:59.820]
sixty five of course we all know what's making the smoke over there in the

[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:04.840]
Vatican the pubs pubs down amen he gets the really good stuff the primo

[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.960]
stuff in fact even an answer to them somebody was telling me that this last time

[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.080]
I was over there they said that they'd have better grade weed but the Pope gets

[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.900]
it all imported the Vatican yeah they got a bunch of little else over there

[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.860]
wrapping it off shipping it off to the Vatican five six seven oh five sixty

[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:26.920]
pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line here's the call from

[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.120]
somewhere hello

[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:34.780]
Neil yes sir okay this is mobile candle here's a mobile candle hey you say your

[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:38.500]
board of the elections to have I think it's his circle just over the week and I

[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.980]
thought three things that really made me laugh number one you know that guy

[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:45.640]
Stewart Taylor who's the car is bonnet for time or newsweek or something he's really

[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.360]
good yeah first of all you got thousands of people saying the only way to really

[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:54.340]
results to count the votes Stewart Taylor saying that in um for our county and

[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:03.840]
the other county would find four votes right so that all right all right

[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.420]
secondly the miniherald the week ago said that if we counted all the over votes in

[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:13.240]
the state of Florida go or would win by twenty three thousand yeah but if we just

[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:18.240]
counted over votes under votes rather go or would also win then when the Florida

[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:22.780]
Supreme Court said we should actually have the vote on Saturday the hell comes

[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:28.780]
out the front page story Saturday yeah Bush saying Bush is going to win right so I

[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.020]
mean they're just for a baloney and then Sunday I need to press another

[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:37.200]
system so another funny moment on Sunday I need to press the first time ever

[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.280]
saw David boys speechless was when Tim Roberts said to him did you know that

[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:46.780]
when they stopped counting the votes that Bush had picked up about fifty votes in

[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:51.860]
the county forty three and he said there he said there like I hadn't heard that yeah

[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:56.580]
okay how can he not heard that russard had to tell him that three times yeah I was

[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:00.800]
totally dumbfounded yeah but if you remember I called last week and I said that

[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:06.440]
after they recount they county that door will only pick up 150 votes remember I was

[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.440]
counting that and then he said the reason being when they started when they started

[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.020]
recounting day county they started with the lowest number counties there's

[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:18.340]
no I'm not going to do a whole thing again please please I will only point I'm

[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:23.200]
going to please I won't say at the point I'm making is this when they start

[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:28.180]
recounting day county from this point on Bush's numbers are going to keep going

[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:32.220]
higher so for anybody that doesn't understand that you have to explain it then

[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:37.400]
okay okay no he said that the precinct numbers keep going to go higher and that they

[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:42.060]
still and it said I don't want to do I run a period no I want to say it's like that

[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:51.060]
no I mean he was right so what's the point so but I mean he was closing in other

[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:55.400]
places in voting five Republican counties were picked up like whatever was 58 votes

[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.060]
it was very very close and they still appear in square and they managed to

[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.920]
intimidate the audience parties and keep them from voting and disqualify them from

[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:10.120]
voting and get all those phony baloney ballot applications in there and they

[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.280]
still and this is what people can't deal with as they saw it still in front of

[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.700]
their eyes but it's too late now you can't get it back don't you understand it

[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:23.660]
was still and there are no laws they're going to let you get it back it's not going to

[01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:31.020]
happen or gee well it's way close maybe a few more of you had voted like the

[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:35.500]
poll we took one day last week I figured what the percentage was but certainly

[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:38.580]
enough of a percentage just from this audience if those people are going out

[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:41.300]
there and voted and they would have voted the same proportion that most of this

[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:44.180]
audience was for more than he would have won the guy damn election of course if they

[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:47.020]
could have got them counted but they probably would have thrown those out too

[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:55.100]
when they thrown them out yeah well it's a nice thought see this guy he wanted

[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.080]
to start I mean he's right he's got a very valid point he knows what he's talking

[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:01.860]
about but but the problem is he wanted to repeat the whole thing again just

[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:07.000]
now I tell you you're endurance out there must be either you're a lot more

[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.740]
bored than I am with life or your endurance must be your capacity for bull

[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.640]
crap must be far more than mine is because I just I can't deal with anymore but it's

[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:21.580]
ridiculous on the face of it it's ludicrous well if the chance fell off during

[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.940]
accounting then the under votes are going to be a different number they're going

[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:27.280]
to be fewer under votes here and what about when they go counting them back on

[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:31.140]
machine again to see if maybe they were real vote because if a vote if a

[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:35.320]
child fell off there must be there was a vote on there oh well we don't know

[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.840]
let's get that statistician on here again let's put him on in fact let's

[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:45.020]
put him up before the Supreme Court I guarantee he'd craft his pants can you

[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:48.460]
imagine them all running out he wants that smell all running out of the chamber

[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.840]
that guy he was like had his head on his chin on his hand he was like

[01:30:54.840 --> 01:31:01.040]
sweating and squaring him you know what I'm talking about the Democratic

the tubal matter yeah but uh... you know about the day county guy i think she

[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:38.360]
says smart uh... if he's trying to evaluate the bush would win with the

[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.460]
uh... under vote count and uh... what are they afraid of

[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:44.500]
no that that's not the point but he doesn't have a valid point that in

[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:45.520]
day county that the

[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.480]
only talking about finding six hundred votes that they were dreaming

[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.180]
yeah with a pipe dream well but then let's count

[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.460]
and at the chat falls off that it becomes what's called a lost vote

[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.100]
well yeah and

[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:58.160]
they anyway

[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.440]
that's a lot of the course call the last word great

[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:06.000]
like lost in space uh... and with with that bush not a given given bush a

[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.440]

he's more mean spirited in the previous time that i had a just uh...

[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.520]

well

[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:49.460]
She's swinging it.

[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.120]
That's our toll free number for the world.

[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:57.360]
Yeah, Tom Zick and I are stupid lettering

[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.580]
in the TV book of the Sunset on the Yesterday.

[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.700]
From somebody from Rochester, no less.

[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.980]
Some Hick from Rochester, who gives a song and an answer

[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:06.440]
about, oh, there used to be such interesting local talk

[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.300]
programs out there.

[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.380]
And he's been here eight months and scoured the dial

[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:10.440]
and can't find one.

[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:13.440]
So Tom's response is, well, that's because companies

[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.100]
like ClearChannel buy up all of your stations

[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:17.100]
and they put a bunch of canned, dedicated shows

[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.960]
on it, and so on.

[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.280]
Tom feels to realize that what those so-called

[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.480]
interesting talk programs went out with

[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.880]
Nickers and High Button Shoes.

[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:26.560]
That's where you fail to recognize Tom.

[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:29.900]
And I know there are people out there saying,

[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:31.400]
well, you know, Neil, if you would do like a more

[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.700]
like you used to do, a more serious intellectual show

[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.600]
that didn't have better colors.

[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:36.660]
I know why you'd do a more serious intellectual show.

[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.380]
That's not what I want.

[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.420]
I want to have a little bit of fun here on the radio

[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:43.060]
for our Zivane.

[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:45.180]
You give people a few labs, help them survive

[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:47.660]
through four hours in this God-for-second place,

[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:48.660]
and then I'm doing a service.

[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.460]
I'm doing a real public service then.

[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.360]
And so if we have to suffer over the fact

[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.700]
we got a lot of more on's out there.

[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.140]
We like to hear bodily sound.

[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:57.340]
That's just the way it goes.

[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.060]
Nothing I can do about it.

[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.640]
I listen to the colors on those other shows,

[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.940]
including George's girlfriend.

[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:03.980]
I listen to those colors.

[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.500]
Oh my God.

[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.680]
She's got the old people I was screaming about last week

[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:09.680]
that I didn't want to talk to.

[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.720]
Their grandparents are the ones that call her.

[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.760]
Oh my God.

[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.080]
I can't even get my thumb on it.

[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:18.360]
Hello Andy.

[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:21.420]
It's so right to this old thing in the jail.

[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:24.580]
Oh man.

[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.000]
Oh I still do respect her for telling the cops

[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.080]
people to blow it up their ass.

[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:30.520]
I'll never forget that.

[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:31.860]
Nice call, Andy.

[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:33.000]
That's right.

[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:34.560]
She had the big pair.

[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:36.420]
She had a big fat pair of balls

[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.940]
and she tore them to you

[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.680]
because she knew they were screwing her over.

[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:40.640]
And they were.

[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:44.520]
And she was one of the few people

[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:45.760]
I've ever encountered in this business

[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:47.660]
who just besides me

[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.480]
was talking to stick away the moon don't shine.

[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.200]
Have a nice day, Randy.

[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.440]
Here's a mobile in Weston, hello.

[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:56.760]
Neil.

[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:57.360]
Yes sir.

[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:58.300]
How you doing, man?

[01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:58.660]
OK.

[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:00.760]
I got an idea for you.

[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.660]
Why don't we have the next election

[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:04.620]
and have the candidates go up to the Supreme Court?

[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:05.940]
They can ask him about your questions

[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:07.320]
and they can decide for us.

[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:08.400]
That's a good idea.

[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:10.420]
And then we save all these money as well.

[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:11.220]
And I tell you one thing,

[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.460]
whichever one brings the good weed

[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:13.720]
to Clarence Thomas, that's the one

[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:14.340]
it's going to get in.

[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.160]
Make no mistake about that.

[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:15.420]
Oh!

[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.020]
And then that would be against the book.

[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:20.460]
5, 6, 7, 05, maybe that's what she's,

[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:21.960]
maybe she's smoking a little

[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.500]
in the back with Clarence too, huh?

[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:25.680]
Oh, I still think it's time

[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.720]
for what she's sucking on the person.

[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:30.980]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.700]
Here's a mobile in vocal, hello.

[01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:33.640]
Neil.

[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.200]
Yes sir.

[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:36.140]
I'm glad to hear you say you want to show

[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:38.080]
a full of laugh because if that's laugh,

[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.980]
I'd always stand for the most serious

[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:40.900]
intellectual issues.

[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.160]
Yeah.

[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.220]
2 points.

[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.260]
Number one, to get a question related for a moment, I think.

[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.060]
One of the issues that's doing the most time

[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:51.900]
to this country is the lack of term limits in Congress.

[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:53.780]
Because I think the founding fathers

[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:57.000]
intended for people to go to the Congress for two years,

[01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.300]
where there were doctors, lawyers,

[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.140]
barbers, even talk show hosts.

[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:02.600]
And then go home.

[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:03.380]
Yeah.

[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:06.400]
What we have now are these icons of power.

[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:09.940]
Career politics and building next to power

[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:10.580]
that is correct.

[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:11.520]
Right.

[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:12.200]
Corruption.

[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:12.760]
Empires.

[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:13.480]
Right.

[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:14.700]
Now, second point.

[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.020]
Just like college football coach,

[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:16.680]
you're same thing.

[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:17.620]
Team is in your house.

[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:18.100]
That's right.

[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:21.280]
Now, the flower water wouldn't

[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.280]
should be more tested by the flower water.

[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:26.460]
First, you found out that a new year's or a friend of yours

[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.620]
won 20, 30, 40, $50,000.

[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.960]
Instead of having these idiots in Colorhazze

[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.440]
spend hundreds of millions telling

[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:33.480]
this to buy the flower water.

[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:33.900]
Right.

[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:34.960]
Thank you.

[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.060]
And let me know when you win.

[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.180]
Thank you.

[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:38.540]
OK.

[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:38.940]
You're welcome.

[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:40.500]
Yeah.

[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.620]
Why can't we have a lot more winners

[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.380]
instead of people who all this pie in the sky?

[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.120]
Why don't we do that?

[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.580]
In fact, let's just have a lottery.

[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.980]
Let's have a special like that.

[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.720]
What do they call that powerball thing?

[01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:51.360]
Why can't we do that and raise the money

[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.060]
to have real voting machines with TouchCode?

[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.300]
She's the only one that's supervising there in Hillsboro

[01:38:58.300 --> 01:38:58.680]
County.

[01:38:59.040 --> 01:38:59.820]
I got to give her credit.

[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.920]
She said, this is the last time we're doing this.

[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.240]
We're going to be installing to the brand new technology

[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.920]
in the TouchCard, the new touch screens, and that's it.

[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.280]
And have real elections.

[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.480]
Now, for a bunch of those pickers up there in Tampa,

[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.180]
which is Hillsboro County, if they can do it,

[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:15.680]
then how come they'll be down here and start?

[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.080]
And I'm going to tell you a lot of reasons

[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:18.260]
that we can't do it down here.

[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:18.960]
Fuck, that was.

[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.840]
Because they got an asshole like David Leahy

[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.500]
is the supervisor of the commission's election supervisor

[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:24.100]
in Dade.

[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.500]
And you know what they say about him.

[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.120]
He's an asshole.

[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:28.820]
Did you see him up there in Colorhazze?

[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:29.460]
He was there.

[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:32.680]
And they were asking them different questions about they.

[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.220]
Where did the Dade votes were being analyzed?

[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.000]
They said, oh, well, I was in love to be involved in that.

[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.480]
I was, he was just standing around there,

[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.380]
pretending that he was somehow looking

[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:41.540]
up for our best interests.

[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.660]
Or as I was now, we'll say, inners.

[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:47.780]
This is the problem because you got in.

[01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:49.100]
Of course, who the hell wants to have?

[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:49.800]
Oh, look at this.

[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:51.860]
I just picked up my pen and the bug flew out of that guy

[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:52.300]
damn thing.

[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:54.960]
Jesus Christ.

[01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.660]
You know what I think these bugs came from?

[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.980]
When he brought me my paycheck this morning.

[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:04.200]
I think that yeah, from the Beasley Bank account.

[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.100]
This flew out of the envelope.

[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.160]
Yeah, they flew out of the envelope.

[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:07.620]
That's where they all came from.

[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:13.020]
5670560.560.

[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.980]
I don't want to say the Beasley's are cheaper,

[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:18.860]
but God, or that Greg Reid is full of crap, or that he's cheap.

[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:20.660]
Oh, thanks for the dollar for playing

[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:21.540]
parent-of-grag.

[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:22.320]
You prick.

[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.040]
9 minutes after noon at 560 WDQF.

[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.900]
The Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio 560.

[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:32.020]
These are not huge.

[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.920]
Thank you, George.

[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.780]
There's no need to fear.

[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.020]
The undervotes are here.

[01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:48.040]
Hey, Tensota, it's all the way from Poppy County.

[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:48.820]
It's from Beethoven.

[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:50.420]
Other hearing's underway.

[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:53.240]
Tensota, where once a recount of the answer,

[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:58.980]
Oh, what's the answer, oh, what's the answer, oh?

[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:00.480]
5 to G.

[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.040]
Oh, let it go.

[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:05.260]
The problem counts the ones that didn't.

[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.900]
The customers are coming.

[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:11.340]
Oh, what's the answer, oh?

[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.240]
So, I'm going to factor it on 560 WQF.

[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:15.460]
Did I mention about Terry Murray?

[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.260]
He's an asshole.

[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.260]
And that's stupid article David Ginny,

[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:18.860]
oh, he's another one.

[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:19.460]
He's an asshole.

[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:23.160]
Also, what a suck, much of suck clothes we got in this town.

[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.020]
That's what enables a lot of people like Terry Murray

[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:25.780]
to keep their jobs.

[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:28.840]
He won a long since have raised their hand and said,

[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:29.980]
should I be fired by now?

[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:33.400]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:33.680]
Hello.

[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:37.360]
Mobile in Miami.

[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.280]
Going runs.

[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:40.820]
Going twice.

[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:42.620]
And I was going to let that corner decide whether we should

[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.880]
cure the thing at 1230 or not.

[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:44.880]
But they're gone.

[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:46.940]
Here's a mobile in Stuart.

[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:47.220]
Hello.

[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:48.520]
Hi, Neil.

[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.760]
No, I read Linda Green has this morning.

[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:55.540]
She's the columnist that follows the court all year round.

[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:56.940]
Not just doing stuff like this.

[01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:57.220]
Yeah.

[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.920]
She made a really interesting point.

[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.360]
I think that nobody thought about.

[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:01.100]
Here it is.

[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:04.680]
If it goes five to four, it's exactly the way most people think

[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:05.060]
it will.

[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:08.800]
This will be the very, very first time in history where the Supreme

[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.740]
Court justice, who he's wearing in a new president, was directly

[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:15.340]
responsible, one-on-one, for putting him in there.

[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:18.200]
And behind him, he's going to have eight Supreme Court

[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:21.320]
justiceists who are absolutely in disagreement,

[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.100]
as to the way this thing should come out.

[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:27.400]
Further, the Supreme Court justice is going to be in effect,

[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.600]
helping the point all new conservatives to the court.

[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:34.700]
My virtue of his what he's doing today, if he goes that way.

[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.060]
Yeah.

[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.100]
That's kind of an industry point, actually, I think.

[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:37.560]
Yeah.

[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:39.080]
I'm a disgusting, but interesting.

[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:39.640]
Yeah.

[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.120]
Okay.

[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.160]
You're a lot of practice with that arm.

[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.160]
You know, that arm up in the air, that 45 degree angle practice makes perfect.

[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:47.580]
Yeah, you got it.

[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:47.880]
Okay.

[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:48.640]
Bye-bye.

[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.120]
See you, Kyle.

[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.040]
5670560.

[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.920]
Pound 567018T and Verizon Wireless Lines.

[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:55.760]
This is Galea, man.

[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:56.080]
Let's go.

[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.760]
What a, what a, oh, God.

[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:58.680]
He's an answer.

[01:42:58.900 --> 01:42:59.260]
Another one.

[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.340]
God, there's like an epidemic of this going around.

[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:03.640]
5670560.

[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:07.780]
Pound 567018T and Verizon Wireless Lines.

[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.600]
Here's a mobile-informed water deal.

[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:09.880]
Hello?

[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:11.320]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:11.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:12.840]
Good morning.

[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:13.280]
How you doing?

[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:13.860]
Okay.

[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:18.360]
Listen, I've heard you've sat there for 12 years.

[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.100]
And I'm watching a lot of people, having a lot of problems with depression.

[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:22.100]
I'm watching a lot of people calling people like Scalia and Rangwick were faster.

[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:27.180]
And I'm probably like most of our city audiences sit back and laugh so, yeah, that means sure.

[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:28.020]
It's a funny guy.

[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.780]
But I'm going to tell you something, afterwards, Leo put this opinion.

[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:37.820]
I mean, if I was aware of my steep, though, when I was driving down the road, I probably would ran to a lake.

[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:41.980]
you know i still can't believe what he's basically saying that all well

[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:45.640]
George w's gonna be in there no matter what the voters think or anybody else

[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:47.880]
they're not you're getting it

[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:53.220]
and he's sitting all of the time i get to get all well you know me also joking

[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:56.960]
as part of a strict or whatever it is but i really can't and and and and

[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.500]
and then on Sunday morning the uh... pocket heads are trying to rationalize

[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.520]
rank with my thing well he's the most conservative he might be uh...

[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:07.580]
he might be a swing header so i think that's a state right

[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.920]
and i'm saying that you know right now you can't get it down

[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.100]
okay and i'm gonna get something out

[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.160]
this is probably your time not mine

[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:20.920]
what was the rationalization of not all of any term limits for president

[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.320]
what was the rationalization for right what a congress

[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:29.460]
amended constitution thing that the of that there is no rationalization they

[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:32.020]
just want to and then we don't want an emperor

this last call up to a certain degree i agree with him

[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:35.640]
uh... the real problem is we don't have anybody of quality running for

[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.600]
president on either side but why not

[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:41.680]

with this is this is a selection

[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:03.400]
we'll be the drive the right now to get a lot of blame i blame the democratic

[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.880]
party and i blame the republican party that's why blame

[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:10.080]

[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.260]
the show the political hacks that they want to put up there so they can get

[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:16.420]

and the captain came on

[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:27.920]
and said it was a blown tire

[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:29.740]
that they could have told back in

[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:33.900]
they could have picked it but don't worry that they call the phantasmus just to be on the safe side

[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:35.780]
so now there's an engine blown

[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:41.800]

[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.240]
Washington they get to Vegas

[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:46.100]

[01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:50.100]
but they have ten hotel rooms for 180 people

[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:54.180]

[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:55.300]

greenberg trowel gun of other seven greenberg trowel there the attorneys for i

[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:42.400]

Washington office of Gibson Dunn and Croucher the firm representing bush in the supreme court argument he's not involved in the

[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.580]
case how do you like that uh... a little bit of a conflict

[01:53:55.500 --> 01:54:00.140]
but we shouldn't be worried about that because uh... that's the american way exactly

[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:04.120]
well i got that finger working quick and pretty impressed for an old jude

[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:08.740]
and he's been able to use how's that pull coming to the cheapest people in the world that's our poll today

[01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:12.800]
we're trying to take some polls to get you people away from this presidential craft to get you uh... geared

[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:16.600]
into like the new year in the holidays and feeling better about life instead of getting all the press

[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.600]
and mired in this crap of the media tell you ought to be mired in i'm sick of it

[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:24.820]
who the cheapest people in the world cubans jews are french Canadians

[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:28.700]
cubans only nineteen out of two hundred twenty six

[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:33.080]
jews sixty eight but french Canadians are hundred thirty nine

[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:39.020]
hands down baby you frauds we hate you french Canadians

[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:42.520]
now there may be some who are nice people i haven't met any

[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:45.560]
never met a nice french Canadian but yet

[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:49.320]
i've seen some proof of the never like a pleasant frog

[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:55.200]
now i'm trying to think so what we're going to do is we're going to have all our

[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:58.960]
french Canadians can line up on here out in the parking lot in a couple of days

[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:03.000]
we'll set it all up but it's just like in the ones that i think can stay they'll stay

[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.600]
right and the ones that believe bye bye we'll have you ever met a good looking

[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.840]
french Canadian now although i saw some good looking people in France

[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.120]
but that was not in Quebec

[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:17.320]

[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.540]
come like the chinese people how come line up on a going with

[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:26.900]
most seriously there's like how come the japanese people most of them uh... another city that's bad

[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:31.020]
that's the trouble thing to say but most of the japanese people i've seen are particularly uh...

[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:33.120]
grotesque looking in the chinese people are well

[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.800]

[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:44.140]
We're glad to meet you.

[02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:48.840]
I want to ask you something,

[02:03:48.840 --> 02:04:05.340]
and there's a lot of news about it in between

[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:16.920]
their sideburns on their a face, b legs, c, I think was rectum and d was, I don't know,

[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:25.820]
I'm not making that up. That was a real for sure. Now let me ask you how many people in this audience would like to get $300 for knowing that men grow sideburns on their face.

[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:32.580]
And this is the number one, two, three, four, and five shows in America for 300 bucks.

[02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:42.760]
People generally, I think the $500 question was people generally take a crap from their lecture where there were no, is there a radius is lip.

[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:52.600]
Oh my god, and you wonder what's wrong with this country, why we can't hold a real election for 300 bucks men generally go to their sideburns on their,

[02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:04.960]
probably before one is five 60, how they come over to all the audio tape there, look at that. They're erasing 55 seconds of it. Yeah, and there's David boys who said nice song.

[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:22.780]
But Neil Roger show sports radio five 60s. You a ham. If it's free, it's me. I believe poor as well as the rich women and men alike citizens of every race, create and color all are equal. They are equal. That is so long as all of their votes.

[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:33.380]
But choose me if the people do not in the end choose me, I would then commit to contest this inaccurate and incomplete count in order to ensure they choose me.

[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:42.140]
This is from America recount after recount God bless America. Amen 16 to one at five 60 David boys just said David boys. Yeah.

[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:51.700]
Five said look at this almost everybody's gone. You want to know why because they all ran off to here. They got the entapes on place. Well, they're not paying the patient. We're all screaming up there and they're booing him.

[02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:58.020]
Like there's more bugs flying around on the board here. They're booing the Republicans. They were. Well, that's enough.

[02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:05.320]
Let's go credit crowd out there. Well, that's okay. You boss will bully you. I'll bully you back like they said in Godfather. Huh? They hit us. We hit him back.

[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:15.400]
I don't want to hear them. Those assholes up there screaming carrying on like a not only that, but it's like a Monday in the middle of the day. Don't those people up there work? No, have a right. No.

[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:30.900]

see if shlopers and dollar beach

[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:20.920]
uh...

[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:22.740]
i want to be spent on something

[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:27.060]
uh... do you think that if the situation happened in any other state let's

[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:30.840]
say california texas new york with the situation with the votes

[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:35.700]
to be going to the same type of a nap what you spend on that i have them what's

[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.260]
my spade my spin

[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.740]
that that that that's because it didn't happen in the other state i don't know

[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.720]
the way that i see it would certainly it would certainly appear to me that the

[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:48.700]
other forty nine states have got their act together hell of a lot better

[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:50.620]
because we're not going through all of this

[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:54.200]
yeah i don't know because uh... you know it seems to me that every other

[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:58.200]
election has been you know such a landslide for the past couple of elections

[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:02.500]
yeah but but one or two little votes didn't make a difference but now uh...

[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:05.520]
you know with the situation was down to i don't know hundred and some of the

[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:09.080]
uh... this is where it didn't make a difference and the fact of the matter is

[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:12.640]
whether we're embarrassed about or not this is the place where we can't get it

[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:16.760]
done right no matter what it is i've always said that no matter what it is we don't

[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:19.120]
know how to do it right i guess you're right

[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:22.700]
back what so at least at least when i like everybody else

[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:25.840]
i have a great thing at least we stand out there in the middle

[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:28.940]
unlike everybody else that knows how to get their crap done right

[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:32.560]
that knows how to do auto inspection right and knows how to hold an election

[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:35.320]
right and a million other god damn things

[02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:38.840]

[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:53.480]
how they ever had the people working in that building on shared industry

[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:57.720]
these people like i told you before a bunch of slabs

[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:01.300]
Greg read in the beesleaves they don't give a crap if we were if all the people

[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:04.160]

[02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:26.540]
uh

[02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:34.100]
this is then rather reporting for the cbscb news cbs orcs can now confirm

[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:41.040]
that a man charged with counting ballots has been caught eating chats

[02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:46.360]

[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:51.500]
psychiatric evaluation more details tonight of the cbs

[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:56.320]
evening news but now this is then rather reported

[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:18.920]
uh

[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:36.780]

[02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:44.940]
Oh here he comes, watch his content you've ever heard.

[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:48.540]
Oh here he comes, he's a shadowy girl.

[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:54.800]
Oh here he comes, man the sky is once the top.

[02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:58.940]
Oh here he comes, he's a shadowy girl.

[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:03.180]
The test phase where the standards should be lower, we've listed earlier in the process

[02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:04.280]
that's thrown out the window.

[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:06.180]
Yeah, throw this, throw him out the window.

[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:11.340]
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T line, it's a big one and two out, we've got to hang from

[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:16.000]
Shulas at two, Monday night football tonight, after Kimberville camperer of also from Shulas.

[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:20.680]
All right, there's much of stuff going on, let's go to a mobile and as a matter of fact,

[02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:24.400]
just one more note on the Panthers, we do have the 2000s reallocestr game, we'll see some

[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:25.320]
real players in here then.

[02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:27.640]
But I'm looking at the schedule, Terry.

[02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:31.940]
I'm looking at the schedule for the next foreseeable futures matter of fact.

[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:37.380]
And the only game that I see that they may have a chance to win is on the 29th of the month

[02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:40.160]
against Baldwin Boston's in town, maybe.

[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.320]
But between then and now you've got 3, 6, 7, 8 other games, I don't think they have a

[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:47.240]
China man chance of winning any one of those games.

[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:48.880]
I could be wrong but we'll see.

[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:51.840]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello.

[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:53.720]
Hello, Neil?

[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:54.280]
Yes sir.

[02:20:55.220 --> 02:21:00.620]
I wanted to express myself, I think that the reason that

[02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:06.800]
Coral lost the election is not because of Lieberman, I think it's because of what happened with

[02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:07.900]
Iliant.

[02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:10.620]
Yeah.

[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:17.020]
I think if somehow he would have pushed for Iliant to stay.

[02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:17.660]
He did.

[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:23.080]
He did, he said that he thought it should be settled in family core, he was going, he

[02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:26.020]
separated himself and Clinton and didn't do him a bit ago, didn't get him one vote.

[02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:27.560]
So you're absolutely positively.

[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:32.600]
I hate to break the news to one dimensional people like you sir but the world, it doesn't

[02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:36.700]
revolve around Iliant or around the causes of the green tooth or tubents down there in

[02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:37.120]
Little Havana.

[02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:38.740]
That's not what the world hinges on.

[02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:40.560]
Sir, I hate to break that news to you.

[02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:43.160]
If Coral had been part of the human chain, they still would have voted him.

[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:44.520]
The human chain, she.

[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:45.880]
Get it right, the human chain.

[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:51.620]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10, now maybe if Lieberman would have been down there wearing the

[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:53.820]
a schmoth on his head instead of a Spencer.

[02:21:57.140 --> 02:22:01.900]
If he would have been the one and he went to wearing a mosses tombstone there and was

[02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:04.260]
hawking a china and sucking up to that to any good.

[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:05.880]
No, no.

[02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:12.680]
The fact is that those people down there are politically incorrect and always will be.

[02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:14.200]
Don't confuse them with the facts.

[02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:20.380]
And if the coast guard just were to use the little less mace, here's a mobile and Fort

[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:20.760]
Waterdale.

[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:21.080]
Hello.

[02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:22.580]
They'll never leave it alone.

[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:25.180]
No, just can't the stop of the alien.

[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:25.920]
Never.

[02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:28.160]
Anyway, let me ask you this.

[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:32.800]
Every single day isn't sometimes the cross you might at least once a day that you hope

[02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:34.380]
that alien is enjoying a happy meal.

[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:35.240]
Absolutely.

[02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:37.780]
But every time you say that it makes me laugh my butt off.

[02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:41.720]
Anyway, I was almost at a point of apathy with this whole lecture thing.

[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:47.500]
But last night MSNBC played a biography on George W.

[02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:09.720]

[02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:40.680]
I think we got it again because we got Scalia and we got always fascist on our side. I just had some kind of an inspiration in this to me. I think that they're going to get either a Kennedy or a Conner. All he knew is one. That's her in around five before the other way. I think they're going to be counting again. Huh? I think you can count on it. Well, I don't know. It just I could be wrong. I say it's good with it. 5.67.0560.

[02:29:41.460 --> 02:30:10.580]
What about those sideburns, Regis? Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello? Yes? How are you doing today? Okay. Can we go home again? Let's go to Hollywood. Hello? Hollywood? Hello? Yes, I am. Neil, just calling to tell you about a great side. I saw coming home from vacation on the Palm Beach, County Line and 27. Uh-huh. Gorkham Wind. Oh, Jay did.

[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:40.500]
Okay, great. Okay. Now they're good and good now. Okay. We got two of these left and then we'll start getting that Christmas music on. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello? Hey, how's it going? All right. All right. I'll tell you all what I'm saying. I just came back from that ugly game. It's really sick. But the people out there really get this political thing. I'll tell you right now. Who gives a crap anymore? Really? That's what I say. I just want to keep in touch with you. You know, it's nice.

[02:30:41.780 --> 02:31:10.400]
I'm glad to be back in Miami. Okay. I'm glad to be back in Miami. Well, that's a lot about your life. Okay. Thank you. Five things. Oh, well, two calls left at the board. Look at that because they're all listening to these audio things. They want to hear this. I don't think it's critical. That stuff. I don't either. Five six seven or five sixty pound five sixty. We just don't have enough people still listening to make it to you at a one o'clock. So I have to play music because I'm not going to sit here and pontificate. I'm not going to do that. They just don't care enough to send

[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:39.380]
their very best. They have no material at all. But I think they're going to be counting again. Starting tomorrow. I have that feeling. I could be wrong. Been wrong many, many, many times before just like showing up this morning. I was payday. Here's South Miami. Hello. There's a pack of the coach. Yeah. Great. Okay. That's it. I take care of it. See one thing I noticed. Of course, a lot of these little part of the backers out there on the phone. I mean, that that that goes with the territory. But one thing I've noticed in watching the TV coverage.

[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:46.180]
Is that the least they're consistent. You know, it's like when Barbara Boxer was up there trying to speak on Saturday in

[02:31:46.180 --> 02:31:52.620]
telehancey and the public and we're shouting her down and screaming in the own. And yet when this Jack asked for

[02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:58.200]
Montana's up there, Mr. Republican, the secretary of the fence doesn't happen the other way around.

[02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:08.500]
Mean spirit hostile, which at least is actually refreshing what their party has become. Mean spirit and hostile and hateful.

[02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:17.680]
So at least thanks for packaging it honestly anyway. Conservative. What is the compassion that hate? Is that what it's all about? Yeah.

[02:32:18.740 --> 02:32:29.320]
Here's a mobile and popular beach. Hello. How you doing? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Just call it. Let's you know. While I did vote for George Bush, I must say one thing that was happening.

[02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:45.180]
No, it goes beyond who should be the president. It's really matter counting all the votes. And you know, well, I did vote for Bush. I do believe there should be a recount a complete manual recount. How in the state of Florida just wanted to let you know that. Okay. Have a good day. Thanks.

[02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:59.000]
Complete manual recount. How they're going to do that? Are they really going to be able to do that? No, but whatever, you know, whatever. Just keep counting. Accounting account until they come up with some number. That's a Supreme Court likes to grow likes to bush like that James Baker likes that I like.

[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:28.980]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi there. Yes, sir. Don't just don't give up caring. Got to know what comments I got to say when everyone stopped saying they don't care anymore. That's when the problems really started. I don't care. I couldn't give a crap lesson this point. I'm sick of it. Well, I agree. It's sickening. I really do. But don't stop caring. I know sir. Let me say it again. I don't care. You've got you've got two terrible candidates. You've got two. Two. Three. Two. Three.

[02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:57.080]
You've got two parties with what they're country down. And I don't care. It's not worth it. There is never going to be a way to get an active account. I said that weeks ago. We'll never know who will you, how many votes you really had in this state? Agreed. But don't stop caring. Okay. Say it again. You can keep saying it from now until health reasons over. I don't care. In fact, the more you say it, I don't care. In fact, let me put it to you very clearly, sir. So maybe that you will care all the way down it. If I can get the damn thing up in here. I don't give a sh** anymore. There you go. Thanks. Thanks, Chris.

[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:07.380]
He just doesn't want to accept it. He thinks that if he says it's 63,000 times, I'm still going to care. I don't give a flying crap. How do you like that? Right.

[02:34:10.060 --> 02:34:24.720]
So it's, you know what fight? It's like company dumpy. Call off the wall. And you could stay in around and argue from now until health was over. How to put it back together? We can't do it. To say what this election. We screwed it up.

[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:41.160]
We don't know how to do an election right here in a state of Florida. It's irreparably harmed. There was no way to put it back together in a way that will really ever have the honest accurate picture. I don't give a crap how many recounts they do now? It's beyond that point. You can't do it. What an embarrassment. What a joke.

[02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:53.440]
And yet you people refuse to accept that because you're so damn obsessed with your partisanship. You refuse to see the whole goddamn jet before it's going to trees. That's the problem.

[02:34:55.200 --> 02:35:11.740]
It's a mess. It's a typical for the God, then mother f in mess is what it is. And you think by getting a bunch of silly old people sitting around holding a punch cards up and looking for looking for the light blinded by the light. Whatever the hell they're doing. You think we're going to figure it out. Right.

[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:23.420]
Here's Palm Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I have a few points that you have the time and patience for me. Number one. In listening to the callers.

[02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:39.340]
From Miami, the Cuban Americans, I guess, they're five six seven O five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. The callers from Miami, the Cuban American. Sir, take your goddamn bigotry and stick it way inside your back.

[02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:49.100]
You blew nose jackass up there and Palm Beach and I hate to break the news here. We got two busloads of the scratches that are going over the Palm Beach today, whether you like it or not.

[02:35:49.260 --> 02:36:01.440]
How do you like that? Just a piss you off. And there and some of them are from Cuba just just just to add salt in your room. How do you like that? You bigoted piece of crap. You have not just scumbag.

[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:08.940]
And you are the ones up there. Open must down here. It seems to me that you are the ones up there and Palm Beach. You're the ones that didn't know how to vote.

[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:25.680]
All you lose five six seven O five 60. Why do you keep a vinyl of that on that line? Topless. Forget about it. Here's a lady mobile in Palm Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am.

[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:55.080]
Hi. Hey, first of all, I have to tell you you're lucky to have an apartment in Amsterdam. My husband and I go there every September. We love it. Yes, I can. And by the way, my husband's European. I have to tell all those people out there that think that we're not so over here. But Europeans think George Bush sucks. Yeah. They don't want them in there. Well, we know that. But the Europeans are better educated than Americans. So what does that say? Exactly. Exactly.

[02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:16.300]
But also this is doing one thing. It's, you know, in two years, the Republicans are going to be out of there. So it's unified everybody else. And you're your comment about the people that vote for Bush cracks me up to about the Bible, something, people, love and.

[02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:30.400]
Drop drive in whatever those people that voted for Bush, they're either retards or I don't know what I don't know what they're thinking. Well, you heard all calls today. So you know, give me a good idea. What's out there?

[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:58.840]
And then my husband too, since his European, he's like, what's the deal with the people that are voting for Bush? You know, these these insects, victims in Appalachia or whatever, you know, all the retards, all the uneducated hillbillies are voting for Bush. And all the people in the rest of the United States that are a little bit tolerant and a little bit educated voted for goers. I would be embarrassed to say I was a Republican. I'd be embarrassed as I was American. Exactly.

[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:17.900]
Okay, see in the dam rack. Thanks. Bye, bye. See you on the trim. 5 6 7 0 5 13 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 8 mean spirited hostile bigoted. That's what the Republican party has become. And those of you who are probably a part of that, take a look. That's all I can say. We'll break it toast to you.

[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:27.900]
Just like that we're doing at the Rachstag. Oh, I just love the way that sounds. Don't you? Love it. Like the Kaiser.

[02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:45.460]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. I just wanted to say I voted for goer, but since I've come to think that either of the vast presidential nominate, would make a better president than either of the presidential campus.

[02:38:46.540 --> 02:39:05.880]
Go ahead, meet as a wisdom or courage to use what I said, such available in this campaign. And you have to be sure. I mean, he would have to be sure that Grant, but it's quite like campaign for and with him that he felt he needed to prove it, but his own.

[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:33.900]
Yeah, well, he didn't want to hear anymore. Those bubble mice. These five six seven oh five 50 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi, Neil. Long time first time. Okay. Are you aware of a situation where we could actually have. Bush and Lieberman. Not going to happen, sir. Yeah, it's been discussed. It's old news. Not going to. It is. Yeah.

[02:39:34.320 --> 02:40:03.780]
Well, I just was wearing there. What can I can I call you think how you think James Baker would like that? Bush would Lieberman sit in there with a smart on his head. He'd probably still wear one on a callus and the pay us in the whole deal. This to piss those are going off. No, you can't. Sir five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 this. I'll tell you this much of cause we've had today. This should tell you anybody here. It was in town from out of town. If you're listening to show believe me may think it's pretty painful, but this is what Florida is all about. You're hearing it.

[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:33.880]
This is exactly the reflection this program as you'll ever get to what the state of Florida is all about. Our middle name is. That's why we don't know how to hold on. Right. Here's a mobile and pepper pine. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Long time first time. People saying and clean yourself on this point in this, but saying that you don't care. I don't care how disappointed anybody is I'm just giving you my honest opinion. Now if it'll make you have.

[02:40:33.900 --> 02:41:02.520]
Happy all gee. What are we going to do? I'll get all worked up. I don't care. I make a point. The Supreme Court is why I care. If you take a look at the makeup of the Supreme Court. It's horrible. I mean it's all one sided basically three of the Supreme Court nominees are Reaganites, but the one that really, really bothers me is the long hand of the old man Bush with the deciding vote clearance.

[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:14.060]
That really disturbs me. That's number one. Number two could get this in is that I think it's a perfect court. We live in a police state anyway. So what difference is it made?

[02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:26.840]
Well, okay. Also, Mr. Scalia, the renowned supposedly the intellect makes this statement. The counting of votes doesn't miss us when he shut down the voting.

[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:37.720]
He said the counting of votes in my opinion threatens your parable harm to the petitioner, which is Mr. Bush. You know why he causes your repairable harm?

[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:45.120]
Because he'd lose the God darn election if he allows the reek counting. That's like an admission that if we count all of votes, yeah.

[02:41:48.280 --> 02:42:05.520]
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And like I said, I don't give a crap. The 567 or 560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lines. See, all of you people with no life request.

[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:13.500]
This is just Florida is famous for people with no life. That's a motto down here. So if you want to get yourself all whipped up into some kind of an apoplectic frenzy, be my guest.

[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:21.100]
But you can only keep squeezing it so wrong that you have to find something else to squeeze. Trust me. Believe me. Even Bob Dolan knows that.

[02:42:22.860 --> 02:42:31.800]
26 after 1 at 560 WQIM. Do you know what he just said? Truth. That must have been clearance Thomas there. He said, are you two living again?

[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:37.740]
The Neil Roger show sports radio 560. QA.

[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:15.140]
We can't find you. She is just disappeared. We're looking all over. And it's still a hit. Hey, Georgie, junior.

[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:11.460]
Georgie, junior is a pizza.

[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:26.860]
We're going to have a big barbecue. Stop resisting already. Yeah, but we're making a lot tougher than expected. And they don't be liking that. 560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:33.080]
Here's a mobile in cool. Hello. Mobile in cool.

[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:46.660]
Going once going twice. Hello, yes, sir. Yeah, I'm here. And I'm here. Hey, I'm here. And I'm here.

[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:59.440]
And your radio is up in the back. Turn that radio on. What we got here is we got to get the get push and go to drop down and drop down.

[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:03.840]
Drop the clip of coin for the other two. All right, but. Bye. Okay, bye. Bye.

[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:11.780]
Cluiston. Ever been in Cluiston? Ever doing two there? I have not. I have to believe me. Go real fast.

[02:45:13.460 --> 02:45:21.840]
560.560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:32.080]
Okay, here's a mobile in the sea. Bring hello. How you doing? Okay. It's first time I'm a listener and the first time color.

[02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:48.480]
I live in Jacksonville. I was just visiting the area. I'm so sorry. Well, yeah, I'm just wondering what are they doing the election people in this area to prevent all the idiots from messing up the election next time?

[02:45:48.480 --> 02:46:03.960]
What do you mean in this area? You had 28,000 votes to route in DuVolk County. Well, they were under votes. No, under under votes and over votes 29,000. Well, I'm afraid it wasn't a bunch of blue hairs running out talking about voted by Mr. Volk.

[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:33.280]
Who was it? You had 5,000 under votes. But they had a total of 29,000, which means you had 24,000 people voted for more than one. Well, I mean, that's a mistake. But what do you mean that's a mistake? That's a mistake. 24,000? I understand what you're saying. But nobody is crying the blues in DuVolk County. Sure they are. Like they were crying the blues, like the blue hairs with crying the blue hair.

[02:46:33.280 --> 02:47:02.780]
Yeah, down here. So what's your point? What are you trying to say? The people in Palm Beach are dumb, aren't there people in DuVolk? Palm Beach, Broward and man. No, we didn't have the problem in Broward. Broward wrapped it all up in no time at all. Once they started counting, they wrapped that whole thing up in a bottle of wax. So here you go. Well, don't come back again now. You hear 5,670, 560, Palm 560 on the 18. Nothing worse than some cracker from DuVolk County coming down here and giving this election when they had 28 or 29,000 over votes and under votes and under pants.

[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:10.320]
Just head back up the Hershey Highway, Palin. They'll come back anytime soon. Here's Carl Gable, so.

[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:19.680]
Oh, that was a refreshing thought. I just want to have you take on the election. I voted Democrat and...

[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:26.980]
You want to have my take on the election? Yes. What does that mean? I just want to ask you a question regarding if things have been different.

[02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:34.480]
We know that Nader was a big part of the... He was one of the chiggers in the wood pile, right?

[02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:48.920]
Now, my premise is, what would have happened if Gore had selected Hearty Duty in the South? He would have won.

[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:53.100]
That's what I mean. Buffalo Bob Smith, Rest in Peace, he would have won.

[02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:55.080]
Why, why, why did he, I mean, I...

[02:47:55.080 --> 02:48:00.760]
Because he's a stupid man, because he's got bad advisors, because he won a crappy campaign, sir.

[02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:04.100]
And thank you for reminding us of that again. It's true.

[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:11.700]
Eight years of great prosperity, record unemployment, all these good things going on. People having a great time of things.

[02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:17.460]
And we have to be counting votes and chads and who scraped the ballot and who scraped the...

[02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:25.240]
And Scalia, to try to get in there? Sure, it's easy to despise James Baker and these right winged far-bison bush people.

[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:29.740]
But the fact of the matter is, the Democratic Party, it was theirs to lose and he lost it.

[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:38.200]
He flushed it right down the toilet, pick in Julie Bremen, running a crappy campaign, not parade in bubble-round air,

[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:43.300]
and at least in Arkansas, Tennessee, where he only lost by 3% in both states.

[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:50.480]
But to try to get anybody to be the least bit objective about this is almost impossible.

[02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:56.720]
You have all these hysterically partisan people as if either party is so great, or as if either candidate is so great.

[02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:05.600]
And I'm going to say it for the umpteenth time. It's just a question of which one is the least dangerous,

[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:12.220]
which is a hell of a sad thing to have to say when you're talking about picking a president and picking which political parties that have no good least damage to you.

[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:15.540]
Here's Kate Kuhl, hello.

[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:17.280]
Good afternoon, Neil. How are you?

[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:17.840]
Okay, sir.

[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:24.080]
Listen, I was listening earlier this morning and I voted for Gorg, but that's not what I was going to talk about, Neil.

[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:30.720]
Here's what we're good at in Florida. We're good at giving $126 tickets for doing two miles over the limit.

[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:38.520]
We're just coming in your backyard, cutting down your citrus tree. We're going to give a 90-year-old driver's license to the mail.

[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:42.100]
Right. He's on. You're on a roll. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it.

[02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:48.880]
What other thing? I have a Republican friend of mine. I said, well, what'd you do this weekend? He says, well, I went to the gun show.

[02:49:50.140 --> 02:49:51.540]
Thanks, Neil. I'll get one.

[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:58.220]
5.67.05.60.0.5.60 on it. And don't forget the early bread dinners. We're going to throw those two at least.

[02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:03.580]
We used to be before the old people put all those places out of business like pumper-nicks by stealing the silverware in the sweeten-low.

[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:08.280]
And stuff on all those pickles in their goddamn bag and their sack.

[02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:15.800]
I hope you have good aim, some of your old folks out there. I hope you don't stuff the pickles in the wrong bag because, oh, man.

[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:19.960]
They rinse right off. Oh, god. Nothing worse than a brown deal.

[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:28.020]
5.6.705.60.0.5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:50:28.180 --> 02:50:30.620]
I think your Lieberman said that makes it uncoachier if you do that.

[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:34.740]
I'll depend on who's best is in the bag, I guess.

[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:40.440]
He wants me to sing God Bless in the Archaean paste decent of G-string up here. I'll do it.

[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:42.820]
All right.

[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:47.820]
This is the year that I'm going to get smart, yeah.

[02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:56.200]
The holiday friends he has already started.

[02:50:58.220 --> 02:51:08.060]
I think you're ever going to see my face in the crowd pushing in the shoving. Don't think so pound.

[02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:14.540]
Not on your lie. It's a quality of snowstorm.

[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:22.480]
That's when my computer on a seaborn of the lazy ass weighing shopped my life.

[02:51:25.060 --> 02:51:29.560]
Not on your lie. Well, I'm buzzing this neighborhood.

[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:38.240]
I don't have to hit a phone, Lieber. I can click a mouse and hear the sign.

[02:51:39.500 --> 02:51:42.120]
So not on your sign.

[02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:43.960]
141.5.60.00.

[02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:48.600]
Neil, we're pretty disappointed in you. We expected you to come on and be waving a banner and I'll

[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:53.120]
piss off about the Supreme Court thing and this Antonin Scalia and his fascist will guess what, too bad.

[02:51:54.860 --> 02:51:58.440]
There are a lot of things in life you can fake, scored, scored, but this ain't one of them.

[02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:03.100]
I just don't care. I'm sick of it. I'm tired. I'm inundated with it already. It's terminal.

[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:10.400]
It's time to end it. It's time to move on with important things as soon as we find out what those are like vacations.

[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:13.180]
Here's a mobile and candle. Hello.

[02:52:13.940 --> 02:52:15.120]
Hey, Neil. Good afternoon.

[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:15.760]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:16.200]
Thank you, Michael.

[02:52:16.580 --> 02:52:17.100]
Thank you.

[02:52:17.180 --> 02:52:17.180]

[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:23.760]
I voted for Bush, but you know what? At this point in the election, if I was Bush running for president,

[02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:32.860]
I'd just go ahead and give it to Gore because it was such a close call and the board voting was so screwed up,

[02:52:32.860 --> 02:52:39.640]
I wouldn't feel confident sitting there as president. Either I'd win it by landslide or I'd just give it up and you know,

[02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:40.660]
look like the better man.

[02:52:41.060 --> 02:52:41.140]
Yeah.

[02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:42.460]
And just call it a day.

[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:44.380]
They both look desperate to me.

[02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:51.620]
But you know, it's funny because just think about the other states that have screwed up in the ballot thing,

[02:52:51.940 --> 02:52:56.740]
but maybe only Florida was brought to light. And how many years this has been going on, you know?

[02:52:58.020 --> 02:53:02.920]
But I think the machine is the best way to do it because the machine is not biased.

[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:03.640]
Machine?

[02:53:03.860 --> 02:53:05.600]
I don't feel a computer man. Computer.

[02:53:06.140 --> 02:53:12.540]
You're close to polls at a certain time, seven o'clock eight o'clock. You press a button that automatically locks out anybody

[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:17.100]
from voting who wasn't in line in time to vote. And then here's the totals and that's it. And then we move on.

[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:17.620]
Yeah.

[02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:20.840]
May have been fun for Dan Radler and Tom Broke, but too bad.

[02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:25.840]
And Neil, what about if they just mix Florida and count all the other states for president?

[02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:28.560]
Well, the other states are not going to let that happen. You can butchering.

[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:29.740]
But why do you think they're so frantic?

[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:37.720]
Hey, one more thing, Neil. I'm looking up with a T.S. for the first time today and I'm looking forward to it. That's always been a fantasy of mine.

[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:37.960]

[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:38.660]
With a what?

[02:53:39.220 --> 02:53:44.060]
A T.S. A transsexual. I don't know if you've ever been with one, but I'm going to give that a shot today.

[02:53:44.220 --> 02:53:45.120]
I've always wanted to try out a little bit of a shot.

[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:46.820]
Okay, give it a shot pal. Good luck here.

[02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:48.020]
Squared, squared. Give it a shot.

[02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:53.660]
With a transsexual. I see I never understood that. But then again, there's some people who are so desperate.

[02:53:57.040 --> 02:53:59.920]
56670560. CTS to me always meant something else like tough.

[02:54:00.840 --> 02:54:01.160]
Crap.

[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:04.320]
Here's a mobile-infoil-moder-dale. Hello.

[02:54:07.500 --> 02:54:08.880]
Mobile-infoil-moder-dale.

[02:54:08.980 --> 02:54:10.200]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:14.280]
Hey, I just wanted to know what do you think about.

[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.260]
I was kind of disappointed. I'm worried for Gore.

[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:17.720]
Yeah.

[02:54:18.060 --> 02:54:25.660]
But he never seemed to address any of the issues and like you didn't want to attack Bush or he was scared to say anything.

[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:30.160]
That's right. He pushed he footed around, man. He pushed he footed around. He dropped the ball. You got it.

[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:34.580]
Exactly. For me, it's like he blew the whole election. I mean, he sat up there and said he's not angry.

[02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:37.580]
I mean, you have all these people behind you who was angry as hell.

[02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:41.960]
And don't forget the way you leave him and push he footed around as the bait would chain you there.

[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:44.060]
I mean, it made him seem like a good guy. That was pathetic.

[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:45.060]
Exactly.

[02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:52.560]
And one question I have for you is, what do you think the GOP has so much as they want to implement that they're willing to...

[02:54:52.560 --> 02:55:00.040]
I mean, like you said, it's clear as they that the basically Bush is saying, hey, I know I lost the election.

[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:02.720]
Let's not do the recount, you know, because I lost.

[02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:07.720]
So what do you think is they have a bit of sleep so much that they're willing to even go on the White House.

[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:10.920]
What do you mean by that? They had to take it away from eight years ago. They wanted back.

[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:15.000]
It's like if somebody came along and took away your best, you know, poach easy game or whatever.

[02:55:15.300 --> 02:55:19.060]
Or somebody at Gildo, they wanted back. They want to play with it for a while. Right?

[02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:21.000]
Just like when Roy came in here, remember that?

[02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:21.380]
Roy!

[02:55:21.700 --> 02:55:24.580]
So that big black Gildo and then Scorant said, I wanted back?

[02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:28.580]
Five. But we haven't seen her in a cruise age, you know what?

[02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:30.380]
Wow, no wonder I haven't said she good mood.

[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:34.480]
I'll be sure and say hi to her for me though, not the QM Christmas party.

[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.440]
Yeah, give her a big kiss on the lip.

[02:55:37.540 --> 02:55:37.940]
Which one?

[02:55:38.140 --> 02:55:41.580]
Not everyone you like, although, bang, you must have a stronger stomach than I do.

[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:44.980]
Five, six seven, oh five, six, the pound, five, six, the only thing.

[02:55:45.060 --> 02:55:47.920]
And all the other people I don't speak to around here, like the water, not tea.

[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:50.060]
And how many of... And of course, you're a good friend, Gile Sarner.

[02:55:50.460 --> 02:55:50.860]
My best friend.

[02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:52.160]
You're a best friend, Gile Sarner.

[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:53.280]
You're saving me a spot.

[02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:55.860]
Now let me ask you, is the food gonna be kosher with the Christmas party tonight?

[02:55:57.620 --> 02:55:59.360]
Where is the Christmas party? Where is the Dorena?

[02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:02.880]
It's gonna be at the Capricios, restaurant, I guess.

[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:04.360]
Yeah.

[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:07.700]
Now you're starting to sound as Goyation's Diffo.

[02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:08.640]
By intent.

[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:10.740]
Where's Dorena? I know. Don't get paranoid.

[02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:13.640]
So that's not gonna be kosher. How can you eat there?

[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:14.580]
That's free.

[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:17.120]
It's just a free super-seed kosher.

[02:56:17.180 --> 02:56:20.960]
Also now we get back to Alpolvoli, who's the cheapest Gary Sarner.

[02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:23.720]
We shouldn't put his name on there too, as opposed to the other Jews.

[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:27.400]
Who has the cheapest people? The French Canadians, how many two?

[02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:29.740]
Jews, 102, and the Cubans only 23.

[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:31.140]
The Cubans didn't belong on it.

[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:32.580]
Let's Cubans aren't known for being cheap.

[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:34.020]
But you just had that one bad side.

[02:56:34.340 --> 02:56:34.800]
Yeah, that's true.

[02:56:35.140 --> 02:56:37.940]
So I figured I'd put it on there, because I give the Cubans a chance to, you know,

[02:56:38.020 --> 02:56:39.800]
get some of their venom out of their system.

[02:56:41.140 --> 02:56:44.360]
Nothing worse than having too much venom, venom, venom, venom.

[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:47.100]
That's what our friends at Intel...

[02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:49.180]
Oh, buy some Intel, by the way. I bought a bunch of that.

[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:51.960]
Just when everybody was saying, oh, look at that.

[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:54.320]
Neobot, Motorola, and Intel, this one they both had warnings.

[02:56:54.520 --> 02:56:55.880]
You know what? They're both doing great.

[02:56:55.980 --> 02:56:58.380]
Oh, so with both hands...

[02:56:58.380 --> 02:56:59.140]
Bye, bye, bye!

[02:56:59.460 --> 02:57:02.700]
What's the market doing? The Dow is only 17 up, but most of us don't care about the Dow.

[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:07.240]
We care about that tech-dreck, which is an XX-UP 75 points right now, as I speak.

[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:11.060]
And after this announcement comes out in a few hours, after Bush gets in there,

[02:57:11.260 --> 02:57:13.020]
the market's going to go soaring through the top.

[02:57:14.100 --> 02:57:17.820]
Because all the pharmaceutical companies and all the people that are polluting the environment,

[02:57:18.100 --> 02:57:21.180]
the oil companies, all the great-wavours, they want Bush. Big time.

[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:24.280]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:26.120]
Hey, Neel. Yes, sir.

[02:57:26.260 --> 02:57:29.360]
First of all, I just want you to pass them DJ that we do have.

[02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:30.020]
DJ, yeah.

[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:30.780]
To hell with them.

[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:32.020]
And...

[02:57:32.020 --> 02:57:33.480]
Yeah, the hell were that kids' groovy, right?

[02:57:35.260 --> 02:57:38.760]
And I hope they're ready for when this Hitler guy comes in,

[02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:41.420]
because he's going to spend over and do them in the butt.

[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:42.060]
Yeah.

[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:45.880]
All right, you saw that thing in 60 minutes when there were an interview in Gour.

[02:57:46.580 --> 02:57:46.940]
Yeah.

[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:49.700]
And how that lady was trying to rip a hole in Gour.

[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:52.320]
She seemed like Gour was a bit...

[02:57:52.820 --> 02:57:53.720]
I guess it was a criminal.

[02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:54.820]
I didn't know that.

[02:57:55.280 --> 02:57:55.940]
Just go on.

[02:57:56.320 --> 02:57:58.240]
Just go on and back out and pack this at Gour.

[02:57:58.500 --> 02:57:59.140]
We'll figure it out.

[02:57:59.900 --> 02:58:01.080]
And one more thing, sir.

[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:01.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:05.520]
Did George go ahead and fill you in when you were on vacation?

[02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:08.460]
He talked something about some guy that came over his house.

[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:09.880]
But thanks, Jimmy.

[02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:11.540]
Some drug dealer?

[02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:14.100]
No, some other guy came over his house.

[02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:15.940]
He came over his house, but thanks, Jimmy.

[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:16.340]
Yeah.

[02:58:16.780 --> 02:58:17.560]
I was on the ground.

[02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:18.620]
Okay.

[02:58:18.860 --> 02:58:19.460]
All right.

[02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:19.860]
Thanks.

[02:58:20.020 --> 02:58:21.060]
What guy came over to your house?

[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:22.720]
One of my friends brought over...

[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:24.600]
His girlfriend brought over a bigoted sack of crap.

[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:25.340]
That was hysterical.

[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:26.500]
Oh, she brought over her wife.

[02:58:26.780 --> 02:58:27.340]
Yeah, it's not the story.

[02:58:28.540 --> 02:58:31.640]
My friend's girlfriend brought over a bigoted sack of crap,

[02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:33.920]
a white trash piece of crap.

[02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:37.500]
You went on for like 10 minutes, but I'm not going to bore you now.

[02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:38.680]
And...

[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:39.680]
And he's...

[02:58:39.680 --> 02:58:44.020]
All the best line that he had after ripping niggers and sticks were about an hour,

[02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:47.040]
was about how the Germans had the best medical care in the world,

[02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:49.220]
because they experimented on live people.

[02:58:49.780 --> 02:58:50.520]
That's what...

[02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:52.400]
That's what Justice Scalia just said.

[02:58:52.500 --> 02:58:52.760]
Look at that.

[02:58:52.820 --> 02:58:53.420]
See?

[02:58:53.500 --> 02:58:53.880]
There you go.

[02:58:54.180 --> 02:58:56.020]
He just got to a sandwich just a second ago.

[02:58:56.180 --> 02:59:03.040]
This is 560 QALs, the Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio 560s.

[02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:05.220]
QALs.

[02:59:05.520 --> 02:59:08.880]
There is no Chris Messin, the silly middle piece.

[02:59:09.220 --> 02:59:09.380]
No.

[02:59:09.500 --> 02:59:11.500]
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus.

[02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:13.180]
They have different religious beliefs.

[02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:15.460]
They believe in Muhammad.

[02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:17.240]
And not in our holiday.

[02:59:18.220 --> 02:59:22.340]
And so every December I go to the middle East and fly.

[02:59:24.140 --> 02:59:25.640]
Hey, there, Mr. Muslims.

[02:59:26.140 --> 02:59:27.260]
Mary fucking Christmas.

[02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:30.540]
Put down that book to call and I hear some holiday wishes.

[02:59:31.940 --> 02:59:33.700]
In case you haven't noticed,

[02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:35.040]
if Jesus said birthday,

[02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:37.980]
so get off your heat and mud for a map and fucking celebrate.

[02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:43.600]
There is no holiday season in India.

[02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:44.400]
I've heard.

[02:59:44.800 --> 02:59:47.940]
They don't hang up their stockings and that is just absurd.

[02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:49.960]
They never read a Christmas story.

[02:59:49.960 --> 02:59:51.700]
They don't know what root off is about.

[02:59:52.420 --> 02:59:56.300]
And that is why in December I'll go to India and fly.

[02:59:58.300 --> 02:59:59.980]
Hi there, Mr. Hinduess.

[03:00:00.180 --> 03:00:01.400]
Mary fucking Christmas.

[03:00:01.800 --> 03:00:04.520]
He can't know any some beef and passage rules on the hands.

[03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:07.520]
In case you haven't noticed,

[03:00:07.940 --> 03:00:08.860]
if Jesus said birthday,

[03:00:09.380 --> 03:00:10.900]
so get off your heat and Hinduess.

[03:00:10.900 --> 03:00:11.720]
I'm not a fucking celebrate.

[03:00:14.300 --> 03:00:16.000]
Now I heard that in Japan,

[03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:17.920]
everyone just lives in sins.

[03:00:18.220 --> 03:00:21.120]
They face several dogs and put needles in their skin.

[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:22.640]
On December 20th,

[03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:24.460]
all they do is eat a cake.

[03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:28.980]
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and fly.

[03:00:31.340 --> 03:00:32.860]
Hi there, Mr. Hinduess.

[03:00:33.100 --> 03:00:34.200]
Mary fucking Christmas.

[03:00:34.540 --> 03:00:37.220]
God is going to kick her out of here for the next day and so.

[03:00:38.340 --> 03:00:40.040]
In case you haven't noticed,

[03:00:40.380 --> 03:00:41.200]
they're supposed to say so.

[03:00:41.660 --> 03:00:42.920]
So that's all we've got for Jesus.

[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:44.880]
Mary fucking Christmas to you.

[03:00:46.420 --> 03:00:47.980]
On Christmas Day,

[03:00:48.460 --> 03:00:51.560]
I travel around the world and say,

[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.920]
now it's Christmas bonus and all you APS2.

[03:00:55.380 --> 03:00:57.660]
Mary fucking Christmas.

[03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:00.160]
So yeah.

[03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:03.000]
Right.

[03:01:03.260 --> 03:01:05.320]
It's what 55 at 56 W. Kim.

[03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:08.180]
I will say at the risk of having you think that I really care about this anymore,

[03:01:08.220 --> 03:01:08.760]
which I don't.

[03:01:09.180 --> 03:01:11.960]
But I did listen to about the minute or two of this anal argument

[03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:13.760]
that they're playing the audio tapes out of on CNN.

[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:20.620]
And the idea that the Supreme Court is saying they're asking about hanging chairs and interfering.

[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:23.180]
These are the states rights people, baby.

[03:01:24.300 --> 03:01:25.520]
The states rights people.

[03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:27.540]
They're sitting up there and of course they're going to push people.

[03:01:28.140 --> 03:01:31.420]
I ask you about the internal affairs of a state election

[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:34.580]
and how votes were counted and how votes were not counted.

[03:01:34.580 --> 03:01:37.280]
Do they have any business being involved in this whatsoever?

[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:38.400]
No, of course not.

[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:40.720]
But it's a good way to wrap it up.

[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:42.760]
Here's North Miami.

[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:43.100]
Hello.

[03:01:43.380 --> 03:01:43.900]
Hey, how are you doing?

[03:01:43.980 --> 03:01:44.460]
Okay, sir.

[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:45.460]
Real quick.

[03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:48.060]
After they started counting it down,

[03:01:48.180 --> 03:01:50.220]
the Saturday I was very happy when they stopped it.

[03:01:50.300 --> 03:01:51.720]
I said, I'm tired of this crap.

[03:01:52.300 --> 03:01:54.160]
You mentioned 60 minutes and you missed.

[03:01:54.500 --> 03:01:58.160]
Or you didn't talk about the most horrendous story they had on their last night.

[03:01:58.880 --> 03:02:01.540]
If you had a call about it, I didn't see it.

[03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:06.440]
The Roman Catholic Church is going into all the poor neighborhoods around the country.

[03:02:06.460 --> 03:02:07.860]
Did you find that in the church?

[03:02:07.980 --> 03:02:08.180]
Yeah.

[03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:09.680]
Buying up the hospitals.

[03:02:10.420 --> 03:02:14.780]
And then not allowing any type of a...

[03:02:14.780 --> 03:02:15.480]
Women's right.

[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:16.200]
Or...

[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:17.880]
What was the first and foremost to do about anything?

[03:02:18.220 --> 03:02:20.780]
There was a lady that had nine children.

[03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:21.560]
Okay?

[03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:22.660]
Nine children.

[03:02:23.260 --> 03:02:25.480]
She might have been a Mexican descendant of that shore.

[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:26.780]
That makes no difference.

[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:31.260]
She wanted to get a total of gays because she couldn't get pregnant again.

[03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:32.920]
No, absolutely not.

[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:36.900]
The closest nearest hospital after that was over 35 miles away.

[03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:39.260]
It was the ugliest...

[03:02:39.820 --> 03:02:40.940]
Well, at least they're consistent.

[03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:46.220]
The greatest dispensers of human suffering, misery and ignorance all over the globe is the Catholic Church.

[03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:47.540]
And they're consistent.

[03:02:47.880 --> 03:02:50.280]
I mentioned last week somebody fasted me a great two-page article,

[03:02:50.460 --> 03:02:55.260]
but we were in poor, the only election crap about the fact that it looked like they were going to ease up their restrictions on contraceptives.

[03:02:56.100 --> 03:02:57.440]
And they said, no, guess what?

[03:02:57.700 --> 03:02:58.420]
The answer is no.

[03:02:58.420 --> 03:03:04.560]
Well, you know, I tell you one thing, the pill that they brought over is probably the best thing that's going to happen

[03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:06.620]
as far as the abortion issue.

[03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:07.980]
I think that's going to be the best bet.

[03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:12.220]
And you need to watch all of 60 minutes to have one more thing there on all about bengruppee.com.

[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:13.720]
I saw...

[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:14.480]
I was slipping around.

[03:03:14.660 --> 03:03:16.940]
I saw that segment, but I didn't see the thing on the chair.

[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:17.900]
And I was thinking about you.

[03:03:18.100 --> 03:03:19.680]
When you talk about your start market,

[03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:20.920]
do you involve any of that stuff?

[03:03:20.940 --> 03:03:22.140]
No, absolutely not.

[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:23.080]
I have no.com.

[03:03:23.300 --> 03:03:23.740]
Thank God.

[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:24.460]
Well, you know what?

[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:25.320]
I love you, Neon.

[03:03:25.380 --> 03:03:26.340]
I've been listening to you for years.

[03:03:26.340 --> 03:03:28.680]
I wish you did not put a dime in the stock market.

[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:30.460]
I wish you did just stuck it in the bank somewhere.

[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:30.900]
Me too.

[03:03:30.980 --> 03:03:32.240]
I had a great life when you retire.

[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:32.740]
Me too.

[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:33.180]
You're right.

[03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:33.840]
You can put it in the holidays.

[03:03:34.300 --> 03:03:36.660]
And we'll survive all of the bull crap that we've had.

[03:03:36.660 --> 03:03:36.900]
You bet.

[03:03:37.080 --> 03:03:37.420]
Thanks a lot.

[03:03:37.660 --> 03:03:37.660]

[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:39.600]
Yeah, we'll make it to your one way or the other.

[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:41.140]
And it's only money.

[03:03:41.220 --> 03:03:42.320]
That's what Mitch Hershaw always says.

[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:42.880]
And the way he says it.

[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:43.540]
I don't know if the link money.

[03:03:43.980 --> 03:03:44.140]
Mine.

[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:46.360]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:46.820]
Pound 5.

[03:03:46.840 --> 03:03:48.580]
What's a Justice Renquist saying?

[03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:50.400]
How many do you think it is?

[03:03:50.820 --> 03:03:52.180]
How many do you like that?

[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:53.160]
How many do I think?

[03:03:53.260 --> 03:03:53.420]
Yeah.

[03:03:53.860 --> 03:03:55.320]
There you go, Justice Renquist.

[03:03:55.540 --> 03:03:56.840]
Stuff them all up your ass all night.
