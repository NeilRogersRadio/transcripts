[00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.420]
560 WQAM presents a meal Roger show. Talk to Neil.

[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.320]
567 WI, 16, and Dan O'Brien Downey's.

[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.180]
4 Count 560 WI for Ryze.

[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.520]
877 75 Neil is a toll freak on all opinions expressed by Neil Rogers.

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.800]
His guests are scholars.

[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.180]
Does not reflect those of the measly broadcaster.

[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.240]
It staff advertises for agency.

[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.680]
No!

[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.860]
The Neil Roger show on 560 Q AF.

[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.680]
It's Friday, you first do.

[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.740]
Today's show was brought to you by Chick-re-Farms.

[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.860]
Chick-re-Farms.

[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.760]
The gift it says, I don't really like you,

[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.660]
but I feel obligated to get you something since you invited me to your dumb party.

[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.040]
Chick-re-Farms.

[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.140]
Because you just don't care.

[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.240]
But critics agree. This collection of holiday songs may very well be the most moving and memorable of all time.

[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.960]
I'm dreaming of a wide, quismous.

[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.620]
Just walk away, I used to know.

[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.300]
Yes, candle wax music presents Elmer Fudz, Christmas classics.

[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.220]
And this 24-record set is truly incredible.

[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.520]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.880]
Oh, what fun it is to hide in a one horse open swear.

[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.400]
Oh, what fun you'll have hearing these timeless classics performed by America's most beloved hunter of wavits.

[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.680]
Put on the wet nose, Wayne Deer.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.840]
Have a very sunny nose.

[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.220]
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it was.

[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.140]
Elmer Fudz, Christmas classics, not available in stores.

[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.220]
And when you receive your set in the mail, you'll know why.

[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.980]
Hello, everybody. I show hope you like my Christmas classics.

[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.500]
So call toll free at 1-800-1.

[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.480]
Oppa waiters are standing by Santa Claus is coming to town.

[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.740]
All right.

[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.340]
Then I'll go to a 5-60 WQM happy Friday, too. It's all request Friday.

[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.820]
So this is going to be the only way I'm going to get them away from all of these.

[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.500]
You know what I'm talking about? The unmentionable f***ing hell that stuff?

[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.700]
Yeah.

[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.760]
It's just and it's the holidays. What a great time. Good idea.

[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.500]
And the L as usual. How'd that pull about yesterday?

[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.880]
Should Al Grobe the Democratic candidate for president in 2004?

[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.560]
No 384.

[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.480]
48.3%.

[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.760]
Yes, 213.

[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.820]
And I'm still convinced most of those are probably Republicans who just are salivating another chance for him to be in there.

[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.160]
213.26.8%.

[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.680]
I don't care.

[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.360]
Now it's not interesting that our first call today is on the line.

[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.640]
You see what I'm saying? Isn't that bizarre?

[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.300]
I can't wait till we try line five.

[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.720]
In fact, let me see if a...

[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.400]
Oh man! Wow!

[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.060]

[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.880]
Every line on the board is working today for the first time since before Abe Lincoln was in embryo.

[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.680]
Here's Boyton Beach. Hello.

[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.760]
Is it me?

[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.060]
My one-quail year, happy new year in advance.

[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.800]
I'm not talking politics. I'm going to Vegas tomorrow.

[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.260]
Excellent. Now you're talking.

[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.680]
Three nights, round trip, 500 bucks a person.

[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.340]
All right.

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.680]
The only bad part is it's Delta and every other flight we have booked for seems to be getting canceled due to pile trouble.

[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.100]
You got good news and bad news.

[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.460]
The good news is he's going to Vegas. The bad news is he probably won't ever get there.

[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.560]
Yeah, exactly. Every time I plan a trip, I have to watch the weather channel.

[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.560]
I'm getting set up with it. Either I storm in Dallas, which you are connecting flight.

[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.180]
Right. Well, there's a hurricane coming. No matter what it is, the weather channel is a part of my life.

[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.920]
And you can't have any fun without aggravating.

[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.640]
Yeah. Too bad you couldn't be going on national air line since you're on the verge of going out of business.

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.100]
Oh really? I didn't know that.

[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.500]
Yeah, they just called for bankruptcy. They're not out of business, but they're in trouble.

[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.200]
Live trouble. So now Delta and others can raise their rates because of what's competition.

[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.400]
Right. I love capital.

[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.540]
Don't you love capitalism instead of...

[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.860]
I don't know if it's flights, but the odds are you'll probably never get there with them either.

[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.040]
Well, the long story of it, Delta once set this up in the air with a blown tire.

[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.060]
It was real fun landing with a blown tire, but they didn't want to admit it.

[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.740]
They have at least a bunch of there.

[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.100]
They got me. Yeah, I'm so alive.

[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.080]
Put your belly on it.

[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.240]
Get me there one piece. I don't care about my luggage.

[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.060]
Right. You just want to live.

[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.220]
Well listen, where are you staying?

[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.300]
At the Paris.

[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.420]
Oh, great.

[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.560]
The town is booked. We wanted the NGM book.

[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.320]
Five months and we called everything's booked as a...

[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.340]
Yeah. I want to ask you where a good restaurant is. I was going to ask you where that 7-11 is, but I can find it on the internet.

[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.220]
I'll tell you, you'll find it inside the Paris. Have you been in the Paris?

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.640]
Never.

[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.680]
Oh, it's beautiful.

[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.500]
They have a thing in there where it's like an outdoors ambience. In other words, you're inside, but it's like the sky...

[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.520]
You think you're outside.

[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.860]
And in that area, there are all these great French restaurants. It's sensational.

[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.440]
If you don't want to want to spend your food, right?

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.880]
Exactly.

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.900]
All right. Have a great time. I hope you can wait for one request.

[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.220]
Yes.

[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.080]
My daughter is getting married in June. And I have... As a father of the bride, I have to dance with my daughter to a certain song.

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.460]
And the song I have picked out, I'll send you a copy of the tape because it's going to be right.

[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.140]
Can you play your version of Butterfly Kisses?

[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.300]
You got it. Thank you.

[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.060]
Have a great time.

[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.360]
Thanks.

[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.220]
How do you like that? Right off the bat. There's a guy that's even in a good mood.

[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.900]
I hate you, daddy. Daddy, it's so sweet. My short...

[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.320]
There you...

[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.000]
There's two things I know.

[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.540]
Daddy, you're a loser.

[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.940]
I would back on my pants.

[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.960]
I think mommy treats on you.

[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.420]
Why is the male man in a least here?

[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.300]
Daddy, why don't you get a job?

[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.480]
Daddy, you smell like beer.

[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.460]
I'm dropping out of high school.

[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.080]
Looking like a mama, a little more everyday.

[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.520]
Daddy, I'm pregnant.

[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.020]
I don't know who the father is.

[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.780]
I asked to turn chick half.

[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.840]
I drove the car into a tree.

[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.540]
Can you just send me some cigarettes?

[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.780]
Hang out my adults for the bride and girls.

[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.600]
Daddy, I'm getting married again.

[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.920]
Dad, that's my ass.

[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.740]
I think I have similar.

[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.160]
Hey, Pop. We're moving in.

[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.400]
And butterfly kisser.

[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.500]
Dad, I have smooth. I'm a lesbian.

[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.620]
Pet away to 5.50 WQM.

[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.680]
Oh, speaking of the people we like here at WQM,

[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.380]
how could I have left out Mark Vandermeer, the voice of the Hercunz?

[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.940]
Because he's out of sight out of mind.

[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.160]
We don't like the Hercunz, but we love Mark Vandermeer,

[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.520]
who's a great guy, great talent, and he's Dutch.

[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.600]
I really like that.

[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.700]
So I'll still believe to you too.

[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.520]
Anyway, this is a great idea.

[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.640]
Did I feel so much better?

[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.080]
Well, this is great.

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.580]
This is the way to wean them away from that crap,

[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.340]
from the f***ing stuff.

[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.460]
Here's our poll for today and over the weekend.

[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.780]
Especially since I see another article,

[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.120]
they just won't give up the ghost.

[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.640]
Marlins will look at FAU Stadium.

[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.080]
They're looking at it.

[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.660]
Sharing of sight of possibility.

[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.860]
Although the team is still hoping that a task force

[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.040]
that began meeting in Miami last week will come up with a financing plan

[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.960]
for a new ballpark to be built in by sending the teniole parking downtown Miami.

[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.000]
Oh, come on.

[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.980]
They want the money.

[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.460]
Oh, little stadium guy, dammit.

[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.260]
So our poll question today,

[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.820]
will you be going to any Marlins games this season?

[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.140]
I know it's only the middle of December,

[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.480]
but it's never too early to start making plans to stay home.

[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.940]
I mean, you go and support the Marlins.

[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.860]
Will you be going to any Marlins games this season?

[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.860]
Here are your choices.

[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.560]
Many, a few, maybe one or two,

[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.800]
or never.

[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.640]
Will you be going to any Marlins games this season?

[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.380]
Many, a few, maybe one or two, or never.

[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.720]
So you have one or which one George is voting for.

[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.180]
Come on.

[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.980]
All of you, people, all of you, hard to answer.

[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.560]
Just because, well, I don't want to go into it.

[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.440]
See, I want to influence the outcome of the game.

[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.100]
Oh, I don't.

[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.600]
I don't want to get blamed for that.

[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.880]
In addition to which to show you what a great mood I'm in,

[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.440]
I'm not watching CNN, MSNBC.

[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.100]
I'm sure I watch in CNBC.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.080]
I don't want to see that stuck.

[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.460]
I'm watching the food channel.

[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.660]
That's my resolution for the foreseeable future,

[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.500]
especially since we don't have any music channels in America

[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.560]
that really play music anyway.

[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.760]
So I sat here scouring the satellite dish this morning

[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.900]
or a small dish, and I decided on the food channel.

[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.840]
There's no little thing in the bottom right hand corner

[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.100]
with the depressing stock news.

[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.620]
There's nothing I can do about it anyway.

[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.400]
Am I buying any more stock?

[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:55.640]
No.

[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.420]
That's it.

[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.020]
I'm done.

[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.700]
Whatever I got, that's it.

[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.120]
I'm hoping for the best in four years.

[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.540]
And whatever I got, that's it.

[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.300]
And the rest of my money is going into CDs, into bonds,

[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.040]
anything.

[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.160]
Guaranteed.

[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.860]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.600]
Anything that's Guaranteed.

[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.160]
And that guy I just want to mention again,

[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.600]
that was hustling me at the hockey game,

[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.000]
so it'll ever come near me again.

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.140]
Go back to Solomon Smith Barney and get out of my face.

[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.500]
You bugged a crap out of me.

[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.360]
As soon as somebody starts hustling,

[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.420]
you want to deal with your money.

[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.820]
You know you're dealing with a real major piece of crap.

[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.160]
Probably show up on our sales department pretty soon.

[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.280]
Ten minutes after 10 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.780]
No force of the program may be listed

[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.140]
out of the express written for me.

[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:36.400]
No.

[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.700]
On each UAM business podcast group in Clipery.

[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.960]
Hey, enough with the pamphors already.

[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.920]
One that helps with the baseball suits of me getting anywhere.

[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.080]
I'm going to be a player.

[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.580]
Return to Santa.

[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.280]
Return to Santa.

[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.700]
I got a sweater from my grand mom.

[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.680]
It was pink and black.

[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.260]
A don't worry be a high-freed.

[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.220]
Was proofed in all the facts.

[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.520]
You wrote a box.

[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.020]
Return to Santa.

[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.900]
Just send me cash.

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.460]
Your tag is wet.

[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.340]
Okay, me or a rash.

[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.860]
I got a food taken some plaid paint.

[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.920]
Get clipped before my nose.

[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.220]
A null ball of old spice.

[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.560]
Boy did I get a hoist.

[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.920]
He wrote a bomb and returned to Santa.

[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.700]
Of whom he is his host.

[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.460]
But he's serious Christmas.

[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.120]
He really is strong.

[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.900]
He wrote a bomb and returned to Santa.

[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.600]
Don't need to be rude.

[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.480]
But this Christmas.

[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.580]
I got swished.

[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.840]
Return to Santa.

[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.540]
Head 14 at 560 W.

[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.160]
I think that's what's happening with our best NLCDs.

[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.740]
It's a classic example of what an asshole Fred Durst is.

[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.060]
Your close personal best friend who thinks that Napster is nifty and great because it encourages people to go out and buy a lot more of their music.

[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.160]
He's a big Napster fan.

[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.160]

[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.280]
You love him.

[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.420]
You said defensive about it.

[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.100]
You're an awful defensive to me.

[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.280]
That's like saying that if you open up the doors like in Burdhines,

[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.600]
if they just let the doors open like after closing hours and people walk in and take the merchandise out for free,

[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.860]
everybody else would see how nifty the merchandise is that they have in there.

[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.460]
And that would stimulate sales for the store.

[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.080]
Right? Isn't that a good idea?

[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.260]
So let's try it.

[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.000]
During the holiday season especially all you departments do are people.

[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.860]
After you're closing hours, just leave the doors open and put a big sign on in there.

[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.480]
You leave the lights on and the doors open and say, well close but come on and take whatever you like.

[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.360]
And then see if profits keep going up like crazy.

[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.580]
Oh man, that Fred Dyrst is a rocket scientist.

[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.080]
But I'm going to start making songs that just say over and over again.

[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.940]
Pick the word over and over again.

[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.980]
There you go.

[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 8.

[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.080]
It's all request for right now.

[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.140]
Yesterday I must say that I probably said a record yesterday.

[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.360]
Wouldn't you say for hanging up on the most people in history of the show?

[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.160]
I think I did.

[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.680]
And I'm proud of it.

[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:49.920]
Because in fact this is getting close to the time of the year when a lot of people make new years resolutions.

[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.700]
And I have a suggestion for most of you.

[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.480]
Not some of you of course are free thinkers.

[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.080]
You actually have a brain and you use not too many but some of you do.

[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.160]
During the coming year, here's your resolution.

[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.880]
Just keep saying it to yourself and pretty soon you'll start to believe it.

[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.260]
During the coming year I'll be less easily led.

[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.460]
I'll be less easily led around the nose like a sheep.

[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.500]
Like a flamingo at feeding time.

[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.380]
That's a great new year's resolution.

[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.380]
What are you saying?

[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:17.980]
Are they going to do it?

[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:18.200]
No.

[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:18.900]
Well just say it.

[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.400]
I mean maybe you'll even start to believe it.

[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.680]
Because anybody today that even comes close to mentioning the election crap, I mean it's all over.

[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.940]
I'm sure that a lot of you people are still very frustrated, agitated.

[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:30.480]
Great.

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.360]
Find somebody to talk to about it but not me.

[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.140]
It's like, it's like, um, pound cake.

[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.000]
Well that's a bad example.

[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:40.860]
P pound cake without anything.

[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.380]
Well I'd like a banana split.

[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:43.580]
Huh?

[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.580]
There's nobody who don't like a good banana split.

[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.540]
I mean you might like different flavors of ice cream in it.

[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.640]
But I can't imagine anybody doesn't like a grape in an split.

[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.960]
But after you had like 14 of them in a short period of time, wouldn't you start like puking your gut sap from it?

[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.100]
Just a thought of it will make you heave your gut sap?

[00:14:59.220 --> 00:14:59.980]
I think so.

[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.520]
Follow my point.

[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.340]
That's not like a great hot-fudge Sunday.

[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.080]
Mmm.

[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.460]
Especially like on a rocky road.

[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.400]
Doesn't that sound good?

[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.300]
Over there.

[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.380]
Why am I talking myself into this?

[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.020]
I finally feel good today.

[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:14.680]
I feel great.

[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.000]
Didn't gain all that weight back that I did on that the diuretic pillow one day peed out all that weight.

[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.460]
And because I got on the exercise bike last night and I got in a pool for about a half an hour last night and swam my brains out.

[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.780]
And only about a maybe a half a pound of that all that weight that I lost in one day.

[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.360]
See generally when you do that, you can't fool them other in nature.

[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:38.680]
You take a diuretic pillow, you lose all your pee out a whole bunch of weight and then you eat a regular meal the next day and then it all comes back.

[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.800]
Didn't happen with this kid.

[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.660]
So if it wasn't so bad for your health and for your kidneys and your potassium and your electrolytes and all that,

[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.840]
we just start popping diuretic pills and just spend all day peeing our brains out.

[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.580]
And about a week I weigh about 60 pounds.

[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.660]
But of course the Lord prevented that because he likes to work in mysterious evil ways.

[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.420]
Here's a call from Helen Dale. Hello.

[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.920]
Helen Dale is gone.

[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.620]
Maybe they expired.

[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.880]
Maybe the ghost of Sonny Rosenberg inflicted on their phone.

[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.500]
I don't know what happened. Evil spirits.

[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.600]
5667.0560.

[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.420]
Pound 560.

[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.400]
They probably heard what I said about talking about.

[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.020]
They didn't want to get hung up on good.

[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.340]
Good. Good thinking.

[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.980]
Go find somebody else to talk about it. Find Sonny Rosenberg.

[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.900]
Find the outhouse gang there in Helen Dale.

[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.680]
All you old Creetans with your plaid pants. Get away from my face.

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.720]
That's one good thing about living in Florida.

[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:37.360]
Where else can you see so many people in the shopping malls with lemon and lime green pants?

[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.940]
And plaid pants, huh?

[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.660]
And don't forget about those rain catch and hats.

[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.320]
The rain catchers. I love those.

[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.480]
I like the nose protectors on the glasses.

[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.760]
Yeah, those are good.

[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.240]
The Florida outfit.

[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.740]
Once you get to be 100 years old, you must wear the Florida outfit.

[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.840]
Oh yeah, the fit in.

[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.740]
In fact, they should just have, they would be a great idea.

[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.100]
I just got an idea for you.

[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.020]
People I want to go to business.

[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.320]
The old fart store.

[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.240]
Who specializes in nothing but uniforms for old farts.

[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.320]
Oh, I want to have a pair of lime green pants before I croak.

[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.520]
Oh, you already mentioned the shoes.

[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.300]
Oh, of course the shoes.

[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:12.760]
White.

[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.040]
White shoes are a white box.

[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.080]
Are making a comeback.

[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.900]
Just ask Pat Boone. He is turned 96.

[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.820]
Here's a mobile informer.

[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.080]
Hey, no, don't forget those big heavy, real-block sunglasses that they wear.

[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.420]
Right.

[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.920]
That's definitely a idea.

[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:29.840]
Over here, you don't have a problem.

[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.700]
Good enough fountain, John.

[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.860]
It's good enough for the welding mask.

[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:32.260]

[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.100]
That's the welding mask.

[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.980]
Yeah, definitely over here, you don't have a problem with losing your grandparents or your great-grandparents'

[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:39.460]
parents' dreams and all that.

[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.840]
I mean, you can find them that everybody's wearing lime green.

[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.580]
Everybody, I think.

[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.980]
And don't forget about the flower on the antenna.

[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.520]
Oh, god, yeah, that's right.

[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.660]
That's for silly things.

[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.380]
They're in fall, baby.

[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.940]
Yeah, they're flowering the orange ball.

[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.480]
Exactly.

[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.360]
Well, you know, unfortunately, I'm getting out of here.

[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.740]
You know, the good thing is I'm getting out of here for about a month or so.

[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.740]
Problem is I'm coming back over to the east coast.

[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.240]
And so...

[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.200]
Well, you're at least a little bit of a step up, not much, but a little bit.

[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.760]
These are all getting away from the great-grandparents.

[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.100]
I'm coming to the grandparents over there.

[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.180]
So that's a good thing.

[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.860]
But you know, if you get me back in the mood over there, can I hear that Joe Corroyo is not a talliano.

[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.280]
Is he a talliano?

[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.520]
No, he's not talliano.

[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:14.920]
Do you remember that one?

[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.900]
What is it, Joe Corroyo is not a talliano.

[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.340]
Not a probano, he's talliano.

[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.100]
What does that call?

[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:20.920]
I don't know.

[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.100]
Okay, we'll find it.

[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:23.720]
Alright, okay.

[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:24.920]
Zagazone.

[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.400]
Oh, you got Joe Corroyo banana boat, is that it?

[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.200]
No, that's not it.

[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.860]
That's the only one I know.

[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.120]
You can tell you in Joe or something like that.

[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:31.860]
Cadian Joe?

[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.920]
See, this is what kills a lot of good times.

[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.340]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.720]
But Cadian Joe, I told you.

[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.620]
I told you.

[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.460]
I told you.

[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.840]
I told you.

[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.900]
I told you.

[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.560]
I told you.

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.560]

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.660]
I told you.

[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:00.660]

[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:00.660]

[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:00.660]

[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:00.700]
I told you.

[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.480]
I told you.

[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:01.480]

[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:01.700]
I told you.

[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.440]
I told you.

[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.720]
I told you.

[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:03.740]
I told you.

[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:03.760]
I told you.

[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.420]
I told you.

[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:04.880]
I told you.

[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.700]
I told you.

[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.140]
I told you.

[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.900]
Hey me.

[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.520]
Hi you.

[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.520]
Hi you.

[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.100]
Yeah.

[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.680]
I hope you like and that tastes best my part.

[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.500]
This is what one you like a lot.

[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.120]
Hey Joe, you can buy my parts.

[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.680]
You can do it, you.

[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.480]
You ain't got a humano.

[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.520]
Don't worry, there's a tiny arrow.

[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.560]
I know you all.

[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.260]
That's 22 and 560 WQM.

[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.260]
So we got the phone all fixed up, which is a cost for big, great celebration.

[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.060]
The problem being now is that our website is screwed up or maybe just the internet.

[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:04.680]
Huh?

[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.260]
Because the Eric Scott the thing up on here and I just cast my vote on our poll today.

[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.760]
Will you be going any Marlins games this season?

[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.140]
And of course my vote was for never.

[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.220]
I mean never, never, never, ever, even though I get free tickets.

[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.140]
Ain't my winning ticket?

[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:17.440]
No.

[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.560]
And it's just going back and forth and back and forth and forever just won't do nothing.

[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.200]
Isn't that depressing?

[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.080]
I'm looking forward to they would like everything.

[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.260]
All the phone lines, everything in here all works at the same time.

[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.440]
Just once, just one day.

[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.420]
We'll be sending, and I'll say, oh, there was no response.

[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.340]
The server could be down or was not responding.

[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.520]
I hate when that thing comes up on there, you know?

[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.140]
Can't stand it.

[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.680]
Okay, okay, get it out of there.

[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.720]
The internet is great sometimes.

[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.020]
Here's a call in dear field. Hello.

[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.220]
How are you, Neil?

[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:52.560]
Great.

[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.340]
I'd like to make a request this morning to my buddy, Mick Narlie.

[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.440]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.000]
Okay.

[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.800]
And I would like to also make a request for a poll if I could.

[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.560]
Do you think George W. has a chance in 2004 of real action?

[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.560]
Okay.

[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.900]
Thanks, but never great line.

[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.460]
Have a good one.

[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.340]
And our thing is working now.

[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.840]
Thank God.

[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.080]
It must have been me.

[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.840]
I think the pewter just looked and saw it was me and it blew to you.

[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.660]
29 so far.

[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.120]
Look at that.

[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.280]
18 said never.

[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.160]
Isn't that bad?

[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.080]
Never going to be going to know.

[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.320]
Well, Marlon's games, what do you say?

[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.040]
How about if we would lower cheat ticket price?

[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:30.320]
Low.

[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:30.640]
Huh?

[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:31.240]
Free ticket.

[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:31.580]
Low.

[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.840]
Eight said maybe one or two.

[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.320]
Two people said many.

[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.060]
And one guy said, eh, few.

[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.660]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.400]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.600]
My beliefs are what requires you.

[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.400]
If I were to let go of fire, my religion is better than yours.

[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.960]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.360]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.060]
What my religion has to date, then it's free and racial hate.

[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.360]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.840]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.180]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.060]
What we like about it best, knife on for boys and wear the dress.

[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.300]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.300]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:24.060]

[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.020]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.140]
We have no respect for women's driver's cab to make the living.

[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.080]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.660]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.280]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.520]
To prepare for us, move your ghosts.

[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.120]
We slaughter pigs and dogs and goats.

[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.200]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.060]
Our higher religion is better than yours.

[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.460]
Our religion is better than yours.

[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.480]
We were puny, since it's barely ever ever.

[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.480]
Our higher religion is better than yours.

[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:03.300]
Please.

[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.120]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.340]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.540]
We now go towards the bothers you like full of brushes.

[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.340]
We are new.

[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.160]
Our religion is better than yours.

[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.020]
Our religion is better than yours.

[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.740]
Our religion is better than yours.

[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.360]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.820]
We wear todaysIDne wide, our bikes and ain't counts very much.

[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.940]
We watch theest, we watch the lowest, we watch the lowest and we...

[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:42.580]
WE WILEGE IN B Okay!, We feel these moments are special.

[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:42.840]
We still see them individually.

[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.440]
whomever we look at will have answers to them.

[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.880]
1026-560-WQM. Happy Holidays from your friends here at WQAIM and the rest of us too.

[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.200]
Because you know, this is great. Where else can you get a smile on your post? Got a lot

[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.060]
of sour people out there, a lot of people that want to dwell on the pants, bitter people.

[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.640]
I'm not going to participate. Life is too God damn short. If you can just put a little

[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.180]
smile on somebody's post, especially at a time like this, then you've done a great job.

[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.300]
I think so if he asked me. I'll tell you one thing John Henry, I wouldn't plan on anybody

[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.760]
building that new stadium. I must be crazy. I must be not. 44 votes so far. Will you be

[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:29.460]
going any more of them's games this season? 27 people say never. As an absolutely, positively,

[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.720]
no chance. If you packed us some free hollava, we still wouldn't go. How do you like that?

[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.460]
In fact, now it's 53 votes and 31 say never. If you gave us free PlayStation 2's, we still

[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:47.280]
wouldn't bring the kids. Maybe one or two games, 16 people, a few games for and many only

[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:58.800]
appear. This is 560 U.A.S. Friday, you best good. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:11.040]
the two newest New York young people. I'm Dr. Gooden and the personal coach Steve

[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:21.100]
Hal. That's what I like about. That goodens in the lineup. The strong man's not flying

[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:28.580]
up. He's ruling like a dog who heard about. He's high as a lab rat for smoking the

[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:35.820]
cracket of bat. He doesn't like cocaine just like the way it smells. Snorting A. Boles.

[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.920]
Hours roll enough for plenty. Snorting A. Boles. And he's getting good and plenty. They

[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:49.000]
lick the 20 dollar bill. Their teeth are grinding like a peppermil.

[00:25:50.040 --> 00:26:02.140]
Go in A. Boles. Out the hole and pills. Steve Hal is in the bullpen. His nostrils are

[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:09.700]
wide open. He's so f**king up beating. He's on the braves. He gets advice from Doc and

[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:17.440]
Doc prescribed some rock. The first people were lining Danny Bluda. Say, Snorting A. Boles.

[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.880]
Say, abuse the magic powder. Snorting A. Boles. Wrinkling on their clam chowder.

[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:31.020]
Prescription. Scots of petriolary film. They do it in the pool if they have gills.

[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:45.560]
Go in A. Boles. Out the hole and pills. All that money. A. Boles. Out the hole and pills.

[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:54.140]
I like to welcome you all aboard. Is she your manager? Hi, Bob. 1031 and 560 WK. That was for

[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.180]
Bill and Ford Lauderdale by Fax. How do you like that? We're even getting Fax requests,

[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.400]
which is fine with us because we're in a great mood here today. We're turning the corner.

[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.840]
We're moving on with life. I suppose the other people just want to wallow in their misery.

[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.240]
I'll give you classic examples since we're doing the poll on the marlins today. People are

[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.760]
really distraught with the Pay Rod. I got caught hangt of it. They had a great name for

[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.560]
Alex Rodriguez instead of A. Rod. He called him Pay Rod, which I like. Anybody want to pay

[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.520]
Rod? No. No, you first. But it's same thing like with the Panthers. I've got a whole

[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.320]
different attitude about that. They buy me the tickets free. I get all my tickets like a penguin

[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.440]
game. I want to go see that on Wednesday. I want to go see a yummy yoghurt and the Leafs will be

[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.900]
here on the 30th. I'm going to go when I feel like it. I don't feel compelled to go. So I'm going

[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.800]
to move on. The tickets are free and maybe I'll sneak in my own damn soda.

[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.940]
And anybody else out there? Yeah, I mean, they've already slapped you in the face. They said

[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.460]
basically he said, well, you know, nice. The Wayne thing again. You got to wait until Wayne

[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.400]
sells the team and gets the deal that he wants. And in the meantime, we're not going to make

[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.920]
any changes. We don't care if they lose every game. Screw you people. And you see, you can

[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.360]
take it. You already paid for your tickets anyway. We got your money. So we scoot you again.

[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.220]
So like I said, don't feel compelled to subsidize this crap. You're going to be a lot happier.

[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.900]
Instead of belly, I get about it and bitching about it. Just, you know, put yourself in a

[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:14.060]
better mood. Get a good book like Mike Mayo said the other day. Take a part in you. Find a hobby.

[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.380]
Go get laid. Do something useful that might actually be enjoyable.

[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:25.580]
And less ponderous. What time is this show on? Less ponderous. I know what time it's on.

[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.180]
What's over the over? Okay, where are we going? Here's a West Miami. Hello.

[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.400]
Hey, good morning. How are you doing? Great. Hey, listen, so I'm 21 and I listen to your show

[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.240]
every day and I'm what you call a young hoolian. I wanted to touch up on something that you've been

[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:47.080]
talking about. You're going to touch on it. Yeah. Which is the top of gone hate.

[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.840]
And how there's so much hate and I can't speak anywhere but South Florida where I live at.

[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.980]
This is the capital of hate. Yeah, and the problem is that nobody wants to take responsibility

[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.520]
for their own actions. Everybody wants to put the shmit on somebody else's hands.

[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:08.840]
You know, we have the Cuban throwing stones at the blacks and the Jews and cemetery village.

[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.580]
And all that stuff. And you know, the crime over spilled milk. It's over just move on.

[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.640]
And you know, stop hating life too short. It's not going to happen.

[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:23.060]
Never going to happen. That's why this town will never work. If we live to be 600,

[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.600]
this place will never work because the people are just hate each other too much.

[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.900]
I hear you. The problem is they don't listen. I hear you time for the past four days.

[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.960]
I don't want to talk no more about the election. You take a call. What's the person saying?

[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.660]
They're the election. You hang up on them and they get mad at you. They would stop and listen.

[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.600]
And you know, stop getting carried away because this public is so easily swayed.

[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.200]
And you know, I just wanted to put my two cents in.

[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.900]
Okay. Any one more quick thing. I bet you before the half-hours up, you have three

[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.660]
callers talking about how the Cuban sucks for voting for Bush.

[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.060]
Okay. Let's do anything later.

[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.140]
You'll see how long it'll be on. I already had a fax. In fact, remember I had a pile of faxes

[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.260]
in the machine when I came in this morning. First fax right on top of the pile.

[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.600]
The Cuban says that and I write it in a waste basket. I don't know why you people waste

[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.080]
here. It makes you feel better because as soon as I start seeing something like that,

[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.460]
I read about two lines of it and it's right in a waste basket.

[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:22.100]
That's what Daryl said. I do about two lines. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and then two more.

[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.640]
Poor Daryl. Do we feel sorry for Daryl? No. No.

[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.680]
Just put him in a box. Put him in a lock box where he'll be safe.

[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.100]
Here's Mimey Springs. Hello. Oh, Morning. Yes, sir.

[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.400]
Hey, it's one of the mentioned a couple things. First, I don't have a computer, so I'll

[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.260]
put in your poll. Many. You'll be going to many games. Yeah.

[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.300]
I know you've got two other people out there. You're number three.

[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.660]
So let's see. That means you can take the whole first base side and somebody can take the third

[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.860]
base side and the other person can take the whole outfield. I'll do it and move around.

[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.580]
Okay. Oh, also, yeah. Just by 90 minutes ago, I was listening to Howard. Yeah.

[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.780]
And one of your old buddies is on here. Oh, yeah. El Goldstein was on it. We had 48

[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.660]
messages that El was going to be on the day and we're bored to death about it.

[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.400]
Uh, but, uh, yeah, sure that he's going to open a whole house in St. Martin.

[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:16.260]
Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, you know, as one mentioned about that and, uh, just pretty much it.

[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:20.040]
Okay. Okay. Thanks, Bill. See you. Okay. Are you excited about that, George?

[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.040]
And El was out. Yeah, we already had the message that El was going to be on. You know, El,

[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.320]
I don't even want to say it. He's going to show up Tuesday night. Bring the case to your

[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.720]
apartment and answer them, El, that you want me to be able to you. I mean, I don't need it.

[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.200]
I got my own apartment, but I like the location of it and every now and then if I need like a

[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.900]
P break or something, you know, although you don't need a P break, they got outside places you can

[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.480]
pee. Isn't that something? What a country, man. Actually outside, I'm not talking about the

[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:49.300]
sidewalk. No, they have outside P play urinals. Apparently it's a Europe thing.

[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.460]
Desert. However, I never saw it in Italy. No. No. In Italy, in fact, I don't think I even

[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.660]
let you pee inside the bed. They had like those walk up booths right on the side of the sidewalk.

[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.240]
Yeah. Because the Pope gets me on the river in Italy if any guy like, you know,

[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.880]
takes a penis out of his pants, he gets not really sure what's going to happen. So you're not

[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.500]
allowed to pee at all. And at least only at home. In France, they just pee on the street.

[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.140]
They do a Billy Carter thing in France. He says wherever they are, if they're in a restaurant,

[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.300]
you know, the mood strikes and they just pee on the floor. See, like I said, don't generalize

[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.160]
about any group of people in the world. It's a bad way to live except the French,

[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.140]
then we'll make the exception, especially the French Canadians. Oh, I was on my way to

[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.560]
Mother's House for lunch yesterday and here's a frog in front of me. And I kept saying,

[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.640]
you, I can't say what I kept saying. I'm screaming in the car, talk about, well, this guy could have

[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.380]
put in reverse them and make it more progress. And of course, kind of like weaving all over

[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.460]
to your little bit of freighting or a rounder because you're not really sure what the hell

[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:48.240]
the son of a bitch is going to do. You French Canadians, we despise you. We hate you like poison.

[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.840]
Pale, who go home? Go away. Don't go away, mag. Just go away soon.

[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.020]
Had one yesterday with the green arrow. Do they not have green arrows in Canada?

[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:04.540]
It means go start your battle now. Oh my god. They are just brutal. And there are no young

[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:10.280]
French Canadians. They're all old. They're all over the age of a hundred. And they drive like they've

[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.800]
been dead for 20 years. But hey, don't get started on. Don't start dwelling on those negatives, man.

[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:21.540]
Keep it positive. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello. Yes sir. Great.

[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:28.000]
This came back from Vegas the other day. Great. What a great time that was. It was a little chilly,

[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.620]
but we got over that. Yeah. Just walk the passenger inside all day anyway. Exactly. That's

[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.320]
less getting back and forth in between the cars. So you're not really a chance to get too cold.

[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:43.900]
But the barrageo, everything is fantastic. Yeah. Never had such a great time of my life.

[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.140]
I recommend everybody is going to go there at least once in their life.

[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:53.700]
To walk down the strip and see all the people and some of the casinos and everything is just

[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.960]
tremendous. I see the people there don't have time to hate each other because they're too busy

[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.680]
having a good time. Exactly. When everybody was nice there, people know how to drive. I took

[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.760]
your advice. I rented a car there. You got to rent a car. No doubt about it. Sure.

[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.980]
I mean, to get anywhere in Vegas you need a car from one end to the fifth to the other no matter what.

[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.920]
Especially if you're looking for those great 7-11. Well, we didn't go any of those. The buffets are

[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:21.840]
tremendous. The fonts were great. The tables were great. And we came, we left with about 1200.

[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:29.080]
We came back for about six. So we did not miss it at all. We did real good. My wife left

[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.280]
the telephone first in Monday morning. We stayed at the Rio Mannington Place. Beautiful.

[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.780]
Oh, it's fantastic. Everybody keeps telling me about how great it is. I had one bad experience

[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.460]
in there one time and I just don't want to go back. I tell you what. I promise you give them

[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.880]
another chance but there are just too many great places to go. So why the hell should I waste my time

[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.900]
going on that though? It's a great place though. Beautiful. They got the buffet and iron there.

[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.920]
16 different world stations that you go to. They got everything imaginable in there.

[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.100]
Sounds good. I think I'm taking off for there for a couple of weeks. Sounds good to me.

[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.900]
Well, I'm already saving up for next year. I'm afraid to get back.

[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.400]
Maybe had a good time. All right. Thanks. Yeah. Everybody loves Vegas.

[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.020]
Oh, and how could they not unless you were sour push?

[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.000]
The Neil Roger Show Sports Radio.

[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.760]
560s. Q.A.M. Florida sucks.

[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.260]
Keeping through the keyhole. Watching mom and dad.

[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.300]
Keeping through the keyhole. The most time we ever had.

[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.380]
Mom and dad were playing tag right there on the bed.

[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.380]
Mommy used to have full bees as a pair of poor daddy's head.

[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.520]
Mommy's head was gobbin. She almost got whipped wash.

[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:41.720]
I don't know what she was drinking but you got a nutma stash.

[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.300]
They've been through the keyhole. I'm sure what I see.

[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.500]
What I'm sure do like it more. It's a big thing.

[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.140]
I'm TV.

[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.540]
Mom and dad were hooked together like my linking wands.

[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.380]
Was by my source something like that. Mom went yelling at the door.

[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.400]
God was breathing heavy. Mom was on her knees.

[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.640]
He must have had a poopful cause. She's just in where he pees.

[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.360]
He's been through the keyhole. Watching mom and dad.

[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.420]
Keeping through the keyhole. The most time we ever had.

[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.420]
Are we watching a little longer.

[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.320]
And I started to get sick.

[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.200]
If daddy's name is Helmer, why mom asked for it?

[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.320]
Daddy granted his iPhone back. Mommy wanted more.

[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.420]
She went back on top of him but all he did was snore.

[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.780]
He's been through the keyhole. Has a minute.

[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.400]
Dad, I can't wait to drive his dad on the door in my class.

[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:41.400]
Squared for it. I can't wait to drive his dad on the door in my class.

[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.600]
16 before 11 at 5.60 W to QM. You're happy new station for at least a few days anyway.

[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.540]
Yeah, no more of that crap between our new years. That's the resolution on this show.

[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.140]
We got Christmas day coming up. Are we working Christmas day?

[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.920]
No. New years come up working new years day?

[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:55.180]
No.

[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.820]
We know how to do it. We know how to get a maximum.

[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.060]
A maximize our time off. That's what it's all about.

[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.580]
Get the most money for the least time off. Or in Georgia's case,

[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.280]
get the least time off for the least money.

[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.060]
Anyway, that was for Glenn and Iowa.

[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.360]
For each of his ass off and I, Glenn was one of our regular factors.

[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.000]
How come our facts machine is like? Is that just that they're all coming like this now?

[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.320]
Is that an ink thing or is that just, huh? Well, don't worry about it.

[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.200]
Don't worry about it. Like I said, we're cheap.

[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.480]
Keith was one of our interns at the station. That maybe he's listening right now.

[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.840]
He leaves me and knows about the car solutions that he called the other day.

[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.420]
And he leaves me an article from Newsweek.

[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.180]
What is it from? Some magazine.

[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.780]
And at any rate, oh, let's live on, huh? Let's live online.com.

[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.020]
Or maybe the name of the magazine is let's look. Well, regardless,

[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.920]
it's got all these different diet bars and protein bars.

[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.960]
And his problem was that he said the car solutions, the shakes are great,

[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.400]
which is true in the bottles. They're great, although a little high in fat, but delicious.

[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.760]
And he says they're one bar. The protein bar they tried tasted like Schmidt.

[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.700]
Well, the chocolate one is the one that I tried that tasted okay.

[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.560]
They've also got like a peanut butter, which I never tried because I can't stand peanut butter.

[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.080]
And they got a couple of, so that's if you don't like the chocolate one, all I can tell you is

[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.880]
good luck to you because most of those things really suck.

[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.620]
But the comes solution shakes are delicious and they're at Walmart and Kmart and Publix and all

[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:32.300]
over the place. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Live.

[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.940]
If you go to any Marlins games this season is up all on theorodgers.com.

[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:42.840]
Not looking too good, John Henry. 90 votes so far. 57 people say never as in no chance.

[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.320]
26 said maybe one or two, maybe not two, you know, maybe one or two.

[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.760]
Five people said a few as in more than two, but less than a whole bunch.

[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.140]
And two people said many. And then the one guy they called two people said many.

[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.660]
And we're going to build a new stadium for this guy. No.

[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:05.420]
No. Well certainly isn't going to be able to compete with all these ridiculous salaries that are

[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.500]
going on out there, which of course is the end game it's all over with. Why don't you just cut your

[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.340]
losses, John Henry and just sell it to some other Schmuck who comes along and bail out.

[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.120]
You already lost half your money with your commodities. Half of that fortune disappeared.

[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.260]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.900]
Hello. Yes, sir. Good morning.

[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.500]
When is to you? I want to know if you could play a Titanic Victory.

[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.520]
Titanic. You got it. Thanks for having me. Okay, have a happy.

[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.700]
Oh, I'm Tommy from Titanic.

[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.700]
Thanks for the best Thai food and the best service.

[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.580]
As long as you're not black, comment down to Titanic or South Beach.

[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.920]
We know like black people. They don't keep well. Besides, why black people want to eat Thai food

[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:51.900]
anyway? We're not have fried chicken on the menu. Oh, wait. I forget. We have a spare ribs.

[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.460]
Look, Shane, I told you.

[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.180]
Cut us the ribs on menu. It's a battle.

[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.340]
So if you're not black, comment down to Titanic. Come to think of it.

[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.280]
First, damn gay people. We know like them either.

[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.540]
Should it keep food, but they talk too loud with funny lists.

[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.580]
They serve other customers. Not come back.

[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.680]
So no gay, no black.

[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:15.200]
And while we're at it, ladden people, you make reservations for seven 15.

[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.180]
Don't show up at 820 and expect you to table. We give it to someone else already.

[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.920]
Ladden people are always late. No black, no gay, no letter in Thai coming.

[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.820]
Enjoy your people. You stop bickering our bill.

[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.760]
Who cares who have what? Take away the anger. Let it outside.

[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.560]
Take 45 minutes to try to divide up bill.

[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.340]
We know one you hear. No Jew, no black, no fact, no Cuban.

[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.500]
And white people, you think you better than everybody else.

[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.600]
Come play too much if we don't kiss your ass.

[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.760]
You all know come back. No white, no black, no Jew, no Latino, no gay.

[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.600]
Everybody else for the best Thai food.

[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.060]
Come on down to Thai Tommy on the beach.

[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.320]
Hurry before we have to close.

[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.320]
She never reminds me that business about everybody gets their 15 seconds of fame.

[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.920]
Same thing here. That was a big stir for like a couple of weeks.

[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.100]
And then there was a little bit of a follow up.

[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.960]
And he gave us apology thing, a big solid and that was it.

[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.040]
Do we even know if he's still in business? Do we know that?

[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:09.640]
No, I don't know.

[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.340]
I mean, I wonder how they're doing. Do you care how they're doing?

[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.700]
No, see all I know all I would care about is if his food was good,

[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.400]
that's all I care about. racist pooks.

[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.080]
I guess you're not going to be in any time soon at the Amal Coast, huh?

[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.280]
They're not racist. I will. No, they're not. They're great.

[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.700]
But I just mentioned that in passing that George don't like five six seven anybody five six seven

[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.220]
oh five sixty. How about Jewish Chinese? Are there? Oh, there must be.

[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:45.060]
I guess there must be. That would a perfect match that would be.

[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:50.440]
Thirms Jews like Chinese food a lot. I'm going to be referring to the small penis.

[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.880]
Oh, no. I wouldn't know except for Milton Berlin, Goli.

[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.520]
Here's Orlando. Hello.

[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:57.960]
Hey, Neil. Yes sir.

[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.640]
I'm going. Okay. I'm surprised how Goldstein didn't mention you on Howard this morning.

[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.280]
Why is that?

[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.140]
I just thought he would give a shout out to you.

[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.740]
No, it was funny that he was on today because today was Howard's big announcement that he signed

[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.660]
for five more years. I was on with a Snoop Dogg dog.

[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.900]
But now, now, now, now has no shame. You know, he'll be the first one to admit. He has no shame at all.

[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.440]
It didn't sound like it. No.

[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.160]
Anyway, I wanted to make a request. Yes, sir.

[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.840]
Can you play the Phil Henry all you could eat and eat grow a bit?

[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.480]
You got it. Thank you. Okay.

[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.520]
So, Al was sucking around with Snoop's what?

[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.720]
Is doggy dog. Oh, but do you fear your nephew is in hell?

[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.440]
I see what in my nephew is.

[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.280]
In that one, so long as you're not with the Lord.

[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.200]
In other words, in hell.

[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:55.860]
I don't know. I see a known, a known, a known, and because they can't part his body, I remember.

[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.040]
You fear that that Roman Catholic communion is they ate your nephew's body?

[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:00.620]
Yes.

[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:06.500]
All right. We have on the light of Van Ice here a Roman Catholic priest on KFI in 640. Hello.

[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.760]
How you doing? Good.

[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:12.780]
Good. Listen, ma'am. First of all, I feel my condolences to you on the longs of your nephew.

[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:13.700]
Are you a priest?

[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:14.620]
Yes, I am.

[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.000]
Okay. So, I just want to let you express something for you.

[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:22.540]
So, this is just you've been missing from the bow.

[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.360]
That is right.

[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.740]
That is your people.

[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.020]
Well, if you just hang on, I will explain to you what I believe is and then you can draw your own conclusion.

[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.040]
But you eat people.

[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.940]
The least thing we're teaching is that you draw your own conclusion.

[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.520]
Let the father explain, okay?

[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:40.740]
Okay. First of all, we believe that when the deceased communion, we receive the body and blood

[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.920]
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.280]
Oh, my God.

[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.680]
Well, hold on, ma'am.

[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.860]
No, I mean, I'm just calling to let you know what I believe is you're a flesh and blood.

[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.660]
If you want to look at it, that way, that fine.

[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.580]
Oh, my God.

[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.100]
That's fine.

[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:52.900]
Oh, my God.

[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.600]
This is our belief and you draw your own conclusion.

[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.520]
I want to vomit.

[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.900]
Ma'am, you got to let the father explain.

[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.920]
Well, when I want to have a hearing, talk about it, the people that have missing form.

[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.820]
This is my shell razor, it's like clad, but they're young.

[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:10.240]
Okay, the hearing's sad because you've been missing from the bow.

[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.780]
What happened to your neck?

[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.800]
You need to tell it.

[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:13.880]
You eat the butt.

[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.360]
You eat the whole damn thing.

[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:15.700]

[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:16.920]
Excuse me?

[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:17.960]
Don't you eat it?

[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.460]
We eat the host.

[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:19.800]
Yes.

[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.400]
The host.

[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.160]
But he sees the whole body of the man.

[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.060]
That's not what they said.

[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.700]
You said you eat the blood and the flesh.

[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.120]
Of who?

[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:29.180]
Carman.

[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.220]
No, of Jesus Christ.

[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.060]
Oh, God.

[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.860]
That is a blasphemy.

[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.480]
What if he took the reason?

[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.640]
All I'm trying to do is influence the front of our belief

[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.320]
that he did that informed.

[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.700]
Do you eat a碰 the booty, too?

[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.200]
I'm not even answering that.

[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.000]
I don't understand what that means.

[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.380]
What does this man talk about eating the Lord Jesus?

[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:50.900]
I didn't finish.

[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.280]
Of them just saved me.

[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.520]
From the scriptures, man, where Jesus took bread and blessed it and broke it.

[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.640]
It said, take this and eat it.

[00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:59.860]
This is my body.

[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.280]
And then if there's a cup of wine, you said take and drink this is my blood.

[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.160]
And again, he says, unless you eat my body and drink my blood, you have no right to eat it.

[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.080]
Oh, my God.

[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.420]
This is good Friday.

[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.060]
Exactly.

[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.260]
And you're talking about eating the blood on Jesus.

[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.180]
I can tell you that.

[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.200]
For me, what we believe.

[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:19.960]
You grab it on Jesus, ain't you?

[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:20.700]
It won't.

[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.400]
Jesus to believe it.

[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.860]
Grab it all on Jesus.

[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.280]
It's got to take a second to the reason.

[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.200]
In my nephew, what about him?

[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.760]
Hey, man, I'm again.

[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:28.900]
I'm back in on Jesus.

[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.500]
And Catholics, blacked on my boy.

[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.300]
I'm a Mac Dunier.

[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.580]
Then Catholics, Mac, done your boy, huh?

[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.180]
You won't laugh in the middle.

[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.660]
And I'm just writing a Dutch class, and I'm here.

[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.860]
I feel a crack in here.

[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.580]
Like some kind of Negro smog is stored over there.

[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.580]
Well, I'll tell you.

[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.100]
Listen to that.

[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.420]
You look a brother, bus, oh, my God.

[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]
I'm here to follow you.

[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.720]
So, looking father, I thank you for taking the time.

[00:45:59.020 --> 00:45:59.720]
I really do.

[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.340]
I'm here to get these things.

[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.940]
Well, you pay for your sins.

[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.520]
Well, only better to die.

[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:05.980]
That's true.

[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:06.760]
Thanks, Father.

[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.320]
All right.

[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.560]
That was a Roman Catholic priest.

[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.180]
And Mac and on my boy, like a brother, bus, ain't you?

[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:13.900]
Oh, you can be.

[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.160]
What was it?

[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:28.580]
What do you call, man?

[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.720]
Oh, you can be Negro.

[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.000]
Oh, no.

[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.000]
Oh, you can eat me, bro.

[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.040]
Oh, God.

[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.380]
So, I understand.

[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.220]
Thank you very much.

[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:13.880]
And you're welcome.

[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.320]
Okay, 10, 54, 5, 60, WQ.

[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.260]
So, what exciting thing you think you have said on with Howard this morning?

[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.520]
I'm a fat Jew.

[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:20.940]
Yeah.

[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.380]
I'm a fat Jew.

[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:21.380]

[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:21.380]

[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:21.380]

[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.860]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on E18.

[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.060]
In fact, now we'll be there.

[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.520]
I know that his legion of fans will want to come and see how fatty still is.

[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.700]
And he's a lot for a thing to do tonight, 6 to 9 p.m.

[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.880]
And Davey, he'll be there bigger than life.

[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.480]
Here's Weston.

[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:37.680]
Hello.

[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:42.560]
In fact, I heard out this morning, and the funniest part about it was when they started asking him,

[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.440]
why are you breathing like that?

[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.800]
Are you going to be dying right here?

[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.020]
Yeah, every time you're with him,

[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.620]
whether he comes in here, whether you're having a meal with him,

[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.360]
every breath looks like it's going to be his last.

[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.740]
And it gets all ridden to face it, so you really have to see it.

[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.460]
He said something about maybe he was looking at Snoop Dogg's thigh

[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.440]
or something, and that was making him breathe heavy or something.

[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:00.800]
It might.

[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.360]
You mentioned earlier about how, you know, the best way to make money in this town

[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.860]
would be to open up the old fart store.

[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:08.320]
Uh-huh.

[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.580]
But I've had this idea.

[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.480]
I mean, open up a rascal dealership.

[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.180]
You know, the little motorized wheelchairs.

[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:14.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:18.600]
And have it out by, obviously you have to have it out by the near publics,

[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.000]
because that's where you see them all.

[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.720]
You have a rascal dealership, and you have special accessories,

[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.360]
like people who want to wear the cool sunglasses,

[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.900]
but they need bifocals, so instead of oakles, they can have bifocals.

[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.680]
And we have all these.

[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.600]
And don't forget the little bag to stick the sweet and low in the pickles in here.

[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.600]
Well, instead of a cup wrap, you have a clasp, clasp me bag wrap.

[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:37.920]
Yeah.

[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.640]
That all these types of things.

[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.060]
And you'd make a lot of money.

[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:46.600]
And in fact, I was going to ask you if you wanted to be able to put your name on the first rascal dealership we owe.

[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.260]
I'd be honored.

[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:47.940]
Okay, great.

[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:48.880]
I have a good time.

[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.100]
And it's a dealers choice as far as a request.

[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.920]
But I wanted to mention, I was a Vegas other day.

[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:55.340]
Yeah.

[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.760]
Actually, it was in July.

[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.960]
I want to say this was in July.

[00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:58.900]
I have a day in July.

[00:48:59.060 --> 00:48:59.640]
And I know that.

[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.740]
114 every day.

[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:02.400]
Oh, I know that.

[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.780]
You know what the beauty of Vegas though?

[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.860]
I was, I said it for five days.

[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.780]
They said the Mandelaid Bank.

[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.200]
I said a postcard to a friend.

[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.620]
I said, this is what the outside of this hotel looks like.

[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:11.660]
I wouldn't know.

[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.980]
I haven't been outside of this hotel.

[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:13.640]
That's right.

[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:14.680]
That's the way they like it.

[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.460]
You don't get it outside.

[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:16.020]
Okay.

[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:16.720]
Have a good one.

[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.260]
Zog is on.

[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.260]
That's right.

[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.940]
Who cares if it's 115 in the shade?

[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.200]
I mean, if you're after walking around on that, you deserve it.

[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.000]
Whatever you're talking about.

[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.440]
And it doesn't, it's dry.

[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.840]
You know, it only feels like 110.

[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.720]
It's not that bad.

[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.940]
1057 at 560 WQL.

[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.020]
420560 WQA and Miami Port Lauderdale.

[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.840]
A feasely broadcast group station.

[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.780]
WQA.com with a world.

[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.360]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.000]
Some people don't.

[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:57.800]
They don't have a clue.

[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:07.320]
They walk around with their head up that's loose.

[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:08.860]
Back them.

[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.720]
It's all way the same.

[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.600]
They're just looking for fame.

[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.060]
And they're not being up in the news.

[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.400]
Like the chronic from you.

[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.640]
Oh, the chronic from you.

[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:36.280]
Oh, it's the first time you're lying.

[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:45.540]
So you took a glass of catfish with half-folded fin.

[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.680]
We'll be waiting for you here tonight.

[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.360]
Just come on up with your green corvette.

[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:56.620]
We?

[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.540]
We? You and what army of little yamu, sir?

[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.780]
We? All your friends?

[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.260]
Why don't you stand up like you're on?

[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.200]
It's always we.

[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.860]
You got all your buddies.

[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.300]
We do stand on our own.

[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.780]
We? There's that we again, man.

[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.340]
Are you speaking French or English?

[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.780]
We? We?

[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:16.540]
We are.

[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.440]
We are. There we go.

[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.000]
We are.

[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.900]
You sound like Dan Klaillows, sir.

[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.120]
You can't even spell us.

[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.860]
You don't want to rob Steve Klaillows on the radio.

[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.400]
And you know where you go?

[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.300]
Where was that?

[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.160]
Take us and we?

[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.880]
We? You sound like Dan Babyd.

[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.240]
Are you and Luther?

[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.360]
Are you an interest, sir?

[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.500]
I think you've been up an interest with Dan Babyd.

[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.500]
You want to millenileve?

[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.120]
Wait for them all.

[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.180]
Some people don't.

[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.120]
They go down the roof.

[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.540]
They walk all around.

[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.020]
With their head up backwards.

[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.700]
They're just looking for things.

[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.360]
And they love the old news.

[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.660]

[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.100]

Which is good.

[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.140]
Which is good because it keeps them off the roads anyway.

[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:43.020]
There it is

[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.560]
So I can't find that way you ought to understand this bitch

[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.560]
I was just going to kill you

[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.460]
I was just going to kill you

[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.100]
I was just going to kill you

[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.920]
I was just going to kill you

[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.440]
Six and a half after 11 at 5.60 WQAM

[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.000]
5.607.05.60 the lines are all working today baby

[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.200]
It's party time we have real reason to celebrate this is a shocking

[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.820]
I don't know what the screamer reached your key to this banana

[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:11.640]
Don't forget we got Hank coming up at 2.00 Hank with Dave Wantsett

[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:14.440]
Who's very quietly doing a pretty damn good job if you ask me

[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.020]
Dave Wantsett showed 5

[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.240]
John Bukeschabi at 6.00 Panther preview at 7.00

[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:23.960]
If we have Panther preview at 7.00 with that means those are a hockey game at 7.30

[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.260]
Panthers at the penguins

[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:32.480]
And I have a feeling the penguins might be in a pretty sour pissed off mood after getting knocked around and pounded by the least 7 to 4 the other night

[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.640]
Nothing I want to start like the voice of doom

[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.460]
But the Panthers at the penguin 7.30 80K after the hockey game

[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.440]
Think the Panthers have a shot tonight?

[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:41.760]
No!

[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.400]
Come on!

[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.640]
Here's a mobile in tempered pine

[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.320]
Hi, how are you going?

[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.560]
Hi, I'm Brian and Terry Murray

[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.320]
I was wondering if you could play we love you Panthers

[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.260]
Oh yeah!

[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.480]
Because they're so great this year

[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.580]
And I love Panthers

[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.620]
I think Pucks would pick it to go to the games

[00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.440]
Okay, thank you

[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.140]
You got it, I think that up is one of those things

[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.440]
Do you know which one it is?

[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.100]
No

[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:05.320]
Three

[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.060]
Is it?

[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:09.700]
Are you sure?

[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:10.960]
Positive

[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.920]
Seriously, okay, well right after the break, that's excellent

[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.440]
See, so far today we haven't had anybody call it with a little hairy on that Joe Corroyo thing

[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.760]
But of course I came through, I mean George came through on that

[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.460]
Because that's one of the things that's very frustrating is that when we do this, which is not all that often

[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:28.000]
But when you do it like an all-request day

[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.440]
And then people will call it like, what's that bit?

[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.500]
What a guy's got his finger up his sister's ass and the

[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:36.720]
And it takes like a half hour to figure out where the hell it is

[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.800]
Or what it is, but kill some good time

[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.920]
Eight minutes after 11 at 5.60 W.A.M

[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.360]
Why don't you go back to Canada you cute boss?

[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.100]
All right

[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.840]
We love you Panthers

[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:57.520]
We'll get to do the way you get it for

[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.700]
And follow through

[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:04.540]
You'll have your family cut in through

[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:05.800]
Are you sure?

[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.960]
Oh, Panthers, we love you

[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:15.320]
We love you, Melanie, you're very bad

[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.160]
We'll make this season clear of the red

[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:25.400]
You are my very favorite cat

[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:29.520]
God, now and be aware of it

[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.640]
That we love you, Melanie

[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.460]
Oh, yes we do

[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:40.340]
The way you see way for can ramp her too

[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.240]
And that short hand it goes

[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.540]
What fool?

[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:51.140]
Still and we love you

[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:57.200]
What a dancer so easy to love

[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:01.300]
Cause they play with us at five

[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:06.100]
We love you, Ellie, you can't be me

[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:10.560]
And when he's born and gone in game three

[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:16.160]
The whole arena cured with me

[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.200]
Hey, today you're gonna be me

[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.200]
And be me, be me

[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.940]
We love you, me, her, mine

[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.240]
I can't really move

[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:31.540]
Like a flower in a sunny room

[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:34.680]
We're gonna fly again

[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:35.880]
Freelcy

[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.200]
Right, me, her, mine

[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.560]
We love you

[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:48.780]
Oh, I can't believe it

[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.840]
Cause they play with us at five

[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.500]
We love you, be me, her, oh, yes we do

[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:01.300]
With your stack in hand, you're a club in two

[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.440]
We'll get the credit where it's due

[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.780]
And we love you

[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.780]
We love you, darling, we do

[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.520]
Oh, yes we do

[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.460]
We'll be both of the year

[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.700]
Because it's true

[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.420]
You brought us all this way

[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.780]
Oh, oh, oh, can't really love you

[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.100]
Goodbye, Brian Murray

[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.900]
You killed the team

[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.440]
And you wouldn't snow good hockey

[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.760]
If it's with you

[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.380]
On the ass for a coach

[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.620]
You are a stupid part

[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.820]
Bill Corey must be nuts

[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.020]
To keep you on it

[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.380]
You put in Spanish your check for

[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:02.100]
Never find the team

[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.380]
That at one time had all the right snow

[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.880]
And it won't be too late

[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.620]
For us to celebrate

[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:15.400]
When you're the one stagerains

[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.220]
And when you leave

[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.900]
Don't forget Christmas

[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.620]
Your hockey queen

[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.660]
You thought that you would do

[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.380]
Santa and Santa's play

[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:32.420]
And when the fate does

[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.760]
And anymore

[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.900]
There's no one left to play

[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:36.960]
And it's all right

[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.400]
Goodbye, Brian Murray

[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.560]
You can't admit that

[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.240]
You don't know

[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.120]
about running all hockey

[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.360]
And you're not interested in hearing why

[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.100]
But no matter how you try

[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.540]
You can't deny that

[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.420]
You made the Santa's joke

[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.440]
Because you make a lousy coach

[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.760]
And as a manager

[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.820]
You really

[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.460]
Close

[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.340]
And it's too late

[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.420]
For us to celebrate

[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.680]
When you're the one stagerains

[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.820]
And when you leave

[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.220]
Don't forget Christmas

[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:26.120]
Your hockey queen

[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.240]
You thought that you

[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.720]
You thought that you

[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.400]
You thought that you would do

[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.060]
Santa and Santa

[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.100]
And anymore

[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.500]
There's no one left to play

[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.260]
It's pathetic and that's a compliment

[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.220]
1160 and 560 WKM

[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.020]
In fact, I was asked in Georgia before the show this morning

[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.940]
How many games do you think the Panthers will win this year?

[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.120]
Yeah, that's what he said

[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.880]
I also just told me some very bad news

[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.320]
I'm sitting here just salivating

[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.320]
Because I'm on the food channel

[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.500]
And they're just my luck

[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.380]
They're making all kinds of ice cream Sundays

[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:02.460]
And butterscotch Sundays in whipped cream

[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.940]
And cakes and pies and stuff

[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.420]
And Georgia is just

[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:07.980]
Excuse me in the bad news

[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.520]
You said it's a bit of a good thing you're on that channel

[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.640]
Because if you're watching that now do I dare just for a commercial

[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.680]
Now you won't see anything

[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.640]
Oh, that's a commercial now good

[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.540]
Let me go back, return to sender

[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.260]
How about is it?

[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.420]
Xerox down, Motorola down, everything's down

[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.260]
Well, down doesn't

[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.340]
Tell me anything

[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.380]
Like down to 6 for Xerox or less

[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.940]
What do you mean down to 6 or less?

[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.260]
It was 4 bucks a couple of weeks ago

[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.680]
Who cares about Xerox?

[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.500]
They're going out of business anyway. What do I care about them?

[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.680]
I've written that off

[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:37.720]
Another back

[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.040]
Oh, they're back?

[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.500]
Let me just take a quick, you'll be sorry that you made me do this

[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.160]
Because I've been in such a damn good mood on more

[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:45.640]
Yeah

[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.480]
It's about even 1130 yet

[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.460]
And the down is down 186 and the next is down 96

[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.820]
Why the hell did you make me do that?

[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.400]
Yeah, we'll have it

[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.040]
And of course we got to do I don't want to say his name in there

[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.640]
We got new in there now

[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:00.740]
Nice start there sweetheart

[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.860]
Nice start

[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.420]
Here's a mobile in Miami

[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.520]
Hello, Neil

[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.100]
Yes sir

[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.600]
I'm still getting over there snacking on Jesus bit

[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.600]
Oh my god, I almost lost it

[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.580]
Are you? Yeah

[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.700]
Listen, I'd like to make a request for big dick in Marco Island

[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.000]
How about the hot dick insider?

[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.700]
Okay

[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.700]
This guy with a one track mine, it sounds like to me

[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.200]
Now is that bit called hot? Oh, I see

[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.460]
Let me make sure I got which one was it?

[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:34.540]
Dickens

[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.020]
Fruit stands

[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:40.320]
Now I know what that one's called, I'm just wondering which dick he was

[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.480]
Hell, hey, hey, I'm Spagged

[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.260]
And you know what, I'm driving down Routin W on a hot summer day

[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.000]
Me and the missus all went stop at Dickens

[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.180]
Fruit stands

[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.080]
They've got everything from fruit to vegetables, homemade pies

[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.760]
But there is nothing like their cider

[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.100]
Ain't that right honey?

[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.820]
Dickens cider

[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.600]
Yes sir, why even though we were late for church last Sunday?

[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.100]
She had to have a little dick insider

[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.660]
She says the ring was the black

[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.980]
Even my minister says this wife enjoys a little dick insider now and then

[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:18.520]
Hey, why don't you bring some home and our protective plastic rib bottle

[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.800]
That way it'll stay fresh

[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.760]
Or you can let it sit awhile and have some hard dick insider

[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.880]
It's good at lunch, good at dinner

[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.440]
And there's nothing like waking up with a dick insider

[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.780]
Dickens fruit stands

[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.800]
Just to have fruit 9 W and country road 6 to 9

[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.480]
Open 24 hours

[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.720]
Because after a chillish summer night

[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.600]
I like to snuggle up in bed with a hot dick insider

[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.620]
Mmm

[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.320]
Now let me say that bit of course

[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.000]
Was it hot dick and big pine

[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.980]
Was it big? I get confused

[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.020]
I got a backward I think

[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.260]
Sometimes you have a tough time keeping your

[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.000]
Straight

[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.260]
Anyway bad news on the market because there's just a little teeny time

[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.260]
They didn't like that the CPI number this morning

[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.640]
Whatever the hell that number was the core inflation rate

[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.520]
And this one and that one it went up just a little

[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.020]
So there's a little bit of inflation around

[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.180]
They're smelling it

[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.800]
And therefore they're in a big panic

[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.400]
Because now the Alan Greenspan and the Fed

[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.320]
Not going to cut interest rates and they're going to go to a neutral bias

[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.760]
And the moon is in Uranus

[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.500]
And papa papa it's all scam

[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.260]
Man it's all a big fat goddamn scam

[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.020]
I'm warning you right now

[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.000]
Don't get started with a stock market crap

[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.480]
Just because a few people got lucky

[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.940]
Out of bunch of phantom bogus stocks for a few months

[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.760]
Don't get sucked in there like I did

[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.280]
Like I did by a guy who's in love with all these phantom tech stocks

[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.500]
Don't ever do it

[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.000]
Try to tell that to George this morning

[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.100]
Like when Dearyl said oh just I don't want to just a couple lines

[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.060]
Yeah sure Dearyl

[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.080]
I'm in I'm up

[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.540]
The amount of money

[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:50.360]
The amount of money that you have in there

[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.460]
There's George every morning George comes in and he's got

[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:58.180]
In the market he's got these four little tiny tiny like not penny stocks

[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.320]
But yeah fine

[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.480]
Well that's fine how much are you going to get hurt with that

[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.480]
And that's as far as you want it to go believe

[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.840]
Exactly don't get involved in all this other stuff

[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.580]
All you have to do is turn it on like this morning

[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.800]
They had a guy from the Chicago border trade in there

[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.620]
And they're in the background behind him

[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.180]
And the noise is just unbearable

[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.700]
And they're screaming and waving and carrying on

[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.600]
Is this your idea of what you want to happen with your money?

[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.860]
No I don't think so

[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.060]
I don't think so

[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.720]
Here's my any hello

[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.360]
How you doing Neil?

[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:28.700]
Great

[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.680]
I'm happy to hear you

[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.540]
I'm sorry

[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:35.180]
Yeah

[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:40.100]
Okay

[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.220]
He was happy to hear me in a good mood until he called

[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.760]
I'm still in a good mood I know it's going to take a crap

[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.380]
You can see that before it opens this morning

[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.720]
They're already making excuses

[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.680]
And we're going to have a recession

[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.420]
And everything's going to be in the crapper and that's it

[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.160]
Life goes on

[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:58.840]
It's only money

[01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.760]
$50,000

[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.200]
$5,670,000, $560

[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.480]
It's all request Friday here at WQAN

[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.480]
Tuesday night, pizza lot six to nine

[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.020]
Now Goldstein will be there with my keys

[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.680]
Here's Miami

[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.020]
Hello

[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:14.800]
Miami

[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.900]
Yes sir

[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.560]
Tell me you're talking about a product called low carbs

[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.420]
No

[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.740]
Well as you mentioned it this morning

[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.800]
I talked about a product called carb solution

[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.820]
Oh, carpsilocyte

[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:32.440]
Could I ask you, is that okay for diabetics?

[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:32.800]
Sure

[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:33.780]
Good

[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:37.340]
Why wouldn't it be? It's got that's the whole idea that it's got almost no carbs in it

[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.900]
That's why I've been drinking it

[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.920]
Great and you told me it's the cell that's been popular

[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.200]
Public's Walmart came out great great

[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.680]
And one thing I meant we listened to the people talking about Vegas

[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.980]
Not only Vegas but they get a chance to take a little side trip to Lake Powell

[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.180]
Beautiful yeah

[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:55.640]
Yes

[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.300]
Not this time of the year

[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:57.920]
Okay thanks

[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.120]
Not this time of the year

[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.020]
Man the roads up there the winding roads in the mountains

[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:03.860]
When there's one

[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.920]
There's one on the way between

[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.060]
Where the hell is it?

[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.320]
Between Sacramento I guess?

[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.300]
Where the hell is it coming from?

[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.340]
And the road you just have to come to an end

[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.380]
Otherwise it's bye bye

[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.620]
You're coming to an end of the road and stop

[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.220]
And almost make a turn right in the mountains

[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.560]
Beautiful thing just don't go there in a winter time

[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:26.920]
56670560.560 on the 18t and Verizon wireless line

[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.220]
Here's a mobile and highly a garden

[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:30.960]
Hello

[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.820]
Yeah, Pioneer, a payment list

[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:33.480]
Yes sir?

[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.440]
Brittany going down on Baba

[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.380]
Brittany going down on Baba

[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:39.940]
Yeah Brittany going to the Clinton

[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:41.260]
What else is that called?

[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.080]
Don't be sorry

[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.420]
I'll find it for you

[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.780]
Thank you, I'll be great for you

[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.200]
I can't find the bubble hopes he does

[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.700]
Baba stiffed him in England there and they have pub for 35 bucks

[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.020]
They said 35 bucks

[01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:56.640]
I find that

[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.180]
How can it only be 35 bucks?

[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.300]
He had a whole entourage in there

[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.200]
Well whatever the tab was they went in there had a few pops and

[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.760]
Walked out

[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.920]
And I guess his attitude was

[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.280]
And 35 bucks is a pretty damn small amount

[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.280]
A few pounds, a few shillings, whatever it is

[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.400]
For bailing your line the asses out two wars in a row

[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.360]
Okay, that's the least you can do

[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.740]
And then some British newspaper came along and picked up the tab

[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:23.180]
See that's how dull it is, that's the kind of stories they're reporting now

[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.820]
What's that Brittany and Baba thing?

[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.440]
What is it? It must be the one that we do

[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.760]
No, it's not in there

[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.760]
We'll find it

[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.500]
Here's Sunrise, hello

[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:34.520]
Hello?

[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.340]
Yes sir?

[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.840]
Hey Neil, thank you for playing that Panther song

[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.560]
I almost brought a tear from my eye

[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.680]
I know, almost

[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.760]
More a lot of tears to my eyes when they started singing about Robbie Needomar

[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.260]
Every time I hear them name it

[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.740]
Is there any chance that Lemieux will make his debut tonight against the Panthers?

[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.000]
No

[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.860]
No, he's not going to come back to where next week

[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.320]
They said maybe the 27th and of course my luck they're playing in Toronto that night

[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.580]
Oh well, I was hoping maybe we could have some excitement tonight in the game

[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.220]
Well there'll be some excitement I'm not so sure which side it will be in

[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.680]
I'm not going to be supplying any of those

[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.400]
I'm going to be able to come from the other side

[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:06.640]
Yeah

[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.480]
All right, well thanks a lot and go Panthers

[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:13.100]
Okay, good luck to us, go Panthers but don't just, you know, don't be angry about it

[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.860]
Because the only good games they play now for the most part are on the road

[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:16.940]
Not that many of them, but

[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.080]
Hey listen, that's going to be great

[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.820]
Just hang on tight, hang in there and go and buy those tickets

[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.980]
Wayne wants your money, the new owner is going to want your money

[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:27.740]
We can't do anything now, I mean if play 29 games they've already won five, what do you want?

[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.240]
Huh? That's not too bad, they play 29 and they won five

[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.640]
And if they play another 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 or 100 they might win another 3 or 4

[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.360]
So what do you tell you I can about?

[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.800]
Just give the man your money, just line up there at the door when they decide to open up the doors

[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.100]
When they're good and ready and open up the gates they'll let you in and buy a whole bunch of that

[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:49.180]
Perfinated there, the shirts and the jackets and all that over price merchandise, come on

[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.460]
Because that's what America is all about, it's about commerce and the way that markets going is again

[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.780]
So now you've picked my interest, I wish you wouldn't have done that

[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:57.380]
But I'm going to get all depressed

[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.500]
Oh, it's still a, oh boy

[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:05.180]
Well that's still 26, 31, that's not very good, but which looks like it's to be about 1500

[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:07.680]
But until the dog gets back to about 5, 6,000

[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.380]
See the smaller the numbers are the easier it is to keep track of

[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:19.220]
This is 560 QAF, but Neil Rogers shows you sports radio 560 QAF

[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:38.980]
Hehe, catch up

[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:38.980]

[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.280]
1129 and 560

[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.140]
WQM all request Friday not turning that marketing on again one more time am I

[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:17.580]

[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.760]
I have the bottom five, you drinking poo.

[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.600]
Look at my face, sir, it's been about the breath limit.

[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.040]
I'm a hunk, it's been dead.

[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.420]
I love you, poo.

[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.460]
Boy, are you gonna miss him?

[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:05.760]
I'll tell you that I already missed him.

[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.740]
1131 at 560 WQM.

[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:09.620]
Now here's a great cooking show, Multimario.

[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.680]
You ever watched Multimario?

[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:11.380]
No.

[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.060]
Well that's because it's a real cooking show.

[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.540]
Because he reads like real attention.

[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:15.880]
And he really makes great stuff.

[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.880]
In fact, he's making the first pasta right now.

[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.580]
See this shows you watch, like Aaron Chef.

[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.140]
Now please don't tell me you watch Emerald.

[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:24.960]
No, I don't like cooking shows.

[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.300]
I don't watch any cooking show except Iron Chef.

[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.020]
Yeah.

[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.220]
Fun and funny.

[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:31.460]
Yeah.

[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.740]
It's funny to laugh at those people.

[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.800]
Well, how about the two abroad's?

[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.420]
The one that just...

[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.100]
Oh, yeah.

[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.280]
That's a magic used to watch them.

[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.200]
They were funny when they were in a trip.

[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.320]
One of them just croaked.

[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:40.840]
Well, they were.

[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:41.760]
They were smoking.

[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.300]
Is that a little bit of time, yeah?

[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.940]
And probably too much of that dick.

[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.200]
Too much of that British cuisine.

[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.220]
But at any rate, if you are in the cooking show,

[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.700]
this is a real great show, Multimario.

[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.060]
But that essence of Emerald, man, I see him.

[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:53.800]
And I just...

[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.620]
I'm not just pissed off at him, but I'm pissed off at the people that suck up to him.

[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.920]
This guy, first of all, the people that know the real chefs and the people that know how to cook a meal,

[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:05.500]
even five who eggs, he couldn't cook his way out of a paper sack number one.

[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.620]
And number two, that's Stale Acta, his...

[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:07.880]
Bam!

[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.660]
Kickin' up a couple of glasses, bam!

[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.400]
And they're all sucking his ass, man.

[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.900]
And you know how much I love Yorkers.

[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.420]
Yeah, oh, he just makes my skin crawl.

[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.340]
But at least he's humble.

[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:18.860]
Yeah, that's true.

[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.200]
And his ex-wife, Alex, all that money.

[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.440]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T Inforizon Wireless Line.

[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:30.520]
Yeah, he got divorced recently because his wife said it would look too many few...

[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.380]
Too few many...

[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:31.800]
What is it?

[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.120]
Too many bams going on that show?

[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:33.700]
Whatever, huh?

[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.140]
And he just said...

[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.040]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T Inforizon, that's a good move, you know?

[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:46.840]
And I said it's all request-fighting, not amnesty or comedy-fighting, asshole.

[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.240]
Here's a mobile and fort-laughter deal, huh?

[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:51.640]
Uh, Neil.

[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:52.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.280]
Just one of which you and George have to holiday...

[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.000]
And the same to you...

[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.860]
And the same to you, even though I don't celebrate the AT&T's even holidays, but that's okay.

[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.920]
And I want to make a statement for questions for grandma's 34.

[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.420]
Grandma's 34?

[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:06.460]
Yeah.

[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.980]
Is that any of a bit, George?

[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.020]
Yes, and it's in there.

[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.240]
Oh, that thing.

[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.140]
That's what it's called.

[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.920]
I'm so in peace for daddy's AT&T.

[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.960]
Martin High School.

[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.720]
I go to Grandma's house, daddy's school is two-three.

[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.160]
She's such a beautiful, kind of AT&T-D.

[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.100]
Grandma has studied in AT&T's ten.

[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.940]
She helped clean her pores.

[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:41.140]
She's a good AT&T-D, the children of the SMAT-NEE.

[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.880]
Grandma's 34.

[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:44.360]
A while.

[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.740]
When mom goes to bars, she needs to say D-D.

[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.580]
Get girls out tonight.

[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.520]
Mommy has the sisters younger than me.

[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.600]
My uncle's birthday was at Tiki-Tiki's.

[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.160]
His mommy gets lucky and brings someone home.

[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.600]
I sleep on the floor.

[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.660]
I have three younger brothers.

[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.700]
I'll see another and grandma's 34.

[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:19.080]
You and me, baby, doing a play in the front bin.

[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.880]
And please don't tell anyone that I am your president.

[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.380]
You and me, baby, let's do it like the Kennedy.

[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.420]
I'll proud you if I could.

[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.660]
Like Mary Jo's dust-packed seat.

[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.100]
You and me, baby, can't do it like the Ghana.

[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:42.000]
And have us a peanut cake, bang if you want.

[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.900]
I'm basically freaking to re-enblood hum gang.

[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.500]
25-pill-nune at 5.60 WDQM from Philadelphia.

[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:50.580]
But they had to go to Europe to make a big smash.

[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.640]
And of course they didn't actually edit out all their videos over there

[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.640]
and bleep out all the, uh, worsen or music.

[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.420]
But hey, this is America.

[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.520]
When it doubt bleep it out, that's our motto because we're very uptight about words

[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.960]
and it's great democracy of ours.

[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:05.180]
Very, very uptight.

[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.020]
Here's a mobile and fort waterdale.

[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:08.360]
Hello.

[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.540]
And Neil.

[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:10.180]
Yes.

[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.220]
How are you?

[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:12.000]
Okay.

[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.920]
I just want to say, um, happy new, happy Christmas.

[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.800]
Mary New Year.

[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.680]
Happy New Year, yeah.

[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.480]
No more sports, no more politics is good weed and good sex.

[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.180]
But I got to have a request.

[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:23.760]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.900]
All you can eat Negro and...

[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.360]
I just got through, I just got through planted.

[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.320]
Oh, they do?

[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:28.700]
Yes.

[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:30.580]
I then just play something for me.

[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:33.500]
Whatever you play is good and George W is a POS.

[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:33.920]
Okay.

[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:40.000]
5.607.05.60, pound 5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:42.080]
How about all you can eat Negro?

[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:42.500]
What do you say?

[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:42.840]
Okay.

[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:44.780]
Here's Miami.

[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.120]
Hello.

[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:48.960]
Yeah.

[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:50.760]
Holy One.

[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.080]
That's how we go.

[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:52.960]
It's one, one little one.

[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:54.740]
Hi, Alia.

[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.000]
Hello.

[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.120]
Hi, Alia.

[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.120]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:58.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.200]
How are you?

[01:19:59.340 --> 01:19:59.600]
Okay.

[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.480]
Enjoy your show.

[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.080]
Mm-hmm.

[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.740]
And I would like to request that little bit that you have with the sevens of the lambs.

[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.420]
What they call the plastic surgeon.

[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.320]
The plastic surgery people.

[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:10.920]
Yeah.

[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.100]
Oh, you're talking about that body augmentation?

[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:14.640]
Right.

[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.280]
Okay.

[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:16.940]
Thank you.

[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:17.960]
And have a happy life.

[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:18.860]
Thank you.

[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:20.960]
This is Gabby.

[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:21.860]
Hello, everybody.

[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.500]
I'm interested in getting some operations done.

[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:25.300]
Okay.

[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.100]
And some body contouring and some liposuction.

[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.240]
Mm-hmm.

[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.560]
And I was wondering if you could tell me to talk.

[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:35.460]
And lip augmentation cosmetic progress sits at the face of all of these things.

[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.040]
Mm-hmm.

[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:37.220]
And I was wondering.

[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.460]
Well, you like to share it with.

[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.900]
Well, I need to get everything done.

[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:45.360]
And probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.

[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:46.900]
Okay, we don't do that.

[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:47.360]
No.

[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.260]
Could you do breast implants, though?

[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.400]
Uh, it can't be done.

[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.920]
The day I'm not there, it would be right away.

[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.840]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:55.680]
Mm-hmm.

[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:56.960]
How much?

[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:58.500]
Uh, 5,000.

[01:20:58.880 --> 01:20:59.240]
Excellent.

[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:01.660]
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced, too.

[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:02.380]
Uh-huh.

[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.380]
Laser surgery.

[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.240]
Uh-huh.

[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.380]
Have the lambs stop crying yet, mommy?

[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:08.660]
Excuse me?

[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.620]
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.

[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.100]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.860]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.

[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:17.780]
Okay.

[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.020]
Can you make me look more like a woman?

[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.960]
Well, we'll have to see you first, and then if I'm looking actually we can tell you that we'll only see you.

[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.020]
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?

[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:29.820]
Uh, if you'd like to.

[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.080]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.460]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:34.580]
Yes.

[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:35.400]
Okay.

[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.360]
Um, there is a $100 consultation fee.

[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.140]
That's fine.

[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.320]
Okay.

[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:42.960]
Okay.

[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.920]
Um, my name is Buffaloville.

[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.960]
Okay, let me get a little information from you.

[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:48.240]
Okay.

[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.400]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.440]
I understand.

[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.960]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.780]
Do you want to come in for a consultation fee?

[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.160]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:02.300]
Uh, okay.

[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:04.400]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:04.660]
No, no, no.

[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:05.380]
You want to call me back?

[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:05.640]
Yeah.

[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.380]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.020]
I understand.

[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.880]
I got my skin suit and it's like, you know.

[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.180]
Bill.

[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:14.880]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:16.160]
I understand that.

[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:16.580]
Would you like to.

[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:18.740]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.400]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.420]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.260]
Okay.

[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.160]
I will talk to you in the time.

[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:24.520]
Okay.

[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:26.460]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:27.240]
Hello.

[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.120]
So what do you think it was really trying to say?

[01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:33.260]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:34.200]
Oh, okay.

[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.200]
21-tonon is 560 WQAM.

[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.500]
This is 560 QAF.

[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.820]
It's Friday, you're fast, dude.

[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:49.680]
Guys are staring at footjores.

[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:53.600]
It's a 5-5-5-3-0 door.

[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.180]
She saw her doctor.

[01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.600]
She filled her up.

[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:03.880]
So she saw that small baby boy.

[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.000]
She said, she's a girl.

[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:11.560]
She's a girl.

[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.120]
She said, she's a girl.

[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.480]
And I think that she's a virgin.

[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:19.980]
She's a star.

[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.060]
She's a star.

[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:21.100]

[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:21.680]
She's a star.

[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:22.100]
She's a star.

[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:22.400]
She's a star.

[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.600]
She's a star.

[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.280]
She's a star.

[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:29.720]
She's a star.

[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.400]
She's a star.

[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:33.160]
She's a star.

[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:34.780]
She's a star.

[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:38.260]
17-tonon at 560 WQAM.

[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.200]
That'd be a good poll question.

[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.060]
Would you rather change the outcome of the election

[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:43.520]
or spend a weekend in the sack with Britney Spears?

[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.040]
Should've done that poll today, you know?

[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.140]
So to speak.

[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.000]
560-7-0560, pound 560.

[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:51.800]
See this thing with washing the cars.

[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.540]
Oh, there it goes.

[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.340]
One moment, please.

[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.020]
No, that's all right.

[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:57.540]
Take your time.

[01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:58.440]
It'll kill some good time.

[01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.960]
Durgers monitor around the hall.

[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.500]
Another thing with washing the cars is a bitch now,

[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.720]
because now we got this water embargo, whatever.

[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:06.680]
What do you call that?

[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:08.440]
What do we call that?

[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:08.700]
Passionate.

[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:09.840]
No, it's not.

[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.160]
Yeah, it is rationing, I guess.

[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:11.980]
It's just shorts.

[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:12.800]
I like calling it in the car.

[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.300]
That's what I'm shortage.

[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.760]
I know what that is.

[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.800]
It's because it rains like crazy like it did here,

[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.640]
but not up by the lake.

[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:19.600]
The mistake by the lake?

[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:20.760]
Well, I'm sorry.

[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:21.320]
That's Orlando.

[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.260]
But at any rate,

[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.080]
what the hell do you do?

[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.440]
Because you can't wash your own car,

[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.680]
unless you want to get up four o'clock in the morning and do it.

[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:29.920]
What kind of hours are those?

[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.620]
You can wash your car and not even the addresses.

[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:35.380]
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday,

[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.540]
whatever the hell day is,

[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:37.980]
between four and eight in the morning.

[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.320]
The sprinklers, that's not a problem,

[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.580]
because even a more on-life making said to the guy at the end of the car.

[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.220]
But washing the car?

[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.520]
So I guess you have to do a commercial thing, right?

[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:48.820]
Doesn't affect them, am I correct?

[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.620]
I don't know.

[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:51.260]
No.

[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.460]
See, that's why I'm asking.

[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.760]
Because I hate to think that anybody would be like the location,

[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:00.060]
violating the embargo slash rationing, whatever, locations are what?

[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.640]
These car wash places that are in a standard location.

[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:03.920]
Yeah.

[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.160]
The guys that drive around supposedly recycle the water.

[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:09.160]
Supposedly.

[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.800]
That's why they're off the hook.

[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.080]
They recycle the water?

[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.600]
That's what I understand.

[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:14.760]
Yeah, I know it sounds like...

[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:15.280]
How do you do that?

[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.200]
How do they get all this?

[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.360]
You don't have to go to a filter and dust,

[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.140]
put it on there again.

[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:18.820]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:19.780]
Jesus Christ!

[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.660]
They run it through a filter.

[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.800]
This is what I heard.

[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.380]
I don't want to talk about it.

[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:25.280]
I'm like a horse job to me.

[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:25.600]

[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8.

[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.120]
They have no power out in California.

[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.060]
It's Florida Flare.

[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.300]
California Flickering Light.

[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.100]
They're doing brown outs and black outs.

[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.340]
And yellow outs.

[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:38.740]
Because they've got a lot of asians over there.

[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.560]
And then we got no water here in Florida.

[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.080]
Not that there are any problems you understand.

[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:44.960]
And of course, what's not be considered about the environment?

[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.080]
See, there he goes again.

[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.580]
Now, what's Mario making here?

[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:49.320]
Worry not.

[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:50.860]
Molten's here.

[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:51.720]
See, there he goes.

[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.400]
Here's Quincy.

[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:55.680]
Hello.

[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:56.880]
Hello?

[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:57.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:58.120]
Quincy, where?

[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.600]
Quincy, Florida.

[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.940]
Quincy, Florida, where's that?

[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.360]
Just a little west of Tallahassee.

[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.100]
Are you cereal?

[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:06.080]
I'm dead cereal.

[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:06.600]
All right.

[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.700]
I've been a long time listening when I lived in South Florida

[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.020]
and I've never gotten a chance to call.

[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:18.560]
But I had a spy report from back in Austin.

[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.340]
I was in August to give it if you're interested.

[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:20.760]
Okay.

[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:25.220]
I got on a plane to go from Tallahassee to West Palm Beach

[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:28.100]
when those little hopper flight.

[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:28.960]
Puddle jumpers, yeah.

[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:29.320]

[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:35.380]
And, well, you know, a little wakers lady, whatever she is,

[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.300]
making a speech before the flight takes off.

[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:44.300]
And she's in the middle of the part about no cell phone.

[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.680]
You should turn it off now.

[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.260]
Well, you got this old son of a bitch in front of me,

[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.060]
just constantly talking on the cell phone.

[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:57.720]
And the lady's looking right at him as she's saying this stuff.

[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.600]
So, he finally turns it off and gets to West Palm.

[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.200]
I get off the plane and there's that old bastard again,

[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.080]
right back on the cell phone.

[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.840]
So, I go to get the baggage and who is it?

[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.300]
FU Bailey.

[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.320]
Oh, I can't believe it.

[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:13.980]
How do you like that?

[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.740]
How many of you have been doing that stupid?

[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:17.780]
That's a bitch.

[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:18.200]

[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.020]
But it was...

[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.240]
Well, many of you have had all people.

[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.400]
I wish I would have had a cell phone with me.

[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.980]
I would have called you right then and picked up a few of them.

[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.540]
I would have probably told them it's in the bag, Lee,

[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:32.620]
or maybe he's in the bag.

[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:37.260]
That was when he had a court date for when they sanctioned him.

[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:37.580]
Right.

[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:38.140]
Right.

[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.680]
But anyway, well, I used to work down at home state

[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.620]
and I have to say that the Neil Rodgers show made the cocks crowed down

[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:50.180]
in that part of the country.

[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:50.960]
That's what they say.

[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:51.860]
That's what I heard.

[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:52.380]
Okay.

[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.500]
And thanks for the time.

[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.720]
All right, have a great life.

[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:56.180]
You too.

[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.840]
Okay. There's a guy from Quimsy.

[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.580]
Now, see, I should know that it was not Quimsy

[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:00.600]
because it was from Massachusetts.

[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.540]
It would be Quimsy.

[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:02.720]
Huh?

[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:03.840]
Like Worcester.

[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.280]
Worcester.

[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.620]
I put people say Warchester.

[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.940]
Because there are a lot of dumb people out there.

[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.720]
And then of course it could be Concord, the New Hampshire, or Concord, Michigan.

[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:15.920]
Yeah.

[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:17.740]
Or it could be Concord, you could be flying.

[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.120]
Did they finally start flying again or not during the they ground them all?

[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:22.800]
I think they started up again.

[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.280]
The bristles had nothing to do with the plane.

[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:24.700]
Not the front.

[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.360]
No, of course not.

[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:28.560]
There was a piece of crap on the runway from a previous plane.

[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.200]
Oh, geez.

[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:33.440]
And they're going to spend all this money millions and millions and how dare they.

[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:35.520]
And of course they haven't flown enough flights and it's not safe.

[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:37.320]
And he was a piece of Drekon, a runway.

[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.420]
But of course there's a major problem all over the world you understand.

[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.060]
Drekon, a runway, and all over birds.

[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:42.800]
Right.

[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.080]
Birds.

[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.040]
Yeah, see I think Alfred Hitchcock was a fresh, a fresh, and he knew what it was all about.

[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.240]
I mean it's done the other night, it's not a thing.

[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.060]
Him and Tippy Headroom.

[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.700]
Well, you know, in its time it was very good.

[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:57.020]
But if you watch it now, I mean the special effects are so bad.

[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:57.440]
Yeah.

[01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.240]
Really weak.

[01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:58.860]
But still.

[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.860]
Can you imagine what they could do with that novel with all the technology we have?

[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.600]
Didn't they redo it and it sucked?

[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:04.900]
They did.

[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:05.760]
I think so.

[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:06.880]
No, you're thinking of psycho.

[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.060]
Hey, we did some of that fag.

[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:09.820]
We did psycho.

[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:10.900]
Anthony.

[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.100]
Well, I'm not talking about that fag.

[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.860]
I'm talking about the director with some fag at the right,

[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:20.360]
anyway, 567-0568, 05-560.

[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.180]
On it, there's some movies that just don't need to be remade.

[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:24.240]
Why would they?

[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:26.300]
Just like there's some songs that don't need to be re-done,

[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.040]
like killing me softly with a song.

[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.100]
Now, who was it that we did that?

[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.640]
Oh, your favorite, Lauren Hill.

[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:32.320]
No!

[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:33.700]
Oh no!

[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.840]
That song doesn't need to be re-done.

[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.780]
Roberta Flack was one of the great songs in the history of mankind.

[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.460]
You couldn't sing it any better.

[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.660]
There's no need to redo that.

[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.320]
Lauren Hill, a couldn't sing away.

[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:51.680]
If you stuck a goddamn 357 magnum,

[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.380]
if you stuck a magnum of champagne up a goddamn,

[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.780]
you couldn't sing.

[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:56.660]
Lauren Hill.

[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.100]
Oh, entertainer of the year.

[01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.020]
Uh-huh.

[01:29:59.480 --> 01:29:59.680]
Okay.

[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:00.580]
Hey, Perlpers.

[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.700]
Who are in the Fred Durst?

[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:02.980]
They're the worst.

[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:05.380]
No, I mean, you admitted to me.

[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.260]
You've got to be stoned out of your mind to listen to that music.

[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:09.500]
And I agree.

[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:11.480]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:11.720]
Hello.

[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.240]
Hey, Nils.

[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.020]
Uh-Law Lissner.

[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.820]
I got two requests.

[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:21.080]
Can you play the Farrakon or the Bridge Tender for them?

[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.300]
Farrakon?

[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.080]
Or the Bridge Tender, whichever one.

[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:24.560]
Okay.

[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:25.340]
Thank you, sir.

[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:30.240]
Hey, I'd like to read a letter that I'm writing to all white people today

[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.740]
in the spirit of unity and understanding.

[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:36.380]
Dear white folk,

[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.700]
couple of things you ought to know.

[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.980]
When I'm born, I'm black.

[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.440]
When I grow up, I'm black.

[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:50.460]
When I get sick, I'm black.

[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:54.340]
When I go out in the sun, I'm black.

[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:59.240]
When I go out in the cold, I'm black.

[01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:03.600]
When I get scared, I'm black.

[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:08.340]
And when I die, I'm still black.

[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:14.480]
But you, my white man, when you're born, you are pink.

[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.220]
When you grow up, you are white.

[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:22.280]
When you get sick, you are green.

[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:26.860]
When you go out in the sun, you go red.

[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:31.420]
And when you get cold, you turn blue.

[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:35.400]
When you get scared, you turn yellow.

[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:41.360]
And the happiest time of my life is when white people die, you turn purple.

[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:46.080]
And you've got the damn nerve to call me color.

[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:47.280]
Exactly.

[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:48.200]

[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:50.780]
It's 11.51 to 5.60 W.K.Y.M.

[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.180]
He really is one big sum-bitch.

[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:55.800]
He is. He's a crap.

[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:57.860]
This is Malthamario.

[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:01.140]
I would much rather watch this, even though it's killing me.

[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.360]
But rather watch that in the market, which is killing me.

[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.220]
I don't recommend pre-cooking any pasta.

[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.420]
Don't pre-cook pasta because then it gets rubbery.

[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:12.340]
There's nothing worse than rubbery pasta.

[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:13.280]
I'll vent a baby.

[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.140]
That's what it's got to be.

[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:17.380]
A little firm, a little hard, if I can say that.

[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.080]
Here's a mobile-in-fort Lauderdale.

[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:20.340]
Hello.

[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:21.580]
Hey, near.

[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:22.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:23.460]
Happy Omnicka.

[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:24.080]
And back to you.

[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:24.920]
Happy, Mary.

[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.300]
I'm cracking up over here, man.

[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.020]
It's your question.

[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.260]
It's like, you know, the best thing.

[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.380]
So then we get back to the question.

[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:33.800]
Yeah, let's get it back with a smile on our face instead of all these depressing people

[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.840]
that are bitching and money over spilt milk and elections.

[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:36.400]
Who cares?

[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:37.360]
There you go.

[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.720]
It's got these in the WN George's contract.

[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.540]
And you're earned.

[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:41.900]
And I'm cracking up over here.

[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:42.260]
Exactly.

[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.520]
Hey, request, I'm going to get a bet.

[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:48.340]
In the ocean, in the basket, the rubber that's big, I might have to change my job.

[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:49.400]
I travel too much, man.

[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.620]
I miss the show too much.

[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.220]
One more thing I got to say is request.

[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:53.680]
Okay.

[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:56.220]
You don't want to be bonked for your kids.

[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.320]
I think it sounds like OJ is talking on it.

[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.180]
Oh, the OJ thing.

[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:03.180]
Yeah, with the bonked for your kids.

[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.020]
And teaching a new study for college or something like that.

[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:07.460]
Okay.

[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:08.680]
All right, thank you.

[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:09.340]
What?

[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:12.720]
I thought I was talking about the no juice thing, didn't you?

[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:13.440]
Yeah.

[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.300]
And now you can play all of them.

[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.380]
Yeah, let's play all of them.

[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:17.120]
No, it's a good time.

[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.740]
Well, let's just go find OJ and give him my sword.

[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.620]
Give him the early Christmas gift.

[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:27.880]
Like something like that.

[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.940]
I took your call to the ebony.

[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:35.520]
Do you say the future needs that's only now I can get no job?

[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.700]
Because I don't got no nerve or a sleep.

[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.260]
I was talking like an old meek road.

[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.120]
You know, I don't talk to his house this way.

[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:46.260]
Now I can't do nothing.

[01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:49.300]
But the heritage says that's okay.

[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.520]
Change my name to shoot road.

[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.760]
Drive a doosie, Makota, and a candlelight.

[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:03.520]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cars hanging outside

[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:07.940]
the building there barbed round the blues out on the teeth.

[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.440]
White devil's got to know your foe's in town.

[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:16.100]
So the bond is confused my life has changed now.

[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:20.620]
I got to go in and tell no crackle kids.

[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:31.180]
Rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids, rackle kids.

[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.840]
Lord, he would have bought his song.

[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.120]
Ibonyx makes me sound funny.

[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.200]
Got nothing to do with letter of C.

[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:48.220]
Now I've got to make more money.

[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:51.280]
Play the fool sound good to me.

[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:53.500]
I got plenty of nothing.

[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.780]
Ibonyx ain't getting me anywhere.

[01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:59.100]
Maybe I'll mug an old ride bitch.

[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.780]
Feel the purse and pull her hair.

[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:04.100]
Then I'm gonna take some money.

[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:07.200]
I'm a cereal and a fridge a day.

[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:20.160]
I remember when I was feeling all the white men's cars hanging outside the building there barbed round the blues out on the teeth.

[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:24.200]
White devil's got to know your foe's in town.

[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.140]
So the bond is confused my life has changed now.

[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.260]
Got to go with proteins, nothra Principle C, right to APPLAUSE

[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:50.880]
Rackle Chainstress C, recylcene, brautoid Franklin Face, rackle chainstressело-je, nothro chinstressело-je, rackle chainstressi lt highest

[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:57.560]
Come on, everybody.

[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:00.740]
We're gonna play a game.

[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:03.700]
We be keeping kids around.

[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.660]
And the panic speed is a-

[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.840]
You know what you told us out?

[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.300]
You take a bucket, you'll win.

[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:12.360]
I'm gonna bust some skills to make it run.

[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.720]
Out of the bucket, you.

[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:15.220]
Check that one out, I'm gonna kick it.

[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.460]
What you told us out?

[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.580]
You have it down and down.

[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:18.480]
Shoot her.

[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:19.480]
Jesus.

[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.040]
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.200]
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:24.900]
Jesus.

[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:25.380]
Jesus.

[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:25.580]
Jesus.

[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.260]
Let's be two homies.

[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.820]
Hold it home, it's a moment, for there, there, there.

[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.820]
So be not so full-hand.

[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:34.220]
Hold it.

[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.340]
Hold it.

[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.400]
Just be as a landing, but it's okay.

[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.140]
And if that doesn't happen, just be partial, partial.

[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:42.580]
And be as a landing.

[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.040]
Who that hold?

[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:48.540]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:55.340]
Hold on, hold on.

[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:56.960]
Don't eat or die or die or die

[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.060]
Eat, die or die or die

[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:00.160]
Oh, no!

[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.580]
Now try your local book

[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:05.560]
Don't post or die or die or die

[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.280]
Don't eat, die or die

[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.480]
Fuck

[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.600]
Tiki-taka, this game

[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:19.240]
Tiki-taka, this game

[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.740]
It is mine, let me put these 7 or 560s in the box

[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:32.760]
Don't touch it or I second thought

[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:36.040]
This is 560, QAF

[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.420]
It's Friday, you first

[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:53.580]
It's Friday, you first

[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.280]
Katie

[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:59.580]
Ooh, who'd be theBamminbad with bets

[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.680]
Eat, you theBammin

[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.580]
Bud with my zdob

[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:07.640]
iting, fairly thee

[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.320]
B Got all spoon and no bet ceiling

[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:16.280]
Hit us turned, we did that strong

[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.260]
When he made them sing this song

[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.680]
I can hear his palm

[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.580]
And the Belgium Hauptessen

[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:22.960]
I hate Jack of Fame.

[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:25.100]
Don't let me go.

[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.820]
I'm your one team.

[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:30.540]
My name is Jeff.

[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:34.260]
But here in the Big House, they call me prison bitch.

[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:36.440]
Sometimes my husband, Robert,

[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.900]
was trading my punk ass for a pack of cigarettes

[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.600]
or a plagiarist or something.

[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:43.780]
It makes me feel so cheap.

[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.780]
Sometimes I sit in my cell and rock back and forth,

[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:49.220]
crying.

[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:51.180]
He told me he loved me.

[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:53.880]
How could he limp me out for a pack of smokes?

[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.020]
I feel so dirty.

[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:58.960]
I wish I could shower for what I do.

[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.860]
The asking is there.

[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:02.280]
Just waiting.

[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:03.600]
Wanted.

[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.600]
And shower days tomorrow.

[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.300]
I can't handle much more meal juice.

[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.840]
Hey prison bitch, I'm not a smokes.

[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.660]
You're sleeping in Leon's cell the night.

[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.700]
Oh dear God.

[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:18.340]
Okay.

[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:19.600]
It was good.

[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:22.200]
202-560-WQM Happy Friday.

[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:23.380]
Are we having fun yet or what?

[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:24.240]
Yeah, we're doing okay.

[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.360]
How's that poor coming?

[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:26.700]
Poor John Henry.

[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.860]
What do you say we give John Henry even though he's still got

[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:31.880]
like half a billion left or whatever he's got left

[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.200]
from all the money he lost in the market?

[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.660]
What do you say we give him a Christmas gift this year?

[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:37.980]
Like a plane ticket out of town for him in the entire ball club.

[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:41.360]
And we'll have a scut in an Ira Packerman sandwich or two

[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.880]
from Atlantic City, Subbs and Hollywood.

[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:43.840]
Business class?

[01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.100]
Yeah, a monkey business class.

[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:48.700]
Bye bye John.

[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:51.020]
211 people on our pool.

[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:53.200]
Will you be going to any modeling games this season?

[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:55.820]
Because every other day here's another article in the paper.

[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.840]
Well, they're going to build a stadium now with FAU.

[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:58.940]
They're going to do this.

[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.700]
But they still want that one in Miami.

[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.760]
And somebody's got a bill of form and come up with the money.

[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:07.020]
They just won't give up and they just won't go away.

[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:10.240]
Which if they did go away, can you imagine all the money?

[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.720]
That would turn this place off.

[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.400]
Over night.

[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.840]
Yeah, like a snap of the fingers that would turn this place around.

[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.680]
If the marlins would just go away.

[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.580]
Will you be going to any modeling games this season?

[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:26.420]
Out of 211, 133, 63% say absolutely never

[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:28.840]
maybe one or two games.

[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:29.340]
Wait a minute.

[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.240]
It's reloading.

[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.020]
One second.

[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:32.720]
Squared, squared.

[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:35.980]
Okay, like I said, out of 214, 136.

[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.380]
53 and half percent say never.

[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.720]
53 say maybe one or two games, 25%.

[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:47.400]
a few games, 15, 7 percent, and many games, oh it's all the way up to 10, 4.6 percent.

[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:52.080]
So I got a great idea. How about those 10 people out there want to go to a whole bunch of games?

[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.260]
Let them build a stadium. That sounds like a good idea.

[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.520]
Here's some rise. Hello.

[01:40:58.720 --> 01:40:59.480]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:02.640]
Yeah, I was wondering if you could play a two-joint song for me.

[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:03.360]
Yes, I can.

[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:06.180]
Yes, I can.

[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.600]
All right, man. I appreciate it.

[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.360]
I can't have a great life.

[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.360]
I'm going to have the surface.

[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.320]
Can I play that one? Can I do it?

[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:14.660]
Yes.

[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.060]
Okay. What do you say?

[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:16.740]
Yes.

[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.220]
Okay.

[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.440]
How's Frank? Where's Neil?

[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:24.540]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:26.820]
I'm sorry.

[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:28.740]
I'm sorry.

[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.160]
And don't forget, with the new regime, all drives are going to be legal.

[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.660]
That's what they do after the other years.

[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:35.840]
I spoke to George in the morning.

[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:38.420]
I spoke to George that night.

[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:39.560]
But only for them.

[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:41.960]
I spoke to George in the afternoon.

[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:44.520]
It makes me feel it all right.

[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:50.580]
I spoke to George that time of the two inside of my home.

[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.500]
I spoke to George before I'm up to George.

[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:56.640]
I say I'll adjust tomorrow.

[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.960]
Oh, my daddy wants to meet you.

[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.320]
You'll be hard working man.

[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.720]
But mama, she wants for me.

[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:07.540]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:08.680]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:08.820]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.400]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.220]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:12.960]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:14.860]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:18.720]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:19.720]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.080]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:22.420]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:22.900]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:23.300]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:23.300]

[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:24.500]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:24.800]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.660]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:25.660]

[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:25.660]

[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:26.300]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:29.220]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:29.220]

[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:30.880]
She wants to meet you.

[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:31.740]
She wants to meet you again

[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:35.040]
and that's everything I was before I spoke to George.

[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:36.500]
I spoke to George.

[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:37.200]
I spoke to George

[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:40.160]
and it's time of the two inside a wall.

[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:44.120]
I spoke to George before I spoke to George

[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.360]
and I said I'll adjust tomorrow.

[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.280]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:30.940]
oh okay

[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:34.140]
I'm so good, isn't I'm fine?

[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:38.760]
So shake your head, that's why I'm so good to you

[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.640]
In the morning, alright

[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.480]
I hope to know it tonight

[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:46.680]
I hope to know it any afternoons

[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:48.820]
It makes me give it alright

[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.060]
I hope to know it any afternoons

[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:52.060]

[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:55.920]
I hope to know it any afternoons

[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.100]
I hope to know it any afternoons

[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:03.300]
And then I hope to know it any afternoons

[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:04.180]
That's what I do

[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.640]
I'm so good, doesn't it with me any more?

[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:17.920]
I hope to know it any afternoons

[01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:25.840]
Yeah, so I hope to know it any afternoons

[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.360]
Oh and then I hope I保持 on a date

[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.900]
HEEEE e e e e..

Oh putt to just

Oh putt to just the twit out

[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:46.780]
Oh you cry

[01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:00.780]
We're down in Jamaica in the catapene.

[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:04.460]
They got the best herb that you ever seen.

[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.240]
Ask anybody in that table of work.

[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:11.940]
They tell you this country where the country is good.

[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.680]
Craftsman has some he want to sell.

[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.460]
And from a mile away, you can detect the smell of smoke.

[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:24.260]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:28.040]
He light up this bliff and choke.

[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.800]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:35.540]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.380]
The gun to be good.

[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.240]
You'll be carried out the herb in the gun.

[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:08.900]
Smoke, gun to be good.

[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:08.920]
Smoke, gun to be good.

[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:08.920]

[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:08.920]

[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.520]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:13.400]
He light up this bliff and choke.

[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.080]
He light up this bliff and choke.

[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:20.940]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:27.600]
He light up this bliff and choke.

[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:31.380]
I'm the teller son, you are a rough, dumb man.

[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:35.160]
You like to smoke, you try and slip whenever you can.

[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.900]
Many people come in here for miles around.

[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:42.580]
Somebody hurt from you by the ounce of liquor.

[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.500]
Craftsman, say to her, mom are you right?

[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:51.120]
They can't be good tonight and then they smoke.

[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:54.940]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:58.720]
He light up this bliff and choke.

[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.540]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:06.240]
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:09.800]
Smoke, gun to smoke.

[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:14.860]
Come on.

[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.700]
It's afternoon at 560 WQM.

[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:19.780]
A lot of bigotry out there.

[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:22.620]
This group hates it and that group hate it.

[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.420]
Nobody don't like the Jamaicans.

[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:26.100]
The Jamaicans, you know what I'm saying?

[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:27.640]
They got the Richmond.

[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:32.920]
This is 560 QAFs, the Neil Rogers Show.

[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:37.140]
Sports radio, 560 QAFs.

[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.160]
It's what's the large thing in the basket.

[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:47.620]
Dead dead dead, someday you'll be dead.

[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:52.280]
Dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead.

[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:54.960]
Dead dead dead.

[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.000]
The minute we're born we start dying.

[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:00.180]
We die a little more every day.

[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:06.120]
Young girl with your poor, there's nothing we can do to stop it.

[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:12.000]
So to look long at that Christmas tree, it may be the last one that you see.

[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:17.220]
Dead create your house in green and red, cause someday you'll be dead.

[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:21.780]
Dead dead dead, someday you'll be dead.

[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:26.420]
Dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead.

[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.240]
It might have been in a couple months or 50 years from now.

[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.760]
But no matter when it happens, it will soon, soon to you.

[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:45.980]
So we sure, your own Christmas Eve, when you snuggle air to death.

[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.280]
Dead you think I'd bore your family, cause someday they'll be dead.

[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:51.980]
All right.

[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.780]
Dead dead dead, someday they'll be dead.

[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:00.240]
Dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead.

[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:07.820]
Who knows how many Christmas is up, that's the middle shortcut.

[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.780]
Nobody knows, that's my point.

[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.540]
Enjoy the while you can.

[01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:19.320]
And someone Christmas morning led good tidies to your bed.

[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:24.720]
What a festive season, someday you'll be dead.

[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:29.160]
Dead dead dead, someday we'll be dead.

[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:37.220]
Dead dead dead, every one you know of, that's a very Merry Christmas to you.

[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:43.400]
Dead dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead.

[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:53.720]
Dead dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead.

[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.060]
Dead dead dead dead dead, someday we'll all be dead.

[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:57.880]
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye.

[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:07.960]
I'm doing her that's right just about everyday and night,

[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:13.120]
cause with me, young and tight, hey baby come on.

[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:18.960]
I waited in the sea, she finally give it to me now.

[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.960]
Just like in her songs, I can hear her moan.

[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:29.720]
I've been dating her since we were four, it ain't no lie, I.

[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:34.880]
I was the first to go through that door, it's a bye bye bye.

[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:40.160]
You're the day I am everybody new, we're doing it like funny for a year or two.

[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:46.060]
I hate to tell you her virginity has come by by by.

[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:51.260]
She just carries us a young and think, I thank God every day that I am within sync.

[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:57.120]
I hate to tell you her virginity has come by by by.

[01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.360]
Bye bye bye.

[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.300]
Exactly, and don't let the door hit you in the ass in a way out.

[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.740]
That's the end thing, not to you Miguel.

[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:08.640]
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:09.540]
I'll request Friday.

[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:13.460]
I was feeling a lot better, George Suckney, turning on his damn CNBC.

[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.060]
Bad move, now I'm all depressed, psychotic.

[01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:19.440]
I'm going to get in my car, start looking for stock brokers.

[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:21.660]
Not made particular, one just any brokers I can find.

[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:26.020]
It's like Bobby Cox's, you know when a braver lose a tough game,

[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:27.760]
he goes home and beats a crap out of his wife.

[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:30.660]
Not that it was her fault they lost the game, but it makes him feel better.

[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:34.120]
You know, it's not my brokers fault the market's going to cracker,

[01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:36.680]
but it would make me feel better to call up like Luke and Broncy.

[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:39.700]
Here's Miami, hello.

[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:40.940]
And on here.

[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:41.540]
Yes sir.

[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.580]
Very much you're laughing at who you.

[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:47.580]
See, I want to get in touch with my feminine side, so play Goldie.

[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:48.780]
Goldie?

[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:49.340]
A Goldie son?

[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:49.900]
Yes.

[01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:51.100]
All right.

[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:52.500]
And have a great life.

[01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.680]
Goldie?

[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.160]
Goldie?

[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.380]
Talking on a sports show?

[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.120]
Trying to be my show?

[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.120]
Your voice sounds just like a seventh year old girl.

[01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:14.960]
A little sports whole show.

[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.340]
What else are you there for?

[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.380]
Goldie?

[01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:20.820]
Goldie?

[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.480]
Talking like a baby?

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:22.480]

[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:25.780]
Who needs a little training?

[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:28.880]
Why can't you understand?

[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:31.960]
You don't sound like a man.

[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:38.400]
We both the rubber bands that show your growth comes.

[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:39.120]
Goldie?

[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:42.000]
Goldie?

[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.200]
Goldie?

[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:45.480]

[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:46.260]
Goldie?

[01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:48.900]
Your lucky man is the still child.

[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:50.280]
Goldie?

[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:52.460]
Goldie?

[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:52.460]

[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:52.460]

[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:52.460]

[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:54.520]
Go on a walk along the air.

[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:56.640]
And goldie?

[01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:00.120]
The sports can wait till your voice crack.

[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:05.680]
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:11.380]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.

[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:12.640]
Goldie?

[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:14.460]
Goldie?

[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.740]
When you're going grow up?

[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:19.620]
Give me a touch on a throw up.

[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:28.440]
You silly, squeaky, fool. Go to broadcasting school. Your fridge, you bastard, boy.

[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:40.520]
Make you sound like a fuck. You're a fuck. You're a fuck. You're a fuck. You're a fuck. You're a fuck.

[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.540]
That's funny that we should get her a question. I'm running to Gilorgan to Hallismore.

[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:50.520]
You're one of the greats on the worst thing. You said, you know, I've been wondering how can a guy with such a gigantic penis is guilty? You have such a high squeaky voice.

[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:59.020]
Huh? Well, you know that story. Time for guys with the deep voices have big balls. Well, you could have like, you know, babies.

[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:04.560]
You could have a gigantic penis and have very tiny balls. Georgia they'll find out next week.

[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:13.540]
56670560, pound 560 on the 18th. Oh, yeah, as D-fo. Ansca Pat. Now, to see, I can't keep that straight.

[01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:22.580]
So to speak, which is the one that the O-D-fo and Pat are tight and Pat and the Gildi enjoy the ones that are feuding and everybody hates Robert.

[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:30.700]
Oh, and every, all of us say Robert like, because he's, now, what do you call Pat Psychopath? It should be Psycho Robert because he's the elunatic in there.

[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:35.500]
Well, he's not Psycho. He's just, down the contrary. Oh, man, everything. Just a little prick.

[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:43.960]
Here's a mobile or West Palm Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, I got a very important question. Okay.

[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:50.440]
Planning for the holiday is not all that crap. Are you going to play the farting contest this year? No. No? No, maybe.

[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:58.920]
Okay. Give us a little advanced notice we can plan for it. Okay. Appreciate it. You bet. So you're. In fact, here's a preview. There you go.

[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:08.820]
5, 6, 7, where do we have that as a matter of fact, the accreditation contest is that in here? It might be. It could be, but it's not.

[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:25.280]
Mid-to-night mini-disc edited. Yeah. Under some kneels nuggets. Yeah. We'll find it somewhere eventually like on Christmas Day. Are we working on Christmas Day? No. Like I said, maybe unlike when it gets real close to Christmas. Like when the log is empty, you know, Monday.

[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:44.840]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale. Our first lady of the day, I do believe. Hello. Our first lady of the day. Hello. Yes, man. Yes. I have a remedy for the post-election blues. Yeah. Yeah. We're having a huge rally over at the house.

[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:55.740]
You know, do you have any idea how much restraint I'm going to have to use to start my usual assault on the women of this town?

[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:08.200]
We've had two hours and 20 minutes. We've had a good time. Everybody's smiling. We're having a nice, free lunch here from the land here. So these subs. Even it's by the market second of crap. We still don't care. Everybody's got a few laps today.

[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:25.940]
And I said, here's the first lady, the first one, the only one. Do she ever request? No. No. Back with the same old, tired crap. I hope that God inflicts a six billion locusts that fly up your ass.

[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:39.960]
And play you for the rest of your life. Lady, God almighty. In fact, maybe they're having a big anti-b alligualism. Well, that's probably what it is. I can't stand that. God.

[01:56:39.960 --> 01:57:04.260]
God. Man, I'm going to upgrade my estimate 90% of this woman of this, this woman. 90% of the women in this town are just one dimensional obnoxious, hateful, pathetic crap. And she's one of them. Don't forget to pop luck sufferer with the attussue dart at your rally.

[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:34.160]
Here's a mobile in Miramar. Hello. Hey, Neil, how do you like that crap? Well, women aren't too bright. Oh, I can't agree with you there. God, not in this town. They're not. Hey, I think this shows funny as hell, man. Don't ever change. But I also had a request for that commercial one hooked on ebonyx. Okay. Thank you, fact. You got it. Did you know that there are 44 sounds in the white man's language? 44. And we'll hook on ebonyx.

[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:45.280]
You ain't got to use one of the mother. For example, I'm telling you, I'm going to be a bond. I'm representing nobody. Just give me out of the way. I'm just going to be a little bit more.

[01:57:45.280 --> 01:58:01.320]
God, I'm not. I'll split with on it. So we're going to give it to you. It's a 180 seven on the man. True true. See, with open and bond, it's you'll be conversing with the boys in the hood at no time. Just call 1 800 south side. That's 1 800 south side and get hope.

[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:11.220]
Go to the body. See, it's the summer 15 is very close to that time when people start making their news resolutions. And I told you one before about don't be a sheep so much next year. And the rest of your life. Here's another good one.

[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:25.640]
And that is that all the people like that bitch that call the couple call all the inus to penis share as in all those other one dimensional people with your hate with your we hate the Cubans we hate to this one we hate to that one the anti bilingual crowd the potlock supper crowds.

[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:36.500]
The resolution is you're going to turn off this program right now and never darken our door again. That's the resolution I want you to make. We don't need you. We don't want you. We peep from you.

[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:45.920]
In fact, you know who else we control when I crowd Peter Leonard there you go. Don't talk in the door again. Even though George might want to see us someday, but I sure doubt it.

[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:53.860]
Don't darken the door again. Have a wonderful life. We wish you nothing but the best, but as far away from us as possible.

[01:58:55.980 --> 01:59:01.900]
As we continue drawing that bigger, bigger line in the sand. Here's Bokeh. Hello.

[01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:31.620]
Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing today? Okay. I did have a request. I'm not appointed already. Could you play a soap. Okay. Hey, I heard you got it. You have a great day and back to you already. Listen to me. This is stand by and steam for so for King. Understand? Where everything is held to the high. So for King. Stand it. The selection isn't just huge. It's so fucking huge. Believe me. You'll never shop anywhere else. And so for King's prices aren't just low. Yes, so fucking low. You'll never find them anywhere else. Listen to me.

[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:59.640]
When I say so for King as a beautiful store, I mean so for King beautiful. When I say, is that helpful? I mean so fucking helpful. Listen to me. Get to know the so for King and enjoy a selection that's so for King huge. A staff that so for King Curtis and prices that are so fucking low. You'll never shop anywhere else. But don't take it for me. Take it from satisfied. Just to my Frank and Stein. So fucking good. You said it. Frankie. So fucking good.

[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:07.960]
Like that bitch of call before man. I might have what do they do that? Why don't you people stop? What does it take?

[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:18.300]
It just like after the early on crap. I mean it was over. It was a Veneto. It was so it was still stater than last year's Haman Toshin.

[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:25.260]
And they were still trying. I'll have another valley. Yeah, go wave it and you're flagged too, honey.

[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:52.020]
But they worked. So speaking of life here's Haman Toshin. What kind of food did the adjoo's eat in the Hanukkah? I was asking Georgia's before and I just like calendar. So far away from all the scrap so far. I get confused. The potato lock is is that it? Is this the holiday? It'd be a crime if it wasn't. I know. I do love those little potato. I shouldn't beat no potatoes or fried food anyway with my apple. What's wrong with apple sauce? Not for you. Why sugary?

[02:00:53.220 --> 02:01:07.260]
Sugar you never heard of sugar free apple sauce? No, they have that. Of course. What do you mean? Did they have that? You're a little slow. You never heard of sugar free apple sauce? No, of course I don't run around looking for sugar free stuff all the time. Why not?

[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:18.640]
Because I'm not a lot of there you go. Tell that to Alan today. Well, he don't go run. He obviously hasn't been if he's been looking for it. He sure hasn't been finding it and the applesauce either.

[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:32.020]
This is 560. U.A.L. Got your dad's Jewish. Okay, I you're my little brother so I have to show you how to celebrate the Hanukkah. This is called a trade-off. You spin it and see where it lands and you sing this song.

[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:42.500]
I have a little trade-off. I need it out of play and when it's high and ready with trade-off I shall play. Oh, trade-off, trade-off, trade-off. I need you out of play.

[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:49.420]
Jaddle, jaddle, jaddle, jaddle with trade-off. I shall play. Now you try. I just spin it with your fingers like this.

[02:01:52.480 --> 02:02:01.340]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hello, hey. This one's like all the way through.

[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:08.960]
Hey, what the hell are you doing? Oh, hey, Carmen. What playing trade-offs? You want to try?

[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:19.100]
Sure. You're the little trade-off that's not in native clay but I'm not gonna play with it because they don't fucking game. Hey, shoot your mouth, set up.

[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:27.200]
Shoot. Play stupid games. Shoot. That's why they're little trade-off, trade-off. I need you out of play.

[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:32.040]
Play stupid, trade-off, trade-off, trade-off. Shoot with trade-off, I shall play. That's why they're ding. What's going on?

[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:38.100]
Oh, it's that onical thing. It's you, amazing. He's spin-off, saying on the ground and he goes,

[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:41.620]
Man, jeez, man, I can work it someday. Let me try it.

[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:48.000]
I'll try to make it spin. It's hell, I'll try again.

[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:51.260]
Oh, trade-off, trade-off, trade-off. I need you out of play.

[02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:54.440]
trade-off, trade-off, trade-off, trade-off. I'll try again.

[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:57.560]
Oh, trade-off, trade-off, trade-off. I need you out of play.

[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:02.560]
Play stupid, trade-off, trade-off, trade-off. I shall play. That's why they're little trade-off.

[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:04.160]
Play stupid, trade-off, trade-off, trade-off. I shall play. That's why they're little trade-off.

[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.900]
Play stupid, trade-off, trade-off, trade-off. I shall play. That's why they're ding.

[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:10.900]
Hello, boys. Hi, man. Oh, how precious.

[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:15.760]
You boys are all playing trade-offs now. You know, that's why I want to present them to people.

[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:19.440]
Yes, we know that, Jacky. It's still very interesting.

[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:23.260]
Now, when you are, make the trade-off spin.

[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:27.320]
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll see the whole red red red spinning bar.

[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.580]
I'll see the trade-off spin. It's gonna be good. I'll see the whole red red. That's why they're ding.

[02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:37.200]
Oh, hi, Jack. Hello, everybody. Say, can I join in?

[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:37.860]
Yes.

[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:42.440]
I have a little trade-off. I need it out of play.

[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:46.180]
And when it's lights i'm ready with trader lights on everybody.

[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:46.820]
I'm...

[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:51.440]
K- Music in the middle of play.

[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:54.440]
I'll see this I'm ready!

[02:03:58.860 --> 02:03:59.220]
I'll see this.

[02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:04.860]
Court me cuts on the view you're so far on that show.

[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:05.300]
Dad?

[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.340]
Court me cuts on the hat.

[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:08.680]
We're singing about addraile.

[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:18.280]
Oh I am no joke!

[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:39.200]
Oh

[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.520]
What'd you say?

[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:44.860]
1232 at 560 WDQ. I'm happy at you nook and happy

[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:50.040]
Christmas all these other silly holidays that you people just refuse to let go and of course business would be a lot worse

[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:55.200]
than this already if we let go of these holidays especially I mean some the other ones like Columbus say that's okay

[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.440]
You like go or that and pour them all the way to want to miss those hummingtimes

[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:02.860]
So anybody call about the potato pancakes. I'm pretty sure that's Chinooka. I think I

[02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:10.160]
don't know of course to show you how far I've fallen away from my people. Why is it all depressing holidays except for like two of them?

[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:14.540]
No, you're only depressing holidays young tipper. What other depressing holidays?

[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:18.560]
Oh, you eat on all the rest of them except for young. I eat on all of them. Can't you tell?

[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:24.660]
That's the only thing they know they're not like really uplifting their holidays like Lent

[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:36.900]
Here's Miami Lakes. Hello Neil and Easter. Yes sir. Thought you could have been on Easter and join your show. Of course you do it more often. Okay.

[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:45.100]
I want to request a gift you have. I think it's either an Irish priest or somebody or somebody from Ireland

[02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:56.520]
trying to teach somebody how to play the pipe. How to play the pipe? Yeah. I mean like play the backpipes. Right. Okay. Thank you Neil. And have a great holiday. Bye bye.

[02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:10.020]
I met the door right now. Come on in. Look at that.

[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:18.420]
Are you ready? Hey, brought by something I wanted to show you. Oh, I wonder what it is. It looks like it looks like a

[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:29.860]
octopus. That's my back boy. Hey, what can I touch it? Sure. Go ahead. Run your hands. Hey, like

[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:38.140]
well, what's this right here? That is my blowpipe. What do you do with the blowpipe? You blow it, lad. You blow it.

[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:48.820]
Hey, you put your mouth around it and your blow. Okay, would you like to blow my pipe, lad? Sure. Go ahead. Okay. Come on lad.

[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:57.780]
You got to put your mouth around it. Don't be afraid. It's not going to break. Like this. Hey, that's a boy. Stick it on the way down.

[02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:07.080]
You throw it. Hey, you mean you do it right? What's this over here? That's my chanter. What do we do with that? What do you do with that, lad?

[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:17.480]
You put your both hands on it. You cover the hole and you run your hands up and down the shaft real quick. Hey, run your hands up and down it there.

[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:24.940]
Now what you want to do, lad? Is you want to blow on the pipe? You want to squeeze the bag nice and gentle.

[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:32.360]
And then you want to run your hands up and down the shaft real quick. Okay. All together all at the same time. Okay, here we go.

[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:44.140]
Good lad. Hey, that's good lad. Sure. Hey, it's good lad. Keep going. No harder lad. Other. Squeeze the bag. Squeeze more.

[02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:49.320]
Run your hands up and down the shaft. Big faster. Run your hands up and down faster. You go.

[02:07:52.480 --> 02:08:10.120]
You're not going to get it again after the kitchen. But maybe 1236 and 560 WQM. That's one of the choices on our well. Sure. Yeah. Maybe one or two games.

[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:16.000]
Will you be going to any Marlon game this season is our poll question on your oranges dot com. Something ought to be thinking about long and hard.

[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:32.920]
Never out of 272. Never. Well, wait a minute. Three fresh right now. Squirt squirt real refreshing 273. Like I said, never 170 62.2%. Maybe one or two 68 25% a few games like here and there.

[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:43.220]
22 8% many games like a whole bunch. Lots of times because we can't get enough of those marlins 13 4.7%.

[02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:51.860]
So let's get that made together and buy John Henry that state. Let's build a build it and it will come. Here's sunrise. Hello.

[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:59.980]
Hello. Yes, sir. Can we talk about you for a second? Sure. I saw a piece in the United. One of these spurts by our official.

[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:07.080]
We did we have peace on Ted Nolan. Yeah. I remember Henry. I had the buffalo. He got the buffalo right.

[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:14.860]
Somehow he's gotten like black balls black. I got it this week and nobody gives him a chance and a guy is dying to get back in the.

[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:23.800]
He's not it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. He's got kind of like the Terry Murray philosophy. Once he gets sour on you, you never have a chance and same with a league. Once they get sour on you. Once.

[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:31.200]
Well, he gave the management a hard time and he turned out to be a hard ass plus plus there's something else there that we just don't know about.

[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:37.580]
Something that doesn't even even use that. There's an hour long piece and at the end I was still confused as to why this guy is in the league.

[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:46.780]
Dad, no answers. I think I think it's that anti-Indian bias something like that. I never stand. I mean he seems to coach a lot of passion. He has successful a team that was pretty mediocre.

[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:52.560]
I mean similar to all these coaches getting fired all around the league. This certainly is going to be any shortage of people to pick from.

[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:59.700]
I guess I was in the field every day now. Who do you think is going to take all of this guy because he can't be much longer. I don't see that.

[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:11.460]
You don't understand. Let me say it to you again. The team is resale. Wayne's got a couple of suckers on the hook and until the deal goes through until a new ownership comes in, he's not going to do anything.

[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:17.360]
So if they lose every game, this guy isn't going to get canned. I know it's hard to believe but and that's what we have to put up with.

[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:24.540]
That's what he expresses to keep buying tickets for is that as long as Wayne makes the deal that's good for him, then somebody will come in here and let them do it.

[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:30.280]
Well I mean obviously tickets are going to go up any while. But he obviously doesn't care about that.

[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:34.220]
He's already got a couple of assholes on the hook.

[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:36.660]
Oh my god. We're just basically a limbo and a little bit of a game.

[02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:43.040]
That's right. That's what he does every time. Once he decides he's going to wash this end of it, we can rot in hell until he gets his money.

[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:51.860]
I mean it's unbearable to watch anymore. I know. It's ridiculous and Trevor is having a great year of going in there.

[02:10:51.860 --> 02:11:01.080]
I feel so bad for him. There's a guy that's playing so great and then Terry opens up his mouth a couple of weeks ago because he let a couple of bad goals in games that the only scored one goal anyway.

[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:05.440]
So they're going to win. I mean this guy's standing on his head and they don't give many support.

[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:08.200]
No, no, no, no. I'm not a centum down the Louvre though.

[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:14.600]
Yeah. So I mean what are you doing to this kid? I feel like every time he gets a hold of it and you're a prospect, he got fully ruined.

[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:19.800]
And don't forget Yoke and then because he opened up his mouth if there was ever any chance that he was going to become something.

[02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:23.120]
So help me scratch for that. You'll never ever see him play for this team again.

[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.180]
Absolutely. Yeah.

[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:26.500]
You know, we do a lot to get this guy.

[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:27.440]
30 goals score.

[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:30.580]
And Mark Perry won't see him no more.

[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:42.600]
I don't understand. I mean I'm a bad hard fan and I've been with the team since the inception and I remember the few fans in the arena back then when they actually knew what a nice thing call was.

[02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:48.660]
And I mean I've been through everything with this team but I'm almost at the end of the rope here. This is ridiculous.

[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:49.180]
I know.

[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.120]
Night in and night out. It's just embarrassing.

[02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:54.020]
Don't forget. Booking a flashlight. They'll help you get through the three hours.

[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:55.600]
Good luck pal.

[02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:56.120]
Good luck.

[02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:59.700]
Okay. Good luck to us because Wayne doesn't give a crap. We despise him.

[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:02.080]
And of course he doesn't care what all that money he's got.

[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:04.060]
Does he give a flying crap about us?

[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:04.220]
No.

[02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:06.140]
You bet your sweet ass he doesn't care about us.

[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:09.500]
We're the...

[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.340]
The prick who stole Christmas and Hanukkah.

[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:19.040]
This is 560 QAFs.

[02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:22.860]
The Neil Roger Show Sports Radio 560s.

[02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:27.280]
Hey baby I'm gonna use you as a sex toy.

[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:29.860]
All right.

[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.120]
Back to it Madonna.

[02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:39.640]
Hit her on my key.

[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:43.520]
Put Prince Uncle Wall through where she put her seat.

[02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:46.080]
She's got bad hygiene.

[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:48.400]
Doesn't wipe too well.

[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:52.260]
I took Prince Uncle and I went to the kitchen really smell.

[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:56.200]
Big Pops are she really need a shower.

[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:00.980]
Left all her bacteria hot by cowl.

[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:04.920]
She don't come close to smelling like a virgin.

[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:09.260]
Spray ball of skull.

[02:13:10.660 --> 02:13:12.100]
Sex with Madonna.

[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:14.560]
Now my hair applies.

[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:16.920]
Apple leaves I didn't win.

[02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:18.020]
That's cranky.

[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.880]
People living proof and the aim I can make a fortune right there.

[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:27.260]
That bitch.

[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.800]
16 to 1 at 560 WDQAM.

[02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:31.380]
56070560.

[02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:32.860]
We got Hanukkah Brigadette 2.

[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.500]
The day wants that show with Hanukkah 5.

[02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:37.880]
We got Boogchambi at 6 and then if you're ready, Panther preview.

[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:39.760]
Six o'clock or seven o'clock.

[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:42.840]
And the Panthers at the Pac-Win 730 from the Igloo.

[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.760]
And Ndk after the Hanukkah game.

[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:47.140]
Here's Miami.

[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:47.720]
Hello.

[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:49.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:50.720]
Love you so, man.

[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:51.360]
Of course.

[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.020]
I need like a...

[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:55.120]
I got some news about law stillers for you.

[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:56.080]
You remember law stillers?

[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:56.520]
Yeah.

[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:57.640]
Yes, what?

[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.000]
He beat up his girl again.

[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:01.080]
Back in jail.

[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:01.760]
Oh, no.

[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:02.240]
A different girl.

[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:02.840]
No.

[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:03.640]
Ain't that a bitch?

[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.380]
That's a bitch. That's what he said.

[02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:07.120]
Man, man, man.

[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.360]
What a shock.

[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:09.300]
That's f***ing bitch.

[02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:09.640]
Yeah.

[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:10.860]
It's the same, man.

[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:11.940]
Same old cramp.

[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:13.440]
Very lost, but it's still ain't seen.

[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:14.200]
You know what they say?

[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:17.860]
You can take the scumbag out of the city, but you can't take the scumbag out of the scumbag.

[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:18.860]
All right, and you love your show.

[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:19.820]
Okay, thanks for the good night.

[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:21.740]
Oh, maybe that Lawrence Phillips guy will be calling.

[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:22.780]
That'll clip it.

[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:23.900]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:25.380]
Have it heard from him in a coolin' safe.

[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:26.140]
Oh, sorry, Lawrence.

[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:31.520]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T.

[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:32.500]
And for what?

[02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:33.500]
And how is he still doing?

[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:36.020]
Oh, he's still trying to get a look at it.

[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:39.080]
Here's Delray Beach.

[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:39.300]
Hello.

[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:43.020]
Hey, you know, this show has been the best birthday present I've had in a long time.

[02:14:43.220 --> 02:14:44.560]
I am laughing my ass while I'm saying.

[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:45.640]
This is your birthday today?

[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:46.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:47.380]
Well, how do you like that?

[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.100]
And for that...

[02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:54.180]
Leave it to an old fart like me to figure out a way to get these people out of their depression.

[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:57.860]
And only one dimensional people to drag them out of this thing.

[02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:00.140]
See, they want us to stay as depressed and crazy as they are.

[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:01.400]
And I refuse to do it.

[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:02.140]
Amen to that.

[02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:03.600]
I'm with you 100%.

[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:06.780]
And I've got to get a request for the I-95 ass full song.

[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:07.380]
Okay.

[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:08.700]
Who would you like to do that?

[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:10.980]
What was the name of that group, George?

[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:13.040]
August Campbell and the Spirit of the Moment Band.

[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:13.560]
Very good.

[02:15:13.620 --> 02:15:14.340]
Oh, awesome.

[02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:15.720]
Alright. Thanks a lot, man.

[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:16.600]
And have a happy.

[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:17.460]
And back to you.

[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:17.940]
Okay.

[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:19.700]
How come it doesn't say, uh...

[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:20.820]
It's not 95.

[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.600]
I know, but it doesn't come up under the eye.

[02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:27.880]
I've had this problem every time I try to get that dim.

[02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:29.500]
No, seriously.

[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:30.860]
Well, how do you... how'd you do it?

[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:32.620]
I dashed 95 ass full song.

[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:34.240]
Oh, I dashed!

[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:36.760]
I dashed.

[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:37.520]
Oh.

[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.980]
Well, I don't want you to say that in there.

[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:42.640]
You know, I don't have to talk to you.

[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:44.000]
Oh, that's true.

[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:45.780]
Oh, that's true.

[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:47.840]
I have to drop a couple of hours in there.

[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:48.860]
Or something now.

[02:15:56.020 --> 02:15:59.040]
Well, I was driving down I-95 the other night.

[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:02.420]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.

[02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:06.680]
I decided what we're going to do in the good of yet, man.

[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:09.060]
I wrote a song about him and said,

[02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:11.320]
and those like this,

[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:15.920]
where he born in Apple.

[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:16.560]
Yes.

[02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:19.660]
Or did he work in a terrible life?

[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.940]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.640]
Did you hear an Apple's knife?

[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:28.480]
Yeah.

[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.180]
Get your an A.

[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:34.120]
That's that thing, so L.E.

[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:37.980]
And don't you try to play this on me.

[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:42.080]
You deserve all the credit.

[02:16:43.380 --> 02:16:45.900]
You're an Apple's knife.

[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:51.920]
You're an Apple's.

[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:56.120]
Yes, you're an Apple's knife.

[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:00.320]
I've got a feeling

[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:05.180]
You'll be an Apple's the rest of your life.

[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:10.160]
Are you sure?

[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:41.440]
I'm gonna be a Apple's.

[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:45.100]
I was talking to your father.

[02:17:45.780 --> 02:17:45.780]

[02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:48.940]
Jeff, he heard it tonight.

[02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:53.400]
I told her I thought you were an Apple.

[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:55.600]
You did, yeah.

[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:57.280]
I think you're right.

[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:03.520]
And all your friends are Apple.

[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:07.280]
You've known that you're a whole life.

[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:11.640]
And somebody told me

[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:14.380]
you've got an Apple's.

[02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:15.480]
Or a Life.

[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:21.940]
Were he born in Apple?

[02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:25.660]
Or did you work in it, your whole life?

[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:29.920]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:32.000]
You're hearing that.

[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:38.060]
You call that a penis?

[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:39.980]
Holds a knife.

[02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:42.140]
Oh, right.

[02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:45.860]
I said, $1.49 is $5.60 WQAN.

[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.460]
Don't forget Tuesday night, 6.9 PM.

[02:18:47.460 --> 02:18:48.720]
We'll be at the pizza loft.

[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:49.600]
Our one and only.

[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:52.280]
Repairance this year with our best in the LCDs cassettes.

[02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:55.140]
T-shirts, those free buttons, those in the Y-axis buttons.

[02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:56.060]
What's the name?

[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.740]
Jeff from New Age Design Graphics.

[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:00.460]
From New Age Design Graphics made up for us.

[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:03.880]
They've got me pictured like a little Buddha with a cigar in my purse.

[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:05.820]
And a finger up in the ear, the middle one.

[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:08.000]
And a thing of fish food in one hand.

[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:08.840]
Those are really nifty.

[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:09.600]
And they're free too.

[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:11.920]
We're not talking about free key chains.

[02:19:12.060 --> 02:19:14.400]
I want to make that clear because you know some asshole will show up.

[02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:17.040]
Don't get those key chains.

[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:18.740]
You say, the other buttons were for free.

[02:19:18.980 --> 02:19:19.740]
Yeah, the buttons.

[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:21.880]
Button button, who's got the button?

[02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:22.820]
Not the key chains.

[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:24.400]
Button, look at the button.

[02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:25.740]
Is the button like got the...

[02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:25.880]
No.

[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:27.300]
Is it a key chain?

[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:27.580]
No.

[02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:29.460]
Does it have like a little thing to make sounds in it?

[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:29.720]
No.

[02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:30.540]
No, there you go.

[02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:31.500]
I got a button on it.

[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:33.240]
I got a button for you.

[02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:34.560]
That's where to put it.

[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:38.380]
So like I said, 6.9 PM at the pizza loft on Tuesday night.

[02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:40.220]
And even Al Goldstein will be there.

[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:43.020]
That's where everybody's coming to see it.

[02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:45.880]
And then Al Goldstein, I'm going to get those keys.

[02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:48.040]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:48.280]
Hello.

[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:49.100]
Good afternoon.

[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:49.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:50.460]
How are you?

[02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:50.820]
Great.

[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:53.920]
Somebody stole my thunder by giving you the fire report on Al,

[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:55.580]
but I'd call to see if thank you anyway.

[02:19:57.140 --> 02:19:58.820]
He was on that show this morning.

[02:19:59.040 --> 02:19:59.220]
Yeah.

[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:00.840]
Call the Fort request.

[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:02.100]
You mean Howard Stern to you?

[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:02.420]
Yeah.

[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:02.840]
Okay.

[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:06.720]
Well, he built it up to be a great show, but this is a great show today.

[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:07.680]
Great bits.

[02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:08.920]
Great, great, great bits.

[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:10.100]
Oh, this is Al's favorite show.

[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:11.700]
I mean, he says that every time it comes on the show,

[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:14.540]
he just sucks up the Howard because he wants to get the hits on his website.

[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:15.760]
That's true.

[02:20:16.420 --> 02:20:17.640]
We got a request for you, sir.

[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:20.660]
The HFCK song?

[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:21.460]
Okay.

[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:22.160]
Thank you.

[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:23.280]
And have a great holiday.

[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:24.060]
Bye, bye, bye.

[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:24.340]
Okay.

[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:25.020]
Bye, bye.

[02:20:25.580 --> 02:20:26.400]
Where the hell is that?

[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:35.540]
I had a chicken egg.

[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:38.320]
When they shoot you away,

[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:42.020]
to Tijuana, where the moon is going?

[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.960]
I'll go with you.

[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:46.500]
But if I write wings censorship,

[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:49.120]
there are words to mustn't slip.

[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:52.980]
Who do you tell you to how I feel for K.

[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:53.500]
K.

[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:54.120]

[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:54.680]
K.

[02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:56.660]
Hello.

[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:01.360]
HFCK is Tijuana.

[02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:05.440]
And I'll see you in TV, you wanna tune.

[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:10.200]
HFCK, tell her I'm a service day.

[02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:13.160]
And the HFCK won't let me sing this.

[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:16.240]
So I'm not gonna say how HFCK,

[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:18.420]
take her hands, gently say.

[02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:20.680]
Then after this transition,

[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:23.440]
I'll be out in 90 days old.

[02:21:24.180 --> 02:21:25.620]
HFCK, you wanna.

[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:28.420]
Then I'll see you with Tijuana.

[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:30.580]
And I'll go, wanna go.

[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:33.240]
But gotta see you with Tijuana.

[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:33.960]
Go!

[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:40.800]
Tough to be two at 5, 60, QM.

[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:41.860]
So would you just tell me Bob,

[02:21:42.220 --> 02:21:43.440]
from Dick and his head out of T-shirts,

[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:44.980]
is gonna bring us a whole bunch of Dick and his head

[02:21:44.980 --> 02:21:46.140]
or T-shirts to give away to tonight?

[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:47.000]
Yes.

[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:48.060]
I'll see you, that's good news.

[02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:49.180]
But of course a lot of people are saying,

[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.180]
oh well, you've got stuff like that to give away.

[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:53.160]
And you'll only give it to the good looking guy, young guys.

[02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:53.840]
Yeah.

[02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:54.640]
And that's true.

[02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:57.240]
And what's the point?

[02:21:58.340 --> 02:21:58.900]
Five seconds.

[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:00.920]
There's no good looking young girls ever show up.

[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:02.100]
They don't?

[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:02.820]
What?

[02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:03.240]
Three.

[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:04.380]
How could you say that?

[02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:04.920]
Ever?

[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:05.720]
How many?

[02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:07.380]
I have a knownest.

[02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:08.740]
No, I noticed.

[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:09.360]
I noticed.

[02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:11.160]
How can you say that?

[02:22:11.260 --> 02:22:12.480]
Over the years, I'd say maybe four.

[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:13.480]
Five.

[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:17.560]
That's over the years, maybe a total of five.

[02:22:19.080 --> 02:22:19.920]
What do you want?

[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:20.980]
I know what you want.

[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:21.980]
I know what I want.

[02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:25.480]
Maybe Jacob will show up to tonight speaking to what I want.

[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:26.900]
No, that'll chase his ass away.

[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:28.540]
Maybe the rest of them too.

[02:22:29.380 --> 02:22:30.460]
Here's a mobile and candle.

[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:30.800]
Hello.

[02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:33.200]
I'm not in candle, but Neil.

[02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:33.980]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:36.180]
There isn't any hot kiss on her.

[02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:38.640]
It's because hot kiss on made me toil.

[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:42.680]
And the lamp had only one day's what of oil.

[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:43.680]
And it's one day's what.

[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.580]
Eight days at point and it's still burning it now.

[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:48.580]
Okay, thanks.

[02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:49.720]
And say how to jacumace it.

[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:51.080]
So we eat potato lockers.

[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:51.700]
I'm Hanukkah.

[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:52.840]
I bet you Monday we have some in here.

[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:54.640]
Can we have some last year somebody brought us by?

[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:55.120]
Yes.

[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:56.400]
Corkeys, out in Pembera pie.

[02:22:56.580 --> 02:22:58.640]
Corkeys are good post best friends in Pembera pie.

[02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:00.720]
And of course, that's probably not real good for me being diabetic.

[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:02.120]
I shouldn't be eating potatoes anyway.

[02:23:02.420 --> 02:23:05.300]
And certainly with my grid, my grid and grid and IBS,

[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:06.600]
I shouldn't be eating fried foods.

[02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:07.560]
But maybe I'll make an exception.

[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:08.940]
Just a couple, dozen.

[02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:12.060]
Yeah, that sounds real good.

[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:13.040]
Some potato lockers.

[02:23:13.140 --> 02:23:14.660]
See those real, real thin ones.

[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:15.460]
Those are the good ones.

[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:17.460]
Real, real crisp and thin.

[02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:18.520]
Hmm.

[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:21.680]
Here's Miami.

[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:22.000]
Hello.

[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:22.880]
Up the nail.

[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:23.660]
How you doing sir?

[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:25.660]
George has eaten for first and Palestinian food.

[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:26.320]
Yes sir.

[02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:27.420]
How you doing sir?

[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:28.020]
Okay.

[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:29.160]
Hey, I'm from Niels.

[02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:33.060]
What Broward doesn't realize is if Wayne, Mr. Wayne,

[02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:35.180]
sells the team, the new owner is going to move it out.

[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:36.160]
Now, he can't do it.

[02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:37.880]
You can't have a contract?

[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:39.460]
Yeah, and it's in the lease.

[02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:40.660]
Oh, okay then.

[02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:43.260]
Hey, they were smart when I did that, thank God.

[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:43.520]
Yeah.

[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:46.500]
Well, I thought they'd eat scoops in the back for 50 cents.

[02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:47.000]
You know that.

[02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:48.900]
Oh, you're just, you're telling me?

[02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:50.260]
I have a requester.

[02:23:50.620 --> 02:23:50.940]
Yes sir.

[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:54.720]
Even though this person will save us from $5 a gallon gas.

[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:57.720]
Can you play, Sada will say the MS?

[02:23:58.280 --> 02:23:58.760]
You got it.

[02:23:58.960 --> 02:23:59.360]
Thank you sir.

[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:01.700]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:05.300]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:08.840]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:09.800]
Yes sir.

[02:24:09.980 --> 02:24:12.780]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:15.840]
I ran to crappy little country.

[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:19.340]
That was like the most national in space.

[02:24:20.060 --> 02:24:21.800]
Just get rid of that.

[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:26.420]
You're in drinking jubbies and blow up the whole goddamn place.

[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:30.580]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:33.820]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:37.400]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:44.640]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:45.660 --> 02:24:49.060]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:51.640]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:51.700]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:51.980 --> 02:24:52.100]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:52.460]
All right.

[02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:55.140]
Sada will say the mother f*** up.

[02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:55.620]
Yeah.

[02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:58.700]
50 cents a QA and we got a facts here from Adam who says,

[02:24:58.700 --> 02:25:01.660]
please, please play Butterfly kisses and have a great holiday.

[02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:03.580]
Well, did I play that right off the bat this morning?

[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:05.600]
Now, what do you give me an exasperated look?

[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:06.720]
But that was a long time ago.

[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:10.260]
Like a fourth time that's happened today with somebody requesting something that you just got done playing.

[02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:14.880]
I didn't just get done playing and I was just about to say I played it three hours ago.

[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.060]
A whole three hours.

[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:21.260]
Well, I'll think about it during the break.

[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:33.400]
This is 560 QAF, 430-560 WQAM by Emmy for Gludderdale, a beastly broadcast for WQAM.com with a world.

[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:35.800]
It's the one to two hour.

[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:37.500]
Hi, Vey.

[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:39.940]
I think it's Daddy's Daddy's socks.

[02:25:40.140 --> 02:25:41.600]
He's my short fan.

[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:46.460]
It's just things I know.

[02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:48.900]
Daddy, you're a loser.

[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:54.660]
She said here from heaven and she's Daddy's little girl.

[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:56.180]
I went back home in my pants.

[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:59.680]
I got all of the time.

[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:04.680]
I think Mommy keeps on you.

[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:19.360]
Hi, Samantha and Elise here.

[02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:26.620]
Daddy, why don't you get a job?

[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:35.820]
Daddy, you smell like beer.

[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:44.940]
I'm dropping out of high school.

[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:48.060]
Just looking like a mama.

[02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:50.420]
A little more everyday.

[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:51.860]
Daddy, I'm pregnant.

[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:53.900]
One more mama.

[02:26:54.540 --> 02:26:56.180]
The other part.

[02:26:56.380 --> 02:26:58.380]
I don't know who the father is.

[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:03.900]
I asked the turn shake.

[02:27:03.940 --> 02:27:07.900]
I asked.

[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:10.240]
I drove the car into a tree.

[02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:13.900]
Can you just send me some cigarettes?

[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:20.020]
Hey, how about a toast for the bride and the world?

[02:27:20.020 --> 02:27:23.380]
She'll change her name today.

[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:25.900]
Daddy, I'm getting married again.

[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:30.880]
She'll make a promise and I'll give her away.

[02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:32.260]
Dad, that's my ass.

[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:36.480]
Standing in the bride room just staring at her.

[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:38.180]
I think I have siffling.

[02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:42.920]
And I said I'm not you.

[02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:46.000]
No, I got a letter going.

[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:53.400]
Hey, Pop, we're moving in.

[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:56.000]
And butterfly kisser.

[02:27:57.540 --> 02:27:59.060]
Dad, I asked you.

[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:00.840]
I'm a lesbian.

[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:03.860]
You did pay three plays in the facts.

[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.360]
Two minutes after one at five, six, they're back in the food channel.

[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:07.980]
They were eating Swedish meatballs.

[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:09.260]
Oh, man.

[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:11.180]
I love one of my favorite things in the world.

[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:12.140]
Be stroganoff.

[02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:13.720]
With sour cream.

[02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:18.620]
And of course, can I eat that because it's on noodles and it's got all that to know.

[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:20.720]
You'll have to eat out of the noodles.

[02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:22.280]
Yeah, sometimes mashed potatoes is good.

[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:25.440]
Yeah, all potato lattes is good with the two.

[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:29.320]
Here's a call from somewhere but don't say on my thing.

[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:29.600]
Hello.

[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:31.160]
Hello.

[02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:35.400]
Maybe that's why I don't say.

[02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:37.040]
Well, it was checking.

[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:37.800]
It was flashing.

[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:39.300]
Here's Miami.

[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:39.640]
Hello.

[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:40.480]
Hello, Neil.

[02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:41.120]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:41.600]
Good afternoon.

[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:42.340]
How are you?

[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:43.080]
I'm doing okay.

[02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:45.260]
The best show on noodles can't be a damn it.

[02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:46.020]
You are the man.

[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:48.280]
Neil, what are you telling me?

[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:49.940]
We're all happy, Neil.

[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:51.320]
So we have a shameless request.

[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:52.080]
Yes, please.

[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:54.180]
Vicky's clothes, where is there?

[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:54.980]
What is it?

[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:56.160]
Vicky's clothes, where?

[02:28:56.700 --> 02:28:57.340]
The pants band.

[02:28:58.600 --> 02:28:59.660]
You know, Vicky's.

[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:00.800]
Vicky's?

[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:01.360]
Yes, sir.

[02:29:01.420 --> 02:29:02.260]
Oh, I bet we don't have that.

[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:02.620]

[02:29:04.860 --> 02:29:05.220]
Hello.

[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:08.700]

[02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:13.360]

[02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:14.160]
Thank you.

[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:15.880]
Transferring to an operator.

[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:17.140]
Please wait.

[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.700]
Vicky's customer service.

[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:21.500]
This is Luanne.

[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:22.280]
How may I help you?

[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:23.560]
Yeah, my Luanne.

[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:23.920]
Hi.

[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:25.420]
You like Dickies?

[02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:26.060]
Sure.

[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:27.800]
I guess a lot of women do, huh?

[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:29.680]
I believe so.

[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:32.060]
My woman says she loves to get Dickies.

[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:33.080]
I say.

[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:34.400]
She likes a lot of them.

[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:35.060]
Yeah.

[02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:37.900]
And understands I'm gay guys like Dickies.

[02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:38.680]
Well, I'm gay.

[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:38.680]

[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:38.680]

[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:38.680]

[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:38.680]

[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:39.840]
I really don't know.

[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:41.420]
I really thought about that.

[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:42.880]
What's the biggest Dickies you've seen?

[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:45.680]
Well, sir, we go out to a 72 waist.

[02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:46.840]
Oh, my God.

[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:48.700]
Do you like little Dickies, too?

[02:29:49.060 --> 02:29:49.680]
Sir, I'm...

[02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:52.760]
I think my girl basically likes big Dickies.

[02:29:53.220 --> 02:29:55.600]
Well, is there a point to this conversation, sir?

[02:29:55.660 --> 02:29:57.900]
Yeah, just as I get to say Dickie a lot on the phone.

[02:29:58.520 --> 02:29:58.640]
Yeah.

[02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:00.700]
Were you wanting to place an order, sir?

[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:01.460]
For what?

[02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:02.400]
For clothing.

[02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:03.040]
All right.

[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:04.140]
I want to talk about Dickies.

[02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:06.140]
Well, sir, that's what we carry is clothing.

[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:08.320]
Well, Mickey Dickie.

[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:09.380]
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

[02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:12.860]
Sir, if there's no other reason that you're calling this...

[02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:14.040]
I'm not like Dickies.

[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:15.600]
A lot of women like Dickies.

[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:17.460]
I'm going to disconnect.

[02:30:17.620 --> 02:30:19.220]
No, when you're talking about Dickie.

[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:22.280]
How is Dickie, by the way?

[02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:24.260]
Four minutes after one at five sixty W.D.C.M.

[02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:26.200]
After the show's over, I just mentioned this in passing.

[02:30:26.340 --> 02:30:27.100]
That thing's going to need ink.

[02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:30.000]
But in the meantime, the facts is, you know,

[02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:31.860]
I mean, I can read like every other word.

[02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:33.540]
And this is Pete the chronic X-port office.

[02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:34.420]
I want to read all his words.

[02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:36.080]
Is this his best new investment?

[02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:37.680]
Is it going to be not renewing his Panther ticket?

[02:30:37.820 --> 02:30:38.040]
Oh!

[02:30:38.620 --> 02:30:39.400]
Good idea, Pete.

[02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:41.720]
But you know the scan they're going to come up with.

[02:30:41.980 --> 02:30:43.600]
Like, you know, in a month or so, they'll say,

[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:45.020]
all the way we got a new ownership in here,

[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:46.320]
and they're going to do this, they're going to do that.

[02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:47.280]
And they're going to use that.

[02:30:47.340 --> 02:30:49.280]
Plus, we got the big All Star game coming in three years.

[02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:51.520]
That's going to be the big incentive, the big push

[02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:54.500]
to try to suck people into what's around their money over again.

[02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:56.900]
I don't think it's going to work too good.

[02:30:58.020 --> 02:30:58.540]
Here's Miami.

[02:30:58.780 --> 02:30:58.900]
Hello.

[02:30:59.100 --> 02:30:59.700]
How you doing, Your?

[02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:00.020]
Okay.

[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:05.300]
You need to pick up the new Playboy with Gabrielle Reef

[02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:05.740]
on the cover.

[02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:06.260]
Yeah.

[02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:09.600]
And they have very interesting interview with Gary Johnson in there.

[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:11.940]
Yes, somebody called about that the other day.

[02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:15.320]
I just read it today and it's very interesting.

[02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:18.480]
Somebody to think for for 2004 if you ever decide.

[02:31:19.580 --> 02:31:19.880]
Okay.

[02:31:20.180 --> 02:31:21.720]
And my request is that you're shoulders.

[02:31:22.140 --> 02:31:22.900]
Okay, you got them in.

[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:23.280]
Thanks, me.

[02:31:23.540 --> 02:31:23.820]
See them.

[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:26.360]
Yeah, that's the pot guy.

[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:29.120]
In fact, I hear that they got like the insert in Playboy this one.

[02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:31.500]
Instead, they play Boy Bunny, it's just rolling papers.

[02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:34.700]
That's what I'm hearing.

[02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:37.520]
Hi, Felicia.

[02:31:37.920 --> 02:31:41.480]
Gee, I love your dress and your hair looks so shiny and manageable.

[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:44.280]
Are you still shampooing with head and shoulders?

[02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:45.640]
I got sick.

[02:31:46.060 --> 02:31:48.340]
I've stopped using head and shoulders a long time ago.

[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:51.380]
I mean, honestly, who grows hair on their shoulders anyway?

[02:31:51.900 --> 02:31:52.660]
Yeah, right.

[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.540]
So what are you using now?

[02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:58.280]
Well, it's like head and shoulders only without all those additives.

[02:31:58.280 --> 02:31:59.980]
It's just called head.

[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:01.720]
Let's tell them about it, girl.

[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:06.200]
It's a tire job to open, head, head, head.

[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:08.020]
Well, take it and feel it.

[02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:11.640]
Yeah, yeah, just remember what I did.

[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:14.980]
You'll feel better if you get some head.

[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:15.460]
Wow.

[02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:17.420]
Where can I get head?

[02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:18.840]
Lots of places, chicks.

[02:32:19.340 --> 02:32:22.920]
You can stop by my place later and I'll be happy to give you this head.

[02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:27.320]
In 50 minutes, I'll have you shampooed, dialed, and blown dry.

[02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:29.440]
Gee, you don't miss a lick, do you?

[02:32:29.720 --> 02:32:32.000]
It's a 10-pound treat, but is it expensive?

[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:33.520]
Not at all, chicks.

[02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:38.180]
I'd rather say there are places downtown where you can get head for less than $10.

[02:32:38.780 --> 02:32:40.120]
Jolly, that's that price.

[02:32:40.460 --> 02:32:41.820]
Everyone should be getting head.

[02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:42.960]
That's right, chicks.

[02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:45.160]
When you say head, you set a mouthful.

[02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:47.040]
Hi, I'm Dr. Raymond Bolotica.

[02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:48.260]
I'm free to go live with you.

[02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:50.260]
Here it tells you why you should get head.

[02:32:50.740 --> 02:32:52.940]
First, at lubricate each lip hair follicle,

[02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:54.580]
leaving in a wrecked, listening shaft.

[02:32:54.580 --> 02:32:57.420]
Then the scalp's natural oils are sucked out of the root,

[02:32:57.520 --> 02:32:59.980]
leaving your hair soft, shiny, and exhausted.

[02:33:00.340 --> 02:33:01.840]
Nothing does the job like head.

[02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:05.160]
Where can I get head from my head, or some bruise?

[02:33:05.460 --> 02:33:08.520]
Probably, but you might want to try your girlfriend first.

[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:11.700]
Go out and get some head to day.

[02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:15.020]
Yeah, yeah, there's work, those are not all legs.

[02:33:15.400 --> 02:33:18.280]
Yeah, yeah, you'll look better and you'll feel periff.

[02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:21.500]
Yeah, yeah, when you get head, you're a nutty sip.

[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:23.880]
What hair with lots of volume?

[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:25.740]
Nothing gets it up like head.

[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:28.320]
Available at a price you won't find hard to swallow.

[02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:30.620]
And it's going down every day.

[02:33:32.660 --> 02:33:34.800]
Honey, we're out in shampoo.

[02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:37.120]
Can you go out and get some head?

[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:38.440]
What did you say?

[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:42.600]
I said, I want you to go out and get head.

[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:45.060]
Oh, thank you, sweet Jesus.

[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:46.500]
I'm going down, down.

[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:49.460]
And head makes a great holiday gift.

[02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:52.060]
Last Christmas, my wife gave me some head.

[02:33:52.060 --> 02:33:53.860]
Then I gave her a pearl necklace.

[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:56.060]
I've never seen her so choke them.

[02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:58.940]
My girlfriend used to give me head, and then we got married.

[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:02.240]
Now I'm lucky if I get Jurgens lotion and a national D-Wrap.

[02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:06.420]
When you try, we will find out how to stop.

[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:09.160]
Can't feel the pain, my son y'all stop.

[02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:12.440]
Can't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:15.420]
Can't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:15.560]
Can't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:22.040]
Can't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:25.380]
Can't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:29.020]
Can't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:31.560]
Don't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:31.580]
Can't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:31.640]
Can't get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:34.100]
Baby, get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:37.460]
Baby, get in the shower, no one out comes.

[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:52.020]
Baby, you are babies, baby.

[02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:56.180]
I can't pull my little head, my help, but I won't put the hair back on your head.

[02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:58.980]
This is the most disgusting program.

[02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:02.560]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[02:35:03.740 --> 02:35:04.220]
Wow.

[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:07.040]
Hey, how you doing, honey?

[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:11.280]
I'm the United States.

[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:14.620]
This is my state of the women's dress.

[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:21.440]
I've known a few girls who stuff they were pretty hot, but Millie's here to tell you

[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:22.080]
that girl.

[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:23.000]
You're not.

[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:29.880]
They used to wear makeup and rib-boy pants, but when they looked at me, they were under

[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:30.820]
my triumph.

[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:31.960]
Wow.

[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:34.760]
You think you're special.

[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:35.980]
Wow.

[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:37.520]
You think you're special.

[02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:38.540]

[02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:39.880]
You think you're special.

[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:42.020]
So Paula Jones, you got a new nose.

[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:44.380]
That dome impressed me much.

[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:50.140]
Well, you got the right part of you got the touch.

[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:51.900]
Now, don't get me wrong.

[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:55.880]
Well, I'll blink here all right, but that won't give me one.

[02:35:56.020 --> 02:35:58.740]
That's a mill all for nine.

[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:02.760]
That dome impressed me much.

[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:09.160]
I think you were number one.

[02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:15.800]
She had a tape recorder that she kept on her song, and after she ate safe, she was

[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:16.960]
very the bone.

[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:25.260]
She got herself a rifle and a tummy tuck, but she still has ugly as a hockey puck.

[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:38.560]
So when the trip got some surgery, that dome impressed me much.

[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:43.840]
Well, you got the right part of you got the touch.

[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:45.680]
Now, don't get me wrong.

[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:49.680]
Yeah, I'll blink here all right, but that won't give me one.

[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:52.200]
That's a mill all for nine.

[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:57.060]
That dome impressed me much.

[02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:00.600]
I keep re-opening.

[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:02.000]
Oh, yeah.

[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:03.100]
How about this next one?

[02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:07.140]
A vague chunky girl with a perturbed of the right.

[02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:10.520]
That damn gas dress nearly put away.

[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:14.580]
Weble-sacres madeings of my car ignore.

[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:18.540]
I could have caught Will Chamberlain by how to score.

[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:21.380]
What a sexy face.

[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:22.360]
A sexy face.

[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.240]
A sexy face.

[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:29.780]
So Monica, you lost 40 pounds.

[02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:32.180]
That dome impressed me much.

[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:37.720]
Well, you got the right part of you got the touch.

[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:39.700]
Now, don't get me wrong.

[02:37:40.100 --> 02:37:43.700]
Well, I'll blink here all right, but that won't give me one.

[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:46.100]
That's a mill all for nine.

[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:48.520]
Oh, yeah.

[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:50.500]
That dome impressed me much.

[02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:55.500]
I'm playing the best for one.

[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:01.060]
Well, I've tried to cut the brakes on her car.

[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:04.700]
No offense, but I think I'd rather sleep with Kenneth Star.

[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:08.760]
Once she gives birth, I'll blink her arms, breaks her head.

[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:12.800]
Big old legs, and an ass too much.

[02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:15.940]
What a sexy face.

[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:19.900]
A sexy face.

[02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:23.780]
So Hillary, you're going to be a senator from New York.

[02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:25.980]
Not dome impressed me much.

[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:31.580]
Well, you got the right part of you got the touch.

[02:38:32.580 --> 02:38:37.500]
I'll blink here all right, but that won't give you one.

[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:39.960]
That's a mill all for nine.

[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:44.520]
That dome impressed me much.

[02:38:45.700 --> 02:38:46.340]
Thank you.

[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:48.380]
That is my side in the women's dress.

[02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:49.760]
I love you.

[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:51.420]
Good morning, Americans.

[02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:52.740]
It's Paul Harvey.

[02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:54.540]
Stand by for news.

[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:58.840]
83-year-old Ja-ja-ga-bor.

[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:04.280]
And her 59-year-old husband, Prince Friedrich von Unholt,

[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:10.740]
are suing the Pfizer Pharmaceutical Company for $7 million.

[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:22.040]
Gabor and her hubby claim that the drug by Agra made her 59-year-old husband,

[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:24.760]
and the vaccine, and the vaccine, and the vaccine, and the vaccine.

[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:29.660]
This reporter suggests that in fact it may not have been the fault of the drug by Agra,

[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:35.800]
but instead the fact that Prince Friedrich has to stare at an 83-year-old Kuchy.

[02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:37.020]
Paul Harvey.

[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:38.760]
Good day.

[02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:39.260]
Good day.

[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:43.400]
116-8-560-W-Q-A-M-567-0-560.

[02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:44.060]
Look at that.

[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:45.480]
Airby Lott and the board is smoking.

[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:46.400]
They all work today.

[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:49.360]
So, as we came into the line of five-starter working again,

[02:39:49.660 --> 02:39:51.560]
we should have known that everything would be okay except the market.

[02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:55.660]
Here's the mobile and blatant V-chillow.

[02:39:55.900 --> 02:39:57.820]
Hey, as soon as you start talking about ventilation,

[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:00.320]
crack the post-art work and again, it's a beautiful thing.

[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:00.740]
Uh-huh.

[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:02.380]
Happy Kahnato.

[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:03.280]
And back to you.

[02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:04.780]
Oh, well, thank you very much.

[02:40:04.900 --> 02:40:05.680]
I love it all over me.

[02:40:05.820 --> 02:40:06.820]
So, are you too many Lottkas?

[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:08.200]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:40:08.880 --> 02:40:09.480]
Good, sir.

[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:16.000]
I would love to hear the Schrozer do the whole thing where he starts with

[02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:19.080]
Oh, God, now I can't think of it.

[02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:19.640]
Hey, man.

[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:23.380]
And then this is the whole thing instead of just the old man part.

[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:23.900]
Yeah.

[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:25.660]
Tell me that for me.

[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:28.040]
Well, don't just say the spars,

[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:29.740]
to tell us which parts you're talking about.

[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:32.900]
Oh, it's, um, it's okay.

[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:33.760]
Okay.

[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:34.400]
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:34.880]
It's a pleasure.

[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:35.060]
It's a pleasure.

[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:35.180]
It's a pleasure.

[02:40:35.380 --> 02:40:35.440]
It's a pleasure.

[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:37.360]
Because, you know, the sail, the three-map boat, you know,

[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:37.800]
it's a pleasure.

[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:38.040]

[02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:38.780]

[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:03.840]

[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:03.840]

[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:03.900]

[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:03.900]

[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:03.900]

[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:03.900]

[02:41:04.060 --> 02:41:04.060]

I can't remember.

[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:05.420]
I can't remember.

[02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:05.980]
I can't remember.

[02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:05.980]

[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:06.520]

[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:06.680]
I can't remember.

[02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:07.160]
I can't remember.

[02:41:08.260 --> 02:41:09.100]

I can't remember.

[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:33.060]
I can't remember.

[02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:38.060]
You know, they always remind me to.

[02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:38.280]
You know when they sometimes roll on you whatever.

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:38.280]

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:39.360]
So, what are you really trying to say, judgment?

[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:48.460]
Okay, speaking of that, speaking of death row prisoner dies now DNA test clears. I'm sure some of you who read the newspaper saw this horrendous story.

[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:59.660]
Here's a guy that spent a dark conflict of course. 14 years on death row. And guess what? Did he do it? No, but too late now because he died from cancer in jail 11 months ago.

[02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:10.680]
DNA evidence has exonerated death row inmate frankly Smith of rape and murder of an eight year old brow county girl and now they know who did it. Although that guy is in some psychiatric facility. He's incompetent to stand trial.

[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:29.200]
Frankly Smith attorney Jeffrey Smith no relation says the state prosecutors had resisted testing frankly Smith while he was alive and pursuing his appeals once he was dead. They were landed and became more cooperative about letting us get the test on. So now that he's dead, they said, oh guess what made this fake and he's dead anyway.

[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:32.160]
Nice go on state of Florida. All right.

[02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:56.380]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How are you? Great. Happy holidays to you and the same. Thank you. And I would request if I may, the black psychic and if you could put anything with Harry carry after that, I'd be a happy man for the next 22 years. Okay. Okay. See you.

I played Florida on the hit show. Good time. And since my residuals ran out over 20 years ago, I've been helping other brothers and sisters find their way with the psychic Negro network.

[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:41.180]
We welcome your cause because nobody has a better understanding of black oppression. That's why it don't even need a credit card. It just like rent in your TV will gladly bill it right to your phone Negro.

[02:43:41.180 --> 02:43:54.100]
Psychic is standing by right now at one nine hundred give me all money to take your call for the low price of only seven ninety nine and a minute while they can tell you if that van a y'all is leading.

[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:08.140]
Oh, if it already left. And if the reds are going to be stringy or tender. So let the psychic Negro network guide you down the primrose path of focus prophecy.

[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:37.880]
Don't you call my friends. Hey, deal. Thank you. There you go, man. It's a perfect for him. See, this has been a stretch of good today because you know what song with nobody is requested so far today and I better not say it out loud speaking about in time. Okay, I won't say it. And I also will play it. Here's a mobile and highly hello. Hello, yes. What are we going to do in the next full year? Listen. I had a lot of business. I was for all requests, but if you would play all you can need Negro. I already played it.

[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:51.180]
All you're kidding. I'm not kidding. I just kind of the car. When if you look at the chance, I'm going to play a twice a one day. I wash your car for six months every day. Okay, I love you. Okay, not going to do it. 560560.

[02:44:52.400 --> 02:45:08.580]
I'm not going to do it. Are you sure positive? Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. I knew. Yes, man. I have two things to say. First of all, guiding light blows lately. Well, I haven't missed anything good. And if you could play the Jamaican lady.

[02:45:09.340 --> 02:45:10.940]
Did you make it lady? Yeah.

[02:45:12.380 --> 02:45:22.600]
Saying what? Doing what? Oh, the Jamaican tarot card? No, she tells you about the soccer. And then you say soccer, soccer.

[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:26.380]
Okay. Thanks.

[02:45:27.340 --> 02:45:37.620]
Do you have any idea what she's talking about? It was a call. Well, we don't have that. It was on a best of. I think that's why it probably was she heard it more than once. Oh, okay. What's the answer? No.

[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:48.980]
Sorry. 567.0560. Well, it's almost 130 already. I mean, you think I'm going to turn around and look into back there and see it all that energy at this point. Not at all far like me. Sorry, man, but to have a nice life.

[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:54.660]
And you're right, guiding light. I haven't watched that thing in a koon thing since we had all this other stuff going on about the. No.

[02:45:56.460 --> 02:46:04.440]
Although now thank goodness I'm finding alternatives like even the food channel. I'm sitting here just drooling in the man Swedish meatballs and beef stroganoff.

[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:18.100]
And then Mario, a multimario. He made that. He made a whole bunch of rigatoni. And he put it like an a gigantic calzone baked rigatoni in a calzone. Oh, God. We're lots of stringy cheese in there.

[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:30.920]
Here's Fort Myers. Hello. Neil, how you doing? Great. Neil, I'm calling you from Fort Myers. I am a 24 year old half-bullio and I'm probably the youngest person alive in this entire city. How you like that? Well, don't stay there too long, man.

[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:35.900]
Yeah, I have to thank you. I've been listening about five years now. I started listening to well 19 years old at the Florida State.

[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:47.680]
Look back on the old audio net when we heard about every eight word. Right. And I have to thank you for the education that I've received over the past five years. And I'm definitely a better man because of it. And the price was right. The price was right. Nice and free. I love it. It's free. It's me just like River said. Right.

[02:46:48.700 --> 02:46:55.820]
Neil, on your pole about the mall and I think you have to factor in the sympathy factor because I'm going to go to a few games to think about you. So sorry for the man.

[02:46:55.820 --> 02:47:06.320]
Yeah. There's there. You know, how many people are going to go? I go just because I feel sorry for the guy. I'm going to go. I show out a few bucks. Do you really want to know how many people are going to go? How many?

[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:19.080]
Yeah. Somebody is opening day nine people. Yeah. I'll have a whole section of myself. That's right. A lot of elbow room. Neil, Shane, what's your question? Yes, sir. Rick Wiley stole my briefcase. You got it. Thank you, sir. And have a great life. You too. Bye. Bye.

[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:33.680]
Rick Wiley stole my briefcase. Rick Wiley stole my briefcase. So George is listening and then this morning. I like the part in his face. That's what I mean. Take what gives him the right.

[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:47.680]
I think it's why I'm fighting up tonight. Rick Wiley stole my briefcase. What this grace to the human race. Oh, rigorous.

[02:47:47.680 --> 02:48:04.600]
Yes, Mark. They go. That we love me should also include Rick Wiley's. But oh, oh, oh, oh, Rick Wiley stole my briefcase. I like a part in his face. Rick Wiley, you're an asshole.

[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:34.240]
Once, one in five, seeing how you were listening to Rick and Spud this morning, if you would have been listening to the Howard, you could have heard our good friend out on there. So you probably made the right choice, even though you said that it was well. What did you say? You said we still like sud. I love suds. Yeah. And so do I. Great guy. Good friend. And then, but then you also said that the show was a non-descript. Yeah. I don't know what I heard. I look at any of them. I feel like.

[02:48:35.520 --> 02:49:03.180]
Well, don't take it personal. So we love you. It's the equals back to your hatred of requirement. That's right. I love Rick now. Yeah, those old days they're starting to look a lot better now. Aren't they? Yeah. Oh, this place still confused this place with a radio station because it ain't. It ain't. Well, continue taking the money though. Thank you. But it just. Oh, brother. Who are these people? Kidding. Not too many. Obviously from what that stock says.

[02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:33.160]
26 after one is 560 W to QM. But Neil Roger show sports radio. 560. You. A. And. Sudden. Lick. Thank you for attending today's conference on how to deal with the wide 2K problem. I would like to announce the development of a new software system, which will be year 2000 compliant. This program is known as millennia year applications software system or Maya. Next Monday, there will be a meeting in which I will show my.

[02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:50.060]
I ask everyone we will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at my. We have not addressed networking aspects yet. So currently only one person at a time can use my. This restriction will be removed after my.

[02:49:50.060 --> 02:50:01.780]
I ask expand last week my secretary said to me I'm a little nervous. I never put anything in my ass before. I helped her through the first time and afterwards she admitted that it was relatively.

[02:50:02.380 --> 02:50:30.140]
I was looking forward to doing it again and was even ready to kiss my ass. As you begin using the program feel free to put anything you want in my. As my. As grows larger we envision a time when it will be common place for supervisor to hand work to an employee and say here stick this in my. It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond here it is. I just pulled it out of my.

[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:43.160]
Excellent. Hey that big deal on Monday we killed four hours painless. Today Monday we can argue again about which year is the beginning of the next century. Huh? The new millennium baby is that I know you don't understand nail you're wrong.

[02:50:45.640 --> 02:51:00.980]
Let me put it to this way you have 20 apples. Okay. Yes. Oh you have 20 apples. Oh this is just a little for play for Monday. You have 20 apples you take 10 and you shove them off to the side. The first apple of the second 10 is number 11. Yeah.

[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:15.980]
Because there was no there was no zero apple. See that's right. Yeah there was no apple. You take an apple corer and cut the middle out of one. So all those people like either that Y2K crap last time they were a rotten to the core is what they were.

[02:51:17.890 --> 02:51:30.450]
Even when they had the big celebration in the ball fell in the big apple they were wrong guess what wrong. But sir I'll we can do it again and the people with a brain larger than their thumbnail they can celebrate the beginning of the next century in the next millennium etc.

[02:51:33.030 --> 02:51:46.130]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Mobile in Miami. Sounds awfully gone. Maybe a little buzzing it back. Yes sir. Hey how you doing? Okay.

You had no blue bowjack pit where they were talking about.

[02:52:30.210 --> 02:52:43.950]

[02:52:45.550 --> 02:52:59.930]
It took a hell of a man to take my and but shouldn't take it long. I like that. Yeah. She ain't much to see but she looks good to the bottom of a

[02:52:59.930 --> 02:53:10.970]

[02:53:35.210 --> 02:53:48.490]
Here's one. Obviously some guy singing this song and he's in some cheap fluze bedroom at the time. I'm ashamed to be here but not ashamed enough to leave.

[02:53:57.530 --> 02:54:10.490]
I'm not ashamed enough to leave. I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart.

[02:54:15.470 --> 02:54:37.990]
I want to hear it. You really wonder about guys who write lyrics like this you don't know what's drinking they've been doing. It's the bottle against the Bible in the battle for daddy's soul. Here's what I really like. It's commode hug and time in the valley.

[02:54:53.310 --> 02:55:07.190]
If you want to keep the beer we'll call the next to my ex wife's heart. My wife ran off with my best friend and I miss him.

Yeah that's right we could've said here could you imagine how terminal I would've been we'd be suicidal

[02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:14.650]
right now listen all those old files and we're having another rally rally with democracy yeah oh brother

[02:56:14.650 --> 02:56:21.090]
I'm gonna tell you I've said it for twenty five years there isn't a damn thing wrong with this

[02:56:21.090 --> 02:56:27.950]
town that a people transplant wouldn't change this could be paradise. Just get the buses

[02:56:27.950 --> 02:56:31.270]
is rolling in and I'll load them up with all the people that have to leave immediately

[02:56:31.270 --> 02:56:32.090]
if not sooner.

[02:56:33.610 --> 02:56:34.930]
This could be sensational.

[02:56:36.090 --> 02:56:44.230]
Sour, nasty, bitter, hateful, miserable, rotten, one-dimensional, obsessive,

[02:56:44.930 --> 02:56:46.390]
yeah, that's it.

[02:56:47.550 --> 02:56:48.310]
That's our motto.

[02:56:48.570 --> 02:56:53.530]
No matter who you are, we hate you and have a nice day.

[02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:58.150]
At least we're consistent.

[02:56:58.290 --> 02:57:00.290]
We may not be good here in Florida, but at least we're consistent.

[02:57:00.630 --> 02:57:01.690]
We're consistently effed up.

[02:57:03.230 --> 02:57:05.510]
23-2-2 at 560 WQM.

[02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:08.130]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[02:57:08.590 --> 02:57:09.930]
Hey beer drinkers.

[02:57:10.230 --> 02:57:14.470]
Do you find that your beer not only fills you up, it binds you up.

[02:57:14.830 --> 02:57:17.790]
You need a beer that will help you loosen up.

[02:57:18.770 --> 02:57:24.450]
Introducing the beer that not only tastes great, it packs a mega high fiber wallet.

[02:57:24.850 --> 02:57:27.610]
It's the first beer that's also a laxative.

[02:57:28.150 --> 02:57:29.910]
We call it Shats.

[02:57:30.250 --> 02:57:31.010]
Oh, God.

[02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:36.290]
S-H-A-T of Costa V.S. Shats.

[02:57:37.230 --> 02:57:41.510]
All the cats get their hats to the man who's drinking Shats.

[02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:45.490]
The man who needs some fiber is cruel and fair.

[02:57:45.750 --> 02:57:47.390]
And I'm not a shat and dumb.

[02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:49.490]
We're not just number one.

[02:57:49.650 --> 02:57:52.450]
The Shats is always number two.

[02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:58.230]
Hi, I'm Phil Throne from Shats.

[02:57:59.510 --> 02:58:00.910]
For yourself a Shats.

[02:58:01.390 --> 02:58:03.910]
And see why it's making a splash all over the country.

[02:58:04.650 --> 02:58:06.610]
Shats, the laxative beer.

[02:58:07.150 --> 02:58:09.870]
Shats is brewed with the highest quality hops in barley.

[02:58:09.870 --> 02:58:13.750]
Then we add our secret ingredient, full-turned-tone.

[02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:16.570]
Not too much, just a pinch.

[02:58:18.190 --> 02:58:21.230]
Every Shats beer is Spotify with 12 central vitamins.

[02:58:21.770 --> 02:58:25.110]
So you're always guaranteed a good healthy Shats.

[02:58:25.810 --> 02:58:30.870]
Shats is available in the 6-ounce little squirt or the 64-ounce pig logger.

[02:58:31.810 --> 02:58:33.970]
And every Shats is paper to one end.

[02:58:34.310 --> 02:58:36.290]
So your can won't slam Shats.

[02:58:36.970 --> 02:58:41.170]
We hear at Shats are saddened by the recent passing of Adolf Shats,

[02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:43.670]
founder of the Shat Family Brewery,

[02:58:43.950 --> 02:58:45.750]
better known as the old brick Shats.

[02:58:46.530 --> 02:58:49.610]
In fact, Adolf loved his beer so much.

[02:58:50.390 --> 02:58:54.950]
His last wish was to be interred in a giant band of Shats.

[02:58:57.550 --> 02:59:00.590]
So come on when it's time to take a load off.

[02:59:00.970 --> 02:59:02.170]
Crack open a Shats.

[02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:08.070]
You will say, O'Reilly calls Rodriguez on its way.

[02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:13.870]
Oh, no, folks, have I given her a seat for you and her?

[02:59:14.450 --> 02:59:17.910]
Give a Shats a pop and soon you'll hear a pop.

[02:59:18.490 --> 02:59:24.370]
Shats is dangerous, brother, beg, oh, yes.

[02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:27.250]
Don't just take any beer.

[02:59:27.730 --> 02:59:30.990]
Take a Shats and for you T-cobblers,

[02:59:30.990 --> 02:59:33.510]
try our new high fiber non-alcoholic beer.

[02:59:33.870 --> 02:59:35.410]
We call it O-stool.

[02:59:36.190 --> 02:59:38.510]
O-stool, sample one today.

[02:59:38.810 --> 02:59:40.750]
And don't forget Shats like Shats Dark.

[02:59:41.210 --> 02:59:44.890]
And for those with diverticulitis, proctitis and polyphosis,

[02:59:45.330 --> 02:59:48.750]
doctors direct them to try new Shats red.

[02:59:49.670 --> 02:59:52.750]
Shats beer, a division of friddle malindustrie, splashing new.

[02:59:53.270 --> 02:59:55.410]
Yeah, but what about those who love the IBS?

[02:59:55.410 --> 02:59:55.930]
I can hear you.

[02:59:59.410 --> 03:00:01.610]
140, 143 at 560 WQAM.

[03:00:01.870 --> 03:00:04.310]
How come they're so good and somebody else is making all the money?

[03:00:04.430 --> 03:00:05.250]
I just, I don't get it.

[03:00:06.890 --> 03:00:07.570]
Good anyway.

[03:00:09.650 --> 03:00:11.190]
How come Rick Brown is making all that money?

[03:00:12.190 --> 03:00:13.050]
Here's Kendall. Hello.

[03:00:13.570 --> 03:00:13.970]
Hey, Neil.

[03:00:14.330 --> 03:00:14.670]
Yes, sir.

[03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:16.350]
Thank you so much for doing this today.

[03:00:16.510 --> 03:00:17.450]
Of course, and you're welcome.

[03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:18.330]
What a relief.

[03:00:18.330 --> 03:00:19.410]
I thought I was going to go nuts.

[03:00:21.130 --> 03:00:22.550]
And let's go smoke some pot.

[03:00:23.690 --> 03:00:25.010]
Well, yeah, we haven't played that today.

[03:00:25.110 --> 03:00:25.990]
Perfect for Friday, man.

[03:00:26.010 --> 03:00:26.990]
Yeah, that's excellent for today.

[03:00:27.050 --> 03:00:27.410]
Hey, guys.

[03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:28.370]
Okay, you got it.

[03:00:28.370 --> 03:00:28.550]
Ha!

[03:00:29.930 --> 03:00:29.930]

[03:00:32.470 --> 03:00:32.750]
Ha!

[03:00:33.610 --> 03:00:33.770]
Ha!

[03:00:36.270 --> 03:00:36.810]
That's not the point!

[03:00:37.250 --> 03:00:37.510]
Hey!

[03:00:38.290 --> 03:00:41.150]
You can really get really good at doing smokey pie.

[03:00:41.330 --> 03:00:42.190]
Plot pie, plot pie.

[03:00:42.590 --> 03:00:43.790]
Well, you can see how you got a song.

[03:00:43.970 --> 03:00:44.810]
We smoke it in a bomb.

[03:00:44.990 --> 03:00:46.410]
Plot pie, plot pie.

[03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:48.110]
Well, you can see that.

[03:00:48.110 --> 03:00:49.290]
You can see that.

[03:00:49.290 --> 03:00:50.410]
Plot pie, plot pie.

[03:00:50.410 --> 03:00:51.710]
That's good for today.

[03:00:51.710 --> 03:00:52.710]
Let's go smoke some pot.

[03:00:53.550 --> 03:00:54.890]
That's good for today.

[03:00:55.690 --> 03:00:56.990]
That's good for today.

[03:00:57.030 --> 03:00:57.490]
All right.

[03:00:57.830 --> 03:00:59.150]
That's good for today.

[03:00:59.350 --> 03:00:59.630]
Okay.

[03:01:00.130 --> 03:01:00.310]
Ha!

[03:01:02.050 --> 03:01:03.370]
That's good for today.

[03:01:03.990 --> 03:01:05.110]
Well, it was easy for Kale.

[03:01:05.310 --> 03:01:06.670]
There's a new Bollym, but it's smokey pie.

[03:01:07.010 --> 03:01:07.790]
Plot pie, plot pie.

[03:01:08.030 --> 03:01:09.250]
Well, there's a black crow.

[03:01:09.530 --> 03:01:11.030]
Can't drive any crimes, but we'll be fine.

[03:01:11.330 --> 03:01:12.050]
Plot pie, plot pie.

[03:01:12.610 --> 03:01:14.630]
This is what you can get with the job.

[03:01:14.970 --> 03:01:16.230]
Plot pie, plot pie, plot pie.

[03:01:16.330 --> 03:01:17.230]
That's good for today.

[03:01:17.230 --> 03:01:18.330]
Let's go smoke some pot.

[03:01:18.330 --> 03:01:20.310]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:01:20.810 --> 03:01:20.990]
Oh!

[03:01:21.330 --> 03:01:22.550]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:01:23.250 --> 03:01:24.810]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:01:25.070 --> 03:01:25.330]
Oh!

[03:01:25.870 --> 03:01:26.150]
Ah!

[03:01:27.770 --> 03:01:29.070]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:01:29.710 --> 03:01:29.890]
Ah!

[03:01:30.650 --> 03:01:34.610]
I want to give you a kiss.

[03:01:43.430 --> 03:01:45.150]
Hey, my soul!

[03:01:59.970 --> 03:02:00.330]
Oh!

[03:02:03.210 --> 03:02:06.510]
Well, there's supposed to be some words here, but I forgot them because I've smoked too much pot.

[03:02:06.750 --> 03:02:07.130]
Yeah, no.

[03:02:07.370 --> 03:02:10.370]
I went to Lama for looting everybody out there with smoke and pot.

[03:02:11.270 --> 03:02:11.730]
Pot's off.

[03:02:12.210 --> 03:02:16.030]
Flying belly, and the red bloodshed of the feather, and the girl can't even watch with panic.

[03:02:16.030 --> 03:02:17.090]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:02:17.730 --> 03:02:18.130]
Oh!

[03:02:18.490 --> 03:02:19.590]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:02:20.410 --> 03:02:21.790]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:02:22.090 --> 03:02:22.450]
Are you?

[03:02:22.750 --> 03:02:23.770]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:02:24.890 --> 03:02:25.190]
Oh!

[03:02:27.070 --> 03:02:28.110]
Let's get a butterfly.

[03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.290]
Oh!

[03:02:29.810 --> 03:02:29.810]

[03:02:29.810 --> 03:02:29.810]

[03:02:30.090 --> 03:02:30.090]

[03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:30.550]
Oh!

[03:02:38.550 --> 03:02:40.310]
Okay, 146 and 560.

[03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.630]

[03:02:50.650 --> 03:02:51.270]
Here's Jupiter.

[03:02:51.350 --> 03:02:51.570]
Hello.

[03:02:52.770 --> 03:02:54.130]
Hello, Dr. Neal.

[03:02:54.290 --> 03:02:55.030]
Yes, picking.

[03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:57.870]
Dr. Neal, I think this show cured my gird.

[03:02:58.190 --> 03:02:58.390]
Good.

[03:02:59.130 --> 03:02:59.610]
Hey, listen.

[03:02:59.750 --> 03:03:00.730]
Can I make a request for a fellow?

[03:03:00.730 --> 03:03:01.370]
You'll clean your right out.

[03:03:01.650 --> 03:03:02.210]
For what?

[03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:03.530]
From a fellow Jew.

[03:03:03.750 --> 03:03:04.010]
Yes?

[03:03:04.290 --> 03:03:07.290]
Or as James Baker would call us, Mutsa Gajudin.

[03:03:07.410 --> 03:03:07.530]
Right.

[03:03:07.630 --> 03:03:08.430]
What can we do for Jew?

[03:03:09.070 --> 03:03:09.790]
Yeah, I have a dilemma.

[03:03:09.790 --> 03:03:10.790]
I've got two of them.

[03:03:10.930 --> 03:03:11.190]
Okay.

[03:03:11.190 --> 03:03:14.350]
I have to hear a big black guy named Ben.

[03:03:14.470 --> 03:03:15.450]
Yeah, and what's the other one?

[03:03:15.610 --> 03:03:17.930]
And Father Turek would be really nice if possible.

[03:03:18.350 --> 03:03:19.210]
Father Turek.

[03:03:19.270 --> 03:03:19.450]
You are God.

[03:03:20.070 --> 03:03:21.350]
You are God himself.

[03:03:21.570 --> 03:03:21.810]
Okay.

[03:03:22.770 --> 03:03:23.430]
See ya.

[03:03:24.430 --> 03:03:25.230]
What do you think?

[03:03:25.370 --> 03:03:27.330]
You were in the big black guy that we just played yesterday, or...

[03:03:27.330 --> 03:03:28.690]
This fall on CBS.

[03:03:29.270 --> 03:03:32.410]
Meet a small town free to speak the word of God.

[03:03:32.770 --> 03:03:35.190]
And add a few choice words of his own.

[03:03:35.650 --> 03:03:37.190]
It's Father Turek's mysteries.

[03:03:37.610 --> 03:03:38.490]
I really believe it.

[03:03:38.770 --> 03:03:40.010]
We are gobbards here today.

[03:03:40.010 --> 03:03:41.330]
To join together.

[03:03:41.490 --> 03:03:43.850]
This is a fucking minute.

[03:03:44.210 --> 03:03:45.030]
Fucking motherfucker.

[03:03:45.670 --> 03:03:47.270]
In Holy Mastro, Mom.

[03:03:47.510 --> 03:03:48.650]
Father Turek's mystery.

[03:03:49.070 --> 03:03:56.050]
A new kind of family drama from the producers of Chicago Hopeless and NYPD Blue Ball.

[03:03:56.410 --> 03:03:58.390]
Oh, you fucking slut.

[03:03:58.610 --> 03:04:00.230]
You little whorebag monger.

[03:04:00.350 --> 03:04:01.630]
You fucking bastard here.

[03:04:01.690 --> 03:04:03.050]
Sunday, this fall.

[03:04:03.490 --> 03:04:05.210]
Ben an hour with Father Turek.

[03:04:05.370 --> 03:04:07.350]
Right after an all-new season of.

[03:04:07.810 --> 03:04:11.230]
Touchdown there by an angel only on PBS.

[03:04:12.410 --> 03:04:14.350]
That after touchdown there by a priest.

[03:04:14.550 --> 03:04:16.370]
It's 12 minutes before 2 at 5.60.

[03:04:16.510 --> 03:04:17.210]
Q.M.R. Poll.

[03:04:17.430 --> 03:04:18.410]
Where you, where you be going?

[03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:19.290]
Now you're thinking about it.

[03:04:19.570 --> 03:04:21.550]
Where you would go at any Marlins games this coming season.

[03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:23.750]
Never to worry to start planning to stay home.

[03:04:25.090 --> 03:04:26.170]
358 votes already.

[03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:30.770]
228 that 64% almost say never no chance.

[03:04:31.170 --> 03:04:32.170]
I still have Easter baby.

[03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:34.470]
And I just go in the way you screwed over Joangel 2.

[03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:35.350]
No chance.

[03:04:36.010 --> 03:04:39.530]
Maybe one or two games 84 85 people 23 and a half percent.

[03:04:39.530 --> 03:04:41.690]
A few games 28 7.8 percent.

[03:04:41.830 --> 03:04:45.630]
Many like a whole bunch 17 people just under 5 percent.

[03:04:46.750 --> 03:04:47.910]
What do you think of that mister?

[03:04:48.130 --> 03:04:49.530]
I must be crazy. I must be nuts.

[03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:51.150]
Hop on the bus.

[03:04:51.310 --> 03:04:52.570]
The one that's headed straight out of town.

[03:04:52.570 --> 03:04:54.090]
I'm over the arrow pointing in any other direction.

[03:04:54.090 --> 03:04:55.690]
But this one and they'll come back soon.

[03:04:56.050 --> 03:04:57.510]
And about that stadium the answer is still.

[03:04:57.610 --> 03:04:57.750]
No.

[03:04:58.490 --> 03:05:01.470]
This is 5.60 Q.A.F.

[03:05:01.950 --> 03:05:03.350]
The Neil Roger show.

[03:05:03.350 --> 03:05:07.290]
Sports radio 5.60 Q.A.F.

[03:05:07.450 --> 03:05:09.570]
And just felt like a prick.

[03:05:10.350 --> 03:05:25.830]

[03:05:33.350 --> 03:05:34.190]
Hi kids.

[03:05:34.290 --> 03:05:36.030]
Do y'all like cut little stinkers?

[03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:38.670]
That funny little sound that comes right out your stinker?

[03:05:39.210 --> 03:05:41.930]
Want to copy me and do exactly like I do?

[03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:44.650]
Get paid to write a little song about boo-boo.

[03:05:45.170 --> 03:05:46.290]
My brains are gone.

[03:05:46.570 --> 03:05:47.870]
I'm trying to get my groove on.

[03:05:48.090 --> 03:05:50.530]
But I can't figure out which spice girl I'm gonna fart on.

[03:05:50.910 --> 03:05:52.110]
Hey Dr. Dre asked.

[03:05:52.190 --> 03:05:53.370]
Yo, man, you passed good.

[03:05:53.710 --> 03:05:54.390]
Hey, I'm not.

[03:05:54.610 --> 03:05:55.650]
What do I spell as?

[03:05:55.890 --> 03:05:56.770]
Man you look wet.

[03:05:56.830 --> 03:05:59.690]
Well since age 12 it seemed like I always smell that thought

[03:05:59.690 --> 03:06:01.830]
dripping gas in the dootin was pretty swell.

[03:06:01.830 --> 03:06:04.810]
I got this off when I put my jeans off.

[03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:08.130]
And parted so hard it turned my underwear backwards like Chris Croft.

[03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:12.070]
And every night I'm like oh dinner has been spun out my ass fast

[03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:13.770]
through the fat MQAQ fast.

[03:06:14.110 --> 03:06:14.950]
Smell this honey.

[03:06:15.090 --> 03:06:15.890]
Yo, just wait a minute.

[03:06:15.950 --> 03:06:16.690]
That's a girl cut.

[03:06:16.950 --> 03:06:17.730]
I don't give a fuck.

[03:06:17.850 --> 03:06:19.610]
God sent me to think the world up.

[03:06:20.590 --> 03:06:21.010]
My ain't it.

[03:06:21.490 --> 03:06:23.230]
My ain't it.

[03:06:23.230 --> 03:06:24.070]
My ain't it.

[03:06:24.130 --> 03:06:26.810]
My ain't it.

[03:06:27.290 --> 03:06:28.190]
My ain't it.

[03:06:29.050 --> 03:06:29.430]
My ain't it.

[03:06:29.430 --> 03:06:29.810]
My ain't it.

[03:06:29.870 --> 03:06:29.870]

[03:06:30.050 --> 03:06:31.750]
My ain't it.

[03:06:31.750 --> 03:06:34.030]
I just want to see you want to me kick out back in junior high.

[03:06:34.170 --> 03:06:36.870]
Said the problem was something cold up my ass and die.

[03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:38.830]
I shot him in the face with my vapor.

[03:06:39.170 --> 03:06:42.630]
The worst happened later when I covered his desk with used toilet vapor.

[03:06:42.970 --> 03:06:44.030]
Walk in the strip club.

[03:06:44.170 --> 03:06:45.410]
My intestines were filled up.

[03:06:45.770 --> 03:06:48.190]
Moons of Bob Tennis took a dump at a tip club.

[03:06:48.690 --> 03:06:51.150]
With over two attempts to head a fuck in her garter.

[03:06:51.470 --> 03:06:54.170]
She lifted her leg up and I knew she was a father.

[03:06:54.910 --> 03:06:57.170]
99% of my life I was lied to.

[03:06:57.410 --> 03:07:00.050]
I just found out my mom got more cats than I do.

[03:07:00.050 --> 03:07:02.850]
My shoulder I throw up to be a famous rapper.

[03:07:03.130 --> 03:07:04.650]
Like a wrecked about strange notice.

[03:07:04.970 --> 03:07:05.750]
Made on the crap.

[03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:08.790]
You know you was dirt when the women rushed to leave.

[03:07:09.010 --> 03:07:11.530]
Drop the hold it back, but she wasn't even released.

[03:07:12.150 --> 03:07:14.650]
This guy or white cat, I'm sad it was pretty cool.

[03:07:15.050 --> 03:07:15.630]
But I had to go.

[03:07:15.890 --> 03:07:17.650]
Go drop the kids off and smooth.

[03:07:18.650 --> 03:07:19.210]
My ain't it.

[03:07:19.710 --> 03:07:20.670]
My ain't it.

[03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:22.150]
My ain't it.

[03:07:22.470 --> 03:07:25.090]
My ain't it.

[03:07:25.310 --> 03:07:25.770]
My ain't it.

[03:07:25.770 --> 03:07:26.550]
My ain't it.

[03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.790]
My ain't it.

[03:07:27.790 --> 03:07:28.050]
My ain't it.

[03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:29.990]
My ain't it.

[03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:31.050]
My ain't it.

[03:07:31.170 --> 03:07:33.150]
My ain't it.

[03:07:33.170 --> 03:07:34.110]
My ain't it.

[03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.910]
My ain't it.

[03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:34.910]

[03:07:34.990 --> 03:07:46.870]
I'm falling so much.

[03:07:47.450 --> 03:07:56.310]
I am no oripper anymore.

[03:07:56.310 --> 03:07:58.630]
I'm falling so much.

[03:07:58.630 --> 03:08:00.410]
I'm going to be done like this.

[03:08:00.970 --> 03:08:02.610]
I'm going to be done like this.

[03:08:02.850 --> 03:08:04.890]
If not, I'm going to be here.

[03:08:05.550 --> 03:08:06.310]
153 is 50.

[03:08:06.650 --> 03:08:08.850]
What is it? 560 WQM 56.

[03:08:09.410 --> 03:08:10.030]
QM 56.

[03:08:11.750 --> 03:08:13.050]
Here's a mobile on the alley.

[03:08:13.170 --> 03:08:13.310]
Hello.

[03:08:14.810 --> 03:08:16.770]
Mobile on the alley with a radio cranked way up.

[03:08:16.790 --> 03:08:18.130]
But I don't blame because they've been on a long time.

[03:08:18.210 --> 03:08:18.410]
Hello.

[03:08:21.170 --> 03:08:22.430]
Mobile on the alley.

[03:08:23.370 --> 03:08:24.170]
Yes sir.

[03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:25.510]
Yes sir. Happy Holidays.

[03:08:25.830 --> 03:08:26.430]
And the same to you.

[03:08:26.430 --> 03:08:28.930]
I was wondering if you could play a great tribute song.

[03:08:28.970 --> 03:08:30.090]
I haven't heard it for a long time.

[03:08:30.910 --> 03:08:31.510]
Needle God.

[03:08:32.250 --> 03:08:32.650]
Okay.

[03:08:33.710 --> 03:08:34.850]
You know what I'm talking about.

[03:08:35.090 --> 03:08:35.550]
I sure do.

[03:08:36.110 --> 03:08:37.130]
That's a really great one.

[03:08:37.610 --> 03:08:38.770]
You have yourself a good holiday.

[03:08:39.050 --> 03:08:39.570]
And back to you.

[03:08:40.670 --> 03:08:41.410]
What do you want to hear?

[03:08:41.430 --> 03:08:42.090]
I want to hear.

[03:08:42.310 --> 03:08:43.450]
Oh, Neil.

[03:08:46.030 --> 03:08:46.830]
Oh, Neil.

[03:08:48.330 --> 03:08:50.330]
That's power that Neil President say, man.

[03:08:50.410 --> 03:08:52.850]
I'm the most powerful God day man in the world.

[03:08:52.930 --> 03:08:54.450]
Yes, I am.

[03:08:54.450 --> 03:08:55.870]
Oh, Neil.

[03:08:57.630 --> 03:08:59.630]
That's power that Neil President say, man.

[03:08:59.710 --> 03:09:02.150]
I'm the most powerful God day man in the world.

[03:09:02.350 --> 03:09:03.430]
That's so really correct.

[03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:05.730]
Look, there's a maid out of people.

[03:09:06.170 --> 03:09:07.330]
Wow, that's great.

[03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.810]
Thanks for coming.

[03:09:09.370 --> 03:09:12.210]
Just that takes this smell out of your sister.

[03:09:12.670 --> 03:09:15.850]
86% of newborns, boys in this country are circumcised.

[03:09:15.850 --> 03:09:18.750]
The procedure is widely performed without any sort of anesthesia.

[03:09:19.610 --> 03:09:20.790]
I have no preview.

[03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.810]
I'm telling you.

[03:09:22.550 --> 03:09:25.250]
Oh, Neil God.

[03:09:25.750 --> 03:09:26.890]
Oh, Neil.

[03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:29.210]
I need you.

[03:09:29.610 --> 03:09:30.410]
I need you.

[03:09:31.410 --> 03:09:33.750]
Oh, Neil God.

[03:09:35.050 --> 03:09:36.290]
Oh, Neil God.

[03:09:36.290 --> 03:09:36.290]

[03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:38.030]
I need you.

[03:09:38.830 --> 03:09:41.930]
I will not take a nice block.

[03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:44.530]
I'll do any other company that perpetuates this kind of behavior.

[03:09:44.530 --> 03:09:45.990]
You jacked at me.

[03:09:46.110 --> 03:09:47.090]
You got me.

[03:09:47.290 --> 03:09:48.150]
You got me.

[03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:51.450]
Here again, it's an all-john product.

[03:09:51.730 --> 03:09:54.350]
I don't have a bones, but I'll take a high.

[03:09:54.530 --> 03:09:56.030]
Hey, they know much about you.

[03:09:56.350 --> 03:10:00.470]
I know that before you can afford your wife's father or two.

[03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:02.470]
God, they don't cry.

[03:10:02.970 --> 03:10:05.010]
Oh, they're very complicated.

[03:10:06.170 --> 03:10:08.030]
This guy is a wicked.

[03:10:08.770 --> 03:10:09.610]
I've got hand jobs.

[03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:13.850]
I'm not going to do my job as well.

[03:10:13.850 --> 03:10:16.610]
When I'm telling you to say this on that, it's great radio.

[03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:17.750]
I am that hemorrhage.

[03:10:17.890 --> 03:10:19.510]
We have a laundered cord on this piece of grass.

[03:10:19.510 --> 03:10:21.510]
Look at this. Look how short this damn thing is.

[03:10:22.210 --> 03:10:24.950]
I'm going to pick this cord and I'm going to shove it away up his end.

[03:10:25.390 --> 03:10:25.870]
Oh, Neil.

[03:10:26.850 --> 03:10:29.230]
This place operates like a freaking nut house.

[03:10:29.430 --> 03:10:29.890]
It really does.

[03:10:30.230 --> 03:10:31.970]
I want to be left a freak alone, okay?

[03:10:32.210 --> 03:10:33.390]
You're not mad and mine's a six.

[03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:34.270]
You're out of board.

[03:10:34.450 --> 03:10:34.970]
That's a big wave.

[03:10:35.210 --> 03:10:36.030]
Look, we're secular.

[03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:37.330]
Oh, boy.

[03:10:37.810 --> 03:10:38.570]
Damn, come.

[03:10:40.350 --> 03:10:42.470]
Oh, she lifts their feet off.

[03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:44.390]
There's no one that's got the kid out there.

[03:10:44.550 --> 03:10:45.730]
God, she's dead.

[03:10:46.270 --> 03:10:46.930]
Oh, boy.

[03:10:47.150 --> 03:10:47.910]
Damn, come.

[03:10:49.170 --> 03:10:51.250]
Those powers that they'll present, they man.

[03:10:51.350 --> 03:10:53.750]
I'm the most powerful god damn man in the world.

[03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:55.070]
I'm so really correct.

[03:10:57.250 --> 03:11:02.230]
This one, and then all you people know, how a stoner's being.

[03:11:04.570 --> 03:11:07.570]
You know, we're real high.

[03:11:07.970 --> 03:11:10.130]
Oh, you also know we were talking about the people we like in the building.

[03:11:10.130 --> 03:11:11.410]
We forgot to beast the other day.

[03:11:11.650 --> 03:11:13.450]
How could we? Oh, my God.

[03:11:13.550 --> 03:11:14.910]
You ask the brownies.

[03:11:16.130 --> 03:11:17.010]
Look at that pot.

[03:11:17.250 --> 03:11:17.810]
So glorious.

[03:11:18.250 --> 03:11:19.690]
And they angel night on the scurry.

[03:11:19.910 --> 03:11:21.650]
So I ask my mouth for some cannabis.

[03:11:22.350 --> 03:11:23.890]
And hope people will smile on the bus.

[03:11:24.430 --> 03:11:26.450]
Come, my friends, they love the pot every day.

[03:11:26.570 --> 03:11:28.350]
You've been out to just can't stop one day.

[03:11:28.350 --> 03:11:29.810]
We've been so up for the top.

[03:11:29.810 --> 03:11:31.610]
Go get a big fat hooker.

[03:11:31.670 --> 03:11:32.890]
Say I flat my seats.

[03:11:33.150 --> 03:11:35.030]
See, see, for my weed.

[03:11:35.350 --> 03:11:36.550]
We've been shit workers.

[03:11:37.070 --> 03:11:37.710]
Bring, bring.

[03:11:38.210 --> 03:11:39.090]
Get a roll again.

[03:11:39.570 --> 03:11:40.750]
Say I flat my seats.

[03:11:41.050 --> 03:11:42.710]
See, see, for my weed.

[03:11:43.070 --> 03:11:45.130]
We've been so up for my bones.

[03:11:46.030 --> 03:11:48.970]
Let me smoke a tap song.

[03:11:52.690 --> 03:11:55.050]
Baby, that bomb of bomb, bomb, bomb.

[03:11:55.610 --> 03:11:56.950]
I love when I smoke the bones.

[03:11:57.430 --> 03:11:58.790]
Just like chicken toe.

[03:11:59.130 --> 03:12:01.010]
Yeah, yeah.

[03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:02.710]
That bomb, bomb, bomb.

[03:12:03.650 --> 03:12:04.290]
Look at that pot.

[03:12:04.450 --> 03:12:05.030]
So glorious.

[03:12:05.450 --> 03:12:06.170]
That's the age of nine.

[03:12:06.310 --> 03:12:07.050]
I was curious.

[03:12:07.430 --> 03:12:09.030]
So I ask my mouth for some cannabis.

[03:12:09.410 --> 03:12:11.230]
You just smoke people who are not on the bus.

[03:12:11.590 --> 03:12:13.670]
Come, my friends, they love the pot every day.

[03:12:13.790 --> 03:12:15.610]
You've been out to just can't stop one day.

[03:12:15.730 --> 03:12:17.110]
We've been so up for the top.

[03:12:17.390 --> 03:12:17.930]
Go get a big fat hooker.

[03:12:17.930 --> 03:12:17.930]

[03:12:17.910 --> 03:12:17.910]
