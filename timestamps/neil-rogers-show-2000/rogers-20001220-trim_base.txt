[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.480]
Now I stand in fifty-fourth of a month where I'll be landed

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.200]
A wife and family I'll be stranded

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.920]
Coming jump with me

[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.420]
Okay!

[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.980]
The economy

[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.920]
This is killin' me

[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.180]
I'm sorry!

[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.600]
Coming jump

[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.980]
Okay, ten or so at five sixty WSUM

[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.020]
It's only money, it's only money

[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.560]
Only people so worried about it

[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.460]
Just become and cooler collected like me

[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.240]
Where's that goddamn mitchhersh?

[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.580]
Now actually the one I'm pissed off is that frickin' Alan Greenspan

[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.660]
That's the son of a bitch

[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.940]
And all you people out there, 90% of you, oh no you're wrong Neil

[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.900]
You don't know anything about it, but he's a genius

[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.480]
Well you know something you're right on the first part

[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.700]
I don't know nothing about economics

[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.940]
I don't know nothing about investing

[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.920]
I don't know nothing about stocks

[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.000]
And I still think that yesterday I would have cut the goddamn interest rates

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.640]
Because this son of a bitch is the one that's cost us a lot of money

[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.500]
And during these holidays we're not supposed to have these feelings of hostility are we?

[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.760]
No!

[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.280]
No, only toward Peter Leonard, but not toward anybody else

[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.220]
The NASDAQ's only done 109 and the Dow's only done 180 this morning

[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.440]
And then it's markets been open already 32 and a half minutes, so what are you bitching about?

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.020]
I mean the NASDAQ's all the way up there to lofty 2,402 points

[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.820]
So what are you...

[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.460]
Complaining about

[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.600]
That's gonna be our pull quite today, we'll do a little thing

[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.120]
And not only that, but it is the holidays

[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.220]
Thanks to everybody who came out of the pizza lot last night

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.000]
We had a tremendous turnout

[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.660]
A mammoth turnout

[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.960]
And I want to thank my good close personal friend Tanner

[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.220]
Although, you know, he did a great job for us waiting on our whole table last night

[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.900]
But when I got there he said, what would you like me?

[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.260]
I said, some hot sausage

[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.280]
And he just never really understood it, you know?

[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.940]
But he did the best he could under hard circumstances

[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.000]
But anyway, thanks Tanner, I'll get you next time

[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.040]
So we raised two grand there last night for a planned parenthood

[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.660]
And our total now is 76,630

[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.840]
And we had some other checks the other day from Eddie Kay and some other people

[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.660]
So I've got to be getting close to like 80,000 bucks

[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.620]
Which isn't fantastic, but yeah listen, what can you do?

[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.240]
You do the best you can, and with all the people out there steaming our CDs

[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.700]
And making copies, you know, burning copies and stealing the stuff off master

[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.740]
We'll do the best we can

[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.880]
Next year we'll know better

[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.140]
Which I'm maybe not sure I know what I mean by saying that we'll know better

[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.680]
But we'll know either a better way to raise more money or we'll know better than to try it again

[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.940]
One of the other, one of the above

[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.900]
Now it's great, we had a lot of interesting people there last night

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.180]
We had some of those people as usual, a real cross-section

[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.200]
Speaking of a cross-section, a good close-personal friend Harvey Slaven

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.000]
Then we Harvey from Kendall, Harvey from Miami Beach, Harvey from Boka, Harvey from Hollywood now

[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.820]
Harvey Slaven, a chronic if there ever was one

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.160]
At least he doesn't call anymore with that whiny voice, you know?

[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.080]
Kind of like Julie Rumin on a bad day after a bad case of gastric distress

[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.840]
of gourd

[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.640]
But anyway, he writes a letter to the editor in my defense

[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.480]
Thank you Harvey, even though I don't need you defense

[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.560]
But that was certainly very wide to him, wasn't it?

[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.000]
He faxes me a copy to the aherald

[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.440]
He says editor, even though the Miami Herald and radio personality neo-ranges

[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.860]
Continuant with each other's throats, there was no need for Kevin Baxter, Slam of Rogers in this column of 1219

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.560]
Comparative Baxter's opinion, neo-ranges allowed those who opposed his views about alien Gonzalez' kidnapping

[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.460]
And the presidential race to be heard

[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.900]
Usually though, those on the opposite side of Rogers reduced the level of verbal exchange

[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.360]
From to calling him a communist or reduced it even further by calling him various names that portrayed needles openly gay lifestyle

[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.020]
That's right Harvey, so I'm pretty damn nasty stuff like

[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.820]
Like your gay

[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.160]
Yeah

[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.200]
As far as Steve Kane and John Broward drawing large audiences is back to road is concerned

[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.280]
Neither of them ever received an arbitrage on rating higher than a blip

[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.020]
Yeah, oh sorry Kevin

[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.080]
Unlike the Rush Limbaugh did ahead, another shows his list is simply,

[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.200]
Parrot the mindset of the talk show host, the neo-ranges colors are probably the most varied

[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.740]
And have the most varied opinions of all radio talk host audiences in America says Harvey Slaven

[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.700]
Even though a lot of them are both those, only said that

[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.140]
Why use a drone like Kevin Baxter to fight your ongoing battle with neo-ranges

[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.700]
Why it's Harvey Slaven and Hollywood to the aherald? How do you like that?

[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.180]
Thank you Harvey and the Quippien Soul Chronic

[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.120]
At least there's somebody out there who came to my defense and like I said we don't need it

[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.580]
Because the ratings came out yesterday and we're right back up there again

[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.700]
Hi it's going boys

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.280]
Don't want those morning guys and I must say this in defense of B-Full and Geltie and Joe especially B-Full

[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.420]
Well he really grew up here because I was sitting in there like I'm staring him down

[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.620]
While they had that suckle mayor on this morning for about 15 minutes

[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.700]
Sitting in there staring him down and what you could see is muscle growing

[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.360]
While I was sitting in there staring even Joe was making them all kinds of faces

[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.540]
Give him a big push

[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.960]
Yeah nice going there B-Full asking some tough questions

[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.020]
And of course it was the same you know same old tired crap the same

[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.900]
Oh well we can't use that money for anything else and that we only wish we had the money

[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.020]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.720]
You're nothing but a phony and a crook Alex

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.900]
You're not fooling anybody with a brain

[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.680]
He never met a billionaire that he couldn't make a behind the scenes back door

[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.080]
This honest deal with

[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.240]
Oh gee what are we going to do we have we can't afford to lose baseball

[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.960]
The whole thing boils down to the same deal and that is how many years have they been trying to do this

[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.720]
The herald and all those other special and Mickey that area down there that's so called downtown corridor

[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.360]
That's a slum that's a toilet with or without the American Airlines arena

[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.620]
And that's all they care about is you know getting their property values goose up

[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.240]
And try to like you know feather their bed a little bit more at the expected everybody else

[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.540]
That's what metro rail is all about

[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.500]
Oh everybody's going to go downtown aren't they?

[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.220]
Oh yeah you'll see we're going to build that thing and they'll all come

[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.720]
Did they come? No. Maybe they came but they sure didn't come downtown

[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.820]
Because I think that's illegal anyway

[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.460]
What a crocker crap

[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.340]
Here's a call from Kendall hello

[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.540]
How you doing? Yes sir

[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.160]
Are you out? That's all there is nothing to do with this person

[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.060]
About what?

[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.420]
I had an idea here. He don't even know what they'll show he's listening to

[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.360]
He called early with a full

[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.720]
Oh call early with that

[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.600]
He don't even know what show he's on this idea

[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.240]
I thought we actually had a caller on there already

[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.220]
I'm not planning on many calls we're in the holidays now

[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.560]
We're going to have about his main calls as we have spots

[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.440]
You don't understand that

[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.400]
It's Christmas time what are you talking about? It's Christmas we're not going to have any callers

[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.060]
But our numbers came right back up there we had another real good month

[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.140]
I want to start it as they was for the benefit of Hank in the morning guys

[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.000]
Which I'm sure Bluff has already massaged their ego or whatever he massaged them with

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.720]
But you know October

[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.000]
Arbitron just couldn't find any of our audience in October they really shat it

[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.080]
They stuck it to us. I hope you a crock up there in Beltsville okay

[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.880]
With your guide damn phony sampling

[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.420]
And all these Julio stations that went through the roof I mean radio or more even Howard for quite a lot

[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.340]
Number what where the hell is that?

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.040]
Oh yeah wacky

[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.280]
Wacky even though it's all old ancient demographics

[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.540]
Radio Mambe beats the crap out of Howard and men in this latest trend

[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.240]
Anybody believe that?

[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.160]
No of course not

[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.100]
Radio Mambe my ass with a 7.9

[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.880]
You'll see how long that's going to last that's all at you know right wing political hysteria

[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.960]
The emotional crap

[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.360]
So maybe maybe next time like in December when you do the final month of this fall book up there in Beltsville

[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.400]
Maybe you could find some people who speak English

[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.500]
You jackasses you morons who still can't sample us marking you never been able to

[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.340]
And of course I should be the last one to complain because knock on hardwood

[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.000]
I've done pretty damn good in these numbers for many many years but nevertheless

[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.920]
It's still a real battle because every now and then it come up again with a month

[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.820]
And they can't find anybody who's speaking in glaze

[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.580]
Even as far to stations went down this time big time

[00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.980]
I think they were like interviewing all the people that came in on banana boats

[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.320]
All the rubber rafts they were interviewing

[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.140]
Nice going

[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.560]
Arbatron

[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.220]
That's our message to you and happy holidays

[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.700]
Well we're gonna have to ask back down over 105 to now 162

[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.920]
But putty roll is up five points let's hurry 50 roll

[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.500]
Now see that's a good idea

[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.080]
Investing in stocks right now I mean investing in food stocks

[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.700]
Because people still have to eat don't they let them eat the tootsie rolls

[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.280]
That's what the annamaria Antoinette said

[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.840]
And we're annamaria

[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.040]
I bet your Randy does

[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.000]
Well how Randy do it?

[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.500]
You doing a good?

[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.300]
Yeah let's get all I can't wait to talk about those numbers

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.940]
Nice going people

[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.880]
Are you idiot you moron?

[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.640]
Oh man

[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.040]
See I would take greater pleasure in it except for the fact that every time I mention his name

[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.060]
It makes me think of all the people whose lives he destroyed

[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.420]
All the careers that he's ruined even even not so great careers

[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.740]
He just nipped him right in the butt if there was any potential in him he destroyed him

[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:02.100]
The life destroying Peter Bolger you suck or you quizzling you jackass you you miserable evil person

[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.300]
Evil that's what you are

[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.000]
You're the personification of evil

[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.980]
I guarantee he's got 6666 on his fat ass

[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.460]
On his butt sucking ass because that's what he is a corporate butt sucker

[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.120]
That'd be a good poll question someday would you rather be a fucker or a butt sucker corporate butt sucker

[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.420]
Because it sure got him up the ladder

[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.540]
What's our poll question that I'm glad you asked

[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.500]
Let's do a little of economic thing even though it's depressing

[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.880]
Do you think we're going to have a recession?

[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.940]
Yes it's coming in the recession too

[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.460]
No the economy will be fine or we're already in it

[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.420]
What a great poll question

[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.400]
Even if you know nothing about it you probably know more than that Alan Greenspan

[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.820]
That piece of turd with the big nose oh man

[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.600]
I like it I was telling you it before I like it until like if somebody got forbidden your house was bleeding to that

[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.220]
Flying on the floor and you called up 911

[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.640]
Told him you had the emergency you described it to him needed help immediately

[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.960]
And then the phone rang in about two minutes they said well you know we're evaluating it here

[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:07.720]
And we're keeping the door open to sending the ambulance but we think we'll wait for a few weeks and then we'll let we'll probably be sending one

[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.520]
That's what they did yesterday

[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.840]
But it's only money it's one minutes after ten at five sixty WQM

[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.100]
No question the server may be recidious without the express

[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.100]
No you can't

[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.460]
WQAM BC Broadcast Group Incorporated

[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.560]
He's got a big heart on it

[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:31.960]
It's why he's so often an artist comes along that captures in song the true spirit of Christmas

[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.360]
Now that hallowed tradition lives on

[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:43.500]
Come here he comes the hottest working man in snow business my godfather of nowhere miss the James Brown

[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.080]
And that's this holding that down on his turn

[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.920]
Yes on his back

[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.240]
Yes be the man's name and it's him it's just me that young

[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.800]
Give the wife

[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.080]
This is no change brown

[00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.820]
Christmas

[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.320]
But you record set that puts the soul give your wife Christmas

[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.100]
This man's name

[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.820]
And he's better wife now

[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.260]
Yes better not change man

[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.620]
Yes better not change man

[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.320]
Yes better not change man

[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.400]
Get a new wife

[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.240]
Yes Sanders got a brand new back

[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:36.100]
Why be good for Christmas when you can be bad start watching your soccer with a James Brown Christmas

[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:41.060]
Wow pass the hearing in your thing

[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.180]
Got it too

[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.860]
That's the wrong king

[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.840]
This is a little man

[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.280]
Oh, I think echo that ten sixteen at five sixty WQM

[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:54.580]
I think he's a real broke

[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.040]
If you have any stock

[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.100]
Unless of course you had a really good broker that was you know ready to set you up against just in case this stuff kind of like hedge

[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.540]
Well here's a great letter of the editor in the year old this morning of all places

[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.120]
Of many there are a lot of hostile letters in here mayor of course he probably don't read the hero anymore because he doesn't like what's in there

[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.320]
Mayor Penga Picanyer maybe he's got somebody reading to him maybe one maybe he is reading a to him in a sponule

[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.120]
Anyway baseball stadium proposal brings mixed responses to that line but I'm reading all these letters and I don't see too many mixed responses

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:29.360]
For example this isn't a really great letter but bunny fineberg and Miami says I don't get it there's no money to increase firefighter salaries

[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.060]
And a shortage of funds may close one of the bridge facilities of the social service agencies are shorter funds

[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.420]
But great news there's money for a new baseball stadium nice going bunny

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.880]
But here's the letter by Jeff Deering in Miami that kind of endured itself to me it says

[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.320]
Alex Penelope's second back room deal the building at another sports arena demonstrates louder than words

[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.520]
Why local elections are vastly more important than presidential elections? Isn't that what I always say?

[00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:00.780]
Roughly 16% of Miami-Dade's electorate voted to put Penelope's back in office yet all of us live with the consequences of the voter apathy that put him there

[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:07.640]
Next time heavy rains flood our streets or a child is electrocuted in a poorly wired public bus stop where we waste our lives sitting in traffic

[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.500]
Remember that our local elected leaders priorities begin with subsidizing billionaire sports morals and athletes

[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.620]
The public benefit of a baseball stadium will be the same as that of a new basketball and hockey arena is exactly zero

[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:24.880]
Baseball is a dying sport the more ones will not I repeat not content for world series again because of a new stadium

[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.000]
Witness the Miami heat and the Florida Panthers who continue to sink in a mediocrity even with lavish new facilities

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:37.060]
Next election Miami-Dade voters need to remember they were not permitted to the side on using public funds to build this white elephant

[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.880]
But can vote out the people who will range this sweetheart deal nice going Jeff Deering in Miami

[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:48.280]
A lot of other great letters in there too echoing pretty much the same sentiment and here the mayor is going on there with his PR campaign making their rounds

[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.020]
You know coming up with all this smooth talk bull crap

[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.980]
Oh and John hand research and honest man and he feels so sorry for him how about all the other business people in Dave County

[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.640]
A lot of whom are losing their ass

[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:06.200]
Who I don't have a billion dollars who aren't getting any special tax deals from the legislature don't you feel sorry for them Alex?

[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:14.200]
No and we're gonna. Hello those 40,000 people assuming they ever do show up where the hell are they going to park Mr. Hot shot Mr. Double Talker

[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.500]
Mr. Back Deal maker Mr. Frickett liar Mr. Crook

[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.180]
Who are you kidding you're not kidding me

[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.920]
You're a little weasel and you're not fooling me for one second maybe you're fooling some of those goddamn banana people but you're not fooling me

[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.500]
Mr. Pingapakania

[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:37.640]
So you can get on a guide and whatever shows you want and pontificate from now till the end of time and like I said if they let you get away with this go ahead

[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.360]
Go do it that could have phased me it's not gonna affect my life I'm not gonna be going there

[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.620]
But you're not fooling this kid and you're not fooling anybody with a brain

[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.040]

5607-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

Still looking for a first-of-year call of the day

[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.480]

Here it is we just got back a friend of mine went to Bellucle and the Vaux Rebaugh's

[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.820]
Bloodstuff brings out one nothing

[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.960]
At a good time for both our toughest saw

[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.360]
Yeah

And you don't have to go to Bellucle you're going to freeze your toughest saw tonight

[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.440]
You're going to stay right here and do that

[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.860]
We went to some of the other hotels the average ages from 60 to 100

[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.340]
Uh-huh

[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.140]
There's just nobody there there's no life in that place

[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.940]
Even that Steve Winnehoff tell that bouer of ours

[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.340]
Yeah

[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.780]
Just a dying dying piece of work there

[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.840]
Well thank God I don't want to go waste my time getting out of plane and going somewhere

[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.600]
Find another group of hundred-year-old people I can also see that right here

[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.680]
At least when you go to Vegas they're almost all in Mar like living and breathing

[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.120]
People and even the old people are like living it up pretty good you know it's a lot of fun

[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.780]
Yeah with a bunch of Marge on players from Coconut Creek that's always saw there

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.280]
Uh-huh

[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.700]
A lot of bubbles and say these

[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.240]
Okay glad to have a great time

[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.540]
Okay see don't go to Bellucle that's what he said and I would agree with him

[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.560]
I would hardly agree although I've never been there

[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.020]
Too many nose pickers in Bellucle

[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.700]
Where you going for the holidays I'm going to Bellucce and I don't think so

[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.980]
Too many don't go to Bellucce

[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.900]
It has X down 89 the Dows down 135

[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.420]
How's that pool coming?

[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.200]
Do you think we're going to have a recession?

[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.000]
13 votes is all we got so far

[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.820]
Yes it's coming in the recession 27

[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.320]
We're already in it 5

[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.340]
No the economy will be fine 1

[00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.940]
Oh yeah we're fine

[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.440]
Always trust people who say that

[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.480]
Oh we're fine

[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:03.860]
Yeah

[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.800]
Speak for yourself Danny boy sweetheart

[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.480]
And quit outing your friends on the ear

[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.380]
Here's a mobile and Cooper city hello

[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.520]
Hey you

[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.080]
Yes sir

[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.440]
I read in the business section yesterday that Al Sharpton called for that boycott of the hurricane

[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:17.760]
Yeah

[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.560]
I can't stand Burger King as a food product

[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.280]
And but I can't stand Al Sharpton even worse

[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.400]
You know something you and I must be thinking alike because I could despise Burger King

[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.020]
But I was saying as soon as I saw the headline I thought the same thing you did

[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.060]
Let's everybody go and eat at Burger King even who can't stand their food

[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.320]
And so let's over

[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:37.780]
Right

[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.200]
And so let's come to Summers off

[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.800]
I will buy Burger King once a week from now on

[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.780]
And we're going to eat it or donate it or whatever

[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.280]
That's right even if you're on the trash

[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.820]
It's my boycott to that fat piece of crap

[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.560]
Thank you very much

[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.080]
Okay excellent idea

[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.460]
In fact every time I used to go to Burger King I would think of the Firestone entire company

[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.140]
5,6705,60, yeah

[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.480]
Because they are it's like Shula there

[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.320]
They're meat

[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.380]
That's the best thing I could say about it

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.400]
Oh and of course they run into those conveyor belts

[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:06.720]
You know

[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.800]
Never been too crazy about that

[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.880]
So in any case when they run food through conveyor belts

[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.940]
Like pizza hot for example they run their pizzas through conveyor belts

[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.520]
Have you ever seen them cook the pizza in there?

[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.120]
No

[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.500]
You never did?

[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:17.100]
No

[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.220]
I was incredible when the last time I actually sat in a pizza place in there

[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.280]
Yeah see most people just do take out or delivery but

[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.860]
They run into a conveyor belt thing

[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.520]
You never went inside a one and saw the

[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.360]
When I was a little bit of a lot of time I was going to eat it

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.400]
And then right there you're looking at it and they run the pizzas they cook them in a conveyor belt deal

[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.040]
Assembly line food

[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:41.900]
Dreck

[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.060]
5,6705,60 pounds

[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.180]
5,60 on the AT&T

[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.940]
Everybody let's go buy Burger King

[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.000]
Get a Whopper baby

[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.060]
That's what I was looking for last night at the pizza lot looking for a Whopper

[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.280]
Tanner kept running away

[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.640]
Now we didn't have a pretty good time I gotta be honest with you

[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.400]
I had my doubts I thought to you why am I going and doing this again

[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.500]
And the traffic was brutal getting there it was bad

[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.580]
All these geeks out there these holiday shopping geeks and they had no idea where they're going

[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.600]
It was a bitch but we had a great time

[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.160]
Thanks Jeff, thanks for what you tell

[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.840]
And they started telling me oh you know you gotta go see Al's house

[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.740]
Even if you just and I said no

[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.600]
Why is it that people just don't understand me?

[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.060]
I mean do I make it?

[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.400]
I thought I was like transparent like looking through a paint of glass you know

[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.100]
Why don't they get it?

[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.400]
I keep trying to explain to Jeff Cohen and the others I'm not impressed by ostentatious people

[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.940]
I don't care what his cigar room looks like I don't care how many chachkis he's got on display

[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.860]
I know him like the palm of my hand and it's just I'm not interested I'm burned out on him already

[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.220]
Like in about five seconds

[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.260]
And he can like I said the other day you can take those keys to his apartment

[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.100]
And he can stick them up his spacious gigantic enormous ass is what he can do

[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.360]
So do you like him?

[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.120]
No it's not that I dislike him I do like him as a matter of fact now the year I don't dislike him

[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.800]
I just I can't put it in the words I can't find a word for it

[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.180]
You gotta decrease your portions

[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.720]
Yeah I can handle him in very tiny if like Suchi you know

[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.340]
I can stand looking at it for like about a half a second and I have to run off

[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.520]
When it went at eyes starts looking back at you then I say oh no I don't think

[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.240]
Well speaking of back at you was nice to see last night can't say it on the air though

[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.980]
Because they'll get upset over there

[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.760]
Oh and I never gave their numbers let's do that after the break

[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.880]
Oh especially those afternoon numbers because that seems to be I mean the midday they have no number at all

[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:41.140]
Are you sure nothing but for the afternoon no matter what they put on over the afternoon

[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.200]
You're safe Humper

[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.440]
You got nothing to worry about over there but you have no fear

[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.580]
26 after why is the bat line ringing there?

[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.340]
Why not I'm really concerned who that might be

[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.680]
So help me God if that's who I think it is

[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:57.840]
Yeah it is

[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:04.860]
Yes

[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:05.240]
Yes

[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.180]
I'd like to speak to the eight downhole statement

[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.300]
Why?

[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.980]
I want like to know what kind of a phone is this

[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.360]
We can't we can't you're a word you're saying fat so your phone's no good

[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.340]
There is a God yes

[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.940]
That was great

[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.800]
Anyway I had to do the spot anyway so I don't have time to be pots going around with that fat

[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.360]
So where's those keys you swab?

[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.820]
I'm a fat Jew

[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.180]
I'm a fat Jew

[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.380]
He's gone again

[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.120]
He's gone again

[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:55.600]
Said I interrupted the whole break there I didn't play my bet I was going to play to put him right on the year even though he has his problems obviously

[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.440]
And he's gone again

[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.780]
I'll give him like 30 seconds to get back under and find out what the hell he wants

[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:00.960]
What do you want?

[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.220]
I'm a fat Jew

[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:07.500]
What we already know that maybe you want to thank Jeff Cohen for allowing him to service him last time he was over at the law

[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.720]
Maybe that was what it was because Jeff said that was the best head he's had in a long time

[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.000]
What?

[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.900]
Why are you looking at gas? Do you heard him say that?

[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.340]
He said it was sensational it said it was like the lips of experience

[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.860]
I thought I didn't think you were going to repeat it on the year

[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.360]
Oh I'm sorry

[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.400]
Oh are we on the year?

[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.880]
Well I guess maybe he'll call back or not as the case maybe we'll survive

[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.360]
One way or the other

[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.520]
He's just having problems

[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.780]
Here's a mobile and port St. Lucie

[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.000]
Hello

[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.980]
Mobile and port St. Lucie

[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.000]
Maybe they're having problems too

[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:43.920]
Hello Neil

[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.540]
Yes sir

[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.420]
Maybe I know how you can barely hear you

[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:46.740]
Okay

[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.860]
Maybe we'll have a phone problem

[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.220]
I don't think so but go ahead do your best

[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.300]
I'll have to call back I can't

[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.220]
Okay call me back

[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.500]
Here's a mobile and port water nail

[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:57.760]
Hello

[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.400]
I can hear you Neil

[00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.800]
Okay

[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.700]
I want to echo what that guy said about the Luxe and Goatport

[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.560]
I was just there about a week and a half ago for getting it

[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.280]
I mean it's low and the crowd blows

[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.820]
You know what it reminds me of reminds me of people to go to Vegas

[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.140]
and they'll say oh you know when you go there you go down to you drive down to Lockland

[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.060]
No I always think to myself why if I'm going to get on a plane and go all the way to Vegas

[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.940]
and I usually have like a couple of days to be there anyway

[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.860]
Why would I waste the time to go down to you know what I'm saying?

[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.000]
It's like saying I'm going to go to New York City for the weekend

[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.600]
Oh when you went to New York did you get it?

[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.840]
When the car drive down to Newark for a few hours?

[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:35.980]
Yeah

[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.480]
Exactly

[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.500]
If you want gaming Vegas to be on the place to go

[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.080]
I will say this we also went over to New Orleans when we were in the Luxe

[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.560]
Yeah

[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.240]
There is a big land-based casino now

[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.300]
It's a hares

[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.680]
And it's pretty nice

[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.200]
It's like a Vegas casino

[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.380]
But it's the only one

[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.740]
So you know if you're only option

[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.960]
But you know New Orleans has great restaurants

[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.640]
Right

[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.480]
A lot of the great trunks yeah

[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.680]
Well that's a problem

[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.840]
But they're living in Britain people walking around

[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.140]
Right

[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.860]
And it would be cold there this time of the year as well

[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.180]
Yeah

[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:06.960]
They have a race track

[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.580]
I mean there's things to do there besides what in this city there's nothing

[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.120]
So but you're right about Vegas

[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.640]
On the stadium you know I agree with you a hundred percent

[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.740]
But selfishly I live in Warrows

[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:21.960]
Yeah

[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.960]
And I gotta say my attitude is like you know

[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.260]
So you know let them lose their soul

[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:27.560]
Right

[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.340]
I'm with you I don't care

[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.240]
I mean if they want to go ahead and do it that's up to them

[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.440]
It's no skin off my ass

[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.700]
Yeah I mean I guess the hope is in baseball

[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.260]
I mean you're right they always dying

[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.860]
But the hope is

[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:43.540]
And don't forget this is going to be supposedly opening two years after they had that mammoth strike in 2002

[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.060]
I was just going to say that

[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.260]
Yeah

[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.620]
The agreement runs out at the end of next year

[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.120]
They're hoping that they're going to for once

[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.020]
Which I don't see why this time would be any different than before

[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.400]
No

[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.140]
They're not going to be down the players

[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.020]
Not going to happen

[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.040]
It's going to be a walk out or a strike

[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.000]
Or a lock out or something

[00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.640]
It's going to go on

[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.860]
I'll probably miss a whole season

[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.160]
No playoffs in the world serious

[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.820]
Going up and again

[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.920]
And it'll be a nightmare

[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.040]
I agree with you

[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.060]
I think what they believe is that they're going to break the players this time

[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.040]
And they can make the game affordable again

[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.260]
I don't think it's going to happen

[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.500]
But it's a good thing

[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.040]
Well there's a share show

[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.700]
And they're sure showing a real inclination to do that right now

[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.060]
Aren't they with all these contracts coming out every single day

[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.920]
I mean, it's crazy

[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.200]
I mean, $4 billion?

[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:20.760]
Yeah

[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.080]
Not

[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.600]
Anyways, one thought

[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:23.880]
Zagazone

[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.600]
Okay, here's one more try, three strikes in your route

[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.680]
And you have me?

[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:29.380]
Yeah

[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:29.800]
Yeah

[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.140]
I'll wait until one question comes up

[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:31.700]
Who's the...

[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.440]
Who's the...

[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.000]
It's the diabetic Jew, can you give me a minute?

[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.900]
Is this the diabetic fat Jew from Amsterdam?

[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.060]
I mean, here's my question, you know, they're really...

[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.360]
Oh my God, I've noticed for you by the way

[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.540]
Before you start out with your turret

[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.320]
It's like, well, it's like, really an hour Stern?

[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.420]
I didn't, I don't listen to how it's turned

[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.200]
I was...

[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.860]
If they they am, I didn't compete, I was funny, I was funny

[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.580]
You have no shame, though, do you?

[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.880]
I'm sorry, I never compete with you, what do you...

[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.040]
No, no, wait, no, come on, you'll let me have no shame

[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.020]
Listen, I go down and guide what you want from me

[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.100]
But you are a nasty old homosexual

[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.200]
But that's why I have good time ahead, wouldn't you?

[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.180]
Will you listen to me?

[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:07.660]
Yes

[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.700]
I have good news for you, you should be in a great, good news, you're putting a holiday spirit

[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.580]
You're gonna be here

[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.000]
From the Hague Netherlands, it's just off the wire

[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.380]
Same sex marriages receive final approval in the Netherlands

[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.760]
Putting it at the International Vanguard of Gay Rights

[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.060]
Activists were jubilant about the legislation

[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.400]
So it'll take effect in April

[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]
And it's the final now, I mean, you know, they...

[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.920]
You don't want, we should be married, we should be married

[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.620]
We should be married, you and I should be married in April in the Amsterdam

[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.660]
Where do you want a honeymoon? I want a honeymoon in the St. Mods

[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.840]
Because I'm gonna have a rule of house

[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.720]
Yeah, right on your...

[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.380]
Oh, I'm pregnant, yeah

[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.080]
You are in trouble, what the fuck

[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.600]
Oh, your phone's breaking up again

[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.400]
Okay, but I want to marry you, Neil, so much

[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.480]
Yeah, I know what you want

[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.180]
I want you dead, and you're not getting it from me sweetheart

[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.420]
Jeff Cohen, let me say it again in case you missed it before

[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.760]
Jeff Cohen said, thanks for the great head on your shoulders

[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.120]
You're gonna have keys next week to help me, God, Neil, I swear to God

[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.820]
Well, let me ask you, why is this such a project?

[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.180]
You send us packages every single day

[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.820]
I want that ex-UPS, UPI, of...

[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.640]
Every day we get packages from you with tapes that we don't want

[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.080]
With all kinds of chavskies

[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.460]
And all I want is like a little set of keys

[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.820]
Which seem to be a big project

[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.800]
No, I want you to wrap your lips around my ear thing, you know what

[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.000]
I'm glad you're here, yeah

[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.440]
But no, Neil, Neil, I can't desperately about you

[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.260]
I'll be next week

[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.820]
I swear to God, I had Joey, but if you go, I did not bring him to the studio

[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.340]
Right?

[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.460]
Because you told me not to

[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.700]
Because we wouldn't know what you went, right?

[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.140]
I know, okay, next week I'm coming in

[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.020]
And I'm gonna have Aino sex with George

[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.940]
Yeah, so what's that?

[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.400]
What's new about that?

[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.960]
I'll see you later

[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.740]
Okay, and you're not welcome to my house, goodbye

[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.480]
Thank you, Baba

[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.460]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.860]
Good, because I don't want to see it anyway

[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.960]
Oh my God

[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:51.960]
I mean, you know, if he wants to bend down for you again, I mean that's up to him, but Christy oughta be used to it by now

[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.040]
What's the big novelty with that?

[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.920]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T

[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.800]
And Verizon wireless line

[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.600]
Did I hear him on Howard?

[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.780]
Is that...

[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.120]
L, please

[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.420]
Please

[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.100]
I'm a fat Jew

[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.900]
And we had a whole bunch of calls on there too up until then, Mom, did you remember that?

[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.340]
Just a few moments ago we had the Zidane calls on the board

[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.960]
You know, yeah, we did

[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.300]
One more

[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.920]
Here's a lady mobile in Chalfv, Chilla

[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.760]
Hi, Neal, you say a warm?

[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:22.720]
Yes, ma'am

[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.620]
Good for you

[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:29.460]
I watched that county commission meeting yesterday in Dave County and it was pretty funny when they brought up the stadium

[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:36.540]
And only one commissioner stood up and said, well, she was definitely not gonna go for it no matter what

[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.520]
And...

[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.600]
Came in Surincin probably

[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.980]
Yeah, exactly

[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:47.800]
And all the other ones, you know, wanted to know how was gonna benefit their own specific groups and so forth and so on

[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.820]
So it's pretty amazing how he like, you know, just went and did this without them even knowing this

[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.240]
Yeah, how come if it's gonna be a county project they don't call them the Miami-Dade Marlins?

[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.340]
Exactly

[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.020]
Well, I think they did, they wanted to call them the Miami-Morlins

[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.760]
No, the Miami-Dade Marlins

[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.860]
No, no, no

[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:09.100]
Miami-Dade's not getting too much good price lately so I don't know if they want that anyway

[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:16.020]
But yeah, it's just pretty amazing evidently he knocked on all their doors at that 630 Sunday morning and let them know about the project

[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:16.880]
So...

[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.740]
Coming in his bathroom, he's trying to take a page out of me or swallow as is a book

[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:20.840]
Definitely

[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.980]
And I think the golf port too and they give away a lot of freebies that's definitely the only good thing about them

[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.600]
They feed you free and you put you up free and that's about it

[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.200]
Not for me

[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.340]
Yeah, definitely

[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.040]
Okay, thanks

[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.720]
How did that one?

[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.120]
You too

[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.820]
Bye-bye

[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.800]
Okay, look at that one call left on here, is a mobile in the sunrise, hello

[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.580]
How you doing?

[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.160]
Okay

[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.040]
Is it the mayor supposed to represent the people?

[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.080]
And?

[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.460]
And not John Henry Wayne Heisenga and the like?

[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.080]
Yeah

[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.000]
I mean, I call the worst team at the end, you probably heard it while you were waiting for one

[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.980]
No, I do not, no

[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.960]
Okay, well, this thing with jobs, I mean what a laugh, here's a democratic moment

[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.760]
Well, you know, if you called them at the end, I mean, that's less than an hour ago

[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.380]
Why are you calling me to repeat the same thing again?

[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.020]
Because you know why they don't, they don't have to

[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.720]
Because you will just want to say the same thing again

[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.800]
Sir, look, what have I told you? I'm million times about chronic colors

[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:17.660]
I'm in the survival, I'm not going to survive with the same people calling like 45 minutes later saying the same guy didn't think again

[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.280]
Or our group's been calling on a crappy cell phone, driving my whole, all my colors away

[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.240]
Thanks, Al, now you owe me those keys

[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.260]
Just slide them under the door, sweetheart

[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.100]
God, what a project

[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.580]
See, I don't know what's happening with this phone here, George, I don't get it, maybe we're having a big phone problem

[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.580]
Here's a call on here from somewhere, which I don't say hello

[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.220]
Yes, sir

[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.060]
Call it from Miami

[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:44.440]
Hey Neil, if they're going to go ahead and put that stupid stadium in, we don't want it

[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:49.100]
Go ahead, take that site that they said was polluted because they've been thrown all that

[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.400]
Well, are we going to talk about this stadium crap here all day today?

[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.240]
No, I don't know

[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.240]
But, I mean, what's there to say about it? This is part of the course in this town

[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.880]
Right, but if they're going to take a piece of property, let's take a piece of property nobody wants

[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:12.840]
And that's downtown, I guess, Fort Dallas Station and whatever it is, that they've been jumping all that junk on it

[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:18.060]
So they need to come and do super fun to clean up on it before anybody can use it, nobody wants to use it

[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.920]
So let's use that with the heck, let's clean it up and make it do something

[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.420]
And in 30 years when they rip it down, somebody can buy it and do something real with it

[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.840]
Yeah, and then we won't have to condemn it again

[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.880]
Okay, great, thank you

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.620]
Okay, that's it for calls today, I guess

[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.760]
I mean, there's one or two on it, but it's obvious that ain't going to happen today

[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.220]
That's all right, I wouldn't have no intention of taking calls today anyway, I just want to play a lot of old stuff

[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:44.880]
A lot of crap, play some music, just sit back, goof off, ratings are over anyway now for the fall book

[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, what am I giving numbers out of? I'm not taking any calls

[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.680]
Well, just force a habit, we'll see what happens

[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.720]
How's that pull coming, 55 votes, do you think we're going to have a recession?

[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.820]
Yes, it's coming in the recession, 230

[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.720]
We're already in it, 15

[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.560]
No, the economy will be fine

[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.600]
Oh, we're fine

[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.920]
10 people say that, of course those are probably 10 people don't have any stock, wouldn't you think?

[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.200]
Uh-huh

[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200]
Yeah, don't have two nickels to rub together

[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.440]
24, 11, and 5, 60, QAM

[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.760]
This is 5, 60, QAM

[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.800]
But Neil Rogers shows

[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.320]
Sports radio, 5, 60, QA

[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.560]
A planet where 80 vote for men

[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.480]
Here's Ricardo Motoban and the Chrysler, New Yorker

[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:32.260]
This luxurious automobile has always delivered the performance you'd expect from a New Yorker

[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:41.380]
And now Chrysler introduces an onboard microprocessor which even speaks to you just like a New Yorker

[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.140]
Hey, more Ron, you want to put on your f***ing seatbelt or would you rather eat the steering wheel, eh?

[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:51.080]
Ah, yes, this is truly a New Yorker

[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.900]
Hey, genius, you left the f***ing headlights on

[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.840]
Jeez, you want dumbass?

[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:56.820]
Oh, you know that

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:02.260]
And for the most dangerous city in the world, a security system second to none

[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.340]
Hey, bag of brains, you want to lock the f***ing doors?

[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.020]
Or maybe we should put a f***ing sign in the f***ing window and say, rip me off

[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.280]
Yes, the Chrysler, New Yorker

[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.900]
If you can find a better luxury car, buy it

[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.640]
I got your luxury right here

[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.700]
Anyway, 1045 at 560 is probably an active guide George

[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.920]
Anyway, we're just rolling along here on a holiday that's f***ing our way through

[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.740]
Here's those great numbers from the INZ from Super Talk

[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.240]
Wooo! Let's look at that afternoon especially, okay?

[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.600]
Because they really, they have got their thumb on it

[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.880]
Let's look at persons 25, 54 in the afternoon, okay?

[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.100]
Because they keep making changes and changes and changes and changes

[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.280]
How many different people have they had on that station in the afternoon since I left there?

[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:46.920]
100

[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.060]
And that was just this year

[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.600]
Let's see, 3 to 7 p.m. persons 25 to 54

[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.420]
These are the ratings for September, October to November because it's a three month rolling trend for anybody who cares

[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.680]
And our audience does care

[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.060]
Let's see, Wion Z, and I'm going to tell you consistency

[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.820]
There's something to be said for it

[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.920]
Back in the summer book, they had a 0.2

[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.120]
August of September, October went all the way up to a 0.3

[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.540]
Now that was, she was not in October now

[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.200]
There's no way because she didn't know

[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.600]
0.3

[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.780]
So they put your girlfriend on there

[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.920]
Wasn't there like an edge till in the middle there's more?

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.900]
I think that the 0.2 and then the 0.3

[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.700]
What you got?

[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.540]
A 0.3

[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.400]
Consistency is where it's at baby, a 0.3

[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.160]
And that's November right in the middle of all that election and politics and all the pontificating

[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.320]
And all that was in the 1902

[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.500]
And that's it, blah blah blah blah blah blah

[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.120]
You know, all that hyper-New York Jappies crap

[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.240]
0.3

[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.280]
Peter, I want to say it again, I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.360]
This is Peter Boulder, I'm speaking about the enough of you, Sakata, Morso Akatakwan that's in this building

[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.740]
And there's no doubt in my mind that he did write that letter

[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.200]
Because he comes to me again this morning with another letter

[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.920]
And then, if I wouldn't have written a letter like this and again he's trying to lay a guilt trip on me

[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.380]
And doesn't appreciate the fact that I showed for him for a year and a half peddling his crap

[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.840]
Go sell something good, okay? Jack asks, you crazy person you?

[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.700]
But anyway, getting back to Peter Boulder

[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.260]
They could put, as much as Kevin Baxter might be offended by it

[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.680]
They could put farting noises on the air for four hours from 3 to 7pm

[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.080]
50,000 watts in the middle of the dial and do a still to 0.3

[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:25.740]
Or probably better

[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.120]
Because people would be talking about, oh do you hear that station where they fart all afternoon?

[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.080]
It's all they do is fart

[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.860]
Do the guarantee better in the point?

[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.240]
Automated fart, so wouldn't have to say anything

[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.600]
Yeah, can imagine how cheap that would be

[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.100]
Or maybe Bob Green and Bob Neil can put that on TMI

[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.100]
Automated fart in stereo on FM

[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.640]
Good vibrations radio

[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.000]
56070560

[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.380]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line

[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.300]
Here's Carl Gables, hello

[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.100]
Hi Neil

[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:53.560]
Yes sir

[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.380]
I love your show

[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:59.500]
But I will get down on my knees and beg you to please stop playing that patch commercial

[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.680]
It's driving me nuts

[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.080]
I got nothing to do with commercial, so I have nothing to do with that

[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.480]
Oh you heard it right, why don't I only understand that?

[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.820]
I don't understand that

[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.280]
I don't look good because I'm a little bit more

[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.500]
I have nothing to say about it

[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.180]
I'll go into the problem

[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.400]
Okay well like I said I have nothing to say about it

[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.420]
56070560

[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.340]
Pound 560 on the AT&T

[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.760]
I haven't even heard it

[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.260]
It's for you either, it was just done

[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:22.860]
Oh I know the one he's talking

[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.600]
We got plenty of spots that have been a lot more annoying than that

[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.280]
Blue leave me

[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:26.740]
Not lately

[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.260]
Well we're working on it

[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.220]
Here's our last call, a mobile invoker, hello

[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.920]
Hi he used to have somebody on the radio more annoying

[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.840]
Was there anything I had to eat another one we forgot yesterday

[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.400]
Yeah

[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.820]
Anyway I used to live on the island

[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.220]
How much planet did I have the ability to do?

[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.800]
I take you out here right now and take your goddamn teeth in

[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.380]
There he is

[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.180]
There he is

[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.820]
I lived on the one of the islands in the 70s in this game day

[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.620]
I remember that tiny arrow was on a

[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:56.500]
We say to say the plant on the bay for the people

[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.160]
Because the people's part of the

[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.580]
Whoever said this went on and on their

[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.140]
Entireals

[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.560]
And then one day they built all the way up to the water with their building

[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.720]
And they justified it by saying well we really had to do it

[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.780]
Because the way our building was it didn't look right otherwise

[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.120]
Yeah

[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.020]
For two years of saying nobody else could do it

[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.940]
See I would expect the hero to at least a little bit if they were honest enough to say

[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.160]
The only thing we really care about is whatever is good for the hero

[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.740]
Whatever is profitable for night ridder

[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.940]
Whatever is in our interest that's how we really care about

[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.560]
And all the rest is just windowed dressing

[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.020]
That's what they did then and that's what they're doing now

[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.420]
These are the same people that gave you a metro rail

[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.840]
Put it over on the public and then slept everybody in the face with that white elephant story

[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.440]
And traffic magazine a couple of years later

[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.840]
These are the same people that got into bed with Mickey Harrison

[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.060]
And gave you that American Airlines arena that sits there

[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.400]
80% empty for most of the heat home games

[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.140]
And 100% empty winners and some special event going on in there

[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.360]
And this is the same group of people that are going to try to give you a downtown baseball stadium

[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.600]
Because it's good for them

[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.960]
Seeing people that will probably sell their property one day like they did when they moved part of their outfit to California

[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.200]
They're not the rest of it

[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.320]
They'll sell their property for a big profit because they can't make money with their property newspaper

[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.900]
You got it

[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.020]
Okay thanks Dale

[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.900]
And have a great day

[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.480]
Anybody seen the night ridder people here lately?

[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.400]
No, they're out there in Silicon Valley

[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.700]
They're pumpin' it

[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.640]
Because it was more profitable for them because it was better for them

[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.520]
And that's all they care about

[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.540]
They're a business and whatever is good for their business that's all they give a crap about

[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.080]
Oh no, we care about the community

[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.400]
No you don't, you lie, you're a bunch of liars

[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.400]
Last call, here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.920]
Yeah, yes sir

[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.160]
How you doing? Okay

[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.160]
I don't give a crap about the stadium

[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.680]
Miami's in a different country anyway

[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.340]
It is a different country

[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.020]
Absolutely

[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:40.320]
You go there and it's just they run their own game and the scams

[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.320]
And you know, it's just a joke

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.200]
Have a little story for you

[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:50.080]
I had gotten a call from Al Goldstein or actually from his housekeeper

[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:54.780]
And he needed an elephant table in his humidor room repaired

[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.620]
He's got a table with two elephant heads on it

[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:04.320]
I have never in my life seen a bigger pile of shit in a home

[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.080]
Ever

[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.220]
This man lives like an animal

[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.580]
If you could see his apartment in Amsterdam

[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.900]
Which is about the size of the room that I'm sitting in here right now

[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.340]
It is covered from wall to wall in every in the bathroom in the living room

[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.760]
And a little bedroom with crap on the floor

[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.560]
There's cassettes and there's tapes and there's wrecking

[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.740]
I really don't know how to do it

[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.900]
I actually had to

[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.980]
Wade my way back to this humidor room

[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.300]
Which there are cigars

[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.300]
I mean I have never seen cigars in my life like this

[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.640]
He has got more crap in that home

[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.220]
And I mean you know give a job just before ever to get paid

[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:41.960]
You know how

[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.840]
Anyway I hope you have your keys and happy holidays

[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.280]
Okay thanks thanks for your dues

[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.700]
So I guess I could be the fact I don't want to go see that house up there in

[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.440]
Pomp and a beach that ostentatious show place

[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.080]
I don't know I could go to miss out seeing a lot more crap

[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.060]
I've already seen all the crap he's got laying on the floor in an apartment in Amsterdam

[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.600]
Which if he ever does give me the keys I'm going to have to wade through that just to get to the toilet

[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.040]
Not one call on the board

[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.560]
This is a fine how do you do isn't it?

[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.040]
How do you do?

[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.120]
I do

[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.580]
What I can

[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.060]
Okay so I guess it's going to be play all the bits through the new year

[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.360]
Now I got stuff in here

[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.760]
I got all kinds of crap just play all the older rack

[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.100]
They got nothing to say here today

[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.520]
Because tomorrow of course is Chinooka

[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.440]
And all the Jews they bailed on us already

[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:27.840]
WQA in

[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.300]
Yeah I'm calling from homestead

[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.520]
Yes sir let's go to homestead

[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:30.740]
Hello

[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.200]
Howdy Nia there's Wapi from homestead

[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.340]
Yeah how could your voice just change happy

[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.560]
I don't know but what can I do

[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.900]
You're boring happy

[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:39.600]
Okay

[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.120]
How do you like that?

[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.500]
Now that was sensation

[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.940]
I'm so glad I picked him up cold

[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.760]
Sounded like an ordinary guy

[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.740]
Hi Nia there's a hat different homestead

[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.900]
Hi with a phony voice

[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.140]
Wow

[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.460]
I'm so sorry for all of us

[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.620]
That we have to be here

[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.380]
You know not just for me but for all of us

[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.680]
Those of us who really don't deserve this

[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.820]
Especially on days like this one

[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.420]
It's going to be like in the 30s maybe the 20s in some places tonight

[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.900]
Now if the weather isn't good then you definitely don't deserve being here

[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.900]
Because that's the only thing we got going for us

[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.260]
So I apologize to all of you then we have to be here

[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.680]
Here's a mobile in the gables hello

[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.520]
Hi Nia good morning

[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.100]
Yes sir

[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.300]
Happy holidays

[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.720]
Thanks for your efforts

[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.760]
You're absolutely 100% correct on everything

[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.440]
There's no changing date county

[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.360]
And there's no sense risking your mental or your physical wellbeing

[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.260]
That's right here's the guy that makes some sense

[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.160]
What's the sense again I'll bend out of shape and whipped up to her friends you again

[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.500]
And again I'll pissed off again

[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.180]
Hey if they're going to screw over the public again there that's too bad you know

[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.040]
Hey it's their stock and trade

[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.940]
What did Alex Penelope or Joe Corolla have ever done?

[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.720]
They never met a crook that they didn't want to put back in office again so what the hell are they expect?

[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.580]
Yeah most of them are family members anyway you know

[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:53.960]
That's right

[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.640]
But now the whole thing is with a Christian only in date county

[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.840]
With something like this even see the light of day

[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:06.140]
Even though it appears that the Penelope and Corolla have done about everything they can to broker this deal before telling anybody

[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.060]
Including the Miami Hill

[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.060]
But I mean you know

[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.520]
But there's no sense getting worked up it

[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.900]
I mean we might as well sit back and kind of a semi detached amusement

[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.020]
Because I'm not I'm not amused about it I'm nauseous

[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:22.420]
But I'm not going to well I'm not going to get bent out of shape there's no point

[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.220]
You can't push a string I mean why fight it

[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.100]
They're going to do it if there's any way they can finagle it they're going to do it

[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:35.140]
See I never dreamed in fact even Hank and I were talking about this off year after he walked out here yesterday

[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.260]
We need to one of us ever believe that they build that Mickey Emerson

[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.220]
Mickey Erison the debacle there that American Airlines arena

[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:46.420]
Nobody with a brain ever thought that they would put that through and they did they managed to pull that off

[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.340]
So I can't put anything past them that's how crooked they are

[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.960]
No no they've been doing it forever

[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.480]
I mean it goes back to the 80s Ralph Sanchez got over 50 million dollars

[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.980]
Yeah I wanted to talk about look at that dish TV 2175

[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.940]
Okay good luck to us here and have a great holiday

[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:02.520]
2175

[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.020]
Company that never had earnings in its existence and mature says

[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.680]
Oh that's going to be a $250 stock

[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.620]
Do you really want to get rid of that dish TV

[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.400]
Which I never wanted in the first place

[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.000]
I think it really blows much

[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.280]
In fact I think you blow to be honest with it

[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.260]
I think you suck

[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.400]
I think you haven't got a freaking clue Mitch

[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.500]
What what are you shaking your head about

[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.600]
Oh I'm agree

[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.360]
I mean he just he's coolest

[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.720]
I mean I bought Oracle and even though it's gone down a little with everything else right now

[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.800]
It's still above where I bought it I bought Intel

[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.720]
Intel's one of the very few stocks that it still go up a few cents

[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.660]
I mean I just it's not that difficult

[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.180]
I mean we're in a tough time and everybody's taking a bath

[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.460]
But this guy he like gravitates toward Drek

[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.480]
He falls in love with Drek

[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.660]
He's kind of like the Peter Clayton of the stock market

[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.780]
Speaking of Drek boy was quite a

[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.840]
Didn't we have quite a little thing going on here yesterday when the show I didn't

[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:00.120]
These numbers came out where I was sitting around waiting and then Bruce Beathley was in here

[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.840]
Come up here with Greg Reed

[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.780]
Shuffle my hands with her

[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:05.660]
I beg your pardon?

[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.400]
No, it was Bruce

[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.840]
I don't think Brad's out yet

[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.740]
I think it was Bruce Beathley I do believe

[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.880]
Because he had a real snappy jacket on

[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.440]
And he came to near and took my hand very friendly

[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.160]
Thank me for all the stuff I've done for the station

[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.060]
Congratulations the ratings are coming back up again

[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.660]
And everything's going to be just fine

[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.800]
And showed up with some of these terrible pictures that somebody took of Amsterdam

[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.700]
The street where I allegedly fell down

[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.500]
Yeah

[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.560]
He seemed like a decent enough guy

[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:32.880]
To my face

[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.740]

I like the wind

[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.840]
Just do wind and Brad boys

[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.760]
Never made a door

[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.240]
Be tall and never saw

[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.920]
Because they're each other's paw

[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.400]
And they're working their mom

[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.140]
Brushing their gums

[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.280]
Because they ain't got no teeth

[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.960]
Most days are mountain-meyer mom because they can't catch a seed

[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.900]
They're getting wayyyy

[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.360]
The only way they know how

[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.180]
That's just a little more fun than going to heaven some cows

[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.620]
Just do wind for advice

[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.800]
Wouldn't change if they could

[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.480]
Scrolling with Darwin because they're can't focus them wood

[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.280]
By the way, Al, I don't want your keys, stay in Al-A

[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.900]
It's 11 o'clock at 560-WQAM

[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.680]
The world famous Neil Rogers show they got Hank Goldberg at 2

[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.120]

730 from the Macarena EDK after the game

[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.560]
So Panthers and the Penguins

[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.920]
6,000 seats still remain

[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.020]
I just mentioned that in passing

[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.080]
Any interest out there?

[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:01.300]
No

[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.520]
Mario ain't playing that I don't know

[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.780]
567-0560

[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.220]
Here's the mobile in Miami

[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:06.620]
Hello

[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.140]
Good morning

[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:08.780]
Yes sir

[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.860]
Don't want to get too sports intensive

[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:17.480]
But is anybody keeping track of how much salaries you're going to be in total baseball

[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.420]
With all these contracts going next year?

[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:19.960]
Don't care

[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:26.000]
But how can it possibly the television, you know, I'm not going to make the money off television or I'm going to be a Mosie

[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.020]
But is there any way that they're going to make money in baseball at the time?

[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.300]
I don't know and I don't care, it's their problem

[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.980]
It's some plague on all of them

[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.720]
I'm not going to walk

[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:38.540]
I haven't been to a baseball game in the last 4 or 5 seasons even though I get free tickets

[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.080]
I will not watch it on TV, I don't want anything to do with it

[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:41.740]
That's their problem

[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.160]
It's unimportant, see

[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.420]
It's a, you're getting all worked up about it, it's unimportant

[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.500]
Well you're right, but you know, the funny part about it is

[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:53.440]
So if this debacle goes through and they build the stadium and the Miami Marlins

[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.260]
Which I remember the old Miami Marlins, the minor league team, at least they were a good product

[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.900]
But if the Miami Marlins had a...

[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.860]
No, they weren't, no they weren't

[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.620]
But why do you say that? Why do you make such a ridiculous comment?

[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.620]
I saw a couple of their games, that was not a good product, there was no lead there, it was a joke

[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.080]
But weren't they part of their Oreos?

[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.980]
Yeah, that wasn't a good product

[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:20.200]
But when you were a kid and you were scoring games, you know, and you're eating a hot dog and you're paying 3 bucks to go in

[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.780]
It wasn't that for 3 bucks

[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.300]
Yeah, wasn't that then make it a good product?

[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.860]
No, but I'm just saying you know, to prepare

[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:31.420]
They also didn't make the hot dogs a good product because the food at the ball games down here has never been any good

[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.880]
And that's true

[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.720]
But you know, you'll still be able to give away free tickets, that's the scariest part about it

[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.220]
When you say you've got free tickets, people will be calling like flies

[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.220]
I don't give away free tickets to baseball games

[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.800]
I haven't given away all the tickets on this show in two or three years at least

[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.340]
Oh good, okay, well I would...

[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.060]
Because I want to make sure that my seats are empty

[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.960]
That's right, you're lying down

[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.420]
You're absolutely right

[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:56.480]
That's right, I want to make sure there's as many empty seats as possible because it's a farce, I'm not going to subsidize it

[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.400]
Because you know, in the television, and I feel like you're saying, who do we know?

[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:05.800]
Do you know any living-grinding person, other than George Will and the Geeks that score the games at home, that watch a baseball game from start to finish?

[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.300]
No, and I thought you mentioned that

[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.160]
I think about that often because I do have the baseball package

[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.380]
Because it's really extra boring here during that part of the summer when I have to be here

[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.880]
Which luckily isn't very much anymore

[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:19.720]
But you know, and I'll watch a couple of meetings here and maybe an ending over there or a half-in-an-ing

[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.660]
And I'll flip it around to see if there's a good game on

[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:26.020]
But and I've thought of that so many times, the idea that I wouldn't sit down and watch a game from start to finish

[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:29.860]
Now back in 187 or 188, whatever the bad was, 187 when it comes to that big year

[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.340]
And I got my first satellite dish

[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.140]
I watched every single comes game from start to finish

[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:36.380]
Start to finish

[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:41.240]
You couldn't pay me to watch a baseball game from start to finish

[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.880]
The only games you can watch are friends, I think are hockey and football

[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.380]
Right

[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:48.120]
That football has become just, you watch the last five minutes that you can play

[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.460]
Well, that's the last two minutes, which takes a half an hour

[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.400]
See you

[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.760]
Okay, good point

[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:58.340]
But I'm not going to worry about it, I mean, pay them $15 billion a year, it makes no difference to me

[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.080]
$5.670, $5.60, $5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line

[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:09.340]
I mean, if you people in Dave County want to get all whipped up in and they may make another big cause

[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.900]
So they may get all say, go ahead, don't do it on this show though

[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:14.740]
So holidays were interesting to be in a better frame of mind

[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:18.040]
Watching the market take a dive, watching our money to do a disappearing act

[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.940]
You notice we have what we have to call about that either

[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.880]
Not one single call about that

[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:26.480]
So I guess there are a lot more confident that Ellen Greenspan is a genius

[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.920]
And that everything will be just fine, just Tunky Dory

[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.000]
Even though what he did yesterday, there are people on death row for offenses lesser than what he did to the economy

[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.080]
And to think that this one man, I've said this so many times but I must be the only person who believes this

[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:46.220]
To think that anyone man has got this kind of power over the economy of the whole world

[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:51.920]
Not just this country, the whole globe shakes every time this man takes a crap, the world shakes

[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:57.440]
Every time he's far, everybody opens a window, oh my god, like when he went to the morning of the fed meeting

[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.900]
He's walking on over across the street with that briefcase and they're sitting there analyzing

[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:04.000]
What's in it, how big is it, how thick is it in the briefcase too, you know

[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.000]
Something very wrong with that

[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.140]
Something really wrong with it

[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.120]
There's enough wrong with it to make you think that if you had any brains

[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.960]
You take all your money and put it under your mattress

[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.280]
Here's a mobile in Papano, hello

[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.040]
Neil? Yes sir

[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.560]
Hey there we go, sorry about that, don't a crappy cell phone

[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.580]
Thanks for a great night last night

[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:30.220]
I had a good time, my buddy Paul John and I brought our wives out and our kids to see it

[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:30.560]
Uh huh

[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:35.780]
And I wanted to apologize to the fat guy sitting across from me, I just assumed that was our gold stain

[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:38.920]
That was fat ricks, don't ever call him our gold stain again

[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.180]
I felt bad about that

[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.860]
No, it's okay, he's been cold worse

[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:48.440]
But good turnout, first time at Pizza Loft and it was surprisingly good too, enjoyed it

[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.100]
It was very good

[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.680]
Yeah, I mean it was amazing, I think there was, you know, Cisco food, it all comes out of a can

[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.800]
But sometimes it's better than that

[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:56.160]
Don't say that

[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.820]
Anyway, I think it's a great guy

[00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:59.960]
Okay, and thanks for coming

[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.940]
So you've got to take a little shot there, it's Cisco foods, how do you like that

[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.160]
Everybody's today looking for a little shot

[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.480]
What is the reason for that?

[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:09.600]
It came out he had a good time, had a nice meal

[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.860]
But he's got to take a little shot because maybe he doesn't like Jeff's pointy tail, whatever the deal is

[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.160]
Or maybe he, uh, maybe Tender didn't give him any, either

[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:21.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18, teen, Verizon Wireless Line

[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.260]
He does it on how they're supposed to be in a better frame of mind

[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:27.120]
He's supposed to be a little more generous, a little more benevolent this time of the year

[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:30.460]
In case nobody ever told you that when you were like a little child, like last week

[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.280]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello

[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.180]
Hello, Neil

[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.460]
Yes, you know, whatever happened to that guy that ricks inches, it would have been

[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:43.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18, teen, and Verizon Wireless Line

[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:46.620]
I'll try a couple more, and that's it, that'll be it

[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.080]
I guess it's good I can't hear anything today

[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.240]
Good, and you're lucky, he got his, I mean, must be looking down upon you

[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.400]
With a smile on his puts, just before he stabs you in the back

[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.900]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale, hello

[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:01.580]
Hello

[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:02.260]
Yes, sir

[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:07.480]
And you know, I got a question here, I can't understand when I watch pro football games

[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.400]
When the teens move down the field and they get to about the 40-yard line

[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:14.940]
And they say the other teens 40 and they stall, then they punt it

[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.720]
Okay, they decide not to go for a field goal, and they put their punter in there

[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.800]
Who tries pooch punts that never work, they always kick it and he ends up

[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.900]
I'll tell you what, call up one of the sports shows, you can have a lengthy and very ponderous discussion about that

[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:27.560]
It sounds like grist for the meal on one of our sports shows

[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:33.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.840]
Harvey, if I'm from hunger, you really had your thumb on it when it comes to our callers, man

[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.500]
You really got your finger in it

[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.040]
Here's my knee-b, chill out

[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.100]
Hey, now, how you doing?

[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:43.520]
Okay

[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.000]
Can we change your subject please?

[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:45.660]
Thank you

[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:46.480]
There is no subject

[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:49.340]
Hey, well, I mean from the bad cause to hopefully a decent one

[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.300]
Well, I'm waiting

[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.800]
I just got back from Vegas yesterday, baby

[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.260]
Yeah

[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.400]
Punch my guts out

[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.180]
Yeah, that's not a subject

[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.920]
No, no, don't be sorry, but what kind of a subject is that?

[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.140]
Well, I don't know, I'm going to tell you the truth, I mean I had a damn good time

[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:07.760]
I want to talk about Vegas and gambling and you know, I was turned on to the whole thing actually by you

[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:08.060]
Yeah

[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.860]
Went there a year ago, for a lifetime

[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:13.080]
But with all the respect, because we had calls like this yesterday too

[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.540]
It's not a bulletin that you have a good time when you go to Vegas

[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.300]
Oh, well

[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.640]
It's not a bulletin

[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.360]
No, you know what?

[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.100]
It's not interesting, it's ponderous to me

[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.260]
I know how, and anybody with a brain in the audience already knows that

[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.240]
Anybody's ever been there, it's fun, it's wonderful, it's great

[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.780]
But we're here and we're not there

[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:34.500]
Although Bruce Beasley told me they just closed their deal on the New Orleans and the Vegas radio stations

[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:39.820]
And as they walked out the door yesterday, I said, hey Greg, how many months of a year do I get to do the show in Vegas?

[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:40.900]
I though that's them

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.200]
And Bruce Beasley did have a great line, he's the S.A.R.

[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.220]
And he said, you know, if we give you any more time off, I'll be working for you

[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.580]
Which was a great line, I thought, yeah, that's a good idea

[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:53.720]
Because the guy that's wearing a suit like that oughta be working for, well, kind of ratings as he gets

[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:54.560]
Yeah, that's right

[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:57.840]
Probably about a point

[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.680]
Like I said, probably about a point

[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:01.240]
Behind

[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.940]
Well, even this thing is acting up to a little bit

[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.240]
Everything's a little ordinary today, and notice we had the Florida flicker in light

[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.340]
The power went out here for about two seconds a little while ago

[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.820]
The phones are acting up a little bit

[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.920]
Maybe it's that stock market, maybe they're pissed off at Alan Greenspond

[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:18.700]
Maybe they're not too happy about this, maybe they're having like a little internal grud or something

[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:20.960]
Because they're getting very nervous and shaky

[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:25.860]
But I do see the 25 people out there, or 26 people said, no, the economy's gonna be...

[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:26.700]
Oh, we're fine

[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.400]
Just fine, don't worry about it

[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:31.380]
Don't you feel better that everybody's telling me that?

[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:32.440]
No, I don't

[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:39.000]
Because far more people, 55 said, yeah, it's coming in a recession too, and 25 said, not always a recession coming, but we're already in it

[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.860]
In fact, that's how I voted, we're already in one

[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.200]
Don't tell that you woulda big nose that though, because he's busy with the what's her name there

[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.860]
From MSNBC, what's her name that I mentioned yesterday?

[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.560]
Maria Bauderello, no

[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:56.860]
Alan Greenspond's wife, oh, that little midget, he has a wife, the news bitch, what's her name?

[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.180]
I'm the one I told you about, yes?

[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.780]
I know, you think I remember it?

[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.080]
Andrea Mitchell, see it took me about a second and a half

[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:04.920]
She's forgettable

[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.400]
Ten minutes after 11 at 5'60, WBDQF

[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.000]
How young is two young people?

[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.700]
Here's Andrew Dice Clay, four, Dice Aroni

[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.120]
All right, let's say you're eaten

[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.920]
You sick and f***ing tired of f***ing potatoes

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.300]
And that stoltop s***

[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.060]
Do like me, honey, eat this

[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.700]
Dice Aroni

[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.520]
Come on, it's almost as simple as you

[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.540]
What the f***ing bag and the f***ing pot

[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.700]
And you turn on the f***ing stove

[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.860]
You think you can manage that, honey?

[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.500]
Hey, what up being a f***ing thing done?

[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.320]
So remember, thank you, doodle, came to town

[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:50.140]
Right in on a pony, stuck up feather off is a f***ing thing called it Dice Aroni

[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:55.100]
Oh, you know Dice, oh, no, me, the catty gave her treat

[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.720]
One of the 13 at 5'50, WBDQF

[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.060]
Happy Holidays to Ian Spud of your obnoxious behavior this morning so far

[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.540]
That's okay, we're used to it

[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.760]
And of course, Harvey from Margate says

[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.260]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.120]
Good morning, Neil

[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:10.480]
Yes, sir

[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.960]
Can you hear me, sir?

[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:14.360]
Yes, sir

[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.960]
Because I'm getting nervous about our phones

[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:16.960]
Oh, that's okay

[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.900]
You know, from time to time, the state of Florida has an anti-crime announcement

[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.200]
If you use a gun, you get 10, 20 lights, you heard of that one?

[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:27.440]
Yeah

[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.900]
I'm just wondering, because since I listened to you, you've made me...

[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.100]
I'm just curious about this one thing

[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.240]
Yes, sir

[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.580]
Does it really carry it out to the limit of what they say?

[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.600]
Or is something that just placate us, the pleases?

[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.020]
I haven't got any idea

[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.780]
I wish somebody from law enforcement

[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.760]
There's all kinds of plea bargaining, so that...

[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.300]
That's what I mean

[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.040]
They're not afraid...

[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.040]
Imagine if they say it's with a gun

[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.680]
It probably applies to a knife also

[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:55.880]
No, I would think

[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.400]
No

[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.180]
No?

[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:57.500]
No

[01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.840]
Yeah, but is it?

[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.860]
Because they would have applied to a knife, OJ would never have moved here

[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T

[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.920]
And Verizon Wireless Line

[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.320]
And by the way, balled over there at the SunCental

[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.180]
We're writing that boring crap about his squeeze or whatever

[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.580]
That Christy Prody bitch, nobody cares anymore

[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.000]
He's getting really stale

[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.080]
Very stale

[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:21.880]
Kind of like these calls

[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.620]
Here's Dear Field, hello

[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:24.180]
Neil

[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:24.800]
Yes, sir

[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.660]
About five years ago I worked for a fast control company

[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.260]
Yes, sir

[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.560]
And I got a car with a good Catholic goldstein

[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.120]
Because they had these little pissant swimming kitchen

[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.260]
And I get there

[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.480]
And you know, if you've seen the kitchen, it's all black

[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.780]
I've never seen the kitchen

[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.360]
Because I've never been anywhere near his house

[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.580]
Oh, you had them

[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.200]
And I thought that the floor is black tile

[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.640]
The counters are black, black marble

[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.060]
The cabinets are painted black

[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:54.380]
The all the appliances are black

[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.420]
There's about 12 cafeteria machines

[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:58.940]
Yeah

[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.460]
And what's not covered by a cap of chino machines on the counter there

[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.960]
Is covered with, there must have been 35 bottles of olive oil

[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.360]
Yeah

[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.240]
It was amazing

[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240]
Well, I know where those go

[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.260]
So I'm looking for these little pissant, right?

[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:12.440]
Yeah

[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.440]
I can't see anything in the kitchen

[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:16.660]
It's totally dark

[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.020]
Right

[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.180]
For the ass of lady I said

[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.000]
Tell me where you saw the answer

[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.280]
She says there everywhere

[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.120]
I said, okay

[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.600]
So she left and I just prayed a little shmups around in there

[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.260]
I have some cap of chino and hold that

[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.360]
Uh-huh

[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.180]
Good thinking

[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:29.800]
That's it

[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.420]
Okay, thanks

[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.620]
See, let me just, I would like to make a suggestion here

[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.260]
And that is that the program, I like the rest of the world

[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.840]
This show is not about algoldstein

[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.740]
See, I know the rest of the world

[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.740]
In fact, the rest of the universe is about algoldstein

[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.980]
But this program is not about algoldstein

[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.160]
I don't really care about his house

[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.320]
In fact, I'm sorry that he mentioned this house

[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.720]
I'm very sorry that he called

[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.020]
What was it 14 times before?

[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.380]
I'm sorry they did that

[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.660]
Because this is not a program about algoldstein

[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.020]
I think he's paying these people to call

[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:55.500]
Probably

[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.000]
Probably

[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.880]
I don't care about this house

[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.680]
567, 0560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T

[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.240]
And Verizon Wireless Line

[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.220]
Here's a mobile in Delray Beach

[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:09.920]
Hello

[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.320]
Hi, I'm Annette

[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.240]
Hello, if it's me, I'm Annette V

[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:18.780]
But my point is, how do you think this thing with George Bush and Green Span

[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.680]
I'm going to work out is

[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.580]
I know that the market was anticipating a 25 quarter point drop in the interest rate

[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:25.840]
Yeah

[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.280]
Then he had a meeting

[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.180]
Oh, I know if they had a meeting the other morning and did not go well

[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.320]
That's what I can tell you, sir

[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.860]
They don't have a meeting of the mines, they did not go well

[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.040]
Which one is the tax budget that Green Span does in one minute?

[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.660]
Do you think that Bush would have liked the quarter point drop?

[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.640]
Of course he would

[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.160]
And so what of course?

[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:45.800]
That was the incoming president wants to inherit a recession

[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:47.980]
That's my point

[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:51.940]
But the point is that the Green Span is Republican appointed by I believe was Reagan

[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:52.460]
Yeah

[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.960]
And just wanting to want every recession

[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.180]
So when the what's the thing comes in, the empty suit comes in

[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:04.000]
That he can sort of pull the thing back out again

[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.760]
Does that make any sense?

[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.140]
No

[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.120]
Do you have any long time idea how long it takes to get out of recession?

[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.240]
I know, I know

[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.680]
I don't just cut the interest rates once and then all of a sudden proof

[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.920]
The economy recovers is like I ate a nine month lag before these things start kicking in again and have an effect

[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:21.940]
Do you think that did that?

[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:22.700]
I think that he said

[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.220]
There had to be an interest rate cut yesterday

[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.380]
There actually had to be and there was not

[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:30.620]
And to say well, you know, we're opening the door for one

[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.020]
And maybe we'll have an intermediate one before the next meeting

[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.320]
And he's talking out by January

[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.480]
Sir, let me say it again, it had to happen yesterday and it did not

[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.580]
He blew it

[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.100]
Not George Bush blew it, Alan Green Span blew it

[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.260]
Playing in simple

[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:52.560]
The Maven, the Maven who hiked interest rates at least twice and probably three times too many last year

[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.200]
Now all of a sudden, well, he's going to wait

[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:54.940]
We're opening the door

[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:58.400]
We're looking worried about recession, but in the meantime, hold your horses

[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.400]
Because we certainly don't want people to go into a panic

[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.560]
And think that we're afraid of a recession like the economy's falling apart

[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.360]
Well, guess what, dummy? That's blood on the floor, baby

[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.320]
Very sad

[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.020]
But it's only money

[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.660]
And like how many to say I'm a victim of my own

[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.060]
I'm one of those people don't do as I do as I say

[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:17.940]
How do I say?

[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.820]
Because I'm a victim of my own stupidity

[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.580]
I keep telling everybody that market is like

[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.500]
And didn't somebody say on this program intellectualized Las Vegas?

[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.800]
I don't want to say it with Ted David

[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.240]
Because he's back working again

[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.780]
Thank God I didn't get cancer saying it

[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:31.940]
Intellectualized Las Vegas

[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.320]
I've been telling you that for years

[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.460]
It's like gambling without having a good time

[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.080]
And especially now, used to be years ago

[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.060]
I remember when I was a kid

[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.280]
And my parents bought me a few shares of Eastman Kodak

[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.280]
Which of course was in Watches, too, that's why I grew up

[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.820]
And so I had a few shares of stock

[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:50.720]
Like, you know, you do for your kids a lot of times

[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.320]
And I pick up the paper in the morning and I read it was like

[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.660]
It would go up 20 cents or down 10 cents, whatever

[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.360]
And the entire stock market

[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.980]
This isn't before there was any NASDAQ

[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.400]
That's the way the market was

[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.320]
And if a stock went like up or down a dollar

[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.620]
We're like, wow, look at that, it was like the end of the world

[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.480]
Now, here like right now, Cisco is down 388

[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.420]
And this one is down

[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.300]
You look at stocks that were $32 yesterday

[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.460]
And they're down $16, now they're worth $16

[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.120]
They just dropped 50% in value

[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.180]
So if you had $100,000 yesterday in that stock

[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.440]
Today you got 50 grand

[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.980]
This is not investing

[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.040]
This is gambling is what it is

[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.720]
And anybody who wants to deny that as far as I'm concerned

[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.220]
Is either an idiot, a liar or both

[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.040]
It's gambling

[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.400]
Wild hysterical gambling

[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.180]
Here's a CMRC, I don't know what that is

[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.620]
25 bucks, down 6 bucks

[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.340]
Here's another one, 8219, down 781

[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.580]
Here are stocks that were

[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.420]
Here's a priceline.com is worth a buck now I think is the, yeah

[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:57.140]
William Shatter is trying to palm that guitar

[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.220]
That's right

[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:03.780]
Tragic

[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:09.140]
Amazon.com, 1759, stocks that were to, they had no earnings

[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.420]
But all of a sudden with this hysteria that were $200 stocks

[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.920]
Now they're on for $15, $7

[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.420]
And we're supposed to believe that this is really investing

[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.960]
Here's a mobile-informed buyer, it's hello

[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:25.900]
How well, Neil?

[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:26.520]

[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:33.740]
I've got one question for you, have you ever seen Andrea Mitchell, Ray Leota and James Woods together at the same time?

[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:37.540]
Yeah, and Randy Johnson

[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.400]
Yeah, and the guy that plays Superman, King King

[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:44.420]
And in the holiday spirit, I got one question

[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.620]
Did stand major ever pay you that $2000? No

[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.180]
Have a great paypal

[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.880]
In fact, that's always my ace in a hole

[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.800]
If I lose all my money in a market, I can always go back to collect interest on that

[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.820]
About 2 million

[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.620]
5,670, 560, pound 560 on EAT&T

[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.060]
And Verizon Wireless Line

[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.320]
Mobile in Miami, hello

[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:02.600]
Hello

[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.320]
Yes sir

[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.700]
I'm surprised more people are on the dress of the economy

[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.440]
I'm watching my portfolio get out of store too

[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:09.720]
Yeah

[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.100]
So let me ask the question, don't you think that the price of oil is what's doing this right?

[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.580]
The price of oil has come way down

[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:18.180]
The price is like $29 bucks a barrel, something like that

[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.080]
The price of oil is down to 13 when the stock market was going crazy

[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.200]
In fact, the price of gas that the pump has already come down

[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.400]
And some of my amico 20 cents a gallon

[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.720]
And what about the price of fuel oil?

[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.880]
We're coming into the coldest winter we've had in the past

[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.860]
Let me say it again, it's already come way down

[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.000]
Way down

[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.320]
You think it's down far enough?

[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:44.120]
Well, what if the price of fuel oil got to do with a value of Cisco or some micro-soft or Microsoft or Intel?

[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.840]
What if the price of oil had to do with that?

[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:51.140]
The problem is that either you've got money to buy computers or you've got money to heat your home, what are you going to do?

[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.140]
You're going to heat your home to buy your car

[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:57.840]
The people who don't have money to heat their home aren't the ones who are buying computers, sir. You know that

[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.160]
Oh, that's not true

[01:09:59.160 --> 01:09:59.840]
It is true

[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:06.080]
The average gallon of street is buying computers, if he doesn't buy computers, you can't just rely on a few intellectuals buying computers

[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.920]
The computers are mass produced for the masses

[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.720]
And if they don't have the money for Christmas to buy them, what are they going to do? They're going to go heat their home and buy their cars

[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.680]
Let me ask you something, how many people in Florida buying a heating oil for their homes right now?

[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:22.000]
Well, but they make the same thing with air conditioning, electric bills

[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.880]
Electric bills go up when the price of oil is those

[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.040]
Everything goes up

[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:26.080]
Everything goes up

[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.920]
I like to propose the same as it always has been

[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:35.760]
Well, let me tell you, we're lucky here in Florida because the price of electricity is cheap here

[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.980]
But you go up to New York and you go up to Pennsylvania

[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.600]
But we're not in New York or Pennsylvania

[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.740]
Because there's a lot of people that buy computers that are there, they can't even go up to Penn on Florida, Penn on the whole world

[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.760]
What about the third world country?

[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.540]
How many shopping isn't only about computers, they were doing one of the new local shows

[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:56.460]
Or maybe it was on CNBC yesterday, they had some people down at Aventure Amal right here in Miami

[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:00.280]
And there was nobody in the mall, it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I think it was Bill Griffin who was talking about it

[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.420]
I'm trying to tell you, they don't have any money left after the end

[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:05.640]
But that's what I'm trying to tell you, you're talking about people in New York and Pennsylvania

[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:11.880]
Aventure Amal is here in Florida, these people aren't, they don't have a shortage of money because of their electric bill

[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.840]
Because of, you know, what do you think is driving the market, you tell me

[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.840]
Sir, the fact is that consumer confidence is just like that

[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.020]
And money is tight, money is tight because it's interesting

[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.480]
Why does money become tight oil?

[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.360]
Because Alan Greenspan is an asshole, sir, that's why money has become tight

[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.640]
Jesus Christ almighty, what do I have to do, draw you a diaphragm?

[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.400]
Go buy some home-eating oil, get out of my face

[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.460]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T

[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.140]
How's the place of olive oil?

[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:47.420]
Great at what's his name's house, you've got plenty of it in this kitchen

[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.280]
Find here one more call about your friend, you started this, so I started

[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.600]
Yeah, you started it, you're the one that introduced us

[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.740]
Yeah, but I didn't fall in love with him

[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.940]
I'm at the one with my head up his ass

[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.200]
I'm at the one with my picture in his magazine with my tongue, with my brown tongue

[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.500]
That's you, Mr.

[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:04.940]
Yeah

[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.940]
Jeff Cohen is the one responsible for, let's blame him, he's not here

[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:08.340]
Okay

[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.960]
Here's your field B, tell him

[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.840]
You think of George Bush's poetic

[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.680]
chronic 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, yeah

[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.940]
Give me some oxygen for these calls today, wow

[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:31.360]
chronic, get a life, this is not WKAT, this is not WS Dozen's fight about Kevin Mac

[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.500]
There says nobody in the world wants through your voice ever again, sir

[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.120]
ever

[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.720]
Go away, don't go away, man, just go away and go back and play with yourself some other day, get out of here

[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.980]
Here's the mobile in sunrise, hello

[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:45.900]
Hey, I'm Leo

[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.500]
Yes, sir

[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:50.940]
I like you showing me you're doing a good job, I'm glad I'm listening

[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:51.600]
Yeah, sure

[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.640]
Can I hear the bridge then?

[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.720]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, here's Fort Myers, hello

[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.100]
Fort Myers

[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.420]
Yeah, Fort, oh hi, Neil, how are you doing?

[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:01.700]

[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:05.220]
Hey, listen, I know you guys got your problems over there in day counting

[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:13.760]
But I just got a chance to listen or read the newspaper over here today in the local section

[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.940]
They have a picture of a seven-tier old man being escorted handcuffed

[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:23.540]
And you will police car because he got busted in a sting operation for prostitution

[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:29.000]
And they got a list of all the names of all the people they got busted during this sting operation

[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.120]
There's nothing to about that, that's been going on in the state for a hundred years

[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.740]
I mean, police work here

[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:39.000]
And I happen to know their city and I'm telling you, Fort Myers down the road, they're selling crack, okay?

[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:39.400]
Yeah

[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:41.900]
So why are they wasting their time doing that?

[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.920]
Because it's like shooting fish in a barrel, that's why, because we live in a police state

[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.680]
How many times do I have to tell you that before you start catching on a little bit? It's a police state

[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.900]
Now, what are you going to do?

[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.380]
And to instigate that, you hear any more news about the prostitution we hear in Dave County and Miami?

[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.640]
About those cops?

[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:00.160]
Uh, no

[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.320]
No, and you won't

[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.120]
Okay, I have a great life

[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:03.560]
All right

[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.860]
Police state, baby, wake up and sniff it, and listen to the guy Dan Booth's stubborn for crying out loud before it's too late

[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.360]
What's wrong with you people?

[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:11.700]
Besides being cruel

[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.340]
Yeah, let's just go to the police to work again, okay?

[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:23.740]
There's a lot of wild penises out there and God knows what dangerous things they might be up to

You can do it!

[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.420]
Did you leave any mark?

[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:01.400]
Who's the rat?

[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:03.960]
How about you surprise?

[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.720]
I'm just gonna jump in 8000.

[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.400]
Or is it about 5000?

[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.680]
So let me ask you one thing.

[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.620]
Where is the...

[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:19.800]
27th of the noon at 560 WQM.

[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.020]
Happy Wednesday, the two of them.

[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.540]
The people here are crazy than in bedbugs.

[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.800]
But they're in that just the way we like it.

[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:24.440]
Who gives you crap?

[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.240]
Huh? We get paid.

[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.300]
560, 705, 60, 0.560 on the AT&T.

[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:34.300]
And Verizon Wireless Line out of townline 877-785-6345.

[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.240]
Mobile and Stewart, hello.

[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:37.120]
Hey, Neil.

[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:37.700]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.080]
How's that beefy stock?

[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:39.880]
A buy-cell?

[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.980]
Yeah, it's still hanging in there.

[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.560]
I'm from a rockster, by the way.

[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.500]
I heard you mentioned Kodak.

[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:45.880]
Right.

[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.620]
And you know, the local accounting up there, Kodak, Xerox, and Bosch and Lyme,

[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.400]
has been about a $38 billion paper loss in Monroe County alone this year.

[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:55.720]
Wow.

[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:56.620]
I mean, it's big.

[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:59.160]
I mean, in this, I don't know if you ever listened to Bob Brinker.

[01:17:59.680 --> 01:17:59.820]
No.

[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.040]
He was having an Elvis Guru.

[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.620]
It was about three weeks ago buying the Q's at 80 in the 80's.

[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.980]
Well, it gets to about a month and a half ago just before the election.

[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:09.960]
I mean, you imagine how those people feel.

[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.580]
I mean, they're looking at QQQ around what?

[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.480]
55 now?

[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:14.620]
No, I have no idea.

[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:15.640]
Going lower and lower.

[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.120]
But you're right about Greenspan.

[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:20.100]
I think you've still got a vendetta against George Bush senior.

[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.620]
And the little boy, Pawn, his shoulder on the news media the other day

[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.560]
didn't exactly help his statue, I don't think.

[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:32.140]
Well, I mean, if that's the case, if it's going to be an EAA pissing contest,

[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.700]
I mean, it really speaks well for the future of the World economy, doesn't it?

[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:40.620]
Yeah, well, I mean, let's face it, Greenspan does not want this tax cut.

[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.620]
He wants the...

[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.000]
You know something?

[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.380]
At this point, I think we need the tax cut.

[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:47.720]
Well, you're probably...

[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.780]
I agree with you now with this one.

[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:50.780]
That's the only way you're going to be able to stimulate the economy.

[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:53.440]
You get more money in the intercirculation is to have a tax cut.

[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.240]
I mean, look, it's a dumpster I'm telling you.

[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.340]
I mean, it's going nowhere.

[01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.320]
I had a quick question about...

[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.180]
The problem is that Alan Greenspan, it's like mentioning God.

[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:05.420]
You know, everybody has brainwashed it and believing that this man knows it all

[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.440]
and he never makes a mistake and believe me, he makes lots of mistakes, including this last year and a half.

[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.480]
Yeah, I heard this guy last night on CNN, he was...

[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.320]
One of the talking had some programs.

[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:15.740]
He was talking how...

[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.440]
He was saying how...

[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.840]
And he's on the economic council, I guess, for Bush.

[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.900]
He was basically bad-mouthing Greenspan.

[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:25.400]
He says, how could this guy not give us a rate decrease yesterday?

[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.620]
He said he does not understand it at all.

[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.260]
And he was...

[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:33.680]
He was like, you know, I don't know if he's the mouthpiece for Bush, but he's one of the new administration people there.

[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:37.360]
Well, they had former Fed governors who built on all the years today,

[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.160]
saying essentially the same thing that if they were still in there,

[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.620]
that they definitely would have cut the rates.

[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.580]
It had to be done.

[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.660]
Well, that's the other thing this guy's saying.

[01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:49.140]
He's saying that they need a whole replacement country wide with all these Fed regulators

[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.820]
with people that sit around their table.

[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.800]
But, hey, I had a question.

[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.440]
I do follow the Panthers a little bit.

[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.300]
I know they kind of stink this year.

[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.520]
What do you mean they kind of stink?

[01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.960]
I mean, I can't believe that the year they had last year,

[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.840]
which, you know, I thought it was a big mistake when they got rid of Vernon,

[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.280]
because I kind of thought that he kind of gave that to him.

[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.720]
What is happening is not the problem.

[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:10.220]
Goldpending is not the problem.

[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:10.840]
What is approaching, too?

[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.860]
I never liked Murray's.

[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.720]
I never liked either one.

[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.980]
Coaching is the problem, but lack of talent.

[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.520]
I keep telling people that lack of talent and bad trades.

[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.740]
Here's another being deal.

[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:22.800]
They went out and traded for Anders Erickson from the Blackhawks,

[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:25.540]
who's another one of Brian Murray's earlier mistakes with Detroit.

[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.200]
He keeps going back to the same Igor Larry on off.

[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.340]
Oh, we want to send it back now.

[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:30.600]
Let's get rid of Meeta's want to go.

[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.460]
Erickson Erickson, another mistake.

[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.500]
Again, you know, I am lucky stuck record.

[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.660]
The public, the so-called fan, the long-suffering fans,

[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.860]
were supposed to sit back and dummy up until Wayne makes the deal to sell the team.

[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.780]
There's no point in discussing any of it,

[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:47.520]
because until he sells the team, no changes will be made.

[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.080]
Well, the first thing they should do is...

[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.960]
They play 32 games and they've won six,

[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.760]
and these people still have their jobs.

[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.740]
Well, the first thing they should do, Neil, is bring Ted Nolan into coaching.

[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.640]
Ted Nolan isn't coming here, sir.

[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.500]
He's blackballed in the NHL. He's not coming here.

[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.220]
Yeah, but with your influence, I feel...

[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:06.380]
Sure, he is not coming here with my influence, right?

[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:09.900]
You'll notice how fast I got the Murray's out of here with my influence.

[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.880]
Well, what is wrong with you people?

[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.800]
Are you in some kind of a dream or in with my influence?

[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:18.600]
I got two calls on the board here. I got so much influence.

[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.760]
And probably both of those are retards. That's where the influence I got.

[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:25.260]
What kind of planet are you living on with my influence?

[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:26.840]
God!

[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:34.440]
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, I would have called him sick if I knew this was going on today.

[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:35.120]
This is special.

[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.740]
And then that crazy person in sales...

[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.400]
I'm telling you right now, he did write that letter.

[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.840]
There is no doubt. The fact that he came in here again with another one of these letters this morning

[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.020]
and handed to me like, oh, I think that's what I really want to wrote.

[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.400]
And I say, that's a happy holiday to have you on the check.

[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:51.940]
What's that organ?

[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.480]
Stay out of here, Peter.

[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.300]
Stay away. Stay far away.

[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.980]
560560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.000]
And Verizon wireless line.

[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:07.820]
Here's a mobile and steward. Hello.

[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:09.400]
Neil, how are you doing?

[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.000]
OK, sir.

[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:14.560]
Just giving you a call to Plac Conaca, Mississippi.

[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:16.640]
Have you ever been there?

[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:17.660]
I'm not going to Mississippi.

[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.820]
Well, that's basically Memphis. It's a real city.

[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.200]
It's a real what?

[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:25.460]
It's a real city.

[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.520]
It's got 21 casinos now.

[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.480]
And it does have Las Vegas style gambling all the way.

[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:38.560]
That better odds and everything that even Las Vegas, because the competition's so keen.

[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.380]
It's got the single deck blockjack.

[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.180]
It's got all the, like I'd ever casino.

[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:45.620]
Yeah, it's got NH.

[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.860]
And it treats you very well.

[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:52.260]
And you know, you don't have to be a giant fish just to get everything.

[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.440]
So, you know, that's not a bad place to go.

[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.360]
But also stock markets go up, stock markets go down.

[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:04.740]
You know, we all know that the Nasdaq would weigh over price.

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.380]
I mean, you're saying it yourself.

[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.700]
I mean, when they use...

[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:10.400]
No, no, we don't all know the Nasdaq was over well over.

[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.120]
But now we know.

[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:17.620]
But the fact is that back then, people including all these experts on CNBC were talking about the old economy and the new economy

[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:21.140]
and that these wildies, PEs that are 200 and 300.

[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:25.100]
It doesn't mean anything anymore because it's tremendous future of these companies and down the road.

[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.480]
And it was all aligned.

[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:33.880]
Now, the same people around here this morning saying, well, you know, something we're never going to have 300 and 400 PEs again.

[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.820]
And all of a sudden, it was all a bubble and a little bit of a...

[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:39.220]
It was a once in a lifetime fathom buy.

[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:42.100]
There was. And if anybody sold into it, they did well.

[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:46.000]
And also, these people are making tremendous bonuses off the same thing.

[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:50.900]
So, you know, they can't go on and say things are bad and kill their own bonus.

[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:53.580]
I mean, they're paid to do what they're paid to do.

[01:23:54.480 --> 01:24:01.420]
Even the CNBC people, if the people get discouraged about the stock market, you know, people won't be watching as well.

[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.240]
You're right.

[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.180]
They'll be laying off there.

[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:03.680]
You're right.

[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.080]
You know, it's all like a big show.

[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.380]
It's like a big side show.

[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:07.980]
Exactly.

[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:12.820]
I mean, the people that invested in the Amazon.com, it's 200 hours a share of, you've got to...

[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:13.760]
17 bucks.

[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:14.980]
17 bucks.

[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:15.720]
Right.

[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.660]
Reserve what they got.

[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.820]
Yahoo! It's 300.

[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:18.280]
Yeah.

[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:19.180]
Reserve what they got.

[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.100]
Bunch of Yahoo's.

[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.400]
Yeah, bunch of Yahoo's.

[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.600]
Okay. Good luck to us, pal.

[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.160]
Okay.

[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:23.880]
That's the holiday.

[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:25.900]
And same to you. Let me tell you some Xerox.

[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:26.760]
How about some shipwrecks?

[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:28.500]
5, 6, 7.

[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:29.880]
How about some dish TV, huh?

[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:30.500]
Whoo!

[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:31.900]
I hear it's going up to 400.

[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.380]
I just made that up.

[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:37.800]
Well, hey, I can make it up if my stockbroker you can do what I can't buy.

[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.120]
This is 560 QAF.

[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.220]
A very fit would say.

[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.440]
Take it up your ass.

[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.240]
They're funky.

[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:48.780]
They're old.

[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:51.340]
They're the California proof.

[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:55.240]
So then you're getting old and clean.

[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.360]
And your time's to pay your head every day.

[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.820]
Give us a new lease.

[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.300]
And that's the show.

[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.460]
And so for you, we got the cure.

[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.080]
Just eat some of us.

[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.740]
Eat us every day.

[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.700]
And there's lots of your class away.

[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:19.100]
Don't you want the thing called underpaste?

[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.160]
Let our music stop wasting.

[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.660]
X-Lax is nice, but it's on white fast.

[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:30.120]
Just eat some food.

[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.960]
We'll have real plans.

[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:34.300]
Under the party, yes.

[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.420]
Under the party, you can eat a store of money.

[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.100]
Hey!

[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.400]
I'm your daughter.

[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:43.240]
California proof.

[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:45.080]
What a way to go.

[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.880]
It's 4.43.05.50 WDQ.A.M.

[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.260]
Here's Marguerite.

[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:50.420]
Hello.

[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:51.580]
Yeah, good afternoon, Neil.

[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.020]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:55.460]
You know, I'm talking about Alan Greenspan and interest rates.

[01:25:55.460 --> 01:26:01.480]
This is a formula, I believe, that with tax cuts and low interest rates,

[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.560]
the public has more money to spend.

[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.620]
The economy heats up.

[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.240]
Price is rise.

[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.420]
Death's rise.

[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:10.760]
And you have a recession.

[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.680]
And that's exactly what's happening.

[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.240]
Greenspan is a little bit behind.

[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.000]
Have you been...

[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.200]
A little bit behind?

[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:19.580]
Yeah.

[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.300]
What about a month's rate?

[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:24.380]
He should have raised interest rates in one time.

[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:25.980]
He should have raised him a long time ago?

[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:26.480]
Yes.

[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.660]
Because if you look at the prices, you...

[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:30.920]
So what are you talking about?

[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.720]
He should have raised interest rates all along.

[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.920]
They've been raising interest rates all year.

[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.180]
They've been raising interest rates.

[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.040]
What are you talking about?

[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.720]
They'll have to go further up because...

[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.200]
Sir, you're out of your mind.

[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.440]
You're a crazy person.

[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:44.560]
You're a lunatic.

[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.080]
Don't be calling it on some talk show just because you have a mouth

[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.460]
and you can make words come out of your mouth.

[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.340]
I know less about the God and the economy and about the market

[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.940]
than probably anybody in the world, but I still am more than you do,

[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:57.200]
which isn't saying much.

[01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:59.960]
He needs to raise interest rates.

[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:00.860]
Right.

[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.200]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.140]
Blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub.

[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.360]
Verizon Wireless Lines.

[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:15.280]
4,000 open lines, just will...

[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.060]
Just open and waiting for your prespicacious comments.

[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:21.200]
And happy holidays from all your friends at QAM.

[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.040]
Here's a mobile in Wellington.

[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:24.380]
Hello.

[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:25.740]
Hey, what's up there, Neil?

[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:26.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.300]
How's the grocery's near?

[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.380]
Fine. No problems.

[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:29.140]
That's good.

[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.780]
Minor point, like you call.

[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:32.800]
What's that?

[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.080]
I said, until I last call.

[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:38.260]
And actually Hank was right about the gap.

[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.100]
It's kind of a good stuff.

[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.220]
Minor point before I talk about the panthers,

[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:44.440]
but you still need a haircut place in Plantation?

[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:44.940]
Yes.

[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:45.760]
Okay.

[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:47.180]
I need Robert so bad right now.

[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:48.280]
I'm going to shave it all off.

[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:49.480]
I'm.

[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.320]
Robert's Farbershop, 2692 North University.

[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:54.760]
I have to ask.

[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:55.980]
2692 is where?

[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.260]
Right in sunrise.

[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.840]
But it sits on the Bourbon Plantation.

[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.280]
In sunrise, like, give me a street.

[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.160]
Like a cross street?

[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.640]
Gosh, it's...

[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.940]
North University is actually right near commercial.

[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:08.540]
Okay.

[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.020]
Cross street.

[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.120]
Good place.

[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.520]
Now, you are right on about the panthers.

[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:15.580]
And I went, I go to maybe three, four games.

[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:16.560]
But when I...

[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.200]
Did you go to the game against the Red Wings?

[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.100]
I was like a damn morgue.

[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:20.380]
Sure.

[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:24.240]
At least 75% of the crowd was recruiting for the Red Wings.

[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.240]
Well, sounded like that.

[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.200]
There were about three, four thousand Red Wings fans in there.

[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:30.820]
And all I could think about is without a question that coaching is pathetic,

[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.340]
there's no enthusiasm.

[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:36.420]
But why the hell that game didn't someone start a fight for the panthers?

[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:37.980]
At least get the crowd into it.

[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.160]
And at that...

[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.480]
No, why do you say that start a fight for the pan?

[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:42.040]
Why do you...

[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.860]
Wait, what is that going to accomplish?

[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.500]
You know, you're right.

[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.500]
What is that going to accomplish?

[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:50.120]
I think we did have three fights in that game and it accomplished absolute.

[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:52.420]
Was either that game or the one just before the...

[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.080]
I mean, they all blended together at this point.

[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:55.300]
There was one of the games...

[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.120]
I think it was the one just before that, maybe Carolina.

[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.080]
And they had three fights and brawled.

[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.500]
It didn't accomplish anything.

[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:02.600]
But, well, more importantly...

[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.800]
What's the object of that?

[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.360]
Is that what you can't go see if the guys fight in a hockey game?

[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:12.180]
Well, more importantly, it's the coaching that there's no...

[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.960]
But why did you just make that comment?

[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:17.620]
I said that because in that particular game, you're right.

[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.620]
The fighting doesn't accomplish anything.

[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:22.740]
But in that game, to me, the guys showed like they don't care.

[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.740]
And sometimes I know team will do this.

[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.500]
At least they'll start a scrap.

[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.940]
I just got you saying, and you agreed with me.

[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:34.620]
The game just before that, it was either Carolina or whoever it was, I know they lost.

[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:39.160]
And they had three fights and everybody thought everybody said that the big spouts

[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.740]
that was fighting and Mel and B was fighting.

[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.880]
And it was the Islander game, as a matter of fact, because it was the game where...

[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:48.340]
Well, we're all got in two fights with Charla and Mel and B went after Kevin Haller

[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.640]
because he was taking a shot at Brey.

[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.620]
It was the Islander game.

[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.100]
It didn't accomplish a damn thing.

[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:53.400]
And they still got their asses kicked.

[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.900]
Don't you people understand this team suffers from a lack of talent?

[01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.300]
Yes, the coaching is bad.

[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.740]
And the general manager is making one bad deal after another because...

[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.520]
And that's the reason that the roster is so thin.

[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.420]
This team doesn't have it. Don't you guys get it?

[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.200]
I'll leave you the thought of it.

[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.380]
Brey and Whitney and who else?

[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:14.460]
Who else? Maybe once in a while Mike Sunder?

[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.840]
Who else is going to scroll for this team?

[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:20.060]
I'll just leave you with this thought and you obviously know this.

[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.480]
But look at it seem like the devil.

[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:25.180]
Why they good year in year out? They start from the minor league systems.

[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.640]
They work their way up.

[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:28.260]
You look at any good team.

[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.480]
I look at my Leafs, the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.160]
They've got so many outstanding young players.

[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.200]
Somebody gets hurt. They bring up a Nathan Demsie or the young Peter...

[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.620]
What's his name? The defenseman.

[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:39.060]
They've got so many of those guys.

[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.420]
There's like a limitless number of guys that they can bring up.

[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.400]
Jeff Farkis and the playoffs when they hit injuries.

[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.260]
The Panthers, they bring up the youngsters for me organization.

[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.800]
And they all think and in a week or two they're all backed out into minor leagues again because they can't cut it.

[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:54.220]
Well, at least we have a new back.

[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.560]
I can't wait to at least see him.

[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:56.040]
I think in the end.

[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:57.200]
Yeah, he don't play for us.

[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:57.760]
I know.

[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.640]
Last time I checked.

[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.040]
Okay, I have a great day pal.

[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:00.720]
You too, Neil.

[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.140]
Peter's for Boulder, the young one.

[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.100]
How you doing Peter?

[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.720]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Marvellous Line.

[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:11.080]
But let's start a fight.

[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:11.520]
Come on.

[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.620]
Why do people say this crap?

[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:17.380]
Why do they say things that just on the face of them are so apparently absurd?

[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.240]
It's what they want.

[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:18.800]
Oh.

[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:20.740]
Come on Peter.

[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:23.600]
Oh, can this be the same old crew and court-cape Coral?

[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:23.840]
Hello.

[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.040]
Hi Neil. How you doing?

[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:25.660]
Happy holidays.

[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:26.280]
Yes sir.

[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.060]
I might start to fall on to the shoot too.

[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:36.380]
And yesterday on TV I see George Bush entertain and Greenspan there for a few minutes.

[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.440]
Do you know what William was he doing at dance?

[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.400]
Yeah, he must have been.

[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:41.480]
He's going to need to do more than a dance.

[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:41.940]
Yeah.

[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:53.700]
He's going to need to do an alcohol steam on him because truthfully, I think Greenspan was a little past off when Bush kind of held him by the arm there and kind of made him pose in front of the camera.

[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.680]
Oh, sir, please.

[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.760]
You got some whining noise in the background there.

[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:01.840]
And again, the stuff that's coming out of your mouth is worse than the guy that said he needed to raise interest rates.

[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.740]
You know, what's the point of talking to these people?

[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:11.140]
Harvey from Hell says that I got the most varied colors in the world.

[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:13.700]
I got the worst colors of any talk show in history of radio.

[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.520]
The show is great.

[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:16.340]
The calls, bro.

[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:19.040]
Imagine how good the show would be if we had calls in it any sense.

[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.960]
Maybe that's why the show is great because the colors are so inane.

[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.640]
How is it possible to be so full of crap?

[01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:30.220]
Bush held him by the arm there for the deployments.

[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:33.720]
The only reason he put his arm on for seconds is because they wanted to take a picture, okay?

[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:34.400]
You idiot.

[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:43.380]
And I don't like Bush any better than you, but for crying out loud, if this is what we're going to get for four years, is that every time he farts the wrong flavor, you're going to be making an attack on it.

[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.720]
What kind of an American are you?

[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.440]
See, these are people already got him set up hoping that he fails.

[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:54.120]
See, we tell you so, you people are assholes that hope that the president fails just because you didn't support him.

[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.640]
That's real Americanism.

[01:32:56.420 --> 01:33:00.880]
That's called being a political asshole is what that's called, which is what you are, sir.

[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.480]
The whole economy of the world is hinging on what the Fed is going to do.

[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.160]
And because George Bush put his hand on Alan Greenspan's shoulder, we're supposed to believe that that pissed him off.

[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:11.700]
And therefore he's sticking it to us now.

[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.180]
That's why they didn't cut interest rates.

[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:16.160]
Oh my God.

[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:18.940]
And let me say it again.

[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.280]
This is what's out there, Florida.

[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:22.300]
This is what's there.

[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:24.560]
This is what's driving all around you in the highways.

[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.640]
This is what's fighting you in the supermarkets and the stores.

[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:31.900]
This is what's out there.

[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:36.620]
This is what just created this nightmare in the election.

[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.500]
Florida, this gigantic big oozing penis, you know.

[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:47.580]
Here's a mobile in Bokeh, hello.

[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.140]
Hello, Neil. How are you?

[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:49.540]
Okay.

[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:54.540]
Let me apologize if I can for the calls, which I know I can't apologize for.

[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:56.060]
I'm more than I am.

[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:57.180]
These are crazy people.

[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.360]
These are dumb people.

[01:33:58.660 --> 01:33:59.920]
These are, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're people.

[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.460]
I know that last guy is just amazing.

[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:09.360]
You know, you need to stand behind your president, no matter if you agree with him or not, because, you know, united, you stand.

[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.960]
The divide you're going to fall for.

[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.440]
I have a first song.

[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.680]
Yeah, I have three quick points.

[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:15.840]
Alan Green is on.

[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:17.800]
The man is a complete idiot.

[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:23.220]
Nobody, the problem with it, people listen to the man and they shouldn't.

[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:24.560]
They should really just be...

[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:27.360]
I don't think he's a complete idiot now because he's made some mistakes.

[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.220]
I mean, I'm not going to go from one extreme to the other.

[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.100]
But the fact is he's not infallible.

[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:32.100]
He's not perfect.

[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.120]
He's not some kind of a financial maven.

[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.120]
He makes mistakes.

[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:46.240]
And he blew it yesterday and we're paying a wicked price for it, because even if they did cut interest rates yesterday, it takes months before it kicks in, before money starts loosening up again, and before the economy starts turning around and back.

[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:46.560]

[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:49.380]
Definitely. And all four of the tax cuts.

[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:53.460]
If anything's going to stimulate this economy now, we need a major tax cut.

[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:57.820]
And like you said, to get money back into the, you know, the financial community.

[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:01.680]
That's no one's going to see saving this crap.

[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:07.600]
Also, that security guard yesterday, I just want to say, I know you got some scumbags that listen to show.

[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.740]
He died. The guy that was shot for Dunbar security.

[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.960]
And I was just going to say, why don't you...

[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:17.140]
Some of you scumbags take the holidays off and maybe not kill someone for Christmas.

[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:18.940]
And I'm at an outlaw leave you.

[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.040]
Thank you very much.

[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:24.980]
What?

[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.180]
5.670560, £560 on the AT&T.

[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:32.860]
And for what? Well, he apologized before he started talking.

[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:39.000]
The Dow is now 122 in the NASDAQ's, so on the 120. They're kind of like converting now. They're like both want to get on the same, you know.

[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.120]
So they can both go down about 300 today.

[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:42.340]
Nice evening numbers.

[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:47.360]
See, it'll be good like when the Dow gets down to about 500 in the NASDAQ down to about 70 points.

[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.340]
Because like I told you the other day, it's much easier when the numbers are smaller.

[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:52.640]
It's much easier to finger it out.

[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.800]
Here's a mobile and open park. Hello?

[01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.140]
Hi Neil. How are you?

[01:35:59.160 --> 01:35:59.780]
Yes sir. Great.

[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.920]
Well, first of all, let's recap here for a second.

[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:07.920]
One guy says that green's band didn't cut interest rates because George pushed his hand on him.

[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:08.180]
Right.

[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:10.680]
One guy wants him to raise interest rates.

[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.400]
Right. One guy wants Peter War out and fight.

[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:15.780]
Right. Or anybody wants to come in and go out and fight.

[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:17.820]
You don't have to show a bunch of more. I'm calling you.

[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.920]
Yeah. I mean, this is a cycle bunch.

[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.620]
It's a holiday. It's a special bunch.

[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:25.180]
God, I'm mighty. Let me just ask that person.

[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:29.140]
You don't have to tell me. I'm sitting here, you know, the phone is open for anybody and everybody.

[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.720]
That's the best part of the deal. And this is the best we can do. What does that tell about this thing?

[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:33.160]
I'm not unbelievable.

[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:34.820]
With our gigantic audience out there.

[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.460]
Can I go to hockey just for one second?

[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:38.240]
Cockey, yeah.

[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:39.560]
Hockey, not hockey.

[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.800]
You are a big advocate for the panthers. You are a big fan of the panthers.

[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:44.900]
I'm a big fan of the panthers.

[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.680]
I refuse to go to the games because the product they have on the field.

[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.480]
I get free tickets. I guess so I go whenever I feel like it.

[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:52.140]
Like tonight I'm going because I want to see the penguins.

[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:58.480]
Okay. I'm just trying to figure out why people are still spending the $100 for the center court seat

[01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.700]
or whatever they call down there at the I.

[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:00.320]
Center court?

[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.920]
Well, you know, center I used to go down and watch the other.

[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.660]
They are not. In case you haven't noticed lately, the crowds keep getting smaller and smaller.

[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:09.880]
Except on the weekend they go because they already got the tickets and it's something to do.

[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:12.420]
But the weeknight games, it's desperate. It's deadly.

[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.560]
What are they throwing?

[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.520]
How much are they going for?

[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:18.280]
No, what kind of a crowd is showing up?

[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.120]
I would say most games about 9,000, 10,000.

[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.100]
And weekend games we get.

[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.340]
We did actually have 15,000 for the Colorado Avalanche game.

[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.620]
I mean, it said 15 in the paper.

[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.460]
And I would say that was the only time it's actually been a real number.

[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:30.500]
That was a pretty good crowd.

[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.300]
And I get people credit for that.

[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.600]
Well, you know, it's easy to say people, there are a lot of people who are hockey fans

[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.520]
who are hoping for the best or some people come out because they wanted to see the Avalanche

[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.540]
with all their superstars or like a lot of people come out because they want to see Yogrid tonight or Marty Strachow

[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.560]
or the various players on the penguins.

[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.740]
And when Mario comes back, people will come to see him.

[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.800]
But the fact is that as far as seeing what we got, there's not much.

[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.440]
Right, like people go see the heat.

[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:55.580]
You know, why are you going to cry?

[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:56.400]
They don't.

[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.840]
But they don't.

[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:58.820]
They aren't going.

[01:37:58.820 --> 01:37:59.720]
Don't you understand?

[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:00.340]
They're not going.

[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.660]
Most of the heat home games are played in front of 9 and 10,000 people.

[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.780]
Well, that's 10,000, still 10,000 idiots that are going down the waste of money for a product that's not going to be sold.

[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:11.760]
But you don't understand some people have already spent their money.

[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.020]
They've already spent their money.

[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:13.960]
They have the tickets.

[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:15.820]
I don't know.

[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:16.160]
Thank you.

[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.760]
I guess that's a good answer.

[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:26.040]
If people buy season tickets and they've already made the investment, it's very easy for you to say,

[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.060]
well, you shouldn't go.

[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:28.720]
But they've already made the investment.

[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.500]
Right, so they got the food and didn't even get tickets.

[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:34.300]
Well, they go hoping that maybe they'll get entertained.

[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.280]
I mean, they spent the money.

[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:36.440]
Might as well get something for it.

[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.020]
Hope for the best.

[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:38.980]
Or maybe they'll just the other team will be exciting.

[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:41.160]
I guess that's the best we can hope for.

[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:42.280]
The only joy you're there.

[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:42.800]
I love you, Sean.

[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:43.140]
Okay.

[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:47.000]
Man, everybody in this town, what am I getting excited about?

[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:48.140]
It's so negative.

[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.140]
So goddamn negative.

[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.100]
I'm going to go tonight.

[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:52.640]
I don't expect the panthers to be spectacular tonight.

[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.900]
But I want to go see you, Agar Plain.

[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.200]
I want to go see the game.

[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.780]
Plus, it's boring as hell here anyway.

[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.140]
If this wasn't one of the most boring places on a face of the earth, there probably wouldn't be 50 people there.

[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.220]
With a kind of crap that they're putting out there.

[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:10.100]
But this man is so agitated and so frustrated that people are showing up.

[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.720]
And I just don't get it.

[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:12.340]
Why?

[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:12.980]
Why?

[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.020]
Why does that bother you so much?

[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:18.340]
Great facts.

[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:20.800]
In 1555, most of the autonomous wrote,

[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:25.040]
come to Millennium, month 12, and the home of the greatest power.

[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.060]
The village idiot will come forth to be acclaimed the leader.

[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:40.220]
This is 560 QAF, 430-560 WQAM by heavy port Lauderdale, a beastly broadcast group station at WQAM.com, or the world.

[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:42.500]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:42.800]
Yes.

[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.180]
There's no cheese or light for Hanukkah.

[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:51.680]
Go down the flat, the houses are darker.

[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:52.840]
We are Christian.

[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:56.160]
We were Christian on the source of our attention.

[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.940]
For eight nights we light life when the center be committed in life.

[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:05.280]
All we can do is light is a minority of Benchikris, Benchikris and Zintz and Zorva.

[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.800]
Our holiday is really such a porous life.

[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:09.640]
It doesn't know the point.

[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:14.500]
All we can do light is a minority of Benchikris, Benchikris and Zintz and Zorva.

[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:17.480]
Our holiday is really such a porous life.

[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.300]
It's so hot for us to go shopping.

[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.760]
We don't know when Hanukkah is happening.

[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:26.120]
What is the date? Are we too late?

[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:27.820]
You can normal-cute and go.

[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:30.540]
Now come on.

[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.080]
What are we supposed to do?

[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.660]
So your thinking seems easy to get.

[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:35.520]
Yes, when we only pay wholesale.

[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:42.000]
All we get to light is a minority of Benchikris and Zintz and Zorva.

[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.980]
Our holiday is really such a porous life.

[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.240]
It doesn't know the point.

[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.180]
All we get to light is a minority of Benchikris and Zintz and Zorva.

[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:54.260]
Our holiday is really such a porous life.

[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:55.480]
It doesn't know the point.

[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:58.540]
Yes, that Alan Greenspan would just raise interest rates one more time.

[01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.840]
Two more times.

[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.000]
Then we could all kill ourselves.

[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.840]
That guy was just a crazy person.

[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:08.820]
Well, the wash-out is single him out.

[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.600]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:11.580]
Hello.

[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.360]
I'm a new fan of the show.

[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:18.340]
See, every time you guys call it the same thing, I'm a new fan.

[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.500]
I never called before.

[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:21.400]
You three little boyfriends out there.

[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.400]
Why not for the holidays?

[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:23.480]
Do them another thing.

[01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:24.900]
You can be the candle in the middle.

[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:26.680]
Stick a candle in your rectum.

[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.520]
Light it on fire with a torch.

[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.480]
Here's a mobile in Hialeah.

[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:31.720]
Hello.

[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:32.700]
Hey, Neil.

[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.540]
Talking about the ignorance of self-floor is what got it to the results of the last lecture.

[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.140]
That is not just got us to the results.

[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:41.340]
The entire world of the results.

[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:41.640]
Yes.

[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:42.720]
Well, yeah.

[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:47.060]
But the Democratic Party is always counted on the ignorance of its constituency.

[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:50.620]
Sir, please don't give me a song of the dance about it's a party thing.

[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.180]
There are plenty of dumb Republicans too.

[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:53.860]
Oh, plenty of dumb Republicans.

[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.380]
So stop with the stupid partisan politics.

[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.140]
If you don't have a conversation.

[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.380]
The Democratic Party is the one that's complete.

[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:03.380]
56670560.560 on the 18T.

[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:06.980]
And Verizon and wireless LAN, a happy holidays to you, too, sir.

[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.460]
I wonder which party had the Dumber candidate.

[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:10.680]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:12.760]
Here's a mobile in Haleah.

[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.260]
Hey, Neil.

[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.000]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.620]
Listen, first of all, happy holidays.

[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:17.960]
Sure.

[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.980]
I don't claim to be an economist or anything.

[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:27.000]
But it seems to me that when people buy stocks and the stock goes down,

[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:33.080]
the only one who's loses the guy that played the game, that somebody, you know, that money goes somewhere.

[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:34.520]
It doesn't disappear.

[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.380]
It doesn't vanish.

[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:39.060]
It's not like put the money in the machine and it gets burned up or something.

[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.440]
Somebody's profiting when someone else is losing, right?

[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.700]
And then that would happen?

[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:45.520]
Not necessarily.

[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.360]
The money's just coming out of the market.

[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:48.980]
Where does it go?

[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:50.140]
It's got to go somewhere.

[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:53.040]
It can go into bonds.

[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.220]
It can go on the sidelines.

[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.720]
It can go, who knows?

[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.780]
But it's not in that stock anymore.

[01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.960]
It's gone somewhere else.

[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:03.160]
But it's still somewhere and somebody's got it.

[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:04.520]
So somebody can get it.

[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:06.020]
It doesn't disappear.

[01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:08.020]
So what does that mean?

[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:11.220]
The point is, I'm a limo driver.

[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:12.200]
I'm not an economist.

[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:14.380]
But it seems to me that the economy is lowering.

[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:17.180]
People have more money than I've ever seen before.

[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.220]
I'm absolutely wrong.

[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.760]
Just ask the people in retail.

[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.780]
I'll tell you that you're absolutely, you couldn't be adding further wrong if you tried.

[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.220]
What I know is retail.

[01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:26.100]
I catch them coming from the airport.

[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:27.440]
There's more people traveling.

[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.460]
What you do is not retail.

[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:33.200]
Retail means you have a business.

[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.040]
You have a store.

[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.240]
You open the door in the morning and people come in and you have a cash register.

[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:37.980]
That's retail.

[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:39.660]
And retail is way off.

[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:42.040]
And at this time of the year, that's a bad bad omen.

[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:45.760]
But there's never been more traffic through the airports than there is right now.

[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.020]
So what does that mean?

[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:52.820]
So it means the economy can't be that bad if that many people are spending that much money on airlines and levels.

[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:55.940]
Well, maybe they're spending on airlines and limos but they're not spending it on merchandise.

[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.800]
So that's one sector.

[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.260]
I don't think the economy is that bad.

[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.540]
But then again, I'm not an expert.

[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.780]
I'm just telling you what I see.

[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.520]
Well, I'm glad you're doing good and have a good holiday.

[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:06.480]
Oh, boy.

[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:09.740]
That's like my mother.

[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:11.140]
The world according to Millie, you know.

[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:15.040]
The sound is in her toilet, so it must be sounding like that and toilets all over the world.

[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:17.720]
What's her show on tomorrow?

[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:20.580]
About two or two 15.

[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:27.080]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.220]
We're getting some real good lessons in economics here today, aren't we?

[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:31.500]
Oh, yeah.

[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:34.740]
Economy is booming.

[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:36.420]
People have got more money than ever before.

[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:37.140]
And that money.

[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.580]
Well, maybe the money's coming out of the market and they're all getting on plane trips and giving it to limo drivers.

[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:41.400]
That must be where it's going.

[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.580]
He answered his own question.

[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:45.560]
Here's Surfside.

[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:45.840]
Hello.

[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:47.600]
I didn't know.

[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.080]
I'm Jerry over here.

[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:50.580]
Listen, I want to know.

[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:53.240]
Here, we don't do names on this show, but that's okay, Jerry.

[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:54.060]
Just don't say it again.

[01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:54.840]
Okay.

[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:57.740]
Well, listen, who's coming up with these numbers?

[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:00.020]
They're talking about a tax cut.

[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:03.360]
You're going to get everybody a tax cut when it gets into the office.

[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:07.580]
And now he goes to Washington DC president Clinton and the whole Congress tells him,

[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:08.820]
you can't cut taxes.

[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.620]
You have to take it a little bit at a time.

[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:15.520]
I'm going to tell you right now, who comes up with these numbers?

[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:18.660]
I mean, it's like the numbers with what number before he went to DC.

[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:19.580]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:20.280]
Come up with what numbers?

[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:24.680]
Well, what I mean is, is they say the numbers don't work if he cuts taxes.

[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:25.460]
Surfside.

[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:26.920]
Let me say something to you.

[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:29.120]
He's not even an office yet, okay?

[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:29.760]
Yeah, all right.

[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.540]
If you'd like to blame what's happening with the economy on him right now, I'm afraid you're a little bit premature.

[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.600]
He doesn't take office until January 20th.

[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:37.460]
It's a month away.

[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:38.180]
Yes.

[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.220]
I'm not blaming him.

[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:40.780]
I like that, you have a tax cut.

[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.440]
Even if I don't know the numbers.

[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:46.480]
But what I'm saying is, the whole thing is drawn up on paper.

[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:47.040]
It looks great.

[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:50.040]
Now he goes to Washington DC and everybody's telling him the numbers don't work.

[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:51.220]
I don't like that.

[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:55.360]
I think there would be subjected to subterfuging, by these people,

[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:59.340]
or they're going to spend all this money on secret bases on the moon or Mars or something.

[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.300]
I mean, it's like anything, the whole economy is right out the open where you can see it.

[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.300]
And now he's being told by the government.

[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:08.280]
You got to prepare that overnight when I'd overnight show that it's...

[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:08.800]
Art Bell.

[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:09.360]
Art Bell.

[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:11.080]
Say hi to Art Bell, sir.

[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.960]
And George has put on his dark sunglasses.

[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.520]
If I had any, I'd put them on right now, too.

[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.300]
I think we need to turn the lights out.

[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:20.560]
I'm going to do the rest of the show under the counter today.

[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:23.140]
I'm getting under the table and doing a show down here.

[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:29.080]
We have secret military bases on the moon.

[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.380]
Shh, there's secret.

[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.600]
And we might even be building some on Uranus, too.

[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:34.780]
You better take a look, okay?

[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.620]
You thought it was just like a cobbunkle.

[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:38.460]
It might be a goddamn military base.

[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:42.660]
You know, we can listen to them through the radio.

[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.580]
You know why I think that they're going to be building one?

[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:45.300]
Talk of all of them.

[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.120]
Yeah, that's coming next.

[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.360]
Here's a mobile and pepper pine, shallow.

[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.040]
Neil, that's a little premature speculation for you.

[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:58.060]
Hey, I just wanted to tell you, I think the best thing for you to do in the market nowadays

[01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:02.360]
is take all your money out, take mid-church to Las Vegas and have a great time.

[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:02.820]
Uh-huh.

[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.120]
Have a happy holiday.

[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:05.000]
Okay, I'm back to you.

[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:10.580]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the 18 and 2, and Verizon Wireless One.

[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:12.780]
See what you can understand, sir, is I haven't lost a dime.

[01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:14.580]
I haven't lost a penny.

[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.600]
In fact, I made money.

[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:20.880]
I had to take losses on one fund just so that I could balance out the money that I made.

[01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:21.540]
How do you like that?

[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.460]
On paper, I'm getting killed.

[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:24.740]
Am I worried about it?

[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.360]
Not me.

[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:27.120]
I'm not happy about it.

[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.180]
Am I peeing in my pants?

[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:28.940]
Am I panicking?

[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:29.560]
No, I'm not.

[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.360]
This is not a fact I'm buying more.

[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.920]
And when it gets all done, I mean, every stock is a dollar.

[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:37.200]
My income isn't going to change.

[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.560]
I'm going to buy a whole bunch more.

[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.260]
I'm going to go up to $2, at least $1.00 then.

[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:42.860]
What do you say, George?

[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:44.260]
Buy with both hands.

[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:45.260]
Okay.

[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:46.200]
And you know what stock?

[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:47.540]
I like, you know what's a nice good number?

[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.920]
I don't want to mention those stocks in particular.

[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.040]
In fact, Bruce Beasley said that before he left the update.

[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:57.280]
He said, you know, speaking of this market stuff, I don't want to put any pressure on you.

[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:00.840]
And I'm not going to give you the name of the stock, but there's one stock going for a...

[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:03.620]
One million pounds for needle robes in the years out.

[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:04.320]
Yeah, for about that.

[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.160]
I said, I don't think so, Bruce.

[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:09.240]
I said, if he gave me a bunch of it, maybe I'd consider it.

[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:10.760]
Why don't they just give me a whole bunch of stock?

[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:12.520]
Huh?

[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:14.700]
Like about 10,000 shares.

[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:16.320]
Then you'd have an incentive to be nice.

[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:17.620]
Like about 100,000 shares.

[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:21.900]
I have an incentive to like, you know, not take another six months off in Vegas over here.

[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:22.500]
That sounds good.

[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:23.660]
Let's do this show from Vegas.

[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:24.140]
What do you say?

[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:24.480]
Uh-huh.

[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:25.700]
Without my church.

[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:28.100]
How's that citrus coming, Rich?

[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:28.880]
And that dish TV?

[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:31.180]
Or should I just ask Jeaves?

[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.260]
Here's a mobile and Palm Beach, hello.

[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.880]
Yeah, anyway, I just turned in a little bit of go and here.

[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:41.860]
I heard some of the comments that you repeated that people made on the calls,

[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:44.060]
and I got on blind, you've been all right today.

[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:45.720]
But did I care about it?

[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:46.820]
I'm not talking about it.

[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.640]
I'm going to give you a great amount of that.

[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:51.420]
What they got is people spending more money that they don't have than ever before.

[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:51.780]
Uh-huh.

[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.900]
And to the guy who says he hopes Bush is wrong,

[01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:58.580]
look, I voted against Bush too, and you know, you've got to get the assignment.

[01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.460]
What are we going to do?

[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:02.320]
Cut our noses off the spotter faces, I'm hoping he failed.

[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:03.760]
I mean, how stupid is that?

[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:04.360]
Like you said.

[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:08.280]
But, you know, I wish he didn't have to be seeing.

[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:09.680]
I wish we could just hear him on the radio.

[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:12.620]
I mean, just the sight of him makes me sick because I did vote against him.

[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.800]
But he's there, and we got to hope for the best.

[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.240]
Yeah, you know, you know, you're on some stuff with brighter people than himself.

[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:19.240]
Talk about one, does the right thing.

[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.640]
Talk about one-dimensional people.

[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:22.040]
I just reached over here to get the facts.

[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:26.120]
And people are facts about the reconset they're doing.

[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.620]
I mean, why don't people let it go already?

[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.080]
It is nothing that's going to change.

[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:31.080]
Right, it's over.

[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:31.820]
I mean, he's in.

[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:33.180]
Let's stand behind him.

[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.020]
Hope he does well.

[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:34.980]
Wish him well.

[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:36.060]
Give him some good karma.

[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:37.060]
Give him some good vibes.

[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.700]
He's going to need to have four years.

[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.560]
And if we want to get through these four years, we're going to have to do it with him.

[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:43.420]
You know, we have a whole bunch of people out there.

[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.400]
Millions of them are afraid.

[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:45.920]
We just want to be pissed off for four years.

[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:47.140]
That's not going to accomplish anything.

[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:50.020]
I was pissed off, but I got over it because it's over.

[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.740]
I wanted to see it to go another way like you did.

[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.300]
But I got one take on the situation for what it's worth.

[01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:59.760]
You know, you always talk about it and you're right about what political pawns we are.

[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.760]
And Green Span is not an idiot.

[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:04.740]
Now, he didn't cut the rates yesterday and we're all staying.

[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:05.840]
How stupid could it be?

[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:06.880]
How could he make that mistake?

[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:07.980]
How stupid could he be?

[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:10.440]
But he's not that stupid.

[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:15.580]
The scenario since I totally believe we're manipulated politically at all times is,

[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.260]
how good does it look that if Green Span on the next go around,

[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.540]
cuts interest rates, after George Bush gets into office,

[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:26.260]
and perhaps has a conversation with him or some influence with him,

[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.400]
and everybody says, oh, look what George Bush did.

[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.700]
He got Green Span to cut rates.

[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.400]
Whereas if he did it at the end of the Clinton administration,

[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:33.560]
but you just kind of walked out of the world.

[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.340]
But he just got to have a breakfast with him two mornings ago.

[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.520]
And I'm sure that I had a cup of during the conversation

[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.460]
that Bush would have liked to have seen him cut away.

[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.600]
He doesn't want to come in in the middle of a brutal recession.

[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:46.220]
That's going to get deeper every minute that they don't do something.

[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.040]
That doesn't make any sense.

[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.640]
Yeah, but I just, you know, my feeling is it's just going to make Bush look better

[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:54.040]
if it happens when it comes under his administration.

[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.100]
And the fact that what's a couple of months,

[01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:59.540]
the people who were dying and getting crushed by it already?

[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:00.220]
Let me say it again.

[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:01.540]
It takes several months.

[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:05.640]
They're saying six to eight, nine months if they cut interest rates tomorrow.

[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.400]
You know, they're talking about how he's far behind the curve.

[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:09.700]
That's what they keep talking about.

[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:12.840]
He is far behind the curve because they were still raising rates

[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:15.460]
when they should have began to start lowering them months ago.

[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:19.580]
Yeah, but at the point that he makes the cut,

[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:22.700]
you're right, there's a time and element involved as to the effect of it.

[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:26.080]
But at the time he makes it, that's what I think the political football is.

[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:27.020]
Is it going to be now?

[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:28.480]
Well, it's going to be a bit more.

[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:31.920]
Well, if our livelihoods, and if our retirement money,

[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:34.460]
and if the economy, the whole world is based on what you say,

[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:36.360]
then we might as well all blow our brains out.

[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:37.840]
That's all I can tell you.

[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.460]
If it's all based on such raising politics is what you're telling me,

[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:42.500]
then there's no hope.

[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:45.640]
In addition to which, if he's so partisan,

[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.220]
and because he is a Republican, if he's so partisan for Bush,

[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:50.140]
how come we had eight years of such great prosperity

[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:51.800]
and such skyrocketing markets?

[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.760]
So, huh?

[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:56.360]
Just the coincidence, right?

[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.880]
That guy ought to be a stockbroker.

[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.520]
I know as you'll make China a new voice,

[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:09.000]
it's probably next afternoon at 560 WQM.

[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:14.000]
But Neil Rogers shows sports radio 560 WQM.

[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:17.060]
And now a public service announces.

[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:19.800]
It has the representative of the IACC,

[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:22.480]
the International Association of Colon Cowboys.

[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:27.360]
We ask the citizens across America to donate whatever you can

[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:31.200]
to start an alternative club to the Boy Scouts of America.

[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:33.920]
But pirates of the Caribbean will give young men

[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:37.000]
an opportunity to experience the fun and camaraderie

[01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:41.310]
of exciting outdoor activities such as sailing,

[01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:44.130]
camping, and my favorite, weenie roasting.

[01:52:44.610 --> 01:52:45.270]
Give them a chance.

[01:52:45.970 --> 01:52:46.750]
Give what you can.

[01:52:47.490 --> 01:52:48.030]
Thank you.

[01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:51.590]
1215, if I'm 60, people are facking me this stuff

[01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:52.770]
because they won't let go of it.

[01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:54.730]
And I agree with those people who say

[01:52:54.730 --> 01:52:56.190]
they shouldn't be doing these recounts.

[01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:58.330]
Because all it's going to do is get everybody crazy.

[01:52:59.210 --> 01:53:01.510]
The Orlando Sentinel conducts the first outside review

[01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:03.030]
to be completed in any Florida County

[01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:05.690]
since the US Supreme Court halted the statewide recount

[01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:06.590]
December 9th.

[01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:07.850]
The paper's findings,

[01:53:08.370 --> 01:53:10.630]
Gouraust and net 130 votes in Lake County,

[01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:12.970]
votes that were clearly his,

[01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:14.950]
even in the conservative GOP bastion,

[01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:17.210]
that Bush dominated as a whole.

[01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:20.990]
So in other words, he had 130 more votes than they counted.

[01:53:21.630 --> 01:53:24.570]
The Sentinel's review found that 376 discarded ballots

[01:53:24.570 --> 01:53:27.190]
in Lake County were clearly intended as votes for Gour.

[01:53:27.490 --> 01:53:29.910]
In each case, an overnext to his name was filled in with a pencil

[01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:32.830]
and the voter mistakenly filled in another overnext to a spot

[01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:34.150]
reserved for a right in candidates,

[01:53:34.150 --> 01:53:35.790]
writing in Gour's name or running mates,

[01:53:35.890 --> 01:53:37.030]
your leave of rooms there as well.

[01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:39.110]
Another 246 such ballots,

[01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:41.630]
so clear votes for Bush and running mate Dick Cheney were thrown out,

[01:53:41.970 --> 01:53:43.490]
had all such ballots been counted.

[01:53:43.630 --> 01:53:46.290]
The net game would have been 130 votes for Gour just in Lake County,

[01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:47.470]
a Republican in the county.

[01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:50.890]
So they're going to continue doing this all around the state

[01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:51.590]
and they're going to say,

[01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:52.730]
oh, you see the Harold was right,

[01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:54.810]
Gouraust should have won the state by 20,000 votes.

[01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:57.490]
Or whatever the number is.

[01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:59.490]
And then what?

[01:54:00.690 --> 01:54:01.770]
And then everybody's going to be,

[01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:03.570]
or at least half the people are going to be very pissed off

[01:54:03.570 --> 01:54:04.710]
and people are going to be screaming,

[01:54:04.890 --> 01:54:05.890]
oh, you see me told you.

[01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:07.210]
And what's the point?

[01:54:07.890 --> 01:54:08.450]
What is the point?

[01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:12.190]
Very, very sad, pathetic.

[01:54:12.930 --> 01:54:13.750]
I keep telling you,

[01:54:13.770 --> 01:54:14.810]
they stole it square and fair,

[01:54:14.910 --> 01:54:15.790]
and you're not going to get it back.

[01:54:16.630 --> 01:54:17.590]
The fix was in.

[01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:21.350]
Here's a mobile in Aventura. Hello.

[01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:23.850]
Neil, good y'all.

[01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:24.670]
Yes, sir.

[01:54:25.090 --> 01:54:26.510]
And a happy holiday for you.

[01:54:27.190 --> 01:54:30.570]
And by the way, I'm like an identity crisis.

[01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:32.330]
I'm not a Julio.

[01:54:32.590 --> 01:54:34.490]
There's a Macubano key.

[01:54:34.930 --> 01:54:35.510]
Yeah, Julio.

[01:54:35.670 --> 01:54:37.350]
Does that make me a Jewel?

[01:54:37.630 --> 01:54:38.030]
Julio.

[01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:39.170]
A Julio.

[01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:39.870]
A Julio.

[01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:42.430]
You know what I was thinking the other day,

[01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:45.630]
I've been listening to you when you used to do those shows,

[01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:46.830]
no matter what the old lady,

[01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:49.930]
and you used to have topics like 20 years ago.

[01:54:50.190 --> 01:54:50.330]
Yeah.

[01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:52.590]
I think those days you definitely come back.

[01:54:52.710 --> 01:54:52.890]
No.

[01:54:53.050 --> 01:54:53.630]
You think about that.

[01:54:53.650 --> 01:54:54.030]
No, I don't.

[01:54:54.570 --> 01:54:55.370]
You don't think so.

[01:54:56.170 --> 01:54:58.770]
The last time I saw you was over at borders.

[01:54:59.250 --> 01:55:02.250]
And we were talking about my friend,

[01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:03.930]
Reston P.

[01:55:04.050 --> 01:55:04.770]
She was your neighbor.

[01:55:05.290 --> 01:55:07.070]
He was always whacked out.

[01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:09.530]
Remember, he used to live in the same complex.

[01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:10.630]
Yeah, like you, of course, Jay.

[01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:11.590]
He was a drug dealer, yeah.

[01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:12.370]
Exactly.

[01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:13.070]

[01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.750]

[01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:14.210]
Exactly.

[01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:14.650]
Exactly.

[01:55:14.890 --> 01:55:15.850]
He's still exactly dead.

[01:55:17.130 --> 01:55:18.710]
He's exactly very dead.

[01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:19.010]
Right.

[01:55:19.130 --> 01:55:21.830]
Big fan of yours, and every time I go to visit him,

[01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:23.210]
it's like together.

[01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:24.890]
It's double conditions for them.

[01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.910]
But, yeah.

[01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:27.230]
Every time you visit who?

[01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.810]
The dead man?

[01:55:27.810 --> 01:55:29.130]
The dead guy.

[01:55:29.490 --> 01:55:30.630]
He was a nice guy.

[01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:33.470]
He just had a major major major major drug problem.

[01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:34.730]
But he was a young kid too.

[01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:35.270]
He died.

[01:55:35.670 --> 01:55:36.470]
He's still dead, yeah.

[01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:38.170]
He was like 32.

[01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:39.410]
Well, listen, other than that,

[01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:41.910]
which is putting the audience into a coma just like that guy,

[01:55:42.010 --> 01:55:42.990]
is what, what else?

[01:55:43.610 --> 01:55:45.110]
Oh, what else is that?

[01:55:45.330 --> 01:55:47.730]
I'm like, I have a major identity problem

[01:55:47.730 --> 01:55:52.250]
because being, having been born into by, of course,

[01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:52.430]

[01:55:52.430 --> 01:55:53.490]
Yeah, you already said that.

[01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:54.490]
Thank you, and have a nice holiday.

[01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.390]
56670560,

[01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:59.270]
on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.710]
Line.

[01:56:02.610 --> 01:56:03.710]
I'm a very good driver.

[01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:07.890]
Here's a mobile and South Miami.

[01:56:08.110 --> 01:56:08.210]
Hello.

[01:56:08.710 --> 01:56:09.290]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:09.890]
Okay, sir.

[01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:11.550]
Well, that guy was reaching from a time.

[01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:12.270]
Oh, brother.

[01:56:12.490 --> 01:56:12.770]
He was.

[01:56:12.810 --> 01:56:13.530]
Hey, I got a quick question.

[01:56:13.610 --> 01:56:15.010]
Well, I just wanted to mention a couple of things.

[01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:17.150]
With regard to the economy,

[01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:20.430]
so much of this is cyclical in that...

[01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:21.390]
Underline the sick part.

[01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:22.250]
Okay.

[01:56:23.690 --> 01:56:25.810]
It's so much of this for the people that are Democrats.

[01:56:25.810 --> 01:56:26.770]
They're all freaking out.

[01:56:26.890 --> 01:56:30.950]
It's so much of this is not going to depend on who's the president.

[01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:33.350]
It's the economy goes through cycle.

[01:56:33.410 --> 01:56:35.250]
Well, what do you mean Democrats are all freaking out?

[01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:38.450]
Don't you think there were Republicans who were invested up to their armpits are freaking out too?

[01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:41.510]
No, I agree with you, but I'm saying,

[01:56:41.950 --> 01:56:43.730]
the people I think that the world's going to end

[01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:45.950]
because their candidate didn't get in the office.

[01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:49.330]
So much of this is...

[01:56:49.330 --> 01:56:52.810]
Well, long before they ever decided who was the winner of the election,

[01:56:53.190 --> 01:56:54.870]
this thing started back in March,

[01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:56.450]
that the Nasdaq started tanking.

[01:56:56.890 --> 01:56:58.630]
This isn't the start when you had the election.

[01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:00.450]
So, see, I agree with you.

[01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:02.870]
A lot of people are saying that they don't...

[01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:05.930]
They know that the economy is going slightly in the slump,

[01:57:06.110 --> 01:57:07.630]
but they're so far in the market.

[01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:09.830]
It's not going slightly in a slump.

[01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:14.550]
The Nasdaq is 2385 and March, it was 5100 points.

[01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:16.410]
That's not slightly in a slump.

[01:57:16.670 --> 01:57:18.770]
That's a drop in more than 50%.

[01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:19.930]
Okay, I agree with you.

[01:57:19.930 --> 01:57:21.310]
That's not slightly in a slump.

[01:57:21.930 --> 01:57:22.930]
Okay, I agree with you.

[01:57:22.930 --> 01:57:26.230]
You buy a stock at $300 a share, and it's worth 17 a day.

[01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:27.850]
That's not slightly in a slump.

[01:57:29.130 --> 01:57:32.470]
No, okay, it looks bad, but what I'm saying is,

[01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:35.570]
is that the people I don't want to admit it looks bad,

[01:57:35.690 --> 01:57:38.450]
don't want to admit it because they're so far up in their neck

[01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:40.670]
that they're scared to admit anything.

[01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:42.690]
But I can look at one different aspect of this.

[01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:43.470]
I'm up to it.

[01:57:43.710 --> 01:57:46.410]
To my eyebrows, and I'm not in the aisle, it's very obvious.

[01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:50.270]
If you look at your portfolio, and it's down by 20% or 40%,

[01:57:50.270 --> 01:57:52.030]
or 50% or whatever it is,

[01:57:52.030 --> 01:57:53.450]
it's not a question of admitting it.

[01:57:53.470 --> 01:57:54.870]
It's a fact, it's just there.

[01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.630]
You're right.

[01:57:56.110 --> 01:57:56.850]
It's not looking.

[01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:58.470]
It's a different perspective.

[01:57:58.630 --> 01:57:59.310]
Look at it this way.

[01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:01.910]
As far as looking at the economy,

[01:58:02.050 --> 01:58:03.270]
for some of the people that aren't believers,

[01:58:03.690 --> 01:58:04.990]
I mean, believers you want.

[01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:06.450]
Well, they don't believe it.

[01:58:06.590 --> 01:58:10.970]
It's like they're walking around saying that they can't see the writing on the wall,

[01:58:10.970 --> 01:58:12.470]
but we're going down.

[01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:13.470]
I mean, this is bad.

[01:58:13.670 --> 01:58:14.290]
It's getting bad.

[01:58:14.850 --> 01:58:16.270]
Look at, if you look at all of it,

[01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:21.130]
one of the first signs of major corporations that the economy is headed for,

[01:58:21.130 --> 01:58:23.910]
isn't it first time however you want to put it?

[01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:27.230]
They automatically cut back in the worst place that they shouldn't,

[01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:28.170]
which is advertising.

[01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:30.850]
And you look at, for example,

[01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:32.110]
which is just a thought.

[01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:33.670]
That's why Time Warner and AOL,

[01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:36.050]
and just both, even though they just, the merger got approved,

[01:58:36.170 --> 01:58:40.370]
they're both in the tank, AOLs down another 3791 for AOL,

[01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:41.430]
and Time Warner is in the tank,

[01:58:41.630 --> 01:58:43.630]
because their advertising revenues are in the toilet.

[01:58:44.090 --> 01:58:44.410]
Exactly.

[01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:46.750]
Now, look at Walt Disney World.

[01:58:47.550 --> 01:58:50.330]
They cut back their advertising major.

[01:58:50.330 --> 01:58:54.730]
Now, all that does is they try to improve themselves by cutting back on the money

[01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:55.750]
that they're spending right now,

[01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:57.370]
so that their numbers look like they're not,

[01:58:58.050 --> 01:58:59.770]
that there's more profit right now,

[01:58:59.770 --> 01:59:01.710]
because they're not spending as much on advertising.

[01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:07.050]
That what happens after that is that the residual effect is that people don't,

[01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:10.610]
you know, no advertising people don't go out, people don't go to Disney World.

[01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:13.950]
So, all these corporations across the board, they were saying,

[01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:16.470]
I think it was advertising news or whatever,

[01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:20.010]
they were saying that this is one of the, this is the major sign,

[01:59:20.190 --> 01:59:23.250]
the major major corporations around the United States are all cutting back

[01:59:23.250 --> 01:59:24.250]
and advertising.

[01:59:24.690 --> 01:59:25.930]
There's going to be an effect.

[01:59:26.650 --> 01:59:27.930]
It's going to affect everybody.

[01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:32.970]
Also, I want to say hello to George, pardon me, Gary, Gary the mortgage brother.

[01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:34.310]
Okay.

[01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:37.050]
Have any idea what he just said?

[01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:37.630]
No.

[01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:38.650]
That makes all of us.

[01:59:39.330 --> 01:59:40.750]
You're a little packer, cut the near-till,

[01:59:40.890 --> 01:59:42.090]
or neutral by Merrill Lynch.

[01:59:43.570 --> 01:59:44.390]
Upgrade, Psycle.

[01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:46.310]
I'm much, much weaker than expected.

[01:59:46.650 --> 01:59:48.450]
Oh, God, a sheer is going to float away or what?

[01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:50.310]
Do you hear what she just said?

[01:59:52.050 --> 01:59:57.030]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:59.290]
You notice what his name is?

[02:00:00.250 --> 02:00:00.630]
Creamer.

[02:00:03.670 --> 02:00:05.370]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach. Hello.

[02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:06.590]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:07.010]
Okay.

[02:00:07.650 --> 02:00:07.950]
Excellent.

[02:00:09.230 --> 02:00:10.450]
This shouldn't be news to you.

[02:00:10.590 --> 02:00:11.230]
I'm doing great.

[02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:12.090]
I feel great.

[02:00:12.210 --> 02:00:12.710]
I'm doing great.

[02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:14.030]
The audience, these people are...

[02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:14.450]
I don't know.

[02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:16.450]
Maybe they just ready to blow their brains out.

[02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:18.030]
I don't know what to deal with his audience today.

[02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:20.170]
I've never heard anything like this in my life.

[02:00:20.410 --> 02:00:21.310]
It's Jerry from Oz.

[02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:22.270]
He's a good call.

[02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:25.090]
I want to talk about presidents.

[02:00:25.590 --> 02:00:30.470]
As you know, presidents don't do much for the economy, but Greenspan does.

[02:00:31.210 --> 02:00:34.890]
And 11 months ago, Greenspan talked about irrational exuberant.

[02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:35.150]
Yeah.

[02:00:35.630 --> 02:00:36.970]
And talked about stemming it.

[02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:39.710]
So in the last, whatever, 6 out of 9, I guess,

[02:00:39.710 --> 02:00:42.170]
that boNC meeting is raising the rate.

[02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:43.890]
And that's why we are where we are now.

[02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:45.550]
That's right, because he went way too far.

[02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:47.010]
He went way too far.

[02:00:47.050 --> 02:00:49.710]
And lead to a maybe three interest rate hikes too many.

[02:00:50.290 --> 02:00:50.510]
Yeah.

[02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:55.710]
And if he brings it back down again, then we'll wait around

[02:00:55.710 --> 02:00:57.390]
and struggle for another six or eight months.

[02:00:57.610 --> 02:00:59.170]
And it'll, you know, think good again.

[02:00:59.250 --> 02:00:59.950]
But that's why I hope.

[02:01:00.190 --> 02:01:00.730]
We hope.

[02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:02.170]
That's why you should have started yesterday.

[02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.390]
Exactly.

[02:01:03.810 --> 02:01:04.090]
You're right.

[02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:05.250]
And another thing.

[02:01:05.370 --> 02:01:06.070]
Back to the...

[02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:08.250]
If somebody just wouldn't have put his hand on his shoulder,

[02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:09.670]
maybe things would be okay today.

[02:01:10.810 --> 02:01:12.310]
He doesn't want to be in touch.

[02:01:12.450 --> 02:01:13.650]
That's even what Andy and Mitchell said.

[02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:14.390]
Don't touch him.

[02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:17.490]
No, it's the dander on his shoulder from all that hair.

[02:01:19.050 --> 02:01:22.790]
The tax cut, $1.3 trillion is what W talk about.

[02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:28.450]
Our GDP today is 10 trillion per year.

[02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:30.310]
He's going to do this over 10 years.

[02:01:30.330 --> 02:01:32.090]
It's less than 1% of the GDP.

[02:01:32.090 --> 02:01:32.890]
I'm off for it.

[02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:33.770]
Bring it on right now.

[02:01:34.170 --> 02:01:34.650]
Yeah, absolutely.

[02:01:34.710 --> 02:01:35.630]
Bring it on right now.

[02:01:35.630 --> 02:01:37.770]
Even though we won a fixed election, bring it on right now.

[02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:38.390]
I'll take it.

[02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:39.270]
I need it.

[02:01:39.330 --> 02:01:39.970]
That's all right.

[02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:41.570]
Al Sharpton in 2004.

[02:01:41.890 --> 02:01:42.290]
Yeah, okay.

[02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.390]
Later.

[02:01:48.050 --> 02:01:48.410]
56670560,

[02:01:49.230 --> 02:01:52.750]
pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:53.850]
Maybe the good drugs came in.

[02:01:53.890 --> 02:01:54.730]
You think that might be a...

[02:01:54.730 --> 02:01:55.390]
Oh, it has to be.

[02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:55.910]
It's got to be.

[02:01:56.610 --> 02:01:58.390]
I mean, each one is ditched you than the previous one.

[02:01:58.450 --> 02:02:00.490]
Each one is crazier than the previous one.

[02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:02.370]
Each one is more incoherent.

[02:02:02.990 --> 02:02:05.090]
I can still envision that the drug guy,

[02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:08.970]
the neighbor he was talking about, that juban coming home from work

[02:02:08.970 --> 02:02:11.110]
and standing out in front of the door and like teetering

[02:02:11.110 --> 02:02:14.950]
and trying to aim the key at the lock and unable to open up his front door.

[02:02:15.450 --> 02:02:17.450]
I can remember days when I looked and you know,

[02:02:17.570 --> 02:02:19.950]
I had in that apartment with a townhouse.

[02:02:20.790 --> 02:02:23.130]
And in the front there were like, what do they call right next to the door,

[02:02:23.250 --> 02:02:25.530]
the things where you're like little windows.

[02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:26.090]
Oh, okay.

[02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:30.130]
And he'd be standing there with his face pressed up against the window,

[02:02:30.250 --> 02:02:30.890]
like peering in.

[02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:33.890]
The drug dealer next door.

[02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:37.550]
And now he's dead.

[02:02:39.790 --> 02:02:43.090]
25 and of course all these people be driving up at different times of the day

[02:02:43.090 --> 02:02:45.470]
in the middle of the night and these strange little vehicles

[02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:47.030]
and every kind of description of them,

[02:02:47.190 --> 02:02:49.110]
they'd be parked there briefly and knocking on his door.

[02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:53.430]
Took a rocket scientist to figure out if he was a drug dealer.

[02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:55.570]
And I remember these before I moved out of there.

[02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:57.430]
These people from...

[02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:58.190]
Someone's out to America.

[02:02:58.350 --> 02:02:59.730]
I remember this Columbia or Brazil.

[02:02:59.910 --> 02:03:00.770]
They were a light of Latinos.

[02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.530]
Not tubans.

[02:03:02.690 --> 02:03:03.010]
Latinos.

[02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:05.210]
And they moved in next door and they had like little kids.

[02:03:06.930 --> 02:03:08.530]
And I remember, you know, they were fairly friendly.

[02:03:08.610 --> 02:03:11.310]
And I remember one day standing outside talking to the one guy,

[02:03:11.410 --> 02:03:11.990]
the father.

[02:03:13.810 --> 02:03:16.270]
And we got into a discussion about the drug dealer next door to me.

[02:03:16.450 --> 02:03:19.550]
I think maybe I found him a new customer because I thought for sure

[02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:22.450]
that they would probably want to keep their little kids as far away as possible

[02:03:22.450 --> 02:03:24.610]
since it was like a drug joint next door to my house.

[02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:27.330]
And then these people got really tight.

[02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:30.330]
So maybe they were like either suppliers or customers

[02:03:30.330 --> 02:03:32.270]
or both of you about filling the blank.

[02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:38.090]
I just mentioned that in passing and he still did.

[02:03:39.130 --> 02:03:41.730]
26 past noon at 5.60 WQAM.

[02:03:42.090 --> 02:03:43.690]
I'm okay, fucking blow.

[02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:45.570]
Hi, I'm Linda Blair.

[02:03:46.110 --> 02:03:47.330]
And whenever I want to...

[02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:51.390]
I'm going to go to...

[02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:54.390]
I go to 666 flags over America.

[02:03:55.230 --> 02:03:56.490]
It's so easy.

[02:03:56.970 --> 02:04:00.310]
You'll leave your car and all hope behind is a parking lot.

[02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:03.210]
Then you'll ride the handbag to the house.

[02:04:04.150 --> 02:04:08.410]
And oh look, here's our parking mascot, Jackie the Jackal.

[02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:12.410]
What you do next is up to you.

[02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:16.590]
You can join the four horsemen of the apocalypse on the carousel of doom.

[02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:18.970]
Yeah, it'll sting your head around.

[02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:22.990]
Ride the lock, loom down the river, stick.

[02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:27.670]
Just relax and have a snack at our possession center.

[02:04:27.670 --> 02:04:31.170]
Yeah, give me a double bond to red hot and large.

[02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:33.070]
Don't walk, get down.

[02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:34.690]
It's a truck in.

[02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:37.090]
666 flags over America.

[02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:39.330]
It's a big parking lot.

[02:04:40.150 --> 02:04:41.230]
That's my sound.

[02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:45.450]
29 past noon at 5.60 WQAM.

[02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:48.330]
Happy Chinoca, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and quans etc.

[02:04:48.690 --> 02:04:50.190]
To all our psychotic people out there.

[02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:52.850]
George has got a suggestion for our young Julio's out there.

[02:04:53.130 --> 02:04:53.690]
Just rub it?

[02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:54.030]
Yeah.

[02:04:55.170 --> 02:04:56.090]
Oh, they already are.

[02:04:57.210 --> 02:04:57.930]
5667.0560.

[02:04:58.350 --> 02:05:00.210]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:04.350]
Out of town line is open 877-785-63-45.

[02:05:04.630 --> 02:05:06.310]
Getting a real good lesson in economics here today.

[02:05:06.730 --> 02:05:09.350]
Oh yeah, I'm learning a lot, raise interest rates.

[02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:10.110]
I'm learning a lot.

[02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:12.530]
In fact, I'm learning that as little as I thought that I knew,

[02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:14.510]
I'm a genius compared to most of you folks.

[02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:19.650]
So don't be calling and giving me a song at the end about how I got sucked into buying dish TV and chitrix

[02:05:19.650 --> 02:05:21.450]
because nature is an asshole, okay?

[02:05:23.070 --> 02:05:25.430]
At least the ones that I picked are doing pretty damn good.

[02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:27.650]
Most of them, even now.

[02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:30.310]
Here's Bokeh, hello.

[02:05:31.130 --> 02:05:32.350]
Neil, how you doing today?

[02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:33.030]
Okay, sir.

[02:05:33.570 --> 02:05:39.850]
I got one of my neighbors is a VP for Citrix and I lost 60 grand in May listening to her ass on this stock.

[02:05:40.110 --> 02:05:45.730]
And I'll tell you what, what Green Stand did yesterday just lets the average working men know that

[02:05:45.730 --> 02:05:47.650]
he didn't write for anything in the country.

[02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:52.370]
I mean, we all need a hand and the average guy's hurting.

[02:05:52.370 --> 02:05:56.510]
They'll reach get richer and the poor get poor and we keep going downhill.

[02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:59.290]
How do we get rid of Green Stand?

[02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:00.930]
Detail out of me.

[02:06:01.290 --> 02:06:03.230]
George W is going to have to say bye-bye.

[02:06:04.090 --> 02:06:08.530]
Well, we need to get some new fresh thinking working in our country, I think.

[02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:14.570]
I don't think Bush is the answer, but hopefully he can appoint some with his new staff.

[02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:17.830]
Okay, pal, hang on tight.

[02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:18.770]
Thanks.

[02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:19.730]
Okay, good luck to you.

[02:06:20.290 --> 02:06:20.590]
What do you say?

[02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:25.550]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:06:27.790 --> 02:06:29.390]
Here's a mobile and Fort Lauderdale, hello.

[02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:30.810]
Hey Neil, how are you?

[02:06:30.970 --> 02:06:31.190]
Great.

[02:06:31.970 --> 02:06:34.090]
Hey, listen, I hope I can make you feel better here.

[02:06:34.690 --> 02:06:36.230]
I just say you said how are you?

[02:06:36.330 --> 02:06:36.810]
I said, great.

[02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.710]
Good.

[02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:39.190]
So how are you going to make me feel better?

[02:06:39.690 --> 02:06:47.670]
Well, I do a lot with these companies like Citrix and Motorola down here and I can tell you all how you took a big, big dump on that Citrix stock.

[02:06:47.670 --> 02:06:53.250]
I do think that when the cyclical cycle goes back up, that Citrix is going to do well.

[02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:55.310]
So just hang in there with that one.

[02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:57.070]
What is that going to happen?

[02:06:57.890 --> 02:06:58.810]
Probably about a year and a half.

[02:06:59.170 --> 02:06:59.470]
Uh-huh.

[02:07:00.850 --> 02:07:05.470]
If I like Motorola, I mean they were good, they were real good, then also they took a big dump.

[02:07:05.690 --> 02:07:09.830]
I don't have Motorola, I bought it in 19 and sold it like a little over 20 or got rid of it in about two weeks.

[02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:10.690]
Yeah, hit it.

[02:07:11.250 --> 02:07:16.430]
And about a year and a half, you'll see both those two companies which are fairly well run are going to do well.

[02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.850]
Okay.

[02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:18.030]
So hang in there, man.

[02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:18.510]
I'm hanging.

[02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.310]
Okay.

[02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.750]
Thanks.

[02:07:19.930 --> 02:07:21.010]
There you go.

[02:07:21.130 --> 02:07:22.090]
See how you feel better already?

[02:07:22.330 --> 02:07:22.470]
No.

[02:07:22.650 --> 02:07:23.370]
Yeah, I feel better.

[02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:24.130]
I'm hanging.

[02:07:24.210 --> 02:07:24.950]
I'm not losing anyone.

[02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:25.850]
It's all on paper.

[02:07:26.970 --> 02:07:28.010]
What's a few million on paper?

[02:07:28.230 --> 02:07:28.850]
It was a few million.

[02:07:28.890 --> 02:07:30.090]
Would I be sitting here, of course not?

[02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:32.430]
What is that?

[02:07:32.730 --> 02:07:33.190]
What's number is that?

[02:07:33.190 --> 02:07:33.570]
Your friends.

[02:07:34.150 --> 02:07:36.930]
On the little friends you have their number now, 388-5833.

[02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:42.810]
If anybody wants to get involved in the telephone circle jerk, who the little rode Julios out there, it's 305, of course.

[02:07:42.810 --> 02:07:46.810]
Where the Julios are 305-388-5833.

[02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:52.390]
305-388-5833.

[02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:53.750]
508-3833, like I said.

[02:07:54.110 --> 02:07:55.330]
And I'm sure that we have it in the talk to you.

[02:07:55.530 --> 02:07:59.010]
And maybe you can participate in there on the circle jerk.

[02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:03.250]
A bunch of little crazy backers.

[02:08:03.870 --> 02:08:05.470]
We should charge a pink fee when we do this.

[02:08:06.570 --> 02:08:11.350]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lines.

[02:08:13.330 --> 02:08:14.230]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.470]

[02:08:14.910 --> 02:08:15.650]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:17.090]
You should change it to a 900 number.

[02:08:17.210 --> 02:08:17.550]
Yes sir.

[02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:19.170]
Three things. First that.

[02:08:19.370 --> 02:08:19.490]
Yeah.

[02:08:19.730 --> 02:08:20.810]
I went last night to the heat game.

[02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:22.170]
Never don't go that often.

[02:08:22.230 --> 02:08:24.330]
One of the best games I've ever seen is an awesome game.

[02:08:24.450 --> 02:08:25.830]
I have a very high annualite.

[02:08:26.530 --> 02:08:27.550]
That was one number two.

[02:08:27.770 --> 02:08:31.130]
What do you think the odds are that push doesn't know how to make his own tie?

[02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.250]
And?

[02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.930]
You don't think?

[02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:35.130]
And what about it?

[02:08:35.610 --> 02:08:39.050]
No, I'm just saying, I saw my TV sitting in the lighthouse talking to Clinton.

[02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:42.210]
It just doesn't look like he belongs in a suit or that he knows how to make his own tie.

[02:08:42.230 --> 02:08:43.370]
Well, he's what you got.

[02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:44.730]
You better get used to it.

[02:08:44.770 --> 02:08:47.070]
May he's going to be there for four long, excruciating years.

[02:08:47.230 --> 02:08:47.910]
You better get used to it.

[02:08:47.970 --> 02:08:49.310]
You better hope somebody makes him smart.

[02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:53.270]
Neil, I'm in the same boat as you and what I've observed when terms of investing.

[02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:56.690]
I just started investing last October's when I came into some money.

[02:08:56.710 --> 02:08:58.430]
It's the worst year I could have ever started.

[02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:00.050]
Well, I'm even worse than you.

[02:09:00.090 --> 02:09:02.410]
I started in March when the NASDAQ was 5100.

[02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:04.210]
And I was lucky enough to get turned on.

[02:09:04.290 --> 02:09:06.990]
I want to say by a rimmer to a guy who's obsessed with tech stock.

[02:09:06.990 --> 02:09:09.390]
And as me in tech up to my goddamn earlobes.

[02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:11.490]
Yeah, you know, I'm rounding in the sea of dread.

[02:09:11.730 --> 02:09:14.430]
Well, it really bothers me as if you listen to CNBC.

[02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:18.150]
Every time there's an event that they claim once we get past this event,

[02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:19.230]
everything's going to be fine.

[02:09:19.370 --> 02:09:20.410]
First, it was the election.

[02:09:21.050 --> 02:09:22.270]
The uncertainty with the election.

[02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:25.570]
And they come up with an excuse every time.

[02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:30.070]
Everybody on CNBC is full of crap, including that Joe Batapaglia from Grenell.

[02:09:30.410 --> 02:09:34.450]
He said the NASDAQ was going to be 5,000 by December two months ago.

[02:09:35.490 --> 02:09:36.590]
They're off full of crap.

[02:09:36.930 --> 02:09:37.410]
You're right.

[02:09:37.610 --> 02:09:38.450]
I'm sure they say that.

[02:09:38.590 --> 02:09:41.170]
They're dead and bonds or by real estate, I guess.

[02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:42.070]
What else is there to do?

[02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:43.070]
What do I have to say?

[02:09:43.150 --> 02:09:44.110]
It's nothing but gambling.

[02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:45.490]
And I sit here and I keep saying that.

[02:09:45.570 --> 02:09:47.810]
The only problem being that I'm so, like most of us,

[02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:50.970]
I'm so deeply into it, I can't get out with taking a humongous law.

[02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:51.590]
So I just have to...

[02:09:52.690 --> 02:09:53.590]
Where are you going to put it?

[02:09:53.650 --> 02:09:56.090]
I put it in a checking account for 2%.

[02:09:56.090 --> 02:09:57.410]
Well, how about putting it in CDs?

[02:09:57.710 --> 02:09:59.770]
There, guaranteed you can get 7.5%.

[02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:02.670]
Yeah, you know, all the guys that proud all the stocks and make money off

[02:10:02.670 --> 02:10:05.730]
are called those certificates of depreciation that talk you out of it.

[02:10:05.730 --> 02:10:06.730]
But they're all full of crap.

[02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:07.690]
It's probably the same thing.

[02:10:07.690 --> 02:10:10.410]
Well, we have almost no inflation in when you get 7.5%.

[02:10:10.410 --> 02:10:11.070]
What's wrong with that?

[02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:12.970]
At least it's guaranteed you're not going to lose a dime.

[02:10:13.730 --> 02:10:15.070]
What can be wrong with that?

[02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:16.970]
Well, they can make commissions off of that.

[02:10:17.090 --> 02:10:17.890]
Yeah, that's exactly.

[02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:19.430]
Hey, good luck.

[02:10:19.590 --> 02:10:20.190]
I'll see you at the bank.

[02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:21.490]
I got put your key right.

[02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:24.090]
I took a little off the table, but I'm holding 600 shares.

[02:10:24.170 --> 02:10:24.990]
Take a little off the top.

[02:10:25.630 --> 02:10:27.050]
Yeah, I took a little off the top.

[02:10:27.110 --> 02:10:28.110]
Okay, good luck, yes sir.

[02:10:31.110 --> 02:10:32.530]
How's that such a cylinder, baby?

[02:10:33.490 --> 02:10:34.410]
That's not even worth looking.

[02:10:34.410 --> 02:10:37.290]
I could look it up over our computer, but how does that pull coming?

[02:10:37.290 --> 02:10:38.330]
Do you think we're going to have a recession?

[02:10:39.210 --> 02:10:42.210]
Yes, it's coming in the recession to 111 out of 207 votes.

[02:10:42.450 --> 02:10:43.350]
53.5%.

[02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:47.230]
So yeah, we're already in at 52 of us because I voted we're already in at 25%.

[02:10:47.230 --> 02:10:49.030]
No, the economy is going to be just fine.

[02:10:49.110 --> 02:10:50.050]
Oh, we're fine.

[02:10:50.210 --> 02:10:51.410]
44.21%.

[02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:53.330]
Say, I already worried about everything's just fine.

[02:10:54.630 --> 02:10:55.350]
No sweatsky.

[02:10:57.790 --> 02:11:00.950]
Those are probably people, you know, when they have a problem, they just ask jeez.

[02:11:02.730 --> 02:11:03.830]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:04.110]
Hello.

[02:11:04.710 --> 02:11:05.310]
Hey, Neil.

[02:11:05.650 --> 02:11:06.010]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:06.090 --> 02:11:06.530]
How are you doing?

[02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:08.290]
Is this your voice?

[02:11:08.410 --> 02:11:09.490]
Sounds like a funny voice tonight.

[02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:12.310]
Sounds like a bad funny voice.

[02:11:12.370 --> 02:11:14.910]
Neil, last night there was a on CNBC.

[02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:17.230]
Is this your real voice or is this a put on?

[02:11:18.010 --> 02:11:18.770]
You were a turbine?

[02:11:19.630 --> 02:11:20.030]
Hello.

[02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.670]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:21.490 --> 02:11:24.030]
Yeah, last night on CNBC there was something interesting.

[02:11:24.970 --> 02:11:26.830]
Lauren's Kudlow, which was a little...

[02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:29.190]
Lauren's Kudlow, yeah, he's the fastest right when he's a crap.

[02:11:29.190 --> 02:11:35.910]
He said something that no government officials should stay like more than two terms in office for green span.

[02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.990]
And the other thing is that...

[02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:38.950]
He's not about green span, green span, an asshole.

[02:11:39.450 --> 02:11:47.030]
Right, he said, and the other thing he said, he said that the fed policies that they use is like from 1900 day,

[02:11:47.110 --> 02:11:51.210]
the models that they use are outdated models.

[02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:54.370]
And it makes sense with this economy.

[02:11:54.630 --> 02:11:55.650]
And you see every time you...

[02:11:55.650 --> 02:11:58.350]
Always like that, Lauren Kudlow, you don't even know he's the right-wing fascist.

[02:11:58.350 --> 02:11:59.350]
He knows this crap.

[02:11:59.450 --> 02:12:00.590]
Yeah, I agree.

[02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:02.610]
Good show.

[02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:03.810]
You need to keep it up.

[02:12:04.050 --> 02:12:04.270]
Okay.

[02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.570]
Thanks.

[02:12:04.670 --> 02:12:05.830]
I'll see you at the convenience store.

[02:12:06.050 --> 02:12:07.890]
560-705-60 or in the cab.

[02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:10.310]
Pound 560 on the AT&T.

[02:12:10.610 --> 02:12:12.470]
How come we don't have Pakistani cab drivers here?

[02:12:12.510 --> 02:12:13.190]
We got all Haitians.

[02:12:13.650 --> 02:12:14.710]
I guess because we got Haitians.

[02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.590]
And they work cheaper.

[02:12:16.990 --> 02:12:20.330]
And that's why the shfarts and the Haitians have that tremendous hostility going.

[02:12:23.530 --> 02:12:25.770]
So anyway, speaking of that, speaking of other countries,

[02:12:25.770 --> 02:12:27.310]
our good old buddy Tom Hopkins.

[02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:32.770]
From WIOD, from the old days, they were our members Tom Hopkins who used to say,

[02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:33.510]
Florida sucks.

[02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:35.130]
And he believes it's so much he's leaving.

[02:12:35.230 --> 02:12:39.510]
And he was there to give us a nice check for planned period of last night at Pizza Loft.

[02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:41.130]
And he's bailing out.

[02:12:41.210 --> 02:12:42.230]
He's heading for Costa Rica.

[02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:45.070]
Maybe in fact, a lot of folks seem to be heading for Costa Rica.

[02:12:45.630 --> 02:12:46.710]
Seems to be the place to go.

[02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:47.990]
That seems to be the place.

[02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:50.130]
And the dollars work like 319 of their...

[02:12:50.130 --> 02:12:51.630]
Whatever they call their currency there, what is it?

[02:12:56.110 --> 02:12:56.910]
But it appeals.

[02:12:59.010 --> 02:12:59.350]
Whatever.

[02:13:01.130 --> 02:13:02.790]
And he seemed to be pretty happy about it.

[02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:04.270]
It's all contented because he was getting out of here.

[02:13:05.570 --> 02:13:07.530]
He was getting out and had a big smile on his face.

[02:13:07.690 --> 02:13:09.650]
I said, you know something Tom, I can cheer really to that.

[02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:12.630]
And looked at the calendar and I said, oh, what'd be that long?

[02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:18.110]
56070560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:20.750]
So I read that story when, what's his name?

[02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:23.790]
Your fat friend was on the phone before but he kept talking so they probably didn't hear it

[02:13:23.790 --> 02:13:28.970]
about the same sex marriages receiving final approval in the phones yesterday, which they did.

[02:13:29.290 --> 02:13:32.790]
I just thought I mentioned that in passing since in so many social areas

[02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:36.110]
and just about every social area, they're at least about 200 years ahead of us.

[02:13:36.730 --> 02:13:38.610]
But they sure don't have enough strip shopping centers.

[02:13:40.090 --> 02:13:42.890]
22 till 1 at 560WQM.

[02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:48.490]
But Neil Rogers shows sports radio 560QM.

[02:13:48.590 --> 02:13:49.890]
Look at and stick it.

[02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:54.770]
From the makers of Nut and Honey comes a brand new breakfast cereal

[02:13:54.770 --> 02:13:57.670]
with a name that'll cause even more problems.

[02:13:58.590 --> 02:14:00.610]
What are you eating man, private?

[02:14:00.890 --> 02:14:01.850]
Nut and Homo.

[02:14:02.210 --> 02:14:03.510]
That's why you did it.

[02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:06.270]
Yes, new, Nut and Homo.

[02:14:06.810 --> 02:14:10.930]
It's just crunchy nuts and great a homogenized mouth.

[02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:13.630]
What are you eating man, Nut and Homo.

[02:14:14.210 --> 02:14:16.090]
Lans, please, nut in front of my wife.

[02:14:16.430 --> 02:14:18.510]
Nut and Homo.

[02:14:18.930 --> 02:14:20.550]
You from the makers of Prinsloo.

[02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:24.670]
1241 at 560WQM.

[02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:26.210]
5607.0560.

[02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:28.890]
Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:32.190]
Let's give that number out again for anybody who wants to talk to amongst a little Julio Faggets.

[02:14:32.450 --> 02:14:34.930]
The number is 305-388-5833.

[02:14:35.810 --> 02:14:37.030]
Call them and keep them busy all day.

[02:14:37.190 --> 02:14:38.010]
Put your hand on them.

[02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:38.730]
305.

[02:14:38.730 --> 02:14:39.390]
What is it again?

[02:14:39.650 --> 02:14:41.070]
388-5833.

[02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:42.470]
They should only rot.

[02:14:44.130 --> 02:14:45.350]
Here's Pember Pine, so.

[02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:46.570]
See that nail.

[02:14:46.770 --> 02:14:47.130]
Yes sir.

[02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:48.770]
Now God, how are you?

[02:14:48.930 --> 02:14:49.250]
Okay, I'm good.

[02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:50.710]
Happy Holidays to you.

[02:14:50.910 --> 02:14:51.030]
Thank you.

[02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:52.770]
I got a couple of things.

[02:14:52.930 --> 02:14:56.470]
First, no politics, no economics, no sports.

[02:14:57.290 --> 02:15:00.110]
I just want to say thank you for all the great years of service.

[02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:01.350]
And I love you man.

[02:15:01.710 --> 02:15:03.510]
You keep me entertained all the time.

[02:15:04.050 --> 02:15:05.130]
I tried to get in yesterday.

[02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:06.230]
I couldn't.

[02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:09.330]
I want to wish my wife a happy 19th anniversary.

[02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:09.830]
Great.

[02:15:10.070 --> 02:15:11.870]
For great years of service.

[02:15:12.730 --> 02:15:13.010]
Okay.

[02:15:13.410 --> 02:15:14.910]
Neil, thank you so much.

[02:15:15.010 --> 02:15:16.050]
You're the wonder.

[02:15:16.330 --> 02:15:16.550]
Okay.

[02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:17.130]
Thank you.

[02:15:17.890 --> 02:15:18.270]
Thank you.

[02:15:19.690 --> 02:15:22.310]
She's servicing the group.

[02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:24.250]
5670560.

[02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:26.050]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:15:26.130 --> 02:15:26.930]
What about over there when it was?

[02:15:26.970 --> 02:15:27.890]
Coast, what's wrong with you?

[02:15:27.890 --> 02:15:28.890]
Those pickers over there, huh?

[02:15:29.770 --> 02:15:31.330]
Get turned down by your pets last night.

[02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:34.330]
877-785-6345.

[02:15:36.970 --> 02:15:38.210]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:15:38.370 --> 02:15:38.490]
Hello?

[02:15:39.610 --> 02:15:40.050]
Neil.

[02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.610]
Yes sir.

[02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:41.210]
How you doing?

[02:15:44.010 --> 02:15:44.890]
56705-606.

[02:15:44.930 --> 02:15:48.710]
No matter how fast you talk, it's still not going to get on the air.

[02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:56.350]
No matter how fast you talk with your little messages or your little boyfriends, it still isn't going to get on the air.

[02:15:56.830 --> 02:15:58.190]
It's not the way it works.

[02:15:59.410 --> 02:16:00.150]
Do you understand?

[02:16:00.150 --> 02:16:00.770]
No.

[02:16:01.210 --> 02:16:02.050]
I didn't think so.

[02:16:05.210 --> 02:16:06.090]
56705-60.

[02:16:06.330 --> 02:16:09.350]
Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:16:09.450 --> 02:16:10.390]
I mean, what's the point of this?

[02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:15.610]
Why don't we just take off between like, you know, about the 15th of December till the New Year rings in?

[02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:17.970]
We're just killing some time here.

[02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:20.210]
Here's a mobile in sunrise.

[02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:20.570]
Hello?

[02:16:21.490 --> 02:16:21.950]
Hey Neil.

[02:16:22.450 --> 02:16:23.530]
You want to talk economics?

[02:16:24.070 --> 02:16:24.690]
I'll tell you what.

[02:16:24.690 --> 02:16:31.050]
Let those idiots corrodote and canalists and their economics plan with this new stadium and just...

[02:16:31.050 --> 02:16:33.030]
What does that have to do with my economics?

[02:16:33.090 --> 02:16:35.410]
What does that have to do with anybody and the money they have invested?

[02:16:35.630 --> 02:16:37.370]
What does that have to do with the price of being, sir?

[02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:39.110]
Well, I'll tell you what.

[02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:42.030]
It's ridiculous to see what they're doing.

[02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:44.510]
Well, you know something, sir, like I said before, I don't care.

[02:16:44.630 --> 02:16:45.310]
It doesn't affect me.

[02:16:45.410 --> 02:16:48.230]
It doesn't affect most of the people who are listening to Westphite now.

[02:16:48.510 --> 02:16:49.970]
So let's talk about things that do.

[02:16:51.210 --> 02:16:54.670]
You see, I understand that there's a certain segment of the audience that wants to keep taking these things out.

[02:16:54.670 --> 02:16:57.050]
They want to keep these things and turning it into a big cause, so let me...

[02:16:57.050 --> 02:17:00.150]
And almost a couple of days ago, I allowed myself to get sucked into doing that.

[02:17:00.330 --> 02:17:01.190]
I'm not going to do that.

[02:17:01.970 --> 02:17:03.310]
I'm not going to bust a gun about that.

[02:17:03.530 --> 02:17:07.870]
If they want to build a baseball stadium on every corner in Dave County, be our guest.

[02:17:08.570 --> 02:17:09.490]
Have a wonderful life.

[02:17:09.650 --> 02:17:10.750]
Have a great time doing it.

[02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:15.470]
They can drop the people in from God, damn sky hooks for all I care.

[02:17:15.850 --> 02:17:16.310]
Go right ahead.

[02:17:17.650 --> 02:17:21.010]
If you want to get all bent out of shape, like we, like I said, a moment ago,

[02:17:21.010 --> 02:17:22.950]
go right ahead and have a nervous breakdown.

[02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.710]
Bust the gun.

[02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:25.650]
Pop a big one.

[02:17:27.670 --> 02:17:34.010]
5667-0560, pound 560 on the AT into the Dow is down 155, then adds that down 140 points.

[02:17:36.010 --> 02:17:37.070]
But it's only money.

[02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:38.810]
Like the guy said before, just hang in there.

[02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.230]
Everything will be just fine.

[02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:41.190]
It'll be great.

[02:17:41.790 --> 02:17:43.270]
That guy is falling.

[02:17:43.530 --> 02:17:44.710]
Here's the lady mobile in Miami.

[02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:45.030]
Hello.

[02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:46.130]
Hello.

[02:17:46.330 --> 02:17:46.850]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:17:47.290 --> 02:17:47.870]
Hi, Neil.

[02:17:48.570 --> 02:17:50.830]
I just wanted to ask you a question.

[02:17:51.570 --> 02:18:00.710]
Have you ever had somebody like call up and is totally not familiar with dealing with hospice care, things like that?

[02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:06.830]
Have I ever had somebody call up and is not totally familiar with dealing with hospice care?

[02:18:07.050 --> 02:18:11.650]
The reason I'm calling and I'm very frustrated is I have a neighbor.

[02:18:12.190 --> 02:18:16.190]
And they live by themselves and I kind of got thrown into trying to help them.

[02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:22.790]
And they were pretty much kicked out of the hospital because insurance won't pay for them to stay in the hospital, like longer in their terminal with cancer.

[02:18:23.410 --> 02:18:33.410]
And I was just wondering if there's a central group of people that I can help him get in contact with or something like that because I'm just real frustrated and I'm really upset and worried about him.

[02:18:33.570 --> 02:18:35.870]
I haven't got any idea, but maybe somebody knows what it does.

[02:18:36.010 --> 02:18:36.930]
Well, maybe somebody will call.

[02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.410]
Okay.

[02:18:37.690 --> 02:18:38.430]
Okay, thanks.

[02:18:38.590 --> 02:18:38.890]
Good luck.

[02:18:39.390 --> 02:18:39.750]
Bye.

[02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.390]
Bye-bye.

[02:18:43.890 --> 02:18:46.670]
56670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:47.850]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:18:48.010 --> 02:18:48.130]
Hello.

[02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:49.630]
Okay.

[02:18:49.950 --> 02:18:50.750]
I have a great life.

[02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:53.310]
Here's the call somewhere, but don't say on the screen.

[02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:53.610]
Hello.

[02:18:54.350 --> 02:18:54.690]
Hey, Neil.

[02:18:54.930 --> 02:18:55.250]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:58.290]
Just leave it here on the camera.

[02:18:58.570 --> 02:19:01.670]
There's a gentleman out here, you know, the Salvation Army ringing about.

[02:19:02.010 --> 02:19:04.630]
You know, they're going, Mary Christmas, ho, ho, ho.

[02:19:04.630 --> 02:19:08.430]
This guy's going to have Bianca in his voucher watch.

[02:19:08.690 --> 02:19:10.010]
He goes, hey, happy Guadalupe.

[02:19:10.650 --> 02:19:11.270]
Getting that money.

[02:19:11.550 --> 02:19:12.510]
You're squeezing her back.

[02:19:12.710 --> 02:19:12.830]
Good.

[02:19:16.130 --> 02:19:17.190]
Here's a couple of reds, hello.

[02:19:17.670 --> 02:19:18.370]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:19:18.490 --> 02:19:18.730]
Okay.

[02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:21.250]
Hey, could you play me, you have the Aaron Summers, Neil God?

[02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:23.590]
Aaron Summers?

[02:19:23.970 --> 02:19:25.350]
Yeah, I saw it on your website once.

[02:19:27.510 --> 02:19:28.990]
You mean just where she says that?

[02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.950]
What she says is Neil God.

[02:19:30.170 --> 02:19:31.070]
Oh, just a second.

[02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:31.390]
Yeah.

[02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:33.610]
Neil God.

[02:19:34.210 --> 02:19:34.390]
That's good.

[02:19:34.610 --> 02:19:35.150]
Is that to it for him?

[02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.770]
Yeah, it is.

[02:19:35.950 --> 02:19:36.170]
Okay.

[02:19:36.330 --> 02:19:41.710]
My wife and I bought herself, we got ourselves the best Christmas presents for ourselves and our family.

[02:19:42.250 --> 02:19:44.970]
We got a home and a job in a nursing home.

[02:19:45.890 --> 02:19:52.590]
And I always said, as soon as I leave Miami on the call, Neil, and tell them, thank God, thank God we're leaving.

[02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:57.470]
And I'd just like to say goodbye to all you people who see, even cheat and connive.

[02:19:57.570 --> 02:19:58.450]
All you losers, yeah.

[02:19:58.730 --> 02:20:00.310]
Oh, I believe we're not.

[02:20:00.310 --> 02:20:00.930]
Congratulations, you're not.

[02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:01.010]

[02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:02.450]
Thank you, sir.

[02:20:02.610 --> 02:20:03.310]
You have a great life.

[02:20:03.430 --> 02:20:04.690]
And I'll look at the beginning of the internet.

[02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:05.570]
Let's call us the luck.

[02:20:05.770 --> 02:20:05.870]
Bye.

[02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.530]
Bye-bye.

[02:20:06.850 --> 02:20:07.350]
There he goes.

[02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:08.810]
We're showing the best of luck.

[02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:09.730]
Bye-bye-bye.

[02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:10.690]
You got out of here.

[02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.670]
Lucky bastard.

[02:20:12.990 --> 02:20:13.670]
5.670.

[02:20:13.970 --> 02:20:14.390]
5.60.

[02:20:14.590 --> 02:20:16.170]
Pound 5.60 on the 18th.

[02:20:16.210 --> 02:20:18.330]
This is the town that refuses to send the real best.

[02:20:18.450 --> 02:20:23.650]
So, Harvey, from hell, I, you know, that facts you say, I know your intentions were good, but your soulful of crap is usual.

[02:20:24.250 --> 02:20:27.590]
Anybody who would defend the callers on this program needs serious assistance.

[02:20:28.290 --> 02:20:32.390]
It's not only today or isolated days, it's every day, every day of my life.

[02:20:33.310 --> 02:20:37.810]
Coming in in the morning with the greatest of optimism and talk to a bunch of bozos who have nothing to say.

[02:20:38.110 --> 02:20:38.650]
Fill in the blank.

[02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:41.990]
Whatever the topic is, it could be, or could be, it makes no difference.

[02:20:42.810 --> 02:20:46.070]
Of course, if I wanted to sit here and carry on about the thing with counting the ballots all day,

[02:20:46.410 --> 02:20:50.770]
and get all bent out of shape about that, and sacrifice five years of my life from frustration and stress,

[02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:52.130]
I could easily do that.

[02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:52.810]
Am I going to do that?

[02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.990]
No.

[02:20:53.170 --> 02:20:53.970]
Because what's the point?

[02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:54.890]
What will that accomplish?

[02:20:57.470 --> 02:20:58.910]
Here's a lady, mobile and Davie.

[02:20:59.010 --> 02:20:59.150]
Hello.

[02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.430]
Hi.

[02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:03.990]
I'm a hospice nurse, and I just heard the lady calling.

[02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.410]
Uh-huh.

[02:21:04.690 --> 02:21:06.170]
I've seen information on hospice.

[02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:07.210]
I can tell her who to call.

[02:21:07.390 --> 02:21:07.610]
Okay.

[02:21:08.250 --> 02:21:09.990]
Hospice care of Howard County.

[02:21:10.430 --> 02:21:13.550]
The numbers 467-742-3.

[02:21:13.650 --> 02:21:14.470]
They can help her.

[02:21:14.730 --> 02:21:15.510]
Great. Thanks a million.

[02:21:15.850 --> 02:21:16.590]
Okay. Bye-bye.

[02:21:16.690 --> 02:21:16.990]
Bye-bye.

[02:21:17.310 --> 02:21:18.310]
Hospice care of Howard.

[02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:21.270]
467-742-3.

[02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:23.010]
That was quick.

[02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:24.710]
And I thank you very much.

[02:21:25.750 --> 02:21:27.830]
So, we try to do something nice out there for someone.

[02:21:29.690 --> 02:21:33.530]
567-0560-560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:21:33.890 --> 02:21:34.630]
West Coast to Florida.

[02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:36.290]
Anybody over there would like you over there in the...

[02:21:36.290 --> 02:21:36.430]
No.

[02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.750]
No.

[02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:39.090]
I couldn't give that number again, but I guess I better not.

[02:21:40.230 --> 02:21:41.310]
Here's a model that's still calling.

[02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:42.130]
Who's calling?

[02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.770]
Den.

[02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:45.110]
Yeah.

[02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:47.030]
Mobile and Pompano.

[02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:47.270]
Hello.

[02:21:47.770 --> 02:21:48.270]
Hey, Neil.

[02:21:48.450 --> 02:21:48.790]
How are you?

[02:21:48.990 --> 02:21:49.250]
Okay.

[02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:51.750]
Long time, long time, this year.

[02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:52.090]
Okay.

[02:21:52.210 --> 02:21:52.450]
Hang on.

[02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:52.830]
Hang on.

[02:21:53.050 --> 02:21:53.130]
I'm sorry.

[02:21:55.050 --> 02:21:55.450]
Okay.

[02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.990]
Go ahead, sir.

[02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:57.470]
Hey, how are you today?

[02:21:57.690 --> 02:21:57.850]
Great.

[02:21:58.590 --> 02:22:00.470]
Listen, I'm up in Palm Beach County.

[02:22:00.470 --> 02:22:01.470]
How many games?

[02:22:01.930 --> 02:22:05.150]
Marlon Games, you think, will be attending down in Miami this year.

[02:22:05.530 --> 02:22:05.950]
I don't know.

[02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:07.750]
Can you say nine?

[02:22:09.730 --> 02:22:10.030]
Nine?

[02:22:10.610 --> 02:22:10.790]
Nine?

[02:22:11.050 --> 02:22:11.050]

[02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:12.150]
Could you give me a favor?

[02:22:12.350 --> 02:22:13.450]
Just one, one, one, one.

[02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:13.830]
Please.

[02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:15.270]
Play young, Neil.

[02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:21.550]
567-0560-560-560.

[02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:25.550]
I'm going to be on the AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:29.190]
Mobile and Fort Lauderdale.

[02:22:29.290 --> 02:22:29.430]
Hello.

[02:22:30.470 --> 02:22:31.530]
Hey, how's it going?

[02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:32.390]
Great.

[02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.690]
Great.

[02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:35.650]
I got a question for you.

[02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:39.930]
Seeing that is on the Christmas holidays.

[02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:41.430]
You're going to be taking any time off?

[02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:42.150]
No.

[02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:43.430]
No?

[02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:44.290]
Oh, that's good.

[02:22:44.690 --> 02:22:45.630]
I'm looking forward to that.

[02:22:46.390 --> 02:22:48.370]
I'm going to be here on Christmas Day.

[02:22:48.370 --> 02:22:50.310]
I won't be here, but nobody works on Christmas Day.

[02:22:50.310 --> 02:22:52.530]
Oh, but you'll be here today after, right?

[02:22:52.750 --> 02:22:53.170]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:53.730 --> 02:22:54.150]
Oh, great.

[02:22:54.890 --> 02:22:56.110]
Easy for you to say.

[02:22:57.630 --> 02:23:03.010]
Well, yeah, we're all like gathered in the OEOA to see you all for a long, long, late time.

[02:23:04.610 --> 02:23:12.410]
My question to you is, being that you and Janet Reno have a lot of time in...

[02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:12.690]
Uh-huh.

[02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:18.470]
567-0560-560 on the AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:20.970]
Here's a mobile and LRAB, Chilla.

[02:23:21.650 --> 02:23:22.210]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[02:23:22.370 --> 02:23:22.690]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:22.930 --> 02:23:23.830]
Just a quick note.

[02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:27.990]
The state of Florida has a hotline for the hospice care.

[02:23:28.970 --> 02:23:38.110]
I'm sorry, I don't know if it's off the top of my head, but it's all I have to information to give that woman that number, and she can get all kinds of information from that.

[02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.390]
Okay.

[02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:39.250]
Okay.

[02:23:39.450 --> 02:23:39.870]
Thanks a lot.

[02:23:40.110 --> 02:23:40.930]
You're having all of it.

[02:23:40.970 --> 02:23:41.590]
And same to you.

[02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:45.790]
We're a couple of eyes people here at A3, the woman I called for the information and these other two I called her with it.

[02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:47.750]
And it's a miracle that they're still listening at this point.

[02:23:47.770 --> 02:23:49.790]
It's a miracle that anybody could still be listening at this point.

[02:23:49.930 --> 02:23:53.330]
Thanks to the rest of you doing such a wonderful job of bushing up this show today.

[02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:55.030]
But I'll get paid one way or the other.

[02:23:55.210 --> 02:23:57.130]
So this is the best that software can do.

[02:23:57.430 --> 02:23:58.250]
Just keep it going.

[02:23:59.010 --> 02:24:01.390]
We got an hour, nine minutes, fiddle, handkeld be here at two.

[02:24:01.630 --> 02:24:02.710]
And then the ball is in his court.

[02:24:02.970 --> 02:24:04.830]
And the puck and the, uh, police skin.

[02:24:07.490 --> 02:24:10.370]
567-0560-560 on the AT&T line.

[02:24:11.890 --> 02:24:13.070]
Mobile and West Palm Beach.

[02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:13.310]
Hello.

[02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:14.690]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:15.190]
Okay.

[02:24:15.570 --> 02:24:17.290]
Uh, we're listening for the last four or five minutes.

[02:24:17.470 --> 02:24:19.670]
I figured I would call real quick before you blew your brains up.

[02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:20.530]
I don't know how I'm going to follow that.

[02:24:20.530 --> 02:24:21.750]
I'm not going to blow my brains out.

[02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.490]
What's that?

[02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:25.050]
I still not blowing my brains out.

[02:24:25.470 --> 02:24:26.070]
No, I don't.

[02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.870]
You do it.

[02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:27.130]
You do it.

[02:24:27.190 --> 02:24:27.210]
You do it.

[02:24:27.210 --> 02:24:29.370]
You get to hang it in there or roll it into the material you're getting.

[02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:32.450]
Uh, supervising up the stock market.

[02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:34.950]
I'm not about 70% this year.

[02:24:35.090 --> 02:24:36.390]
I got it in April, not March.

[02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:37.710]
And uh, same thing.

[02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:40.970]
So, uh, head deep into tech and uh,

[02:24:41.530 --> 02:24:42.790]
the payment price now.

[02:24:43.090 --> 02:24:43.410]
Definitely.

[02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:45.290]
Yeah, what are you going to do?

[02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:47.410]
I, uh, you got to write, like I said,

[02:24:47.530 --> 02:24:48.470]
having lots of time yet.

[02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:49.630]
Just going to write it out.

[02:24:50.010 --> 02:24:50.350]
Exactly.

[02:24:51.210 --> 02:24:52.770]
And uh, green stands for president.

[02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:53.750]
Not exactly.

[02:24:54.930 --> 02:24:55.590]
Have a good day, Neil.

[02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:55.990]
Okay.

[02:24:56.470 --> 02:24:56.590]
Bye.

[02:24:58.310 --> 02:25:00.130]
That has actually done 147.

[02:25:00.130 --> 02:25:00.730]
That's very nice.

[02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:01.990]
Number 2364.

[02:25:03.130 --> 02:25:04.430]
That was down 151.

[02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:07.390]
Getting some real good economic advice here today.

[02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:09.070]
Almost as good as Mitch Hirsch.

[02:25:10.910 --> 02:25:11.350]
560560,

[02:25:11.650 --> 02:25:14.950]
pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:25:15.770 --> 02:25:16.510]
Here's Miami.

[02:25:16.750 --> 02:25:16.910]
Hello.

[02:25:17.290 --> 02:25:18.250]
And you know, yes sir.

[02:25:19.170 --> 02:25:21.990]
I've used a hospice of power and they're nonprofit.

[02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:24.430]
So there's two different kinds apparently.

[02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.710]
Okay.

[02:25:25.790 --> 02:25:27.370]
Well listen, I don't want to have a discount.

[02:25:27.370 --> 02:25:28.350]
I just want to help out this today.

[02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:30.370]
You know, I just don't want to help the woman out.

[02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:31.150]
Let me go.

[02:25:31.330 --> 02:25:31.570]
Okay.

[02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.510]
Thanks.

[02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.870]
467.7423.

[02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:35.210]
We got it.

[02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.970]
The information now.

[02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.850]
Let's move on.

[02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:37.170]
Please.

[02:25:37.170 --> 02:25:37.390]
Please.

[02:25:38.310 --> 02:25:39.150]
I'm begging you.

[02:25:40.050 --> 02:25:41.570]
I'm not begging you, but I'm suggesting.

[02:25:45.210 --> 02:25:46.570]
Here's a mobile and four-letter mail.

[02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:46.790]
Hello.

[02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:48.110]
Hi Neil.

[02:25:48.450 --> 02:25:48.730]
Yes sir.

[02:25:48.730 --> 02:25:51.450]
Just wanted to say that thanks for signing the Auto Drive last night.

[02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.390]
The...

[02:25:53.390 --> 02:25:54.630]
I feel that was amazing.

[02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:55.130]
Uh-huh.

[02:25:57.490 --> 02:25:58.290]
And it's just...

[02:25:58.290 --> 02:25:58.790]
There's fire smooth.

[02:25:59.930 --> 02:26:00.710]
What is it?

[02:26:00.730 --> 02:26:01.650]
Your phone's crappy now sir.

[02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:02.890]
I'm happy you had a good time.

[02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:13.270]
5667.0560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless freaking mother scratching line.

[02:26:15.410 --> 02:26:16.890]
Here's a mobile and hi, Leah.

[02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.190]

[02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:18.110]
Hi Neil.

[02:26:18.370 --> 02:26:18.670]
Yes sir.

[02:26:18.990 --> 02:26:19.230]
Okay.

[02:26:19.350 --> 02:26:21.390]
The lady they're calling about the...

[02:26:22.490 --> 02:26:27.450]
5667.0560.560 on the AT&T line out of town.

[02:26:27.610 --> 02:26:31.430]
877.785.63.45.

[02:26:31.430 --> 02:26:35.570]
We're not going to be discussing hospices on the show today.

[02:26:35.850 --> 02:26:37.930]
We got the information from two very nice callers.

[02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:39.070]
Thank you very much.

[02:26:39.230 --> 02:26:40.870]
And on we go.

[02:26:41.810 --> 02:26:42.490]
Got it?

[02:26:42.990 --> 02:26:43.330]
You got it?

[02:26:43.410 --> 02:26:43.570]
No.

[02:26:43.790 --> 02:26:43.930]
Oh.

[02:26:45.270 --> 02:26:46.290]
Play that back again.

[02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:48.070]
Here's a mobile and four-letter mail.

[02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.290]
Hello.

[02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:49.590]
Hey Neil.

[02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:50.150]
Yes sir.

[02:26:50.710 --> 02:26:51.070]
Uh-huh.

[02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:54.270]
Wanted to turn a negative into a positive with the stock market.

[02:26:54.530 --> 02:26:54.690]
Yeah.

[02:26:54.990 --> 02:27:00.210]
What you do is you sell out out of your stocks to take a nice capital gain, nice loss on it.

[02:27:00.210 --> 02:27:00.610]
Uh-huh.

[02:27:00.750 --> 02:27:05.810]
And for your tax purposes and then just turn around and buy right back in very similar stocks.

[02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:09.770]
Say just swap one computer company for another.

[02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:12.090]
So if you're in compact, go out and buy a deal.

[02:27:12.370 --> 02:27:17.510]
If you're an IBM buy something else and then you could take a loss.

[02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:19.910]
Why do I need a loss like that?

[02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.730]
Why should I do that?

[02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:25.410]
Well because you're a counter to us you can always even carry it over to next year probably if you need to.

[02:27:25.650 --> 02:27:25.790]
Yeah.

[02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:28.590]
And how do I know how do I know I'm going to make money next year?

[02:27:29.610 --> 02:27:32.890]
Well what if we have a recession in the last three, four years, five years?

[02:27:34.210 --> 02:27:34.770]
Uh-huh.

[02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:35.750]
I doubt that's going to happen.

[02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:36.890]
How do you know that?

[02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:38.950]
Well you look at the history and the trends.

[02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:42.990]
You always have one or two bad down years in the market every ten years or so.

[02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:45.170]
And this is the one bad year that we had.

[02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:48.350]
Things will turn around in the second quarter of the year next year.

[02:27:48.450 --> 02:27:52.030]
Well I mean I'm not going to do something based on the fact that you think that they will.

[02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:55.770]
I'm not going to take off my life savings that I've worked for five years.

[02:27:56.470 --> 02:28:02.030]
And then just take a humongous loss because you're very competent that everything is going to be a hunky-dory.

[02:28:02.590 --> 02:28:04.450]
That doesn't look like an approach in a part one.

[02:28:04.650 --> 02:28:06.310]
You wouldn't be taking the loss.

[02:28:06.490 --> 02:28:12.570]
You just turn around and you buy these very same companies just like different electronic companies, different companies.

[02:28:12.990 --> 02:28:13.810]
But you're missing the point.

[02:28:13.890 --> 02:28:16.630]
It's not like I'm not going to have the same income next year in the year after that.

[02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:18.010]
I'm going to continue having the same income.

[02:28:18.310 --> 02:28:24.410]
So I have enough that I can invest in those years and I can buy all of those companies you're talking about at those deflated prices.

[02:28:24.910 --> 02:28:28.550]
Yeah so you get the best of both worlds because you could be still right back in the market.

[02:28:28.690 --> 02:28:29.870]
You're not giving anything up.

[02:28:30.350 --> 02:28:34.230]
You're just talking in some losses right now and you're still in similar companies.

[02:28:34.690 --> 02:28:35.630]
Maybe you're not in Dell.

[02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:37.550]
Maybe you're now in Compact, whatever it is.

[02:28:37.950 --> 02:28:40.110]
But that's the way that you could turn a negative into a positive.

[02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.930]
Not a chance.

[02:28:41.310 --> 02:28:41.630]
No chance.

[02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:42.210]
No chance.

[02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:43.470]
All right.

[02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:46.330]
Hey. I'm going to say but as you are. I'm getting my ass kicked too.

[02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:49.110]
I'm trying to do exactly what I'm doing right now.

[02:28:49.390 --> 02:28:50.450]
You're selling losses.

[02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:51.330]
Do you take in the loss?

[02:28:51.730 --> 02:28:54.250]
I'm locking in losses and I'm reinvesting immediately.

[02:28:55.050 --> 02:28:55.430]
Immediately?

[02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:59.530]
Yeah. Well the thing is you're not allowed to buy the same company for a period of 60 days.

[02:28:59.670 --> 02:29:01.290]
But you can buy a company just like it.

[02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:03.370]
You can swap one type tech for another.

[02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:05.190]
How do you know that we're duller?

[02:29:05.290 --> 02:29:07.790]
How about us to ask that cost of 1500? What are you going to do then?

[02:29:08.350 --> 02:29:15.150]
Well then you're not really losing anything because you're invested in 50 does do nothing and just sitting on a silent and waiting for everything to turn around.

[02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:19.210]
You're no better. You're no worse off than you normally would have been if you just did nothing.

[02:29:20.010 --> 02:29:21.750]
By doing what I'm telling you to do.

[02:29:22.150 --> 02:29:26.750]
You can only be better off than worse off if you have no intention of ever getting out of the market.

[02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.670]
Good luck, you sir.

[02:29:28.170 --> 02:29:28.670]
I like it.

[02:29:28.750 --> 02:29:28.930]
Okay.

[02:29:30.050 --> 02:29:31.030]
What do you think of that George?

[02:29:34.290 --> 02:29:34.990]
Ask me, church.

[02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:37.790]
No, I'm not asking me, church or that guy.

[02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:44.870]
56670560, you see this is like I told you, like going to the racetrack and you can find a thousand touts.

[02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:53.710]
You just go down on the track side level. Right down there where it's really earthy and gritty where all the degenerates are kicking over the tickets looking to do is hoping somebody dropped the winning ticket.

[02:29:54.330 --> 02:29:57.650]
And everybody's a tout. Everybody's got a tip. Everybody's got something hot going.

[02:29:59.330 --> 02:30:02.610]
I got the winner in this race. Tell me who you think it is and I'll let you know if you're right.

[02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:03.950]
That kind of crap.

[02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:08.530]
No difference. It's exactly the same.

[02:30:09.430 --> 02:30:12.250]
Only this is intellectualized. There's pseudo intellectualized.

[02:30:16.530 --> 02:30:16.970]
1257560WQM.

[02:30:19.350 --> 02:30:25.970]
420560WQAM by Amy Fort Lauderdale, a beastly broadcast group station ham, WQAM.com with a world.

[02:30:26.390 --> 02:30:28.970]
Oh, boy. It's the one to two hour.

[02:30:29.250 --> 02:30:34.070]
Okay, 1259 to 560. It's our big one to two hour. We're going to take 6,000 calls this hour. You watch.

[02:30:34.690 --> 02:30:36.930]
I'm serious. We're going to take a billion calls this hour.

[02:30:36.930 --> 02:30:39.250]
I'm going to get some great economic advice this hour.

[02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:44.030]
Like that last guy says I should take the losses and they'll have them for a rainy day when I need them.

[02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:48.950]
You first pal. You jump first and you know yelled at me when you hit the ground.

[02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.950]
You'll see if you're still alive.

[02:30:51.370 --> 02:30:53.530]
237 votes. Do you think we're going to have a recession?

[02:30:54.650 --> 02:30:56.810]
Yes, it's coming in a recession 231.

[02:30:57.250 --> 02:31:00.110]
We're already in it. 58th. No, the economy will be fine, stupid.

[02:31:00.270 --> 02:31:01.230]
Oh, we'll find.

[02:31:01.410 --> 02:31:05.030]
We're 48. 20% of the people in the audience think everything's okay. It's rosy.

[02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:11.270]
And probably of those 20%. 99% of those people don't have a penny or stock anyway.

[02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:14.270]
Here's a mobile in Boca. Hello.

[02:31:14.650 --> 02:31:15.710]
Hey, Neal. How are you doing today?

[02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:19.390]
Great. That guy before you was the dumbest person I've ever heard.

[02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:20.590]
Where did he go to business school?

[02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:21.290]
He was great.

[02:31:21.310 --> 02:31:22.350]
The losses now.

[02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.750]
Yeah.

[02:31:23.010 --> 02:31:24.550]
You're just the same as you were.

[02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.990]
Uh-huh.

[02:31:25.690 --> 02:31:27.970]
I'm driving in my car driving off 95.

[02:31:28.330 --> 02:31:29.310]
And then he knew my job.

[02:31:29.310 --> 02:31:31.830]
Then he's reinvesting in other companies immediately.

[02:31:32.090 --> 02:31:33.110]
Super stacks of energy.

[02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:34.170]
And he and my life.

[02:31:34.290 --> 02:31:34.410]
Yeah.

[02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:36.010]
It's just amazing.

[02:31:36.610 --> 02:31:38.690]
I mean, people in the jungle are building very soon.

[02:31:38.810 --> 02:31:40.650]
You better watch out for, you know, following people.

[02:31:40.810 --> 02:31:41.130]
Exactly.

[02:31:41.970 --> 02:31:43.010]
It's very exciting.

[02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:45.430]
Every time Green State opens up now, they take the huge dump.

[02:31:46.810 --> 02:31:48.010]
Anyway, have a wonderful holiday.

[02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:49.270]
Okay, and you too.

[02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:53.090]
567.

[02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:54.990]
I'm going to call up and let's do what I need.

[02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:56.290]
We'll call them and I have them to sell everything.

[02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.630]
Take those losses.

[02:31:57.890 --> 02:31:58.690]
And then I'll have them.

[02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:00.270]
You know?

[02:32:00.690 --> 02:32:01.610]
Just in case I need them.

[02:32:05.810 --> 02:32:06.470]
Here's Miami.

[02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:07.050]
Hello.

[02:32:07.050 --> 02:32:08.050]
I'm from the high dogs.

[02:32:08.390 --> 02:32:08.590]
Great.

[02:32:09.130 --> 02:32:10.810]
But the color diff doesn't know.

[02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:12.450]
I'm looking at these stocks market now.

[02:32:12.530 --> 02:32:17.950]
Most of the computer companies are taking giant, bloody, oozing dumps.

[02:32:17.950 --> 02:32:18.730]
That is now.

[02:32:18.810 --> 02:32:20.110]
That was 16 bucks, man.

[02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:23.030]
That's why he has this down 5 already.

[02:32:23.350 --> 02:32:23.570]
Yeah.

[02:32:23.970 --> 02:32:26.510]
I mean, please, okay, doesn't know whatever it is.

[02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:27.970]
He don't know how to smet from Shinoa.

[02:32:28.170 --> 02:32:28.910]
Hey, I'm from the O.

[02:32:29.370 --> 02:32:29.570]
Okay.

[02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:31.150]
Do you explain this to me?

[02:32:31.150 --> 02:32:34.070]
This guy that the color is going to the crapper.

[02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:34.370]
Yeah.

[02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:36.610]
And this guy does not lower the rates.

[02:32:36.770 --> 02:32:37.530]
He stands pat.

[02:32:38.290 --> 02:32:42.090]
And then they say that maybe a lower room when...

[02:32:42.090 --> 02:32:43.330]
Yeah, he left his door open.

[02:32:43.450 --> 02:32:46.250]
In January during the inauguration.

[02:32:46.410 --> 02:32:48.370]
That's how I'm kind of fishy to me.

[02:32:48.570 --> 02:32:49.590]
Not during the inauguration.

[02:32:49.730 --> 02:32:51.570]
The next Fed meeting is January 30th.

[02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:52.250]
It's 10 or 30th.

[02:32:52.250 --> 02:32:53.410]
It's after the inauguration, right?

[02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:55.370]
That's still how I'm kind of fishy to me.

[02:32:55.930 --> 02:32:55.930]

[02:32:56.610 --> 02:32:58.490]
I mean, then he lowers it.

[02:32:58.490 --> 02:33:00.010]
The dial goes up.

[02:33:00.130 --> 02:33:01.010]
Everything goes up.

[02:33:01.790 --> 02:33:04.190]
And then, of course, Mr. Bush comes up saying,

[02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:05.570]
well, you see what I did?

[02:33:05.770 --> 02:33:07.850]
It has nothing to do with Mr. Bush.

[02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:09.410]
You guys are so paranoid.

[02:33:09.410 --> 02:33:10.910]
It's got nothing to do with Mr. Bush.

[02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:13.210]
Mr. Bush doesn't want to come in and preside over.

[02:33:13.450 --> 02:33:15.810]
The worst recession since when Papa was in there.

[02:33:16.190 --> 02:33:16.370]
All right.

[02:33:17.450 --> 02:33:19.870]
It's got to do with the fact that Alan Greenspan is an arrogant,

[02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:21.810]
egotistical, seen-out world prick.

[02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:24.990]
That's what it's got to do with a hard-ass who refuses to deal with reality.

[02:33:25.290 --> 02:33:25.970]
He doesn't get it.

[02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:26.670]
Yeah.

[02:33:27.370 --> 02:33:27.810]
Oh, well.

[02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:30.270]
He just wants to put the brick on everything

[02:33:30.270 --> 02:33:32.410]
and just boil the party for everybody.

[02:33:32.490 --> 02:33:33.330]
I say screw him.

[02:33:33.450 --> 02:33:33.930]
That's what I say.

[02:33:34.490 --> 02:33:35.410]
Let's get a lynch mob.

[02:33:35.850 --> 02:33:35.850]

[02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:40.330]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T,

[02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:41.810]
and Verizon Wireless One.

[02:33:41.930 --> 02:33:42.150]
Look at that.

[02:33:42.310 --> 02:33:43.490]
NASDAQ down 152.

[02:33:43.810 --> 02:33:45.470]
See, I don't know what everybody's getting all screaming

[02:33:45.470 --> 02:33:48.450]
because by the end of the week, the NASDAQ's only going to be about 6.

[02:33:50.430 --> 02:33:52.310]
Well, maybe I'm exaggerating.

[02:33:52.350 --> 02:33:53.610]
By the end of the week, it'll be about 8.

[02:33:54.170 --> 02:33:55.690]
I'm not talking about individual stock.

[02:33:55.690 --> 02:33:56.470]
I mean, the whole thing.

[02:33:57.090 --> 02:33:59.250]
Instead of this like 2300, it'll just be 8.

[02:34:02.430 --> 02:34:04.230]
And boy, it's like I've told you a million times,

[02:34:04.430 --> 02:34:06.130]
it's so easy to deal with those small numbers.

[02:34:07.430 --> 02:34:08.150]
Nothing complicated.

[02:34:08.350 --> 02:34:10.610]
Don't need no computer, slide rule, advocates.

[02:34:12.430 --> 02:34:13.650]
Here's a mobile and park land.

[02:34:13.770 --> 02:34:13.910]
Hello.

[02:34:14.550 --> 02:34:15.290]
How are you doing, Neil?

[02:34:15.450 --> 02:34:15.630]
Great.

[02:34:16.110 --> 02:34:16.430]
Good.

[02:34:16.970 --> 02:34:20.510]
I think what the guy meant actually was for tax purposes, tax law.

[02:34:20.510 --> 02:34:22.310]
No, I understood what he's saying, but that's ridiculous.

[02:34:22.610 --> 02:34:24.050]
I mean, that's based on if-com.

[02:34:24.050 --> 02:34:25.210]
How do I know I'm going to need that?

[02:34:25.270 --> 02:34:27.790]
How I don't know I'm going to make that money back this year or next year?

[02:34:27.850 --> 02:34:29.190]
I mean, that's stupid.

[02:34:29.970 --> 02:34:33.070]
I don't necessarily disagree, but I understand where he's coming from.

[02:34:33.310 --> 02:34:33.490]
Uh-huh.

[02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:35.510]
I got a question for you actually.

[02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:42.390]
Why does it seem like reverend-shopting or reverend-jaxing continually play the race card?

[02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:45.930]
Because they're both, that's their business.

[02:34:46.290 --> 02:34:47.050]
Because they're both opportunists.

[02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:51.450]
You know, they're both exploiters of human misery and tragedy,

[02:34:51.490 --> 02:34:53.050]
and that's the way they make their money.

[02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:54.050]
It's very frustrating.

[02:34:55.690 --> 02:34:58.550]
And they both have, they've disconnected early, both happen to be reverends.

[02:34:59.010 --> 02:34:59.170]
Yeah.

[02:34:59.730 --> 02:35:01.050]
That's very interesting to me.

[02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:06.010]
Because it seems to me that they wouldn't maybe be promoting peace as opposed to hatred,

[02:35:06.270 --> 02:35:08.750]
which I believe that's what they're actually doing.

[02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:10.050]
Dividing conquer, man.

[02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:15.950]
You know, I mean, I would imagine that some of my relatives in the past, you know,

[02:35:16.050 --> 02:35:21.030]
let's say 125 years ago, may have had a bit of an issue with some African-Americans,

[02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:24.270]
but I would have to say over the last 60 years or so.

[02:35:24.970 --> 02:35:25.610]
Uh-uh.

[02:35:25.610 --> 02:35:30.590]
I don't think that, that, that, new personally, has had any issues with anyone of different color.

[02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:34.910]
And it's very frustrating to me to have other people who are off-color.

[02:35:35.410 --> 02:35:41.590]
So, yeah, they're being held back by the white boy, you know, and, and, and it's very frustrating to me,

[02:35:41.650 --> 02:35:46.470]
because, uh, you know, we go out of our way to try to make everybody peaceful.

[02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:47.150]
Well, not everyone.

[02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:49.670]
Not everyone does that, but I do my part for this country.

[02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:53.830]
I hope, uh, to make everybody, uh, live together.

[02:35:54.190 --> 02:35:56.230]
And I'm promoting that with my children as well.

[02:35:56.590 --> 02:36:01.570]
And I just hate to see, uh, people like that on the TV promoting, uh, additional hatred.

[02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:05.770]
Well, that's, that's what the media specializes in, is being a platform for assholes like that.

[02:36:05.790 --> 02:36:06.790]
So, it's not going to change.

[02:36:07.370 --> 02:36:08.630]
Well, yeah, I'm happy, how are they?

[02:36:08.770 --> 02:36:13.110]
I just wanted to bring that point up and change the subject away from, uh, some of the tax losses.

[02:36:13.210 --> 02:36:13.710]
Thank God.

[02:36:13.850 --> 02:36:14.650]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:36:14.730 --> 02:36:14.990]
Thank you.

[02:36:15.050 --> 02:36:15.310]
Thank you.

[02:36:15.310 --> 02:36:18.710]
So, we have something uplifting, like, uh, the fact we got those two assholes running around.

[02:36:19.530 --> 02:36:22.270]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 50, pound 5, 50 on the 18.

[02:36:22.410 --> 02:36:25.390]
And you, you mark my words that are going to do this, uh, uh, vocouting the vote.

[02:36:25.450 --> 02:36:26.150]
They're already doing it.

[02:36:26.170 --> 02:36:29.270]
The newspaper organizations around the state, and they're going to come up with a different total.

[02:36:29.370 --> 02:36:30.730]
It's going to prove what we all knew anyway.

[02:36:30.810 --> 02:36:34.650]
At least those of us who were honest, they grow a really one-election, and that bush in this people's store.

[02:36:34.850 --> 02:36:35.770]
And then, and then what?

[02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:36.730]
What's that kind of accomplish?

[02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:42.330]
And then we can have just unbelievable, much worse than we already had from months on in.

[02:36:42.330 --> 02:36:44.530]
Hate to it and bitterness and psychosis.

[02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:45.450]
And that's great.

[02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:46.530]
That's terrific.

[02:36:47.430 --> 02:36:50.390]
And with the way the economy is going right now, you would think, Goa is probably saying,

[02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:52.630]
all year as George, baby, better you than me.

[02:36:52.970 --> 02:36:55.490]
And it's probably when they had that short meeting yesterday, as probably what he said.

[02:36:56.010 --> 02:36:56.770]
Good luck, your sweetheart.

[02:36:57.330 --> 02:36:58.170]
Here's a slide rule.

[02:37:00.650 --> 02:37:02.770]
It just keeps sliding out three hours to go today.

[02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:05.570]
I mean, it's not even close to a market closing in 405.

[02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:08.310]
And it's just sliding and sliding and sliding.

[02:37:09.290 --> 02:37:12.250]
I think it's time to take my losses, George, like a man.

[02:37:13.810 --> 02:37:14.810]
Here's Sport Lauderdale.

[02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:15.050]
Hello.

[02:37:16.030 --> 02:37:16.370]
Hey, Neil.

[02:37:16.590 --> 02:37:16.890]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:17.370 --> 02:37:19.590]
Hey, the pick of the day is some microsystems.

[02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:20.750]
Yeah, I got it.

[02:37:21.730 --> 02:37:22.970]
Support 25 and 8.

[02:37:23.390 --> 02:37:24.150]
You watch this one.

[02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:25.470]
It's running only stock up today.

[02:37:25.650 --> 02:37:26.190]
That's the one.

[02:37:26.310 --> 02:37:27.030]
It's 27.

[02:37:27.470 --> 02:37:29.830]
Okay, I'm telling you, the support is 25.

[02:37:30.010 --> 02:37:30.870]
Boy, listen out there.

[02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.390]
Buy it.

[02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:32.890]
It's down 10 days a row.

[02:37:33.330 --> 02:37:37.370]
The Japanese believes from 8 to 10 days down in a row, the stock has to bounce.

[02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:38.810]
It's going for a bounce.

[02:37:39.390 --> 02:37:39.670]
Okay.

[02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:41.130]
Thanks for the good news.

[02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:41.610]
I got it.

[02:37:41.650 --> 02:37:42.650]
Of course, I bought it at $38.

[02:37:43.430 --> 02:37:43.950]
I'm Friday.

[02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:45.570]
But that's okay.

[02:37:45.610 --> 02:37:46.370]
I'm not worried about some microsystems.

[02:37:47.090 --> 02:37:47.630]
It's a great company.

[02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:49.670]
Just like I'm not worried about Cisco, even though my church is.

[02:37:49.710 --> 02:37:50.590]
Cisco is a great company.

[02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:52.150]
I don't give a crap what it is right now.

[02:37:52.210 --> 02:37:52.670]
It's $37.

[02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:53.370]
It's even terrible.

[02:37:54.890 --> 02:37:56.030]
I bought it at $47.

[02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:57.710]
Am I pissed off that I didn't buy a cheaper?

[02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:58.130]
You bet.

[02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:58.790]
But that's okay.

[02:37:59.030 --> 02:38:00.210]
Am I worried I'm going to lose money on it?

[02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.370]
No.

[02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:03.770]
Now, when you buy great companies, you shouldn't be concerned about it.

[02:38:03.970 --> 02:38:04.650]
You shouldn't be panicking.

[02:38:04.910 --> 02:38:05.670]
You know what I'm saying, George?

[02:38:06.270 --> 02:38:07.210]
You shouldn't be panicking.

[02:38:07.210 --> 02:38:07.210]

[02:38:09.890 --> 02:38:11.430]
Son of Microsoft, see this guy?

[02:38:11.730 --> 02:38:12.590]
I wonder how much he's got.

[02:38:12.670 --> 02:38:14.170]
Probably got it with both hands up to a zero.

[02:38:14.370 --> 02:38:15.170]
Bye, bye, bye.

[02:38:15.330 --> 02:38:15.650]
That's right.

[02:38:15.810 --> 02:38:18.050]
Call up your broker right now by at least a thousand cherries.

[02:38:19.730 --> 02:38:20.730]
Here's a mobile in broker.

[02:38:20.890 --> 02:38:21.050]
Hello?

[02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.950]
Hey, Neon.

[02:38:21.950 --> 02:38:22.310]
How are you?

[02:38:22.390 --> 02:38:22.550]
Great.

[02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.630]
Hey, listen.

[02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:25.710]
I know you stole some of my fund.

[02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:27.850]
I'm in the business still to speak for 16 years.

[02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.230]
Uh-huh.

[02:38:28.630 --> 02:38:31.650]
And some of the information you're getting, I don't know,

[02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:32.510]
where do you think it is?

[02:38:32.650 --> 02:38:33.890]
I haven't been getting any information.

[02:38:33.890 --> 02:38:35.830]
I've just been hearing the rambling of crazy people.

[02:38:35.970 --> 02:38:36.870]
I haven't had any information.

[02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:39.550]
Up till last caller was giving me a song to dance about a stuck hour.

[02:38:39.730 --> 02:38:42.630]
I already like that guy actually told you to sell everything, go to cash,

[02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:44.950]
and then buy other losers so you can lose more money.

[02:38:45.090 --> 02:38:45.230]
Right.

[02:38:46.830 --> 02:38:47.850]
Obviously, don't panic.

[02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:51.750]
Let me give you a take on the green span that maybe is more factual.

[02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.330]
Okay.

[02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:55.370]
The guy really doesn't know what he's doing.

[02:38:55.490 --> 02:38:56.410]
He is an old commogen.

[02:38:57.170 --> 02:38:59.170]
And he's following what's called Phillips curve,

[02:38:59.310 --> 02:39:02.050]
which is like 50-year-old economics with unemployment.

[02:39:02.650 --> 02:39:06.070]
The bottom line is, even if you were to raise rates in January,

[02:39:06.810 --> 02:39:08.830]
this economy is going to have-

[02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:10.730]
Wait a minute, if you were to raise rates in January?

[02:39:11.070 --> 02:39:11.470]
No, I'm sorry.

[02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:12.690]
If you're a low rate, I'm sorry.

[02:39:13.330 --> 02:39:14.930]
If you're a low rate, it's too late.

[02:39:15.930 --> 02:39:19.010]
And the economy is going to have negative growth,

[02:39:19.210 --> 02:39:21.150]
probably in the fourth quarter or first quarter.

[02:39:22.130 --> 02:39:24.630]
So for the next six months, it's basically dead money.

[02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:25.010]
Right.

[02:39:25.970 --> 02:39:27.170]
But the only good companies,

[02:39:27.730 --> 02:39:30.670]
but I will tell you, if you own the Yahoo's or the Amazon,

[02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:32.530]
I don't have one dime.

[02:39:32.670 --> 02:39:35.610]
Not only of those companies, but of any mutual funds that have those companies.

[02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:36.690]
Good. Good.

[02:39:37.090 --> 02:39:38.410]
I mean, the stocks you own are good.

[02:39:38.450 --> 02:39:39.590]
Like, I'm getting killed too.

[02:39:40.010 --> 02:39:43.410]
But I will tell you, if you own these Yahoo's or these eBay's or that crap,

[02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:44.550]
they're not going to come back.

[02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:47.850]
But other than that, really, don't look at the paper.

[02:39:48.110 --> 02:39:49.490]
Don't worry about what's going on.

[02:39:49.530 --> 02:39:50.110]
You'll be fine.

[02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:51.730]
And what about Citrix and Dish TV?

[02:39:53.470 --> 02:39:54.930]
Ah, now he's laughing, see.

[02:39:56.110 --> 02:39:57.070]
Well, I'll tell you what.

[02:39:57.070 --> 02:40:01.470]
I know a lot of people that own these dishes and these DSL things,

[02:40:01.470 --> 02:40:03.350]
and that was other bubble mites.

[02:40:04.850 --> 02:40:05.910]
They're never going to make money.

[02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.450]
They don't know how to.

[02:40:08.270 --> 02:40:12.010]
But unfortunately, Greenstan, all this crap about bullish stuff,

[02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:12.790]
that's nothing.

[02:40:13.470 --> 02:40:14.830]
Greenstan is not going to listen to both.

[02:40:14.930 --> 02:40:15.930]
She's not going to listen to anybody.

[02:40:16.050 --> 02:40:17.650]
He's too eagletistical.

[02:40:18.890 --> 02:40:20.890]
And he should have a lower rate, but he didn't.

[02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:22.170]
And now we're going to pay the price.

[02:40:22.310 --> 02:40:22.970]
We're going to have a recession.

[02:40:23.370 --> 02:40:24.470]
If I can draw on an allergy,

[02:40:24.470 --> 02:40:28.130]
it seems to me that Alan Greenspan is like the Pope of the financial world.

[02:40:28.510 --> 02:40:29.770]
He's a senior old man.

[02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:31.810]
Only he's a better dresser, but not by much.

[02:40:32.930 --> 02:40:35.450]
Well, I think if he wore the hat, he'd look better.

[02:40:35.590 --> 02:40:36.730]
Yeah, a little smother might help.

[02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:38.150]
Hey, happy Hanukkah, see you later.

[02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.610]
Same to you.

[02:40:38.810 --> 02:40:39.230]
Bye-bye.

[02:40:39.390 --> 02:40:39.630]
Good luck.

[02:40:40.170 --> 02:40:41.110]
See, there he goes. I feel better.

[02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:42.190]
Now there's a rational guy.

[02:40:42.370 --> 02:40:44.950]
Of course, he's in a business, so he's maybe blowing a little bit of smoke.

[02:40:45.210 --> 02:40:46.530]
But I think he knows what he's talking about.

[02:40:47.850 --> 02:40:48.170]
Right?

[02:40:49.710 --> 02:40:51.190]
And what do I tell you about that dish TV?

[02:40:51.290 --> 02:40:52.370]
It's only a couple hundred cheers,

[02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:53.870]
but I didn't want in the first place.

[02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:55.330]
Maybe Mitch will like to buy me out.

[02:40:55.350 --> 02:40:56.190]
I'll sell two of them at 40.

[02:40:56.330 --> 02:40:56.890]
I'll be a nice guy.

[02:40:57.130 --> 02:40:57.270]
Yeah.

[02:40:58.130 --> 02:40:59.290]
It's 25 right now.

[02:40:59.410 --> 02:41:00.590]
He should have his money back in no time.

[02:41:00.810 --> 02:41:01.490]
What do you say, Mitch?

[02:41:02.250 --> 02:41:03.030]
A mens will do it.

[02:41:04.050 --> 02:41:04.790]
He's not a mens.

[02:41:05.170 --> 02:41:06.190]
He's a little twerp.

[02:41:07.690 --> 02:41:08.790]
Ask Rimmer, he'll tell you.

[02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.510]
All right, geez.

[02:41:11.390 --> 02:41:14.670]
Nine minutes after one at five sixty-double-two QA.

[02:41:20.190 --> 02:41:21.930]
I got a starting ride.

[02:41:22.890 --> 02:41:24.850]
I guess he's getting tight.

[02:41:25.790 --> 02:41:28.290]
I can let the wrong cow go in a hole.

[02:41:29.170 --> 02:41:29.650]
I'm a child.

[02:41:31.410 --> 02:41:32.050]
I'm a puppet.

[02:41:33.610 --> 02:41:35.310]
And I'll see the two good.

[02:41:35.770 --> 02:41:37.830]
I think I might buy the farm.

[02:41:39.150 --> 02:41:40.410]
Hi, I'm Darrell Hall.

[02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:42.570]
You know, even though my hair looks really good,

[02:41:42.910 --> 02:41:45.110]
I got a great bod and all the women really love me.

[02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:46.110]
I got a problem.

[02:41:46.590 --> 02:41:47.510]
Hi, cholesterol.

[02:41:48.070 --> 02:41:49.890]
So that's why I ate this new,

[02:41:49.890 --> 02:41:51.270]
Holland Oat Brown cereal.

[02:41:51.870 --> 02:41:53.410]
Every tastey little flake of shape,

[02:41:53.550 --> 02:41:54.570]
just like my partner, John,

[02:41:54.850 --> 02:41:56.710]
set their bigger and they don't hold back my career.

[02:41:57.070 --> 02:41:59.210]
Anyway, before you've lost that living feeling,

[02:41:59.570 --> 02:42:01.790]
rock and roll with a healthy bowl of Holland Oat Brown.

[02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:04.290]
Hey, it's the only thing I like better than me.

[02:42:04.770 --> 02:42:09.530]
I'll try a bowl at the mint and chew out.

[02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:11.790]
Try some hot doggo.

[02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:14.090]
Be a friend, eater.

[02:42:14.530 --> 02:42:17.730]
Holland Oat Brown cereal from the makers of Guns and Raisins.

[02:42:18.310 --> 02:42:20.230]
I will go have a bowl.

[02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:22.330]
Be a friend, eater.

[02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:26.790]
Once 14 to 5.60 WQM,

[02:42:26.810 --> 02:42:29.010]
I want to go one of the worst shows in the history of this program.

[02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:31.910]
I'm going to tell you this has been right in my memoirs.

[02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:33.190]
That's how bad this has been today.

[02:42:33.630 --> 02:42:35.570]
And there are two calls in the board right now as I speak.

[02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:37.070]
Kids out of school in Dave County,

[02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:38.390]
and we're finally figuring that out.

[02:42:38.390 --> 02:42:39.170]
We're a little slow on it.

[02:42:39.390 --> 02:42:40.730]
I shouldn't know because I came to the schools

[02:42:40.730 --> 02:42:42.670]
on this morning and the lights were not flashing.

[02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:45.650]
No school today in Dave County.

[02:42:45.650 --> 02:42:48.770]
So automatically that's way behind the eighth ball on that.

[02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:52.130]
5.6705.60,

[02:42:52.410 --> 02:42:55.310]
pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon Marlos Line.

[02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:57.190]
Plus we got Hanukkah coming tomorrow night.

[02:42:57.570 --> 02:42:58.990]
So you put those two ingredients together

[02:42:58.990 --> 02:43:00.790]
and you got the recipe for desperation.

[02:43:01.370 --> 02:43:02.150]
Which means starting tomorrow,

[02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:04.490]
we're playing like bits and stuff through the end of the year.

[02:43:05.690 --> 02:43:06.370]
Kibbles and bits.

[02:43:07.570 --> 02:43:08.430]
Here's the sunrise.

[02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.750]
Hello.

[02:43:09.310 --> 02:43:09.750]
Hi Neil.

[02:43:10.050 --> 02:43:10.310]
Yes sir.

[02:43:10.850 --> 02:43:13.590]
Hey, was that guy in Cornwall a while ago for real or what?

[02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:16.610]
The guy who said, oh, maybe 125 years ago,

[02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:19.610]
some of my ancestors had trouble with the colored people,

[02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:21.510]
but not in the last 60 years.

[02:43:21.610 --> 02:43:24.130]
What planet did I, what is he talking about?

[02:43:24.290 --> 02:43:24.910]
He likes everybody.

[02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:26.530]
Right?

[02:43:26.730 --> 02:43:28.750]
It's like, when he talks about peace.

[02:43:29.410 --> 02:43:30.630]
It's like when they wake up and say,

[02:43:30.810 --> 02:43:32.310]
and then they say, come on, you're not mad, are you?

[02:43:32.610 --> 02:43:33.870]
Come on, let's take peace.

[02:43:34.250 --> 02:43:34.370]
Yeah.

[02:43:35.550 --> 02:43:36.510]
But what does he got to think?

[02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:38.250]
Did we got to get an arrest of 60 years?

[02:43:38.310 --> 02:43:40.270]
There was no problem.

[02:43:40.270 --> 02:43:43.250]
And then, racial lives in this country, what does that mean?

[02:43:43.730 --> 02:43:44.510]
What is the point?

[02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:45.670]
Why is this productive?

[02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:48.590]
Well, yeah, his call was counterproductive,

[02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:49.270]
that's what I'm saying.

[02:43:49.390 --> 02:43:51.110]
So, then why are you wasting your time talking about it?

[02:43:51.130 --> 02:43:52.850]
It was on the face of it, it was absurd.

[02:43:53.450 --> 02:43:53.950]
You're right now.

[02:43:54.270 --> 02:43:55.230]
I just feel like pointing out.

[02:43:55.250 --> 02:43:55.650]
Feel better.

[02:43:55.950 --> 02:43:56.190]
Okay.

[02:43:56.410 --> 02:43:56.650]
Okay.

[02:43:56.850 --> 02:43:57.910]
Take two and call us so tomorrow.

[02:43:59.190 --> 02:44:00.550]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:02.290]
pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T,

[02:44:02.410 --> 02:44:03.410]
and Verizon wireless line.

[02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:06.290]
See, there's some things that are never going to change.

[02:44:06.410 --> 02:44:07.510]
It's just like I told you yesterday,

[02:44:07.730 --> 02:44:08.270]
and I'll say it again.

[02:44:08.270 --> 02:44:11.290]
I hope I'm wrong, but this community in Dave County, especially,

[02:44:11.370 --> 02:44:13.870]
but South Florida, this is always going to be a battle zone.

[02:44:14.290 --> 02:44:15.030]
Always will be.

[02:44:16.530 --> 02:44:19.210]
The politicians will make sure the special interests people

[02:44:19.210 --> 02:44:21.010]
will make sure it just always will be.

[02:44:21.290 --> 02:44:23.330]
And the people who are here don't give a crap about making

[02:44:23.330 --> 02:44:24.790]
any different anyway, because they hate each other,

[02:44:24.810 --> 02:44:27.190]
they're such a degree, that they thrive on it.

[02:44:27.430 --> 02:44:28.130]
They fell from it.

[02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:31.510]
Here's a mobile-invoting beach.

[02:44:31.710 --> 02:44:31.710]

[02:44:32.330 --> 02:44:33.170]
Can you hear me?

[02:44:33.290 --> 02:44:34.450]
I'm clapping, so.

[02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:35.370]
Here you're fine.

[02:44:35.810 --> 02:44:37.490]
I just got back from Vegas.

[02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:38.370]
I called you Friday.

[02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:40.710]
I'm unbelievable.

[02:44:40.990 --> 02:44:43.010]
I bet you the Bellagio fountain show.

[02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:45.410]
Now, one last thing.

[02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:47.810]
Well, what even one last thing?

[02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:48.810]
What was the first thing?

[02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.730]
What was anyway last thing?

[02:44:49.730 --> 02:44:52.050]
Well, you know, it's everything you say, and it's more.

[02:44:52.330 --> 02:44:53.730]
It's just, it was incredible.

[02:44:54.030 --> 02:44:54.850]
There's so much to do.

[02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:56.790]
I'm going to be, you've walked down the A1A,

[02:44:57.170 --> 02:44:59.030]
and I have how close with shows and...

[02:44:59.690 --> 02:45:01.430]
Don't worry about talking about it.

[02:45:01.530 --> 02:45:03.350]
Because it will never happen, so don't worry about it.

[02:45:03.350 --> 02:45:04.570]
It's a breathing out, but it's still lovely.

[02:45:05.310 --> 02:45:07.010]
You can't have a bad time there.

[02:45:07.310 --> 02:45:07.310]

[02:45:07.850 --> 02:45:08.290]
That was it?

[02:45:08.810 --> 02:45:09.030]
Okay.

[02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:12.030]
You had a good time in Vegas.

[02:45:15.430 --> 02:45:15.990]
Me too.

[02:45:17.410 --> 02:45:18.150]
Yeah, me too.

[02:45:19.570 --> 02:45:20.510]
Probably just a coincidence.

[02:45:22.050 --> 02:45:23.330]
5.6705.60.

[02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:24.450]
Probably got the big panther.

[02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:25.190]
Penguin gave it to that.

[02:45:25.250 --> 02:45:26.670]
Everybody fired up for that, huh?

[02:45:28.750 --> 02:45:29.190]
Oh.

[02:45:30.410 --> 02:45:31.590]
Oh my god.

[02:45:31.590 --> 02:45:34.310]
If you looked up Deadhead in the dictionary,

[02:45:35.110 --> 02:45:36.810]
you just see a map of the state of Florida,

[02:45:36.950 --> 02:45:37.830]
giant penis, you'll know.

[02:45:38.610 --> 02:45:39.430]
And it would be.

[02:45:45.450 --> 02:45:46.470]
Here's Pompano, hello.

[02:45:46.970 --> 02:45:47.130]
Neil.

[02:45:47.430 --> 02:45:47.710]
Yes, sir.

[02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:51.070]
You're talking about you wanted to raise the level of the show.

[02:45:51.310 --> 02:45:52.410]
You need to talk about the issues.

[02:45:52.690 --> 02:45:55.150]
You're not talking about the issues, then you're talking about stupid things

[02:45:55.150 --> 02:45:56.090]
like the part and sounds.

[02:45:56.310 --> 02:45:57.410]
That's why you have a dead audience.

[02:45:57.710 --> 02:45:58.870]
Yeah, I'm not sure.

[02:45:59.090 --> 02:46:00.630]
Why do you listen to them?

[02:46:01.210 --> 02:46:02.450]
Because there's nothing else to do.

[02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:06.510]
5.6705.60.

[02:46:06.650 --> 02:46:07.070]
Thanks a lot.

[02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:08.550]
That was Kevin Baxter from The Hero.

[02:46:11.050 --> 02:46:12.330]
Raise the level of the discussion.

[02:46:12.890 --> 02:46:14.250]
Here's the guy's telling me how to do the show,

[02:46:14.370 --> 02:46:15.830]
but he's listening to says nothing else to do.

[02:46:16.430 --> 02:46:18.310]
So you just, it's the last part of what you said.

[02:46:18.450 --> 02:46:19.270]
You put your thumb on it.

[02:46:19.430 --> 02:46:20.310]
There's nothing else to do.

[02:46:20.830 --> 02:46:22.330]
Because this is the end of the world.

[02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:25.710]
Here's Bokeh.

[02:46:25.710 --> 02:46:25.850]
Hello.

[02:46:26.430 --> 02:46:26.750]
Hi.

[02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:27.370]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:28.270]
Hi there.

[02:46:28.270 --> 02:46:30.690]
I just wanted to say I love your show, great show.

[02:46:31.290 --> 02:46:34.950]
I just came from New York last week and there's nothing like you up there.

[02:46:35.310 --> 02:46:36.890]
There's nothing like these collars up there either.

[02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:41.410]
Listen, I want to say I want to see the penguins kick tonight.

[02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:44.850]
And they probably will.

[02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:47.870]
Yes, probably pissed off about losing the panties up there last week.

[02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:50.570]
Listen, what I'm really calling about is,

[02:46:50.790 --> 02:46:54.330]
yesterday you made a comment about programs on radio, how they suck.

[02:46:55.250 --> 02:46:59.630]
I just wanted to say you mentioned Dr. Bore and I know the sound.

[02:47:00.690 --> 02:47:00.910]
I don't know.

[02:47:01.430 --> 02:47:02.730]
I really, really respect that show.

[02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:04.570]
I think that is one of the few quality shows.

[02:47:04.590 --> 02:47:06.450]
We respect that show based on what?

[02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:11.750]
Based on, based on the fact that she's a white wing fanatical born again,

[02:47:12.730 --> 02:47:15.790]
Orthodox Jew, who's Sue Spew's hate,

[02:47:16.170 --> 02:47:18.710]
and then she said to genius that her TV show has been canceled.

[02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:23.310]
Now actually what I like about her is that she tried to set people straight

[02:47:23.310 --> 02:47:24.690]
in a more, at least in a whole lot of ways.

[02:47:24.690 --> 02:47:26.830]
So I think it was great was that just to play on words?

[02:47:27.130 --> 02:47:27.590]
Excuse me?

[02:47:27.970 --> 02:47:28.270]
Great?

[02:47:28.770 --> 02:47:30.150]
Okay, I'm sorry I didn't pick up on that.

[02:47:30.650 --> 02:47:32.350]
I'm sorry about that, nothing personal.

[02:47:32.890 --> 02:47:33.750]
No, but what I'm saying is...

[02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:35.870]
I would take it first, I mean she's a bigoted bitch.

[02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:39.950]
She hates men and she, her whole object is just to put down men and put them in a place

[02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:43.290]
and to show everybody what a wonderful person she is and how much better she is

[02:47:43.290 --> 02:47:44.710]
since she married an Orthodox Jew.

[02:47:46.030 --> 02:47:47.190]
I'm not a way to choose Orthodox.

[02:47:47.850 --> 02:47:48.410]
Well, she is.

[02:47:49.010 --> 02:47:50.690]
She's a fanatical Orthodox Jew.

[02:47:50.690 --> 02:47:53.550]
Not just Orthodox, she's even more Orthodox than Jew Lieberman.

[02:47:54.270 --> 02:47:54.630]
Really?

[02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:55.170]
Yes.

[02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:59.250]
Okay, now let's put this way.

[02:47:59.330 --> 02:48:01.690]
There are a lot of people running around out there that don't have any direction at all.

[02:48:01.850 --> 02:48:03.710]
I think she does give some sort of direction to people.

[02:48:03.770 --> 02:48:04.930]
Sir, let me say this to you.

[02:48:05.290 --> 02:48:09.330]
If anybody thinks that they're going to get direction for their lives from a radio show,

[02:48:09.690 --> 02:48:12.050]
those people need to be put in an institution somewhere.

[02:48:12.470 --> 02:48:14.530]
Yeah, but at least there's a voice out there that people...

[02:48:14.530 --> 02:48:15.350]
A voice saying what?

[02:48:15.450 --> 02:48:17.470]
What is it that she says that you find so compelling?

[02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:19.070]
It's what exact.

[02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:20.250]
Yeah, there's not one specific thing.

[02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:21.670]
Well, they're just generally speaking.

[02:48:21.870 --> 02:48:24.810]
What is the message that she conveys that you find so compelling?

[02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:31.350]
That we have to put ourselves aside for other people, for our children, for our...

[02:48:31.350 --> 02:48:36.150]
Putting aside our comfort for the betterment of...

[02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:36.930]
For children, Hayter.

[02:48:37.390 --> 02:48:37.530]
Yeah.

[02:48:37.870 --> 02:48:38.290]
For what?

[02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:39.930]
For children, Hayter liked poison.

[02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.710]
How do you know that?

[02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:42.410]
Because they talk about it exactly.

[02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:44.270]
What she has...

[02:48:44.270 --> 02:48:45.910]
For her first marriage.

[02:48:46.690 --> 02:48:47.470]
For her first marriage.

[02:48:47.470 --> 02:48:48.910]
Yeah, Hayter liked poison.

[02:48:49.150 --> 02:48:49.550]
Uh-huh.

[02:48:50.450 --> 02:48:53.610]
Okay, well, I don't know anything about her personal life.

[02:48:53.710 --> 02:48:57.250]
But if you don't only think about her personal life, why do you give me a song that ends

[02:48:57.250 --> 02:48:58.210]
about how she's given...

[02:48:58.210 --> 02:49:00.370]
But I don't know how that you're personal life.

[02:49:00.590 --> 02:49:02.770]
I mean, your personal life, and I respect you over the radio.

[02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:04.210]
I think a lot of your views are correct.

[02:49:04.210 --> 02:49:05.750]
What do you mean you respect me over the radio?

[02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:06.930]
This is a radio show.

[02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:07.810]
You don't know me.

[02:49:07.970 --> 02:49:09.210]
How can you say you respect me?

[02:49:09.230 --> 02:49:10.150]
It's a radio show.

[02:49:10.830 --> 02:49:11.270]
So what?

[02:49:11.470 --> 02:49:12.570]
But who's on the radio show you?

[02:49:12.810 --> 02:49:13.590]
I'm listening to your views.

[02:49:13.690 --> 02:49:14.290]
I respect them.

[02:49:14.290 --> 02:49:15.090]
No, no.

[02:49:15.090 --> 02:49:18.510]
I respect my views as one thing, but you know respect me because you don't know me.

[02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:19.630]
But they know that too.

[02:49:19.690 --> 02:49:20.030]
That's the exact same.

[02:49:20.190 --> 02:49:20.870]
That's the lower show.

[02:49:21.090 --> 02:49:21.210]
That's the exact same.

[02:49:21.210 --> 02:49:22.150]
That's the lower show.

[02:49:22.390 --> 02:49:24.390]
And she is a spreader of virulent hate.

[02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:25.490]
That's Dr. Laura.

[02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:28.030]
She's a homophobic, white-wing bitch.

[02:49:29.650 --> 02:49:30.550]
Anything else, sir?

[02:49:32.030 --> 02:49:32.490]
Um...

[02:49:32.490 --> 02:49:33.150]
Have a great day.

[02:49:33.450 --> 02:49:34.030]
I'm back to you.

[02:49:34.350 --> 02:49:34.610]
Why?

[02:49:34.930 --> 02:49:35.470]
I just see you.

[02:49:35.470 --> 02:49:36.570]
Get her off this air.

[02:49:36.650 --> 02:49:38.650]
Get that bitch off my show now.

[02:49:41.050 --> 02:49:41.690]
Unless you're...

[02:49:41.690 --> 02:49:42.450]
Unless you're stuck.

[02:49:42.450 --> 02:49:44.170]
I'm so much to the radio retire.

[02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:46.390]
Keep that bitch off this show.

[02:49:47.770 --> 02:49:49.450]
Hi, I'm Dr. Laura Schlesinger.

[02:49:50.850 --> 02:49:53.290]
And I'm here to tell you a little bit about douching.

[02:49:53.630 --> 02:49:58.130]
Because it takes a real sour plus bitch like me to tell you how to do it right.

[02:49:58.270 --> 02:50:00.090]
Besides, you don't know how to do it anyway.

[02:50:00.270 --> 02:50:01.110]
You're probably too stupid.

[02:50:01.730 --> 02:50:07.370]
But what I do is I spread my legs like this, kind of upside down and squish in.

[02:50:07.370 --> 02:50:08.790]
Hot the Rosalene.

[02:50:09.310 --> 02:50:11.850]
Nothing works better than hot the Rosalene.

[02:50:12.250 --> 02:50:13.330]
Give it a little squish.

[02:50:15.250 --> 02:50:16.570]
All right, it's a twist of fish.

[02:50:17.210 --> 02:50:21.090]
5'6.705.60, pound 5'60 on the AT&T and for a reason.

[02:50:21.170 --> 02:50:22.250]
He fit in like a glove today.

[02:50:22.610 --> 02:50:24.190]
Welcome to our town, sir, from New York.

[02:50:24.370 --> 02:50:25.810]
Not that we don't have enough New Yorkers there already.

[02:50:26.110 --> 02:50:27.030]
But welcome to our town.

[02:50:27.850 --> 02:50:31.490]
And we're delighted that your entire life is so meaningless and so vacuous that you will

[02:50:31.490 --> 02:50:37.090]
have a hateful right-wing obnoxious, super goody-touches born again orthodox you like that bitch on the radio.

[02:50:37.090 --> 02:50:39.070]
To dictate how people should live.

[02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:42.310]
I know why I kind of wonder how I should deal with the situation.

[02:50:42.410 --> 02:50:43.590]
I turn on the radio.

[02:50:44.250 --> 02:50:45.590]
Or I turn on Judge Judy.

[02:50:46.050 --> 02:50:47.650]
And see, how would Judge Judy handle this?

[02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:48.950]
I call Cleo.

[02:50:49.550 --> 02:50:49.730]
Oh.

[02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:52.450]
I call it, is she the Jamaican one?

[02:50:52.650 --> 02:50:52.790]
Yeah.

[02:50:53.010 --> 02:50:54.170]
Or the Jamaican tarot carburetor.

[02:50:54.270 --> 02:50:54.970]
She's my favorite.

[02:50:55.770 --> 02:50:56.590]
She knows it all around.

[02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:57.770]
And she has the goodsment too.

[02:50:59.350 --> 02:51:00.410]
Here's Portland, hello.

[02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:03.510]
Neil Rogers, you big coo-cow are you, sir.

[02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:03.830]
Okay.

[02:51:04.570 --> 02:51:07.170]
Hey, I just, I haven't been in Miami for about a month.

[02:51:07.330 --> 02:51:08.810]
Well, congratulations to you then.

[02:51:08.970 --> 02:51:09.510]
Say thank you.

[02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:14.950]
I just want to call say a little to all my Cuban nationalist friends like Al Goldstein and Ron Jeremy.

[02:51:14.950 --> 02:51:16.050]
Hi guys, how are you doing?

[02:51:16.210 --> 02:51:16.490]
Uh-huh.

[02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:20.110]
Hey, I just wanted to call to put a lot of your rest to bed.

[02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:25.350]
When the live wild show does go national next month, she's going to be on 12 to 4 Pacific.

[02:51:25.350 --> 02:51:28.310]
So it's not going to, it's not going to come to your level.

[02:51:28.310 --> 02:51:33.490]
Oh yeah, this is, you know, something I wondered why he was hawking us a trinic with Ron Jeremy and Al Goldstein.

[02:51:33.490 --> 02:51:37.090]
He had a Liz Wilds boyfriend calling to plug her show.

[02:51:37.450 --> 02:51:40.390]
And we're so concerned about Liz Wild being on opposite this show.

[02:51:40.770 --> 02:51:42.650]
Oh my god, how could we ever deal with that?

[02:51:42.830 --> 02:51:43.950]
Her nationwide show.

[02:51:45.650 --> 02:51:47.410]
Well, you know, here we got the numbers.

[02:51:47.530 --> 02:51:49.050]
We were just talking about earlier this morning.

[02:51:49.350 --> 02:51:50.330]
She had no numbers.

[02:51:51.910 --> 02:51:53.310]
Fractions, points.

[02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:54.570]
So what's the point?

[02:51:56.790 --> 02:52:00.310]
We've been on against Howard since today he came on in this market the first hour.

[02:52:00.590 --> 02:52:01.170]
Doing just fine.

[02:52:01.310 --> 02:52:01.750]
Thank you.

[02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:04.010]
On against fat ass limbaugh.

[02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:07.530]
Doing just great kickin' his ass ever since they put him back on a year and a market years ago.

[02:52:07.810 --> 02:52:08.910]
Airv book, airv trend.

[02:52:09.630 --> 02:52:13.030]
And we're worried about Liz Wilds with her fractions.

[02:52:13.390 --> 02:52:14.410]
You know, it's pathetic.

[02:52:15.210 --> 02:52:18.790]
But you'll be sure and try and use the show again to promote some no talent piece of crap.

[02:52:18.930 --> 02:52:19.350]
Okay, sir?

[02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:20.410]
And have a wonderful life.

[02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:22.570]
Because you're sure pull the wool over our eye.

[02:52:23.730 --> 02:52:27.190]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound, five, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:31.730]
And in fact, I'm delighted because maybe then Al can find a new home and he can go back on that show.

[02:52:32.070 --> 02:52:33.470]
Because he sure ain't gonna be on this one.

[02:52:35.730 --> 02:52:37.790]
He can have a segment called all about Al.

[02:52:39.950 --> 02:52:40.590]
Here's Davy.

[02:52:40.690 --> 02:52:40.830]
Hello.

[02:52:42.010 --> 02:52:42.270]
Hello?

[02:52:42.570 --> 02:52:42.890]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:45.190]
Dr. Laura, I've had a total bitch.

[02:52:45.430 --> 02:52:46.230]
Yeah, we know that.

[02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:48.250]
Do you think her voice gives it to her?

[02:52:48.330 --> 02:52:48.870]
Why's in the black?

[02:52:49.570 --> 02:52:49.790]
Who?

[02:52:50.470 --> 02:52:50.830]
Bush.

[02:52:52.890 --> 02:52:53.910]
She gives it into what?

[02:52:54.730 --> 02:52:55.730]
She gives it into his bush?

[02:52:56.350 --> 02:52:58.890]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound, five, 60.

[02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:59.610]
He's one of your people.

[02:52:59.850 --> 02:53:01.970]
He wants to know about Bob Lasseter.

[02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:05.650]
He said then he have a really big...

[02:53:07.770 --> 02:53:08.910]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:53:08.910 --> 02:53:09.210]
Hello?

[02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:11.110]
Hello?

[02:53:11.430 --> 02:53:11.750]
Yes, sir?

[02:53:12.610 --> 02:53:12.770]
Yeah.

[02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:17.790]
Is there something that the Vary King has against you?

[02:53:17.970 --> 02:53:25.050]
I have to be flipping last night and suddenly radio so-called workshop host on Vary King.

[02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:28.010]
I mean, these guys are...

[02:53:28.830 --> 02:53:29.650]
What does that mean?

[02:53:29.790 --> 02:53:31.630]
What does that mean does he have something against me?

[02:53:31.750 --> 02:53:32.590]
What are you talking about?

[02:53:32.610 --> 02:53:34.810]
I'm not going to answer why aren't you on one of those guys?

[02:53:34.810 --> 02:53:36.430]
Because I don't want to go on his shows.

[02:53:36.430 --> 02:53:37.590]
They've called me and I refuse.

[02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:38.730]
I don't go on that crap.

[02:53:39.330 --> 02:53:41.590]
I'm not going to participate in his suck fest.

[02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:42.110]
That's why.

[02:53:42.330 --> 02:53:43.270]
What is it going to do for me?

[02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:44.070]
What do I need that for?

[02:53:44.670 --> 02:53:46.550]
At least you got a brain.

[02:53:46.870 --> 02:53:47.090]
Yeah.

[02:53:47.610 --> 02:53:49.170]
And have the brain enough to stay off that show?

[02:53:49.310 --> 02:53:49.570]
That's right.

[02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:50.890]
I'll participate in suck fest.

[02:53:51.890 --> 02:53:53.790]
If I participate in the suck fest, believe me,

[02:53:53.790 --> 02:53:55.730]
it's not on a year and it's something I'm enjoying doing.

[02:53:58.550 --> 02:54:00.270]
56670560, £560 on the AT&T.

[02:54:00.570 --> 02:54:01.650]
You know what this sounds like to me?

[02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:02.810]
This is kind of like some of the...

[02:54:02.810 --> 02:54:05.430]
I mean, scattered obviously among the rest of this riffraff today.

[02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:08.150]
But some of the people that Kevin Backfield was writing about yesterday,

[02:54:08.310 --> 02:54:10.330]
some of these Sandy Peyton people.

[02:54:11.970 --> 02:54:12.290]
Yeah.

[02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:16.410]
Why can't you be on there when that guy that Neil Bortz guy gets on there every five minutes?

[02:54:17.250 --> 02:54:18.190]
Because I don't want to be.

[02:54:18.330 --> 02:54:19.510]
I don't need it and I don't want it.

[02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:24.230]
See, I'd rather feed my appetite than my ego.

[02:54:24.810 --> 02:54:27.990]
For some people with gigantic big fat egos.

[02:54:29.270 --> 02:54:32.270]
Neil Bortz, there's a real good nose picker from Atlanta, WSB,

[02:54:32.650 --> 02:54:34.290]
or whatever he's on now, ring, I don't know what he's on.

[02:54:37.050 --> 02:54:39.730]
Tredgic, have you ever heard WSB in Atlanta a cock station?

[02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:40.950]
No.

[02:54:41.130 --> 02:54:42.510]
Oh my God.

[02:54:44.850 --> 02:54:46.370]
I stay off the AM ban with him.

[02:54:46.370 --> 02:54:46.770]
Oh.

[02:54:46.770 --> 02:54:47.490]
I go to the hills.

[02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:49.570]
Boy, it's all religion cons.

[02:54:49.790 --> 02:54:51.330]
It sounds like they just all...

[02:54:51.330 --> 02:54:53.590]
They all drifted in from entry.

[02:54:54.090 --> 02:54:55.670]
Wasn't David Paul on that station?

[02:54:56.610 --> 02:54:57.710]
Oh, we're flying.

[02:54:58.570 --> 02:54:59.670]
I mean, on the label.

[02:54:59.870 --> 02:55:00.910]
He's right next to Dan Stewart.

[02:55:01.110 --> 02:55:01.250]
Wow.

[02:55:01.790 --> 02:55:03.190]
I bet he's real uncomfortable about that.

[02:55:04.710 --> 02:55:06.210]
27 past one at 5.

[02:55:06.470 --> 02:55:07.910]
60, 70 at QAM.

[02:55:08.550 --> 02:55:11.150]
But Neil Rosershoff, your sports radio,

[02:55:11.370 --> 02:55:12.050]
5.60.

[02:55:13.070 --> 02:55:13.550]
QA.

[02:55:13.870 --> 02:55:15.410]
Another dick in the White House?

[02:55:23.090 --> 02:55:25.530]
I love the subrenotes.

[02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:27.110]
Each week on HBO,

[02:55:27.690 --> 02:55:30.490]
far much EVI'll be staying.

[02:55:31.150 --> 02:55:35.450]
Set up by a computer, Tony's mum's a loon.

[02:55:36.130 --> 02:55:38.090]
Now he knows who wants to train.

[02:55:39.030 --> 02:55:42.790]
He goes to therapy, take drugs that daily,

[02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:46.130]
wants to be with Dr. Melfi.

[02:55:46.870 --> 02:55:50.610]
One thing I know I just love the soprano

[02:55:50.610 --> 02:55:54.190]
is they should win all 16 Emmys.

[02:55:54.610 --> 02:56:01.450]
Cause Tony's a piece of candy.

[02:56:03.850 --> 02:56:06.910]
The Ducky's, they did flee.

[02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:10.870]
The Ducky's, they did flee.

[02:56:10.870 --> 02:56:16.950]
Made in that in a loole.

[02:56:18.010 --> 02:56:20.430]
They're loole, they're loole.

[02:56:20.790 --> 02:56:23.170]
Him and Carmella living in New Jersey.

[02:56:23.810 --> 02:56:25.050]
They are family.

[02:56:25.710 --> 02:56:27.550]
Go do butterfly finger.

[02:56:28.130 --> 02:56:29.450]
Make it girl's dancing.

[02:56:31.390 --> 02:56:33.530]
For all the time.

[02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:37.550]
Big butterfly finger, butterfly finger.

[02:56:39.050 --> 02:56:41.970]
They avoid the cops, they don't stop.

[02:56:42.690 --> 02:56:49.010]
I love the subrenotes.

[02:56:49.690 --> 02:56:50.970]
Oh yeah, I love them.

[02:56:51.450 --> 02:56:55.910]
We will see, Tony has to see Big Puzzah, his mommy.

[02:56:56.350 --> 02:56:59.110]
It's crazy, I don't know about it.

[02:56:59.270 --> 02:57:03.410]
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody.

[02:57:07.310 --> 02:57:10.450]
Nobody to miss this show.

[02:57:10.670 --> 02:57:12.310]
It's real for some Reynolds.

[02:57:12.690 --> 02:57:15.270]
Oh yeah, I can't see.

[02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:22.830]
By the time I get through the next couple of minutes,

[02:57:23.170 --> 02:57:26.210]
she is going to have to pick every scab off that cutrid,

[02:57:26.670 --> 02:57:28.270]
Puzz filled body of hers, all right?

[02:57:28.630 --> 02:57:31.590]
Nobody risked your better.

[02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:36.230]
So I'm going crazy on this, yes, because this has got to stop.

[02:57:36.650 --> 02:57:38.490]
You make me sick, Pat, you bitch.

[02:57:38.930 --> 02:57:42.210]
God, how is it possible to be so stupid, Pat?

[02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:47.370]
Nobody, Pat, feel, and I so good at the end.

[02:57:47.890 --> 02:57:49.230]
Do any of you asshole you?

[02:57:50.210 --> 02:57:51.690]
Baby, you better.

[02:57:53.730 --> 02:57:55.430]
Well, sing this, you fat slob.

[02:57:55.930 --> 02:57:58.790]
I'm going to take this cord and I'm going to shove it right up his ass, okay?

[02:57:59.270 --> 02:58:01.590]
And I'm going to shove this thing so far up his butt

[02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:04.490]
that he's going to be singing a different tune that I get through with him.

[02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:06.570]
But we have a longer cord than this piece of cramp.

[02:58:06.710 --> 02:58:08.490]
Look at this. Look how short this damn thing is.

[02:58:08.970 --> 02:58:10.730]
You got 100 assholes running around this building.

[02:58:10.730 --> 02:58:13.730]
They can find another one beside him, although, maybe not that big.

[02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:15.790]
Oh, get it out of there.

[02:58:15.930 --> 02:58:18.150]
Go pull it, cord somewhere. Go do something.

[02:58:18.810 --> 02:58:21.170]
Pull what? In your case, a good question, okay?

[02:58:21.730 --> 02:58:22.130]
God.

[02:58:26.970 --> 02:58:27.790]
Nobody risked his head.

[02:58:27.790 --> 02:58:30.550]
He's got the same fat old meal for whatever you're upset about

[02:58:30.550 --> 02:58:33.730]
and disgusting, nauseating old sloths.

[02:58:35.690 --> 02:58:39.950]
Nobody risked his head when I said, good at the end.

[02:58:40.030 --> 02:58:41.470]
Old, pami old bitch.

[02:58:41.710 --> 02:58:44.030]
Neal, if you don't rethink your gon' spit hell, what is?

[02:58:44.650 --> 02:58:46.090]
Yeah, I've got a clear, clear, blittle wide open.

[02:58:46.190 --> 02:58:48.330]
You're going to spit a little bit of your skull with a mallet.

[02:58:48.330 --> 02:58:49.270]
It's too little bitch.

[02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:52.050]
There we go. Now we're cooking.

[02:58:52.310 --> 02:58:54.550]
But baby, baby, say hello.

[02:58:56.550 --> 02:58:58.490]
What did I just get through talking about?

[02:58:58.690 --> 02:58:59.370]
It was old bag.

[02:58:59.710 --> 02:59:01.250]
We don't want you, lady, okay?

[02:59:01.410 --> 02:59:02.550]
Go get some knitting up.

[02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:03.830]
Go get some crossword.

[02:59:04.930 --> 02:59:06.750]
Go get something.

[02:59:07.090 --> 02:59:07.310]
Lade.

[02:59:08.470 --> 02:59:09.830]
134.560 WQM.

[02:59:09.870 --> 02:59:11.310]
That was by request from a CR.

[02:59:11.950 --> 02:59:13.190]
Got an interesting point in this fact.

[02:59:13.370 --> 02:59:15.890]
You said, I wonder if it's any coincidence it was about this time last year.

[02:59:15.950 --> 02:59:17.230]
You went to the no-phone calls format.

[02:59:17.470 --> 02:59:17.790]
Remember that?

[02:59:18.850 --> 02:59:19.370]
Oh, yeah.

[02:59:19.530 --> 02:59:20.130]
Yeah, fire.

[02:59:20.370 --> 02:59:22.970]
Could there be something about the combination of the holiday season cold weather

[02:59:22.970 --> 02:59:25.570]
and the semi-important ponderous news stories that turn this audience,

[02:59:25.690 --> 02:59:27.830]
release the calling audience into a bigger bunch of idiots,

[02:59:28.410 --> 02:59:29.850]
well-passed their normal potential?

[02:59:30.490 --> 02:59:32.490]
Next week, when every little snob-nose kid is out of school,

[02:59:32.610 --> 02:59:34.170]
it's only going to get worse since the CR.

[02:59:34.690 --> 02:59:35.890]
And thanks for sounding t-shirt life.

[02:59:35.890 --> 02:59:37.390]
It's time to take a week off, I think.

[02:59:37.810 --> 02:59:37.990]
Yeah.

[02:59:38.450 --> 02:59:39.650]
And Georgia's taking next week off.

[02:59:39.790 --> 02:59:41.830]
I'm not going to do that because that would be bad.

[02:59:42.790 --> 02:59:43.390]
Well, I don't care.

[02:59:43.470 --> 02:59:44.130]
I'm just playing stuff.

[02:59:44.190 --> 02:59:45.110]
I was going to do that today.

[02:59:45.290 --> 02:59:46.510]
You know, as I look back now,

[02:59:46.630 --> 02:59:48.910]
it wouldn't have been a much better idea to play a bunch of great stuff.

[02:59:49.050 --> 02:59:51.330]
I did, you know, I'm digging back in the library there.

[02:59:51.330 --> 02:59:53.950]
And the ACN played a lot of old stuff we haven't heard in a long time,

[02:59:54.390 --> 02:59:56.370]
like, uh, not in the Homo.

[02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:58.150]
What's that?

[02:59:58.230 --> 02:59:58.890]
What's that other one?

[02:59:59.310 --> 02:59:59.750]
Not in the honey?

[03:00:00.550 --> 03:00:01.130]
I am writing.

[03:00:01.610 --> 03:00:02.370]
But it's not in here.

[03:00:02.930 --> 03:00:03.630]
I don't think so.

[03:00:03.930 --> 03:00:04.650]
Oh, like I said.

[03:00:05.130 --> 03:00:06.050]
But anyway, I'll find that.

[03:00:06.510 --> 03:00:09.210]
Just dillions of things that we haven't heard in a long time and have a few laughs.

[03:00:09.470 --> 03:00:11.250]
As opposed to, you know, this ponderous crap.

[03:00:11.970 --> 03:00:14.290]
See, because one of the great things about when the kids get out of school

[03:00:14.290 --> 03:00:15.370]
like a kid's in day today,

[03:00:15.850 --> 03:00:17.210]
this show is like a play toy.

[03:00:17.390 --> 03:00:20.430]
Because somebody stole their dreidel and somebody stole their, uh, dildo.

[03:00:20.430 --> 03:00:21.970]
So this show becomes their play toy.

[03:00:22.890 --> 03:00:24.290]
So they sit out there between 10 and 2.

[03:00:24.530 --> 03:00:25.150]
And they play with it.

[03:00:25.230 --> 03:00:25.790]
And the show, too.

[03:00:28.030 --> 03:00:31.730]
567-0560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[03:00:31.970 --> 03:00:34.450]
Oh, am I a scared, Liz, while it's coming back on the radio.

[03:00:34.750 --> 03:00:34.910]
Woo!

[03:00:35.770 --> 03:00:37.490]
Man, my vows are trembling.

[03:00:38.010 --> 03:00:38.190]
Woo!

[03:00:38.570 --> 03:00:39.250]
It's the end of you, buddy.

[03:00:39.770 --> 03:00:39.950]
God.

[03:00:40.890 --> 03:00:42.430]
It's like that bitch from Texas that time.

[03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:43.990]
Oh, Nea, are you scared?

[03:00:44.170 --> 03:00:45.350]
Why is she coming in the market?

[03:00:45.490 --> 03:00:46.290]
Are you scared?

[03:00:49.150 --> 03:00:50.330]
How many years ago was that?

[03:00:50.330 --> 03:00:51.330]
About 100 years ago?

[03:00:52.270 --> 03:00:54.430]
He still can't find an audience at the age of 100.

[03:00:56.010 --> 03:00:59.750]
Oh, yeah, we had those big 12-plus numbers there during the election time.

[03:00:59.830 --> 03:01:00.650]
Yeah, we saw those boys.

[03:01:01.890 --> 03:01:03.270]
All 55-plus.

[03:01:03.610 --> 03:01:06.150]
All older than the Fuzla, all actually 65-plus.

[03:01:06.670 --> 03:01:08.530]
People that make knee-look, young, which is same a lot.

[03:01:09.790 --> 03:01:11.170]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:12.690]
Hey, Nea, how you doing?

[03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:13.150]
Great.

[03:01:13.630 --> 03:01:16.330]
Um, I heard that guy call up a mob, Dr. Laura.

[03:01:16.470 --> 03:01:17.510]
I gotta tell you a couple things.

[03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:19.350]
First of all, she's not really in Q.

[03:01:20.370 --> 03:01:22.450]
She confronted Ditch as her man.

[03:01:22.730 --> 03:01:23.350]
Right, right.

[03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:26.370]
She married an orthodox fanatical Jew, and then she became a crazy bitch.

[03:01:27.090 --> 03:01:32.750]
Exactly. And second of all, she obviously doesn't practice what she preaches because not too long ago,

[03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:35.530]
she was dating some guy who took naked pictures of her.

[03:01:35.570 --> 03:01:36.490]
Oh, I know. They're all in the internet.

[03:01:36.710 --> 03:01:37.070]
We've all seen it.

[03:01:37.150 --> 03:01:38.630]
I know all over the internet for Christ's sake.

[03:01:38.750 --> 03:01:40.730]
When your stomach is strong enough, you can find them.

[03:01:41.710 --> 03:01:45.570]
Or if your teeth are dirty enough and you need a toothpick, there you go.

[03:01:45.650 --> 03:01:45.970]
That'll do.

[03:01:46.050 --> 03:01:47.310]
The woman weighs like 60 pounds.

[03:01:48.150 --> 03:01:48.990]
God help her.

[03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:53.310]
Anyway, I think she's a phony, ugly, Nazi, born-again bitch.

[03:01:54.270 --> 03:01:54.450]
Yeah.

[03:01:54.450 --> 03:01:55.650]
I had to say that. Thank you, Nea.

[03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:56.770]
The other night she's okay.

[03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:57.830]
We wish you're happy holidays.

[03:01:58.250 --> 03:01:58.510]
Likewise.

[03:01:58.750 --> 03:01:59.030]
Thank you.

[03:01:59.350 --> 03:01:59.930]
I said her.

[03:02:00.810 --> 03:02:04.310]
5607.0560, pump 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:09.190]
Yes, even with the wireless fags, that TV show or hers was such a bomb in the first place.

[03:02:09.390 --> 03:02:11.150]
I mean, what had lasted about five minutes and all that?

[03:02:11.170 --> 03:02:13.970]
Even that thing on Wami, that abortion we had lasted longer than that,

[03:02:13.970 --> 03:02:14.990]
with the schmottes on.

[03:02:16.390 --> 03:02:18.730]
And that was, uh, Christ, they put a lot of effort on that thing.

[03:02:18.990 --> 03:02:20.230]
Do you want to reassure them as those old days?

[03:02:20.370 --> 03:02:20.430]
No.

[03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.950]

[03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:21.090]
No.

[03:02:22.610 --> 03:02:25.090]
You have no idea how many people still will come up to me and say,

[03:02:25.370 --> 03:02:27.510]
oh, whatever happened on that show, that you, that was the best damn thing,

[03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:29.950]
at least the laugh our ass off, that thing was, yeah, seriously.

[03:02:31.130 --> 03:02:35.350]
We couldn't find an audience who had the search party on a TV station that now is like,

[03:02:35.490 --> 03:02:37.470]
well, no speaking in ways pretty soon.

[03:02:38.970 --> 03:02:40.050]
Nice going, Barry Diller.

[03:02:40.630 --> 03:02:41.490]
You silly girl.

[03:02:42.630 --> 03:02:44.090]
Here's a mobile and cutler ridge.

[03:02:44.230 --> 03:02:44.290]
Hello.

[03:02:46.230 --> 03:02:47.630]
Mobile and cutler ridge.

[03:02:48.330 --> 03:02:49.290]
Going once.

[03:02:50.290 --> 03:02:51.150]
Going twice.

[03:02:51.690 --> 03:02:52.650]
Here's Puckuley.

[03:02:52.670 --> 03:02:53.470]
Here's Pompano. Hello.

[03:02:53.710 --> 03:02:54.570]
Hello, Neil.

[03:02:54.890 --> 03:02:55.050]
Yes?

[03:02:55.530 --> 03:02:56.390]
Hey, I'm a first.

[03:02:56.710 --> 03:02:58.470]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[03:02:58.650 --> 03:03:00.670]
Pomp 5, 60 on the AT&T Line.

[03:03:00.970 --> 03:03:01.770]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[03:03:01.890 --> 03:03:03.070]
Neil, what's the news?

[03:03:03.270 --> 03:03:04.630]
Type this, count the notes.

[03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:07.270]
Uh-huh.

[03:03:08.250 --> 03:03:09.190]
Pepperpine, tell him.

[03:03:09.190 --> 03:03:12.730]
Tell him how you doing, but I just want to laugh on Neil.

[03:03:12.850 --> 03:03:14.830]
Can you play that song, my fat and Bernie?

[03:03:15.770 --> 03:03:16.410]
What is it?

[03:03:16.930 --> 03:03:19.690]
My fat and Bernie's at 7, 8 days of Hanukkah or something.

[03:03:21.090 --> 03:03:23.070]
Eight days of Hanukkah, not my fat and Bernie.

[03:03:23.270 --> 03:03:24.310]
So it is one of the ones on song.

[03:03:24.410 --> 03:03:24.610]
Very good.

[03:03:24.770 --> 03:03:25.890]
Even though it's the one on the song.

[03:03:27.490 --> 03:03:28.310]
That's a good song.

[03:03:28.910 --> 03:03:29.650]
You got it, man.

[03:03:30.530 --> 03:03:31.570]
You'll be gotten to, you want to know why?

[03:03:31.630 --> 03:03:33.690]
Because it's long, it'll kill some very, very good time.

[03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:35.770]
Thank you so much.

[03:03:36.570 --> 03:03:41.110]
22, 4, 2, 5, 60, WDQM Hanukkah will be here to rescue the operation of 2 this afternoon.

[03:03:41.870 --> 03:03:46.490]
We got Yeldey on game night from the Hard Rock Cafe right across from the song,

[03:03:46.610 --> 03:03:51.470]
we got 6, 7, then we got the big games show 7 o'clock, 7, 30, Panthers and the penguins.

[03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:56.630]
Mike Lang is in town, Robert Lang is in town, Marty Stracke, Yammy Yogher,

[03:03:57.190 --> 03:03:58.330]
all those go in there all here.

[03:03:59.050 --> 03:04:04.830]
Garth Snow, Garth Brooks, Armist Brooks, they're all here for the night for the big game.

[03:04:04.830 --> 03:04:05.510]
Gonna be there night?

[03:04:05.690 --> 03:04:06.450]
No, I'll be there.

[03:04:06.970 --> 03:04:10.070]
And that guy, that stock guy, stay away from me.

[03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:12.770]
Don't come by my seat again, and I have to go to him security.

[03:04:13.210 --> 03:04:15.650]
Come and beat your ass, even that old man will come and beat you up.

[03:04:15.870 --> 03:04:19.130]
Just stay the hell away with all your goddamn hype, all your bull crap.

[03:04:20.890 --> 03:04:22.270]
And have a nice holiday too.

[03:04:23.610 --> 03:04:25.690]
21 before 2 at 5, 60, QM.

[03:04:30.390 --> 03:04:31.530]
Hi.

[03:04:31.530 --> 03:04:31.530]

[03:04:32.470 --> 03:04:33.210]
Hi.

[03:04:33.230 --> 03:04:44.550]
On the first day of Hannita, my parents gave to me a picture of my bad and funny.

[03:04:46.430 --> 03:04:53.430]
On the second day of Hannita, my parents gave to me.

[03:04:54.830 --> 03:05:00.550]
2 thinking straight, all the picture of my bad and funny.

[03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:10.370]
On the third day of Hannita, my parents gave to me.

[03:05:11.290 --> 03:05:18.090]
3 me ugly shirts, 2 thinking straight, all the picture of my bad and funny.

[03:05:18.570 --> 03:05:19.210]
Oh, what?

[03:05:19.970 --> 03:05:21.250]
What's this weird thing on a head?

[03:05:21.430 --> 03:05:21.950]
That's your face.

[03:05:21.950 --> 03:05:22.610]
Hi.

[03:05:22.990 --> 03:05:25.530]
On the first day of Hannita.

[03:05:26.050 --> 03:05:26.630]
Hi, girl.

[03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:27.530]
That's cool.

[03:05:28.370 --> 03:05:30.910]
My parents gave to me.

[03:05:32.250 --> 03:05:37.110]
Wow, these kosher candy, 3 ugly shirts, 2 thinking straight, all the picture of my bad and funny.

[03:05:37.110 --> 03:05:38.030]
Things that Draidel songs.

[03:05:38.330 --> 03:05:38.550]
No.

[03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:39.110]
Sonny.

[03:05:39.390 --> 03:05:41.990]
Draidel, Draidel, Draidel, when they did out of play.

[03:05:42.410 --> 03:05:45.070]
And when the one is watching, a brother thing away.

[03:05:45.610 --> 03:05:46.730]
No, but that nice.

[03:05:46.990 --> 03:05:47.370]
Fight me.

[03:05:48.170 --> 03:05:50.910]
On the fifth day of Hannita.

[03:05:50.910 --> 03:05:54.810]
My parents yelled at me.

[03:05:55.170 --> 03:05:58.110]
What one take a Christmas tree.

[03:05:59.290 --> 03:06:00.690]
Oh, it's what Jimmy's got one.

[03:06:00.810 --> 03:06:01.910]
Maybe Jimmy's Catholic.

[03:06:03.010 --> 03:06:04.390]
And not what they can be.

[03:06:04.490 --> 03:06:05.470]
Not what they should.

[03:06:05.710 --> 03:06:06.950]
Not what they're trails.

[03:06:07.570 --> 03:06:10.610]
Or a picture of my bad and funny.

[03:06:11.430 --> 03:06:12.650]
Oh, me.

[03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:19.630]
On the sixth day of Hannita, my parents made me sing.

[03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:23.570]
If I were a rich man, no.

[03:06:24.190 --> 03:06:27.330]
It was on every year.

[03:06:27.490 --> 03:06:29.410]
In front of myself.

[03:06:31.370 --> 03:06:32.650]
For me.

[03:06:34.130 --> 03:06:38.790]
On the seventh day of Hannita.

[03:06:39.690 --> 03:06:40.450]
Not bad.

[03:06:41.230 --> 03:06:43.590]
My parents made me sing.

[03:06:45.250 --> 03:06:47.190]
Seven creepy lockers.

[03:06:48.250 --> 03:06:50.230]
If I were a rich man.

[03:06:50.510 --> 03:06:52.130]
I want a Christmas tree.

[03:06:52.530 --> 03:06:54.150]
I want a Christmas tree.

[03:06:54.530 --> 03:06:56.070]
Oh, it's not a Christmas tree.

[03:06:56.250 --> 03:06:57.310]
It's Christmas tree.

[03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:59.750]
Hi, this is a hunt.

[03:07:00.810 --> 03:07:03.910]
On the eighth day of Hannita.

[03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:07.730]
My parents gave to me.

[03:07:09.370 --> 03:07:10.630]
Nothing that I wanted.

[03:07:10.850 --> 03:07:12.090]
It's fantasy lockers.

[03:07:12.150 --> 03:07:13.530]
If I were a rich man.

[03:07:13.530 --> 03:07:15.290]
Where is my Christmas tree?

[03:07:15.770 --> 03:07:16.850]
I'll be closer, candy.

[03:07:17.010 --> 03:07:18.990]
Three of the shirts, two, single trails.

[03:07:19.950 --> 03:07:24.610]
And a picture of my bad and funny.

[03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:32.750]
145 at 560 WQM.

[03:07:33.050 --> 03:07:34.650]
Dow is down about 200 points.

[03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:38.830]
Just a little tiny here, a curly little hair less than 200 in the NASDAQ 164.

[03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:40.030]
But it's going to get a lot better.

[03:07:40.030 --> 03:07:41.570]
You watch.

[03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:43.910]
I'll give him a kick in the ass.

[03:07:44.510 --> 03:07:45.550]
Maybe his bagel tip over.

[03:07:47.270 --> 03:07:47.970]
Here's Miami.

[03:07:48.850 --> 03:07:49.510]
How are you doing?

[03:07:49.750 --> 03:07:50.050]
Pretty good.

[03:07:50.450 --> 03:07:51.470]
I have a friendly Rick.

[03:07:52.050 --> 03:07:53.130]
He has a small package.

[03:07:54.430 --> 03:07:57.910]
And for Christmas we're thinking of a little penis and large nymphom.

[03:07:58.110 --> 03:07:58.630]
The little things work.

[03:07:58.730 --> 03:07:58.990]
Yeah, huh.

[03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:01.250]
567 or 560.

[03:08:01.570 --> 03:08:03.610]
You just keep your tongue on it.

[03:08:05.310 --> 03:08:06.050]
Here's a little bigger.

[03:08:06.250 --> 03:08:07.350]
Here's a mobile and four-lotterdale.

[03:08:07.350 --> 03:08:07.490]
Hello.

[03:08:07.990 --> 03:08:08.650]
Hello, Leo.

[03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:09.150]
How are you?

[03:08:09.230 --> 03:08:09.490]
Okay.

[03:08:09.690 --> 03:08:11.670]
I'll tell you your call is today.

[03:08:11.670 --> 03:08:13.570]
This was the all time.

[03:08:13.690 --> 03:08:15.610]
Does really you think you reached the very bottom line?

[03:08:15.870 --> 03:08:16.510]
I love this show.

[03:08:16.690 --> 03:08:17.490]
We said all the time.

[03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:18.210]
Driving around.

[03:08:18.530 --> 03:08:24.670]
First of all, Alan Greensman is appointed by the president, confirmed by the Senate.

[03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:26.430]
Just to everyone's head.

[03:08:26.970 --> 03:08:31.530]
If there's third, the third administration, nobody can do anything with him to 2004.

[03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:36.530]
And during the course of the campaign, you notice W went out of his way.

[03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:37.950]
Not to criticize him.

[03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:46.390]
And I think that his real fear is that even though you will benefit, I'll benefit that W's,

[03:08:47.910 --> 03:08:54.290]
the 1%, the tax cut that will affect the wealthiest 1%, is not going to help the country.

[03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:58.210]
Now if he came up with a better tax cut plan, that would have a lot more people.

[03:08:58.490 --> 03:08:59.310]
It wouldn't help us.

[03:08:59.630 --> 03:09:02.850]
But I just want to know.

[03:09:02.850 --> 03:09:05.570]
Look, first of all, you've got stalemate in Congress.

[03:09:05.790 --> 03:09:09.230]
I mean, Republicans have a five-seat edge in the house.

[03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:12.070]
The Senate is 50-50 right down the middle.

[03:09:12.450 --> 03:09:16.110]
So what kind of a radical tax cut package is he going to get passed at best anyway?

[03:09:16.390 --> 03:09:17.490]
And he hasn't even taken office.

[03:09:17.490 --> 03:09:18.870]
He's not going to happen for another month yet.

[03:09:19.170 --> 03:09:23.970]
So what kind of decisions are these to be made on if comes stuff way down the road, months down the road?

[03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.970]
Yeah, they're chaotic.

[03:09:25.390 --> 03:09:31.250]
I think what I'll do in January 30th is he will lower the interest rates.

[03:09:31.250 --> 03:09:32.570]
But 30 if rather.

[03:09:32.930 --> 03:09:36.390]
No, they're going to have to have an interim cut.

[03:09:36.690 --> 03:09:40.810]
They're not going to have to be able to have a meeting at the board at any time.

[03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:44.270]
Because he's taking such heat now and this market is in such a free call.

[03:09:44.390 --> 03:09:44.590]
Oh, it doesn't.

[03:09:45.070 --> 03:09:48.250]
He's got a slam on a break before we have a total depression.

[03:09:48.630 --> 03:09:49.450]
I had a request.

[03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.710]
Yep.

[03:09:51.690 --> 03:09:52.270]
I'm sorry.

[03:09:52.490 --> 03:09:53.410]
I have a chance with a request.

[03:09:53.710 --> 03:09:54.030]
Yes, sir.

[03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:57.670]
I'd like to hear Regent Sardman and Professor Daddy.

[03:09:58.650 --> 03:09:58.910]
Okay.

[03:09:58.910 --> 03:09:59.970]
Thank you.

[03:10:00.650 --> 03:10:01.750]
We know where that is over here.

[03:10:01.750 --> 03:10:02.130]
It's not in here.

[03:10:02.250 --> 03:10:05.130]
I don't think so.

[03:10:05.290 --> 03:10:06.130]
Oh, I know it's on one of these.

[03:10:06.370 --> 03:10:08.170]
But while we'll see, I'll try to work real fast.

[03:10:08.310 --> 03:10:08.770]
I have my doubts.

[03:10:09.130 --> 03:10:10.190]
If not, tomorrow for sure.

[03:10:10.510 --> 03:10:11.590]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[03:10:11.690 --> 03:10:11.870]
Hello.

[03:10:14.130 --> 03:10:15.390]
Mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[03:10:15.910 --> 03:10:16.430]
Hello, Neil.

[03:10:16.650 --> 03:10:17.090]
Yes, sir.

[03:10:17.830 --> 03:10:18.050]
All right.

[03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:19.270]
You're flying federal today.

[03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:20.670]
I am the audience, ain't.

[03:10:21.390 --> 03:10:21.590]
Yes.

[03:10:23.350 --> 03:10:25.650]
Well, it's going to have an ad basket, isn't it?

[03:10:26.270 --> 03:10:26.770]
What is that?

[03:10:28.350 --> 03:10:29.970]
I guess the smoke hole is, too.

[03:10:30.530 --> 03:10:30.650]
Yeah.

[03:10:33.090 --> 03:10:33.410]
And...

[03:10:34.270 --> 03:10:34.890]
What is that?

[03:10:35.650 --> 03:10:36.950]
And he's turned the radio up and he's told...

[03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:37.710]
I'm just going to keep talking.

[03:10:38.110 --> 03:10:38.410]
T-O-E.

[03:10:38.810 --> 03:10:39.090]
Hang up.

[03:10:39.610 --> 03:10:41.850]
I want to see how long he could keep hearing the sound of his voice.

[03:10:41.970 --> 03:10:42.830]
How long he would squeeze it.

[03:10:44.010 --> 03:10:45.850]
Maybe we'd hear a little squirt, squirt sound effect.

[03:10:46.490 --> 03:10:50.450]
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:54.850]
Hey, I understand there's a lot of pressure on there to have something to say about, like, anything in the world.

[03:10:54.850 --> 03:10:55.690]
I realize that.

[03:10:55.810 --> 03:10:56.990]
That's one of the problems with this program.

[03:10:57.290 --> 03:10:59.310]
If you don't spoon feed the audience, we don't screen the calls.

[03:10:59.670 --> 03:11:01.130]
What would you like to talk about?

[03:11:01.410 --> 03:11:03.750]
Would you like to talk about what the Yankees win the pennant?

[03:11:04.090 --> 03:11:05.130]
What would you like to say?

[03:11:05.570 --> 03:11:06.310]
Oh, no, we're talking about the money today.

[03:11:06.310 --> 03:11:09.550]
Run it by me first and then we'll let you know if that's okay with us.

[03:11:09.890 --> 03:11:11.110]
We're talking about enemies today.

[03:11:11.370 --> 03:11:11.990]
Oh, good.

[03:11:12.530 --> 03:11:14.490]
In fact, this show could have used one, but it's too late now.

[03:11:14.950 --> 03:11:15.530]
Right at the beginning.

[03:11:15.770 --> 03:11:16.270]
Big one.

[03:11:17.190 --> 03:11:19.630]
I'm never going to find that the Regis puffed anything, huh?

[03:11:19.930 --> 03:11:20.850]
Isn't it who wants to...

[03:11:21.450 --> 03:11:22.630]
No, no, I know what it is.

[03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:27.490]
I know exactly what it's called, but I ain't going to find it today.

[03:11:27.790 --> 03:11:28.830]
So I'll play for the guy tomorrow.

[03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:33.350]
Because tomorrow I'm going to do the show that I should have done that I was going to do and should have done today.

[03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:35.110]
Believe me when I tell you.

[03:11:35.310 --> 03:11:37.690]
And if I were to realize that the kids were out of school and they'd kind of say,

[03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:39.670]
what I have done it today, I knew about your stuff.

[03:11:39.670 --> 03:11:39.830]
Yeah!

[03:11:40.170 --> 03:11:40.750]
That is correct.

[03:11:41.050 --> 03:11:42.170]
I would have done it today.

[03:11:43.130 --> 03:11:44.570]
But tomorrow be another day.

[03:11:45.530 --> 03:11:46.170]
Here's Homestead.

[03:11:46.290 --> 03:11:46.430]
Hello.

[03:11:48.430 --> 03:11:48.750]
Homestead.

[03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.770]
Oh, Nill.

[03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.410]
Yes, sir.

[03:11:50.410 --> 03:11:51.490]
Compaity Brit.

[03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.950]
Do you know what?

[03:11:53.250 --> 03:11:58.330]
I've got the guts just to request something for a beautiful young English girl that's staying with me,

[03:11:58.450 --> 03:12:00.730]
leaving the day before the Backstreet Boys concert.

[03:12:00.910 --> 03:12:01.290]
Yes, sir.

[03:12:01.390 --> 03:12:06.610]
Doesn't believe about that parody because whenever that phone comes on, I know the words do it, but she goes,

[03:12:07.170 --> 03:12:08.170]
you're kidding me.

[03:12:08.590 --> 03:12:08.710]
Huh.

[03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:09.490]
Would you play that?

[03:12:09.910 --> 03:12:10.690]
We're not gay.

[03:12:11.450 --> 03:12:12.050]
Okay, sir.

[03:12:12.750 --> 03:12:13.410]
You just keep staying.

[03:12:13.950 --> 03:12:14.870]
Maybe W is something.

[03:12:16.450 --> 03:12:18.590]
All those pretty Brit's are all the same, you know.

[03:12:18.590 --> 03:12:19.390]
We're gay.

[03:12:20.210 --> 03:12:20.590]
Alright.

[03:12:21.870 --> 03:12:21.870]

[03:12:21.870 --> 03:12:24.610]
This is the same.

[03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:25.170]
Yes.

[03:12:25.930 --> 03:12:27.990]
Like the same.

[03:12:28.470 --> 03:12:28.470]

[03:12:28.470 --> 03:12:39.190]
But we must tell you, this will be nice days if you want.

[03:12:40.030 --> 03:12:43.790]
This house is like land.

[03:12:43.790 --> 03:12:49.030]
They burn, take your hand.

[03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:52.050]
We got a land.

[03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:56.550]
We swelled in my day.

[03:12:57.130 --> 03:12:58.090]
We look alike.

[03:12:58.550 --> 03:13:00.790]
Can't be a different type.

[03:13:01.770 --> 03:13:05.870]
We sing like a bunch of silly whining.

[03:13:06.770 --> 03:13:07.510]
I'm frustrating.

[03:13:08.010 --> 03:13:10.970]
Our agent says we got a saying.

[03:13:10.970 --> 03:13:16.250]
This will be nice days.

[03:13:17.050 --> 03:13:21.070]
Our biggest fans are 12 year old girls.

[03:13:21.470 --> 03:13:24.190]
The super-estude SMD.

[03:13:24.810 --> 03:13:25.230]
Yes.

[03:13:26.250 --> 03:13:30.390]
As they get older, they all figure out.

[03:13:30.850 --> 03:13:35.090]
We're hiding our late-tencey.

[03:13:35.090 --> 03:13:44.970]
One thing is for sure we get many joy.

[03:13:48.090 --> 03:13:50.950]
We're so close.

[03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:51.790]
We're so close.

[03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.510]
We're so close.

[03:13:52.510 --> 03:13:52.690]
We're so close.

[03:13:52.690 --> 03:13:53.270]
We're so close.

[03:13:53.930 --> 03:13:54.470]
We're so close.

[03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:56.050]
We're so close.

[03:13:57.090 --> 03:13:58.330]
We're so close.

[03:13:59.530 --> 03:13:59.910]
We're so close.

[03:14:01.350 --> 03:14:02.730]
We're so close.

[03:14:02.730 --> 03:14:02.750]
We're so close.

[03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:03.610]
We're so close.

[03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:04.750]

[03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:04.750]

[03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:05.890]
We're so close.

[03:14:05.890 --> 03:14:05.890]

[03:14:05.890 --> 03:14:05.890]

[03:14:05.890 --> 03:14:05.890]

[03:14:05.890 --> 03:14:05.890]

[03:14:05.890 --> 03:14:05.890]

[03:14:05.890 --> 03:14:08.630]
Please say, in our day.

[03:14:09.430 --> 03:14:14.390]
I swear wait 9 dialogue.

[03:14:14.490 --> 03:14:32.750]
The Neil Roger Show Sports Radio of five sixties.

[03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:34.830]
are stupid dogs.

[03:14:36.790 --> 03:14:38.530]
Bill Cory must be nuts.

[03:14:40.750 --> 03:14:44.430]
To keep you on it, you put it's manager check books,

[03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:49.730]
never mind the thing that at one time had all the rights

[03:14:49.730 --> 03:14:50.370]
though.

[03:14:53.430 --> 03:14:56.610]
And it won't be too late for us to celebrate

[03:14:57.590 --> 03:14:59.910]
when you're the one's day trade.

[03:15:00.910 --> 03:15:07.150]
And when you leave, don't forget Christmas, your happy Queen.

[03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:14.470]
You thought that you would do better than something's late,

[03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:18.570]
but you can't point the things out anymore

[03:15:18.570 --> 03:15:22.450]
there's no one left to play hide.

[03:15:25.210 --> 03:15:27.330]
Goodbye, Brian Murray.

[03:15:28.270 --> 03:15:29.510]
You can't make me sad.

[03:15:30.050 --> 03:15:34.510]
You don't know shit about running all mahkeekey

[03:15:34.510 --> 03:15:38.270]
and you're not interested in hearing why.

[03:15:39.350 --> 03:15:45.490]
But no matter how you try, you can't deny that.
