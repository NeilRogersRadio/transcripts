[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980]
You'll find 560 QAF.

[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.860]
It's locked to NEO.

[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.160]
560 MF.

[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.460]
560 MF.

[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.600]
3 in David Rousehall.

[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.260]
Now 560 on yourself.

[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.600]
All the opinions of NEO, discussion callers.

[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.320]
You're not necessarily represent those

[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.560]
of the easily brought that through.

[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.520]
It's that advertisers are agenties.

[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.140]
Now, here's NEO Roger on 560 QAF.

[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.900]
Arachite, fucking blow!

[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.500]
What's up with you, NEO?

[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.880]
The pizza's sh**!

[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.980]
What's up with you, NEO?

[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.380]
The pizza's sh**!

[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.100]
So it's for you who get into pizza sh**!

[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700]
So it's for you who get into pizza sh**!

[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.560]
And the rich boiled bread,

[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.560]
and the NEO's can't junk it!

[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.040]
But he's gonna do it all I can't pay for that!

[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.480]
He's gonna give us bread,

[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.640]
up our people's go-one, hungry,

[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.940]
but so confusing with the staff.

[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.360]
We can't find your wife, she is just a bit!

[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.860]
We're looking all over him,

[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.020]
it's still like this!

[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.620]
Hey, Judge, if you knew where your wife she is,

[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.720]
well, are you afraid that we'll find out

[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.420]
that you did wrong to ask you a wrongful challenge,

[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.920]
kid, a token party, huh?

[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.400]
Thank you, my bitch, for possession of drugs!

[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.140]
But I'll quit, bitch, like you!

[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.000]
You can hire a judge to catch the name,

[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.960]
Jack, Linda, and the big head sponsor!

[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.100]
The first junior in the pizza sh**!

[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.720]
The first junior in the pizza sh**!

[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.660]
The first junior in the pizza sh**!

[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:40.080]
The first junior in the pizza sh**!

[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.700]
What the f**k is that?

[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.600]
The first junior in the pizza sh**!

[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.760]
The first junior in the pizza sh**!

[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.320]
The first junior in the pizza sh**!

[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.460]
The first junior in the pizza sh**!

[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.040]
Oh, crap!

[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.900]
Then, I'll do it five, 60 WQ,

[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.080]
I'm happy Monday morning to you.

[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.960]
This is it, baby!

[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.640]
This is it!

[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.280]
I'm going to write down the wire!

[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.320]
Would you like it to mean to tell you who I think is going to win tomorrow?

[00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.820]
I bet or not.

[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.500]
But at any rate, we had a tremendous response

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.700]
on our poll over the weekend,

[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.980]
and also a phenomenal bunch of people

[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.180]
checked out that little video clip we had

[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.980]
on our website, neo-wongers.com,

[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.700]
as in bottoms-up Georgie,

[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.460]
and that was 1992 that wedding.

[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.000]
That pie-faced shot we had at Georgie W.

[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.040]
But at any rate, we know he hasn't taken a drink.

[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.260]
See, even if you believe that he hasn't taken a drink in the 10 years,

[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.360]
the fact is that here's a man who admits now

[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.640]
that he was a scumbag, a drunk, a collouser,

[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.380]
and of course doesn't want to tell us any more about it

[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.280]
because we threw him burrow-sink

[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.940]
during his youthful and discretion days until he was 40.

[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.020]
And now, all of a sudden, because he's got Jesus on his side,

[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.000]
now he demands.

[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.500]
Oh!

[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.600]
Boy, just scary.

[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.400]
And speaking of scary, there were a couple of ads in the paper

[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.840]
over the weekend, one in the hill, one in the sun,

[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.520]
sent a couple of these born-again,

[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.860]
fetus hugging, or crazy.

[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.780]
Oh, and then that's what you people,

[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.280]
you bush people are in bed with.

[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.200]
Man, you better check for your coupes, I'll tell you that.

[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.440]
1717 votes will George W. Bush's DUI arrest,

[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.660]
or is there a colleague in now, DWI?

[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.480]
Yeah, that's what they're calling it.

[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.120]
Make any difference in the election outcome.

[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.620]
Yes, 945, 55%, no, 772, 45%.

[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.100]
Now, realize that that's in conflict with the CNN poll,

[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.980]
and some of the other polls.

[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.320]
But this first statewide poll they took on it yesterday

[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.560]
or at least over the weekend in Pennsylvania,

[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.640]
68% said no, no difference.

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.180]
32% said yes.

[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.620]
Now, that may seem, you know, 2-1 against people saying,

[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.500]
no, it would make a difference,

[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.500]
but still 32% in the state that's

[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.520]
raised your thin margin could make a difference on tomorrow.

[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.500]
See, the whole thing is going to all depend on who shows up tomorrow.

[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.580]
And it's quite of all they talk about,

[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.920]
oh, we want a big turn out, yeah, they want a big turn out

[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.060]
of those conservative Christians,

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.260]
that's what they want a big turn out.

[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.480]
But the whole thing hinges on all you brothers

[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.360]
and sisters out there, baby, get the dark folks out.

[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.060]
That's what we need.

[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.340]
How?

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.580]
Now, up until three days ago,

[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.180]
Goro is pulling 86% in the dark

[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.040]
and the African American community.

[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.840]
You know what he's got now?

[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.660]
91%

[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.920]
Bush has gone from four to three percent

[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.940]
and the other three percent are trying to figure out

[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.840]
who else is on a ballot.

[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.180]
They're sure he's on a vote for a native.

[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.180]
Any blacks were native?

[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.700]
Oh, no.

[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.820]
No way.

[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.320]
The notice that most of the people for native

[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.380]
took categories.

[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.740]
Very naive college kids who know nothing about anything

[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.280]
and think that if he gets elected,

[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.300]
they're going to be smoking pot in the streets the next day.

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.140]
And a bunch of old, uh,

[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.460]
craggy sixties or rejects.

[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.940]
You know, people want to relive the sixties.

[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.080]
Those are the native people.

[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.820]
And if you took up, and thank God over the weekend

[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.260]
and all was pulling that we're seeing,

[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.300]
one thing that we are seeing is that the liberals

[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.900]
and the native people are coming back

[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.840]
to the Democratic Party.

[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.820]
Thank God for that.

[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.540]
Thank you.

[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.080]
Good.

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.420]
Right.

[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.480]
And if I had to listen to that any more of these

[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.500]
native assholes calling,

[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.980]
in fact, I think that happy to people

[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.180]
calling and arguing for native,

[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.100]
I think they're bush people.

[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.180]
I kind of like Pat you can in myself.

[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.020]
Yeah, if I'm thinking about Bush,

[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.820]
I'm thinking, no,

[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.700]
Buchanan is really more of a good fascist.

[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.800]
Let's go all the way.

[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.580]
Why go halfway?

[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.480]
So I would think very seriously

[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.220]
before I'd punch that bush out,

[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.100]
I'd think about that Buchanan thing

[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.160]
or you bush people out there,

[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.460]
at least you can and don't have no DWIs

[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.240]
that we know of.

[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.800]
Or is that great cartoon?

[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.500]
Is it in the air?

[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.180]
I'm out here somewhere.

[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.620]
I don't know.

[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.820]
I've got too much crap.

[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.060]
I'm just loaded up with crap.

[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.000]
Now, somebody faxes me the latest,

[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.720]
and I got to be honest with it.

[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.940]
These polls, there's a good article.

[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.240]
It's in yesterday's hero,

[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.920]
in the focus, focus, focus, focus section.

[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.680]
That's his polls that never been so ubiquitous or meaningless.

[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.240]
Everybody agrees.

[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.980]
The art of polling needs an overhaul.

[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.300]
One of the points that they make

[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.560]
because our telephone has become a weapon in our home

[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.760]
and all these crazy solicitors have been bugging the hell out of us.

[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.380]
I don't know about you,

[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.420]
but when I get a solicitor,

[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.460]
oh no, I'm sorry he's not here.

[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.880]
He's not gone on vacation for two weeks.

[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.240]
That click, which is pretty polite, I guess,

[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.700]
to most people who just say click,

[00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.720]
or even worse,

[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.560]
as in FU don't bother me again.

[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.880]
Click.

[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.560]
So they have a tough time.

[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.200]
He used to be 75% of the people in these political polls

[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.180]
would respond on the phone.

[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.700]
Now it's down to 50%.

[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.600]
I mean, a lot of cases is less.

[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.640]
So they're having a really tough time

[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.880]
getting a representative sample.

[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.100]
Just like Arbitron had during the month of September,

[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.300]
Ruff came in here and showed me the month by month

[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.540]
in our last summer book,

[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.420]
September,

[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.960]
and this radio station,

[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.780]
according to Arbitron,

[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.360]
anyway, vanished off the face of the globe.

[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.860]
Does anybody believe that?

[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.680]
Do we believe it?

[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.420]
No, of course not.

[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.260]
Up there in Delph Stoemerelin,

[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.940]
I think it's too many,

[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.260]
a few too many bells.

[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.680]
Their problem up there.

[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.400]
They know they're answering their elbow.

[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.820]
But here's the very latest.

[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.400]
And if you really are in Saun and in Saun,

[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.140]
the actor really just obsessed with this election,

[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.380]
which I can't imagine as you would be,

[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.880]
unless you're worried about fanshers

[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.820]
and then all those right-wing judges.

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.260]
See that's the real thing.

[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.520]
I had some woman call last week,

[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.860]
oh that's just a scare tactic.

[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.320]
I'm out there.

[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.500]
That's a scare tactic.

[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.720]

[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.680]
And also for the native people who think

[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.940]
that they're building a party

[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.440]
and that they're going to get that $12 million

[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.040]
if they get their 5%.

[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.320]
You see, once George W.

[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.720]
If he, if you help him, get in there.

[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.360]
Once he starts appointing those judges,

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.720]
you get one or two or maybe more in.

[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.560]
Everything that native supposedly stands for

[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.460]
is down the toilet.

[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.960]
It takes several big giant steps backward

[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.420]
into the Stone Age.

[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.480]
But don't confuse the native people with the facts.

[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.960]
Also, if they do get their 5%

[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.800]
and they get their $12 million,

[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.620]
what they're basically doing

[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.100]
is ensuring Republican presidents

[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.380]
for years to come.

[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.140]
For years to come,

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.260]
because of the Green Party,

[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260]
which is an extreme radical left-wing movement,

[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.320]
with no real constituency in this country,

[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.620]
except like I said, a bunch of stupid night college kids

[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.840]
and a bunch of old folks who want to remove their 60s.

[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.460]
And if they do start making a few inwards

[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.320]
to the part where they get their 7 or 8%

[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.480]
which don't ever get more than that,

[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.860]
then they could ensure like I said,

[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.500]
Republican presidents for years in years to come.

[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.440]
What's again, is like cutting off your nose

[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.240]
despite your face,

[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.940]
because naturally the Republican party

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.680]
stands for everything diametrically opposed

[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.400]
to what the native people in the Green Party

[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.680]
supposedly stand for.

[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.220]
Like the environment,

[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.280]
well, I tell you one thing,

[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.680]
big businesses just salivating

[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.600]
waiting to get a couple of those busher poins in there.

[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.900]
They can't wait.

[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.360]
Here's the latest Florida 49 for Gore 46 for Bush,

[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.440]
for for Nader.

[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.740]
That's as of this moment from MSNBC Zodvey.

[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.460]
And I have very serious doubts about their poll.

[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.660]
Michigan, they got grew up by 7th.

[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.680]
State of Washington grew up by 4,

[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.280]
but Nader's getting 7% there.

[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.160]
Pennsylvania,

[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.140]
Gore 47, Bush 45, Nader with 7.

[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.440]
So again, you see the Nader factor there,

[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.760]
he's the Chigurin and Wipile.

[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.940]
You take him out of the equation there,

[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.120]
and even his 7 points,

[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.620]
say you're five to go into the bush.

[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.280]
It would be not even close.

[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.800]
Wisconsin, Bush 47,

[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.800]
Gore 45, Nader 7 again.

[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.460]
And of course,

[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.320]
Gore cannot afford really lose Wisconsin.

[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.540]
Illinois grew up by 13.

[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.400]
National registered voters,

[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.060]
registered, not likely voters.

[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.560]
National registered voters,

[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.420]
Gallup Post shows,

[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.700]
Gore 46, Bush 45.

[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.320]

[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.340]
Newsweek,

[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.960]
Gore 44, Bush 41.

[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.300]
And the PBS poll,

[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.300]
Gore 45, Bush 42.

[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.020]
But likely voters,

[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.000]
Gore 46,

[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:17.660]
Bush 47,

[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.340]
and the MSNBC Zodvey poll

[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.880]
and Gallup, Bush 47,

[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.840]
Gore 45.

[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.520]
Likely voters.

[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.540]
So the whole thing hinges on getting a whole bunch of people

[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.180]
out there tomorrow,

[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.180]
who everybody expects,

[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.480]
well, they're not going to bother this time,

[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.560]
because the candidates are boring,

[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]
and nobody really gives a crap,

[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.380]
and nobody just country votes anyway.

[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.000]
That's what it all boils down to.

[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.220]
A massive,

[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:38.780]
gigantic,

[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:39.900]
humongous,

[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.660]
upheaval of people coming out to vote tomorrow.

[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.700]
Hey, I got to make sure that I got the right place.

[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.000]
I'm going to get up right

[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.560]
in the early in the morning.

[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.360]
I'm going to vote in the morning.

[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.740]
And I hope that it's if there's a victory part place

[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.080]
on the crowd.

[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.820]
I hope that's correct.

[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.080]
I didn't get any bum information.

[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.820]
Because it looks to me like a little firehouse building there,

[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.380]
and sunrise by 118.

[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.240]
It looks like a,

[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.900]
an outhouse is what it really looks like.

[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.360]
Yeah, I hear the people in the hell in the elevator voting

[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.420]
guys to set out house again.

[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.200]
I scroll in sunny.

[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.300]
You jackass.

[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.300]
10 past 10 at 560 WQ.

[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.380]
No question the server may be

[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.300]
used to this without the express written permission

[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.260]
of WQAM,

[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.720]
DC God has written appropriate.

[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.100]
I wouldn't believe a word,

[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.300]
Neil said if the phone was not organized.

[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.980]
Good. I got entertainment tonight.

[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.660]
Governor Bush,

[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.200]
why did you outlaw the bunch of steel workout video in Texas?

[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.520]
I want you to have an answer.

[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.940]
She can pass on from one generation to the next.

[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.240]
What?

[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.100]
I want you to have your own answer.

[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.260]
That you can call your own.

[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.000]
That's tonight on entertainment tonight.

[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.320]
That's 15 to 560 WQMC.

[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.060]
The DUI, the DWI,

[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.900]
whatever you want to call it,

[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.040]
that may or may not have any impact on people.

[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.660]
But the fact is that this reporter,

[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.300]
what that was his name again,

[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.040]
walked through a slater somewhere

[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.380]
from the water stable,

[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.800]
from the Dallas Morning News,

[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.080]
comes right out.

[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:55.780]
And for some reason,

[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.200]
we only saw that three or four times.

[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:57.960]
And that was the end of it.

[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.160]
They showed it one more time yesterday.

[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.860]
Talking about the interview he did with W.

[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.740]
It was two years ago,

[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.080]
asking did he ever have any rest before night or after 1968?

[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.220]
And the answer was no.

[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.720]
And then what's your name?

[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.960]
Katie, what's your name?

[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.680]
Correct. What did I know?

[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840]
It's certainly his secretary.

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:15.840]
She steps in.

[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.680]
They were like separates them like in a wrestling match.

[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.100]
They're like in a ring in a boxing match.

[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.140]
She steps in between the two.

[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.340]
My last set, times up.

[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.460]
Get out of here.

[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.980]
You're starting to tread on very dangerous ground.

[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.460]
And this business, the fact that the American public

[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.920]
seems satisfied with the fact that he just generalizes

[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.520]
glosses over these 40 years or have many,

[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.740]
I guess, 25 years of screwing around,

[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.580]
with, well, I didn't have a perfect record as a youth.

[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.740]
First of all, 39, 30, 80 youth, that's number one.

[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.640]
And number two,

[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.760]
I inquiring minds if they had any brains,

[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.300]
probably would like to know what that means.

[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.640]
Other than just the glittering generality.

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.300]
Because characters,

[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.240]
they're one of those big things that I've been screaming about.

[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.260]
And if you notice on his campaign on his stump speeches,

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.060]
stump's may, why anybody's buying it,

[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.500]
could it exactly the same thing everywhere?

[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.200]
All the cliches about all the oil fashion politics

[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.420]
and the Washington politics and all this horse crap.

[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.340]
Now get rid of the bitterness in Washington.

[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.800]
All these, I mean, mindless generalities.

[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.460]
Because he can't answer his questions about the fandom

[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.540]
social security with the trading dollars over here,

[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.860]
for the young people and the trillion

[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.600]
for the old people who are supposed to be collecting it now.

[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.640]
He can't answer that.

[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.520]
And certainly doesn't want to talk too much about the tax cut for the rich.

[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.960]
So it's a lot better to talk about

[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.620]
getting rid of the bitterness and the old style politics

[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.360]
and the character assassination and yada yada yada.

[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.120]
What the hell are we, what are these people listening?

[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.840]
Do I just don't get it? I really don't.

[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.980]
Here's our poll question for today.

[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.980]
And I guess you guessed it.

[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.080]
We'll try one more time.

[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.560]
I will see how much success we have.

[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.100]
If you are voting tomorrow,

[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.020]
who are you voting for?

[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.760]
George W. Bush,

[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:00.780]
Al Gore,

[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.100]
Ralph Nader,

[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.780]
Harry Brown.

[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.920]
Yeah, we even put Harry Brown on there for those

[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.380]
10 libertarians we have out there.

[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.580]
You know what we say about the libertarians?

[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.340]
Yeah.

[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.680]
They blow too.

[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.840]
They're blowing more smoke than the native people.

[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.100]
How about we, we might even put Fudge Brown on there,

[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.720]
maybe next time.

[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:20.960]
Put me a cannon on there.

[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.020]
Did I leave him out?

[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.820]
Oh yeah, Patrick, if you can and Scott,

[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.980]
that was a sublimal or a slip on my part.

[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.560]
Don't forget the great Pat you can and all you will

[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.840]
right when Republicans are there.

[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.740]
You know something I think we ought to start a campaign

[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.700]
down there in Little Habana.

[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.560]
Make them understand that Pat you can and is their man.

[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.580]
Not George W.

[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.620]
He don't like illegal, he was not getting the Grinch to begin with.

[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.720]
We'll get somebody to draw.

[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.220]
That's right.

[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.400]
I can't hate immigrants.

[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.220]
Why can't you get that?

[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:43.680]
Huh?

[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.040]
Well, that's somebody to draw.

[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.000]
She been flybed out of the handkerchief around his neck.

[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.000]
Oh, I'm beginning neck.

[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.880]
I remember she wrote for round his neck yesterday.

[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.200]
Yes, today.

[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.600]
The W was down here in,

[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.340]
in what was it?

[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.820]
The FIU stadium.

[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.260]
And Rosanne, Rosanne, Diana was on the stage with him.

[00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.520]
She was standing about 4 feet away.

[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.080]
She was curling so much.

[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.780]
I thought she was going to jump up and just hop on his back

[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.580]
and do a little piggyback.

[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.340]
She was just forming it to mouth.

[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.980]
And especially when he started screaming about a free Cuba

[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.300]
up on all this other crap.

[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.820]
And all those toothless wonders again,

[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.740]
screaming in the end to the same or...

[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.880]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.620]
Tired crap.

[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.160]
I say tomorrow every living and breathing person in South Florida

[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.940]
who really cares should give a spartial

[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.260]
a ride to the pouring place, huh?

[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.320]
Which is anything you have to go to idea?

[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.120]
I'm not saying that most black people don't have their own cars,

[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.940]
but sometimes there's a little bit of brown Toyota's.

[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.100]
Well, that's the Haitians, I guess.

[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.400]
Let's lift those Haitians out.

[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.460]
Those you make ones too much.

[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.640]
Don't forget about them.

[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.920]
Here's a mobile in Pemberk Pines, our first call of the week.

[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.180]
Hello.

[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:50.740]
Hello?

[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.060]
Hello?

[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:52.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.220]
It's a good morning.

[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.360]
That's my first time calling on Little Nervous.

[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.500]
I drive taxi for living.

[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.140]
The bushwaters are behind the boat, you know?

[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:03.880]
Is that what?

[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.100]
But I have for me money to board for a boat.

[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.300]
You offer you how much?

[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.300]
Nothing much, you can give you ten dollars tip if you bought for us.

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.560]
Yeah, not enough.

[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.840]
I said no.

[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.280]
Well, you should have taken it to me, can't tell you.

[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.380]
In fact, we should take tips from all the boys people

[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.120]
that I go and vote for.

[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:23.680]
Go anyway.

[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.320]
No, he gave me, he gave me.

[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.180]
But it happened.

[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.860]
But you think, then, south-fowl, who you all are going to win?

[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.600]
I said, I don't know who won, then, but I go to board for a go.

[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:34.980]
He said, why?

[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.700]
I said, first of all, he's a little better looking than before.

[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.380]
That's right.

[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.720]
And he got a little penis.

[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.720]
He got a little experience more than the bush.

[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.100]
He said, no, but a bush is a good guy.

[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.140]
God is liar.

[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.380]
I said, they are lie.

[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.460]
He said, no.

[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.080]
He said, bush, do what he say.

[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.480]
But God promised, and he don't do it.

[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.360]
I said, but more papa bush.

[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.900]
He said, what he said?

[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.600]
He read my, read my hips, yeah.

[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.060]
Yeah, he said, that's his son.

[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.200]
Okay, for the lesson, vote two or three times for going.

[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.580]
And since you'd love it at tax,

[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.040]
you pick up a bunch of desperate people,

[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.100]
make sure they vote for go to.

[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.760]
Good luck to you, sir.

[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.640]
God bless you.

[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.660]
How do you like that?

[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.520]
They're off on Cadwara.

[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.980]
I read both for both stats.

[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.480]
I desperately are here in South Florida.

[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.060]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless.

[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:29.740]
Why I see lines?

[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.920]
Five is still out of dust.

[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.180]
He gave me a song to dance and double talk about that.

[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.000]
You know, I'm looking at that trend for September.

[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.340]
I mean, this is faster for this entire radio station.

[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.660]
And I'm thinking to myself, boy, if I'm in his shoes,

[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.600]
I'm on the phone right now with the phone company.

[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.260]
I'm like dancing around the edges of the building.

[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.100]
I'm doing everything in my power to try to resurrect the audience here.

[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.380]
In fact, I'm sitting here looking at that phone

[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.040]
and I'm trying to resurrect this audience too.

[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:52.920]
What is with this?

[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.300]
This is the debut for the election.

[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.220]
Oh, that's right.

[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.100]
It's Monday, I forgot.

[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.080]
And we're not talking about the canes and the fish.

[00:16:59.160 --> 00:16:59.960]
The fish and the cane.

[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.460]
See, that's what this, what this state is all about.

[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.520]
Football, give me the ball, give me the ball, give me the ball.

[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.360]
That's what it's all about.

[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.900]
And speaking of that, how the hell come we haven't read anything

[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.940]
over the weekend about the Murray Boys being gone?

[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.000]
Speaking of sports.

[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.660]
Just a matter of time, baby.

[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.100]
Just a matter of time.

[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.500]
Here's a mobile in pomp and a hello.

[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.640]
Yep, you're going to vote for Goyan Hebrewman.

[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.460]
5, 5.

[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.160]
Okay.

[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.120]
5, 6, 7, I was reading.

[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:26.660]
That was brilliant.

[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.

[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.040]
I think you ought to call a cease-band people.

[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.240]
Maybe we can still get them in here today.

[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:32.320]
Yeah.

[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.560]
Oh, we had a couple of days last week that you would have been

[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.780]
really just, uh,

[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.440]
slapped yourself in the armpit a couple of times.

[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:41.960]
Here's Fort Myers.

[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.320]
Hello.

[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.940]
Flaps yourself in the armpit?

[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.380]
What's that?

[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.020]
Come on, let's get with it, sir.

[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.860]
Let's hear your material.

[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.220]
Not mine.

[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.920]
We just heard mine.

[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.400]
All right.

[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.260]
First of all, the strikers will see the card to get to the polls.

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.040]
And on Wednesday morning,

[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.140]
what you're going to have to do is change that song.

[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.400]
It's going to be, uh,

[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.760]
President Bush.

[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.940]
Is a, we already had President Bush.

[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.440]
And he was a piece of Smith.

[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.920]
Well, we're going to have another one.

[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.720]
No, I don't think so.

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.260]
Yeah, we are.

[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.260]
And he, uh,

[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.320]
but you know something?

[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:10.740]
Yeah.

[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.740]
The fact that you're sitting here on the phone saying it,

[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.940]
number one, isn't going to make it happen.

[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.300]
And number two, it really dismayes me that you y'all

[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.400]
hose over there on the West Coast.

[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.340]
Uh, we're not interested in what you have to say.

[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.160]
We know it's got that big red thing on the map.

[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.380]
They had a thing in the papers over the weekend showing the,

[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.040]
the demographics and the voting preferences

[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.720]
and the various parts of this day.

[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.380]
We know that you're solidly.

[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.420]
And they could put up a goddamn gorilla there to run

[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.740]
and just still be aware of where that was done.

[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.480]
A Republican ticket.

[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.620]
You go there and vote for it because it's in your blood.

[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.860]
You can't help yourself.

[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.340]
In fact, I think you deserve that,

[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.820]
you know, I think he filled in like a rubber glove deep inside

[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.020]
you.

[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.660]
Correct him.

[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.220]
Speaking of these ads in the paper over the weekend,

[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]
here was page.

[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.880]
What is it?

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.440]
5V?

[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.180]
What is your sloppy punny?

[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.520]
5V in yesterday's Sun Sentinel.

[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:54.740]
Saturday's.

[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.220]
Can a Christian vote for Al Gore?

[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.640]
For page ad.

[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.820]
This is, this is right in line with at last.

[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.980]
Yahoo, we just heard from Fort Myers that asshole.

[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.900]
Seven issues from a biblical perspective.

[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.140]
It's a matter of record that without votes of professing Christians,

[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.440]
Clinton could never have been elected.

[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.160]
Approximately a turd of evangelical Christians voted for him.

[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.220]
You turd.

[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.860]
George Washington himself stated flatly,

[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.640]
it is impossible to write governor the world without God in the Bible.

[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.760]
Even though of course he was a deist, which means he was an atheist.

[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.420]
We sincerely believe it is impossible for a true Christian

[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.280]
who follows God's word of hope for God for the present.

[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.500]
And it's like, it's like, it's an appointment

[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.360]
that George Washington was not a Christian.

[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.260]
This is a paid political ad paid by Peter Foy,

[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.260]
1515 Fort Street East Omaha, Nebraska.

[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.880]
Peter Foy, some great.

[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.400]
One, Gore advocates abortion, partially born and unborn.

[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.480]
The precious value of life is the major thing that the Bible

[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:55.960]
goes on.

[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.440]
Two, Gore advocates or tolerates homosexuality.

[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.380]
God's word is clear.

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.660]
Homosexuality is an abomination that goes on.

[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.300]
Gore will appoint judges who are hostile to Christianity.

[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.080]
All right.

[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.840]
The president's power to appoint Supreme Court justices

[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.960]
and federal court justices is far reaching.

[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:13.860]
In my view, if elected,

[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.980]
we'll attempt to refashion America into a country

[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.440]
deboitable of values and virtues

[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.020]
our founders will be necessary for the survival of our nation.

[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.700]
Like to have them, I'll drunk and then cover it up.

[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.940]
And then why not about your military service, too?

[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.980]
Four, a great presidency will continue

[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.960]
a systematic destruction of the family.

[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.300]
Federal government policy and atheists

[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.500]
at public school and oxidation

[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.340]
has exasperated the present deteriorating condition.

[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.200]
Of your...

[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.900]
How do you...

[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:40.660]
Are you hearing that?

[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.660]
There's dumb as he is.

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.580]
And by the way, one of my things social security

[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.780]
is some kind of a federal program?

[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.320]
Yeah, that was another good one.

[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.800]
All he just has trouble.

[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.600]
He just gets confused.

[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.220]
He's a moron, okay?

[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.480]
They think it's some kind of a federal program.

[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.140]
The word they're looking for here is exacerbated,

[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.480]
but it says federal government policy and atheists

[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.540]
at public school and oxidation

[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.320]
has exasperated the present deteriorating condition

[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.540]
of the American family.

[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.400]
How do you like that?

[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.480]
A little bit moron, hang out together.

[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.640]
How do you like that, Apple, huh?

[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.720]
Business style ethics will continue on this war.

[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.740]
The war can foster the indoctrination of America's children

[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.740]
and the war could further disarm our nation

[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.200]
and demoralize our funding forces.

[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.620]
Yadi, yadi, yadi, yadi, yadi, and God and the Graham and Citroen so on.

[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.060]
Then we got another one.

[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.720]
23A in yesterday's Herald.

[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.180]
Have you ever held a newborn baby in your arms?

[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.480]
Have you ever seen the signs of a baby's feet

[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.880]
at 10 weeks after conception?

[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.220]
Well, here they are, the actual size.

[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.380]
And it's got like a little,

[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.980]
a tiny pair of black feet, as a matter of fact.

[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:48.680]
Ooh.

[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.920]
On November 7th, we have a chance to save millions of babies

[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.620]
alive by voting for people of life,

[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.740]
especially a present who respect the life of the unborn.

[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.800]
White this sacred, make no mistake about this.

[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.500]
Psalm 13913 says,

[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.980]
You have formed in my inmost being,

[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.480]
You knit me in my mother's womb.

[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.080]
As the nation under God, Yadi, Yadi, Yadi,

[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.260]
this one's paid for by the McAlpine family,

[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:11.960]
whoever they are.

[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.140]
Both for George W. Bush for president.

[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.660]
For those of you who are pro-choice

[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.600]
and to make it with a new testament

[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.880]
and it's got Yadi, Yadi, a bunch of biblical crap.

[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.900]
So all the rights to do out there

[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.340]
who think that you're hopping in bed with moderate people,

[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.500]
you're hopping in bed with a far religious right.

[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.660]
I've been telling you that all along

[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.760]
and that's what it's all about.

[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.640]
Those are the people who are sound of hate right now.

[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.300]
They're squeezing it.

[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.040]
They're squeezing each other.

[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.220]
They're so excited about this.

[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.260]
26th after 10, at 5'60 W. Q.A.M.

[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.000]
Can you know, one last look.

[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.740]
I'm not a baby.

[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.920]
I'm not a baby.

[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.120]
I'm not a baby.

[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.380]
The way does this give me a few.

[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.940]
Not till they text your blood.

[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.460]
I'm not a baby.

[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.280]
I finally turned a day in you.

[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.160]
And I'm scared to be glad.

[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.880]
Yes, warning.

[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.740]
All you want to do is leave.

[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.840]
Not a baby.

[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.180]
But I'm really hot.

[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.060]
While we're pure.

[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.800]
I'm not scared.

[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.120]
I'm scared to be.

[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.040]
I'm scared to be.

[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.640]
School girl, just wait above my name.

[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.840]
Over my name.

[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.000]
When you think of what you'd do to me.

[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.300]
Remember that I'm.

[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.900]
Legal baby, that's your crime.

[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.940]
10, 32, 5'50 W. Q.A.M.

[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.220]
So George W. is up there saying,

[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.580]
what do they think, social security,

[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.780]
some kind of a federal program?

[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:53.820]
Vote.

[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.060]
And while you're turning out the vote,

[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.600]
make sure you talk to open minded Democrats.

[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.500]
And independence.

[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.180]
That word for words, verbatim.

[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.560]
Every campaign stop.

[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.180]
Word for word.

[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.960]
All he did come up with,

[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.120]
the Ulym now, he's got help is on the way.

[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.280]
It's only 24 hours away.

[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.280]
Help is on the way.

[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.840]
Help from this great prosperity of the last eight years.

[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.760]
Help from the fact that most of you are better off

[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.700]
than you were eight years ago,

[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.200]
under the Reagan Bush depression,

[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.320]
with high inflation, high unemployment,

[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.040]
and that unfinished Gulf War.

[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.420]
Yeah.

[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.820]
Help is on the way.

[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.060]
I'll write for the big oil companies

[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.360]
and the pharmaceutical companies

[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.600]
and the tobacco companies.

[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.720]
And all of his other friends who

[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.840]
pollute the environment like they

[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.080]
didn't Houston and all over Texas.

[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.600]
If you ever understand why the Democrats

[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.320]
didn't write a whole series of campaign ads,

[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.340]
just showing the Houston skyline

[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.660]
on an average day.

[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.940]
They had somebody reporting from Austin yesterday

[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.880]
with the middle of the afternoon,

[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.840]
even though they're now behind.

[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.680]
So maybe it was two o'clock in the afternoon.

[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.860]
And look like something you'd see at eight o'clock

[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.580]
in the morning on a foggy day.

[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.580]
We're like the end of the world in Austin, Texas.

[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.540]
In dust through a pollution, boys and girls,

[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.440]
you ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:01.960]
That's right.

[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.160]
That ought to be his line.

[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.060]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.140]
Here's the, well, this is the same stuff we had before.

[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.640]
MSNBC is rolling the polls.

[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.120]
Florida 49 for Gork 46 for Bush Nader with six.

[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.120]
Illinois Gorks got a 13 points up.

[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.520]
Michigan,

[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.460]
rural 50, Bush 43, Nader 5.

[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.600]
Oh, this is brand new.

[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.460]
Isn't it?

[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.460]
Is this what I had before?

[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.260]
Michigan?

[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:24.700]
Not.

[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.420]
That's what we had before.

[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.620]
I started to say before they're going to have last minute polling.

[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.200]
They don't think it on election day itself

[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.360]
because they claim they don't want to

[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.640]
influence the outcome of the election.

[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.400]
Anybody believe that?

[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:33.800]
Huh?

[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:34.520]
Yeah.

[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.300]
But they're conducting last minute polling

[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.360]
right up till midnight tonight.

[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.340]
So if your phone rings,

[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.120]
we're assuming that's on the West Coast

[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.300]
they're doing the polling up till midnight,

[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:42.940]
but you never know.

[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.520]
Maybe the phone rings 12, 30 to morning.

[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.260]
Ah, that's it.

[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.760]
As I hear, I write here,

[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.340]
I'll zag me, I'll zag me up.

[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:48.520]
Yeah.

[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:49.800]
Click.

[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.560]
Can't understand why they haven't so much

[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.880]
difficulty in those people to respond.

[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.440]
Here's the mobile and Hollywood.

[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:57.780]
Hello.

[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.920]
Hi, I'm not you doing okay.

[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.840]
You can vote today, you know.

[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.440]
If Brown County is still doing absentee, that was.

[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:05.820]
Yeah.

[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.560]
Why don't they don't need to do that?

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.520]
If you don't want to worry about it tomorrow

[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.520]
in the South satellite courthouse or the main courthouse.

[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.920]
I'm not going to any courthouse.

[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.640]
I'm just like because the polling place is right

[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.240]
by my house, assuming it's the right one.

[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.300]
Yeah, because I just went and voted today

[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.140]
because I'm driving people to the polls tomorrow.

[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:24.620]
Wait.

[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.260]
As long as the Democrats.

[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:26.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.840]
So there's not very many people online

[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.120]
and you get it over and done with.

[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:32.800]
Okay.

[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.040]
All right.

[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.340]
Go back and do it again tomorrow.

[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.000]
Okay.

[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.860]
5'6'0'5'60.

[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.840]
What's that purer look like?

[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.760]
38 votes already.

[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.400]
If you were voting, if you are voting tomorrow,

[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.640]
who you be voting for?

[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.740]
Goal 27.

[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:45.940]
Verse 6.

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.880]
Later to you can't and to and

[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.420]
fudge a brown, a hairy brown.

[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.060]
One.

[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:50.680]
Uno.

[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.400]
Doble of eight.

[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.140]
Doble of eight.

[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.440]
He was in here yesterday in Miami.

[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.320]
Doble of eight.

[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.740]
I wonder if he was talking about the 15th of May.

[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.080]
The AC6.

[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.340]
I mean, this man is so dumb.

[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.860]
He makes a rock look like a genius.

[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.880]
Better than ought to be his campaign song.

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.540]
I am a rock.

[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.080]
Here's for a water deal.

[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:14.380]
Hello.

[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.420]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:15.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:16.820]
Hey, two questions.

[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.600]
First of all,

[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.860]
why did Elaine Bloom change the spelling of her last name

[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.760]
from UM to O-Lam?

[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.900]
Excellent question.

[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.000]
Because people used to probably call her Blum.

[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.740]
And the third second question is regarding the DUI

[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.560]
that George Bush got 24 years ago.

[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.420]
DWI, yeah.

[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.120]
We have a senator who drove off a bridge

[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.620]
and no one seemed to really care about that.

[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.920]
Kill the goal from that, you know,

[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.180]
Massachusetts.

[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.680]
Why do you see the fact of the matter is

[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.500]
that senator has stood before the electorate.

[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.060]
There is no great secret about that.

[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.220]
It's been talked about a great length.

[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.940]
And that senator has stood for the election in this state.

[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.200]
In fact, sometimes he doesn't even have an opponent

[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.220]
because he's so popular.

[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.760]
And the electorate, I'm not saying that he doesn't have a right

[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.520]
to drive while drunk,

[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.960]
but the public has a right to know about it.

[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.680]
And he certainly ought to not be lying

[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.700]
to be producing the Dallas Morning News or anybody else

[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.000]
and trying to cover it up, which he has been.

[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.220]
And then there's a stupid letter

[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.600]
of the editor in the paper today about

[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.620]
all how courageous and refreshing it was

[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.800]
to see him deal with his head on.

[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.580]
Well, he dealt with it head on

[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.520]
because they had him.

[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:11.960]
Gotcha.

[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.640]
They had the grids on him

[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.300]
that come out you know,

[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.180]
they're in the name, whatever little smoth

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.440]
on his head that the goofball.

[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.600]
Yeah, there's a senator and how can he

[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.260]
lay in the room change their name?

[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.160]
What is this?

[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.740]
What is this?

[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.020]
I bought a keychain and CD off your website

[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.380]
and now they want to give a $1,000

[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.100]
dollar.

[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.260]
I don't understand what the hell I

[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.080]
is. What is that?

[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.480]
I don't get it.

[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.820]
That's one of our chronic statues with the crayon.

[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.760]
Oh, yeah. Maybe somebody wrote it out for him.

[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.580]
Just scrolled it out.

[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, £5, 60.

[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.620]
Sure, if that's the best you can do,

[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.200]
if that's the best campaign speech you can do on the

[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.200]
84 about the senator and Massachusetts,

[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.080]
and by the way, sir, he happens to be

[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.860]
probably in my opinion the most effective

[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.320]
senator in the entire United States

[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.240]
Senate in my favorite.

[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.080]
And it's not true that no one seems to care

[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.420]
about it.

[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.460]
We've only heard chapequetic.

[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.980]
Oh, yeah, they care about it a lot,

[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.760]
but let me say it again.

[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.140]
When you go before the electorate,

[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.680]
then we find out how much those people

[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.300]
care about it.

[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.740]
And obviously the people of Massachusetts

[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.660]
don't care.

[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.540]
And I'll say it again.

[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.060]
We're going to have whoever wins,

[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.980]
Dick Cheney, George W and Ted Kennedy

[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.820]
and also Alasero Gonzalez.

[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.460]
Those four are going to be driving.

[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.320]
They're going to be taking turns.

[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.580]
They're going to be fighting for the wheel.

[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.720]
That's right.

[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.320]
The Hogan's dollars family.

[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.720]
Delphin, he'll be in their two.

[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.820]
Twenty two before, rather than five, 60 WQA.

[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.780]
I think Bush is going to win.

[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.640]
I hate to say that.

[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.920]
A lot of really other people out there.

[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.280]
I smell the same tough one on him that I smell

[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:47.720]
on Reagan.

[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.280]
You can smell it.

[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:49.960]
I'm out of weight.

[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:50.560]
Yeah.

[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.120]
If they would come out and find out that he

[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.040]
murdered somebody 25 years ago,

[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.660]
or if the abortion story came out,

[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.340]
I still don't think it would make any

[00:29:59.340 --> 00:29:59.600]
difference.

[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.180]
Even the same people that put those edges

[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.080]
in the paper, I was just really,

[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.680]
wow, but he accepted Christ.

[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.360]
It doesn't make any difference.

[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.320]
See, that's a catch-all.

[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.280]
That's a cover-up for everything.

[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.340]
No matter what you did,

[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.180]
it's like those crazy born-again nuts who say,

[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.460]
oh, if Hitler would have accepted Christ

[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.140]
on his deathbed,

[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.200]
then he'd go to heaven.

[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.960]
Which is why many of us are going to be

[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.020]
very happy not to be there.

[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.460]
The Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio.

[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.520]
Five, six, eight,

[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:24.860]
QA.

[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.140]
A long, so,

[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.620]
years so big.

[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.060]
I don't know the closing statements.

[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.040]
I trust you, President.

[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.480]
It's one of my top priorities,

[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.280]
Kim, to give every single child in the United States

[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.680]
are handguns that are so widely available

[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.760]
that kids are finding ways to get a hold of them.

[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.980]
I'm a grandfather now.

[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.420]
I want to be able to kill my grandson.

[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.500]
We were violent and unpredictable.

[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.580]
I'll do whatever is necessary if I'm present

[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.820]
to make sure that it stays that way.

[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.220]
And I ask for your support.

[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.840]
So the most important thing is to have a new

[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.820]
commander in chief who are man money to corrupt officials.

[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.160]
And to make sure our society is as hopeful

[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.500]
as it possibly can be.

[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.400]
Every single child in America must be put to death.

[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.460]
I mean, every child.

[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.700]
We can close public schools

[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.260]
and a hard, hard,

[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.000]
hard person and I don't care about children.

[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.100]
We feel that is a failure of a kids'

[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:18.660]
and lose friendship.

[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.440]
How do I do?

[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.280]
I do 18, 4, 11, and 5, 60,

[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.420]
WDQ. I'm Randy Rhodes, 307.

[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.120]
As we continue recycling the same old losers again,

[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.140]
stupid talk starting.

[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.040]
When did you say them all?

[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.660]
Did you say them all?

[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.120]
We don't know.

[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:30.900]
Oh, we don't know yet.

[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.320]
Where?

[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.080]
Yeah.

[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.180]
Oh, she ought to be gigantic.

[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.020]
Let's hear it.

[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.680]
As they continue putting on these,

[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.620]
the succession of female tacos

[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.740]
to all sound of saying,

[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.040]
fail of saying,

[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:46.700]
unwiscible,

[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.880]
but in the words of that brilliant programmer,

[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:51.640]
Pete Boulder,

[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.760]
she's a broad,

[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.620]
she's a broad.

[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]
Okay, nice going, everybody.

[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.460]
Three to seven, I'm stupid talk starting tomorrow.

[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.320]
Can't wait for that.

[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.900]
Boy, Hank, you're in big trouble now.

[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.400]
We're starting some time.

[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:05.860]
Hi, Leah.

[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.140]
Hello.

[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.940]
You know me, no one is perfect.

[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.260]
Yeah, including you.

[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.640]
Fony voice, same old clowns.

[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.960]
Put it back in your pants, pal,

[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.200]
because if ever anything was invented by nature,

[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:16.880]
that wasn't perfect.

[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:17.660]
That's it.

[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.300]
That's it.

[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:18.820]
Oh, God.

[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.720]
Take a look at that thing.

[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.500]
Here's my me B, Chelo.

[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:22.920]
Yeah, I don't know.

[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:23.480]
Okay, sir.

[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.960]
Yeah, I was one on, uh,

[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.820]
you guys stuck me against Bush.

[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.800]
My name is Wayne Bush and I'm a well,

[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.560]
it's in his and I like my,

[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.860]
my, my, my, my, my,

[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.800]
I'm a relative of you.

[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.960]
You were kissing a kiss in a cousin?

[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.100]
What you think?

[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.160]
Are you kissing cousin?

[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.600]
Yeah, no, I'm not a kissing cousin,

[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.080]
but you're talking bad about him.

[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.900]
Yeah, like he's a more honest.

[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.440]
He is a world.

[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.120]
He is.

[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:44.980]
No, I'm not.

[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.020]
I mean, you've been idiot.

[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.120]
How about you, a joke?

[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:47.840]
Yeah, joke.

[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.360]
I'm bad.

[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:49.600]
I'm bad.

[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.340]
I'm 10 year everyday.

[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.260]
Okay, with your phony name and your phony laugh

[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.360]
and your phony, whatever else.

[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.640]
Your phony stront penis.

[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:56.960]
5670560.

[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.760]
So this is the mentality of the Bush people.

[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.260]
The guy from Fort Myers,

[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.420]
this guy here,

[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.160]
the other punk that calls up a dissonant

[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.420]
about Ted Kennedy and his,

[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.220]
driving the,

[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.000]
it's Mary Joe,

[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.500]
completely off the bridge in the

[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.320]
Sepulchic.

[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.300]
As if that's guy,

[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.280]
he's a little off the line on a,

[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.160]
and Missouri,

[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.200]
poor Bush 49,

[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.100]
Gore 45,

[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:13.820]
Nader 4.

[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.420]
Bad news for the Gore people

[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.200]
right there in Missouri.

[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.840]
I'll tell you that.

[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.400]
That's a state he can ill,

[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.580]
a while.

[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.280]
He would not find him.

[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:20.860]
I'm going to get anyway,

[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.060]
but they'll look real good.

[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.320]
Gore's got to win Florida,

[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.980]
Pennsylvania, Michigan.

[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.440]
All three make no mistake about that.

[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.780]
And then still has got some work to do.

[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.200]
5670560.

[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.360]
Listen to these calls.

[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.420]
We're getting here again today.

[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.660]
This is the intelligentsia.

[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.920]
The cream of the crop in South Florida.

[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.400]
And all so many of the

[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.140]
punters are saying,

[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.040]
oh, yeah, Florida's going to be the key

[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.280]
and South Florida specials.

[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.960]
We've got to decide the outcome of the solution.

[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.080]
Just for some of these people.

[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.480]
Here's South Miami.

[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:50.840]
Hello.

[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.960]
I want to vote for a.

[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.060]
Yeah, huh.

[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:54.860]
Delray Beach.

[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.080]
Hello.

[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.200]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:56.760]
Okay, sir.

[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.400]
Not cool before I'm, uh,

[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:58.940]
Bush reported.

[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.380]
And the reason why I think you might win is,

[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.860]
hey, you're going to make me the same

[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.800]
speech that you made before.

[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.020]
No, no, no, no, no, no,

[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.240]
that speech is I'm talking about polls.

[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:06.940]
Yeah, okay.

[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.580]
The poll that I've been looking at,

[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.980]
which seems to be the most reliable

[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.220]
in the last several elections,

[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.900]
is what they call the battleground poll,

[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.220]
which has the

[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.980]
Democrats, Solingo Lake and the Republican,

[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.440]
uh, Robert Goa as I think his name is Robert Goa,

[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.420]
something like that.

[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.020]
And their latest poll last

[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.280]
of this morning shows Bush with a nine point lead.

[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.220]
Okay, he's increased it actually over the weekend.

[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.400]
Nine point lead and where?

[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:29.980]
The whole country.

[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.340]
And what they said is,

[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.360]
it's, you know, listen to this.

[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.260]
I don't know if you heard this.

[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.600]
I an individual,

[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.400]
if he wins the election by more than 2.2 percentage points

[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.260]
throughout the country,

[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.500]
yeah, he cannot

[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.580]
statistically, he can't lose the electoral college.

[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.360]
I don't know how they figure that out,

[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.200]
but that's what they said.

[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.280]
That's ridiculous.

[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.540]
That's what they said.

[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.000]
I don't care what they said,

[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.300]
it's ridiculous because he's going to win

[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.080]
Texas by a gigantic landslide

[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.560]
and Groor isn't going to win California

[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.280]
by as much as they thought he was going to win.

[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.260]
So it's still a possibility.

[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.540]
They'll all say that.

[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.200]
And you'll say, I don't know,

[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.280]
I don't know how they figure that out.

[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.560]
And the only problem I have with him is,

[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.060]
and they see Zodby is an article I read is that,

[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.780]
Zodby says most of his polling

[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.380]
before six o'clock at night.

[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:11.720]
Right.

[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.380]
So he's not encompassing everybody.

[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.340]
When you poll at night, let's say between six and 11,

[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.380]
you get everybody.

[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.620]
Zodby just polls mainly during the day

[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.940]
and he gets mainly retirees

[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.880]
with people who aren't working.

[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.920]
So his poll channel is so close to Democrat.

[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.780]
It's under polls.

[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.120]
You mean as opposed to the Gallup poll,

[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.000]
but always for some reason,

[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.140]
seems it's totally Republican

[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.260]
for some strange reason?

[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.580]
Well, I'm just going by what I read now.

[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.460]
You know, and we'll know tomorrow,

[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.700]
you think at about 11 o'clock.

[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.200]
And one thing that I'll flart is that 100,000

[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:46.080]
absentee ballots are there are more than 100,000 absentee ballots

[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.320]
for Republicans of the Democrats.

[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.560]
So that tells me about motivation.

[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.320]
You've sent this, you've seen more of a motivational

[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.540]
base with the Republican.

[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:54.980]
Oh, sure.

[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.260]
There's no question about that

[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.500]
because they got the board again.

[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.880]
Christians are whipped up into a friend.

[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.100]
He has no question about that.

[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.440]
Do you know how to who wins with still living

[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.580]
in the greatest country of the world?

[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.060]
No, we're not.

[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.340]
No, we absolutely are not.

[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.340]
Well, we disagree there.

[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.580]
Okay, I have a great day, pal.

[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.360]
See, there's a guy who believes this is the greatest country

[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.420]
in the world with our third rate education

[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.580]
in our life expectancy.

[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.740]
So much shorter than somebody

[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.540]
that civilized countries.

[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.220]
This is the fattest country in the world.

[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.960]
No question about that.

[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.680]
In fact, I'll tell you what a great country it is.

[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.180]
There's an article front page of this morning's

[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.440]
Harold that I found kind of bizarre.

[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.640]
It's this four-and-a-half block the

[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.120]
Broward international visits up

[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.120]
385% since 85.

[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.920]
And it goes on about all these people,

[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.520]
mostly from Latin America,

[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.620]
Europe, or whatever.

[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.980]
It's got the countries listed in here.

[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.700]
But anyway, when I picked this up

[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.700]
when I came into work this morning,

[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.080]
I picked up the front page again.

[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:49.680]
I thought to myself,

[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.700]
what is it that these people are doing

[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.660]
when they come to Broward?

[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.120]
And of course, immediately,

[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.100]
once they came to mind, the saw grass.

[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.240]
And I opened up to the second part of the article

[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.280]
on page 14, a

[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.640]
Rally tourism season increase.

[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.540]
And here are a bunch of people,

[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.420]
a couple of old parts in some middle-aged people.

[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.460]
Bargain seekers tourists from Norway and Sweden,

[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.680]
this and brought from Van

[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.860]
to shop at the Sawgrass Mills Mall in sunrise.

[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.380]
Oh!

[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.100]
The greatest country in the world, baby.

[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.520]
More strip shopping centers,

[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:19.920]
more shopping malls.

[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.980]
Do they have a hotel in the mall there?

[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.040]
No, but they should have.

[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:23.620]
They ought to, yeah.

[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.380]
Equally.

[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.940]
I mean, what are we talking about?

[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.740]
I mean, we'll be glad to take their money.

[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.620]
Just keep bringing them on.

[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.200]
And drop it off a little sack, thank you.

[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.900]
But I just don't understand what the hell they're doing there.

[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.660]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.360]
Hello.

[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.400]
Hello.

[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.240]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.480]
Hi, I'll, how are you this morning?

[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:41.840]
Al.

[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.540]
Al Gore?

[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:44.860]
Yeah.

[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.660]
I'm sorry, Al Niel.

[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:47.660]
Al Niel.

[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.040]
No Gore.

[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.740]
I'm a little bit confused.

[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.420]
I'm talking about Al Niel.

[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.200]
I have, I'm a volunteer.

[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:54.920]
I sure have.

[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.680]
I'm a little bit more animated than Al Gore.

[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.760]
You sure are.

[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.140]
Okay.

[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.040]
Most definitely.

[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.260]
And this is not a matter of fact, I'm a

[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.540]
a little abit listener, except that today I have a little

[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.700]
favorite ask to see if we can let people know on your

[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.880]
listening station that.

[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.920]
My listening station?

[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.580]
Well, you've broadcast the date and

[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.360]
brow it and I believe the west coast.

[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.060]
Yeah, even on the west coast, that's right.

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.840]
Even on the red next, there's no stickers over there.

[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.440]
In four mires and Naples, right?

[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:20.940]
Right.

[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:21.940]
But I'm a volunteer.

[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.900]
There are probably you're doing your sheep right now.

[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.500]
I've been volunteering for the democratic party here

[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.700]
in Miami.

[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:29.160]
Yeah.

[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.700]
And I just wanted to ask whether or not there's

[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.740]
people that would like to come to see Al Gore and

[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.820]
Stevie Wonder tonight, starting at 10 o'clock on South

[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.100]
Beach.

[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.700]
Now Stevie Wonder, going to see Al Gore?

[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.140]
They he's going to be there.

[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:43.640]
Oh, okay.

[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.680]
He's actually going to be one of the performers

[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.900]
and Debbert Cox is also going to be there.

[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.160]
And they can get free tickets if you are a

[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.240]
Gore supporter at any of the democratic party officers

[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.740]
and you can go buy and pick them up.

[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.600]
We'd like to see as many people there as possible tonight

[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.120]
and if anyone can come out and support

[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.340]
Al Gore and his victory tonight,

[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.860]
that would really help if you could put this on the air.

[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:12.360]
Okay.

[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.120]
It's on the air.

[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:13.800]
Oh, it is.

[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:14.300]
Great.

[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.240]
Thank you very much.

[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:15.480]
Thank you.

[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:15.640]
You're welcome.

[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.020]
Good luck.

[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.340]
California poll.

[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:17.740]
Look at that.

[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.800]
Goal 47, Bush 44, Nator 7.

[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:21.860]
That's a little bit too tight.

[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.220]
Florida poll.

[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.400]
Goal 49, Bush 46, Nator 4.

[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.040]
I think they've got to call before though.

[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:28.600]
I think you're right.

[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.580]
I think Bush is going to win.

[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.560]
But of course, don't get overconfident.

[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.500]
Don't get too cocky.

[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.540]
You might be surprised at just how many people turn out.

[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.280]
See, we tend to believe polls that tell us things that we like.

[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.120]
If a poll comes out and it's several points

[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.140]
in favor of the candidate we don't like, we say,

[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.080]
ah, yeah, well, we don't believe that poll.

[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.600]
And so we keep certain, of course, now it's easy

[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.940]
because there's eight million different polls.

[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.840]
So we tend to focus in on the poll that has the result

[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.440]
that we like and say, yeah, they know their craft.

[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.440]
Like the Fox poll.

[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.220]
The Fox poll of the weekend was the only one

[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.860]
that was like dead even 43 a piece.

[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.800]
Now, the why would they say anything they say Fox news?

[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.540]
Oh, of course not.

[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.320]
They're a bunch of fashions which surprises me.

[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.600]
Maybe they're trying to roll somebody

[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.740]
into believe that Gourmite win.

[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.060]
I don't know what they're trying to well pedal at Fox.

[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.620]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:16.960]
Hello.

[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:18.920]
Hollywood.

[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.240]
Going once.

[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.360]
Going twice.

[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.040]
Probably expired.

[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.480]
Here's a, um, Margette call.

[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:25.720]
Hello.

[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:26.900]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:27.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.740]
I just want to reply to the people

[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.300]
that are calling about Ted Kennedy.

[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.280]
That is the chapacritic.

[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.240]
Yeah, I had one call.

[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:35.940]
It's not the people.

[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:36.860]
That's what I call one.

[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.140]
I know.

[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.720]
There's been on several stations.

[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.600]
I just want to say that's why he never was able to run

[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.200]
for president.

[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.160]
What do you mean he was never able to run?

[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.380]
He did run in 1980s.

[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.100]
Don't you remember that, sir?

[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:46.720]
He did run.

[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.660]
No, I didn't recall that.

[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.280]
Oh, okay.

[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.060]
Oh, boy.

[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.320]
I'm in.

[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:54.480]
Oh, boy.

[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:54.500]
Woo.

[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.020]
Can I ask you a one question?

[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:02.500]
Seriously?

[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.040]
What's the use?

[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.260]
That's the question.

[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.000]
What's the use?

[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.060]
You get paid.

[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.640]
No, I understand that.

[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.380]
I'll take the money.

[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.980]
But I mean, what?

[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.360]
And here's a guy who's over left and no better.

[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.960]
You have to like have somebody read you a book sometime.

[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:19.960]
You know, it's not.

[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.520]
It's only 20 years ago.

[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.540]
He was never able to run for a, he doesn't recall that.

[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.500]
That he challenged Jimmy Carter in 1980.

[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.180]
One a couple of primaries and then proceeded to get his ass kicked.

[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.100]
Because he really couldn't say why he was running for president

[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.320]
other than his name was Kennedy.

[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:38.520]
Just like George W.

[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.500]
He's running for president because his name is Bush.

[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.160]
Because the daddy and Dick Cheney and all of his other buddies,

[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.380]
all his other asshole buddies.

[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.900]
This is the figurehead.

[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.860]
Just like Reagan was the figurehead for eight years.

[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.380]
And now Michael wants another figurehead.

[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.920]
Because that's exactly what he is.

[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:55.360]
A puppet.

[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.920]
Here's a mobile in the key.

[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.240]
Hello.

[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:02.560]
Hello.

[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.320]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:03.600]
Yes.

[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.240]
Have a good evening.

[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:04.900]
Good evening.

[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.300]
I'm a grocery supporter and I just have a question kind of off the topic a little bit.

[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.400]
I look at a sample ballot and I've got all the stuff about reelecting the judges.

[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.220]
But working, you get information of how these judges,

[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.980]
what their records and what how they ruled on different things.

[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.540]
Every time we have an election, I never see anything in the papers or any kind of

[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:34.800]
information about their past performance and why we should be reelecting them or voting them out.

[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.100]
I don't know.

[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.540]
Big section in the papers yesterday.

[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.180]
Both of them are held in the Sun Sentinels.

[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.200]
Here's the focus section.

[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.520]
And there's a special election section in the Sun Sentinels also.

[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.040]
And a house racist.

[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.160]
By the way, the guy that called me on Friday and said,

[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.220]
be sure to vote for Elaine Bloom.

[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.440]
I'm going to long because I'm trying to pump up Elaine Bloom and be Clay Shaw.

[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.060]
But the fact is, I don't live anywhere near Elaine Bloom's in the Clay Shaw district.

[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.020]
District 26.

[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.620]
I live like most of the people in Broward and most of the people in the district 20.

[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.560]
Peter Doich, who's running on a post.

[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.380]
So I'll try to vote for Elaine Bloom.

[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.080]
Maybe I'll find somewhere to write her name in there.

[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.740]
Elaine Bloom, Bloom, whatever it is, a B-base.

[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.080]
Sir, get you a paper.

[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.520]
Get you at one of yesterday's newspapers.

[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.660]
There's the best information for you right there.

[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.780]
Just pages and pages and pages.

[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.640]
More than you could ever possibly digest or even want to know.

[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.520]
Here's Lakeland, hello?

[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.560]
Yeah, and yesterday, as the Jebber was on all the radio,

[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.600]
I mean, all the talk shows.

[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.800]
And Sam Donaldson asked in point blank, he said,

[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.560]
you and your brother have not answered the question.

[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.520]
What happens when people take their money,

[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.920]
put it in the stock market and they lose?

[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.200]
Will the taxpayers bail them out?

[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.800]
And Jebber wouldn't answer.

[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.600]
Will they should bail out the SNL?

[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.400]
That's right.

[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.000]
But even funnier was on Fox when Jebber was on.

[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.440]
They were asking about the DUI and Jebber said,

[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.480]
well, the first time I heard about it was on television.

[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.740]
And they said, well, but then Jebber said,

[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.140]
but that tells, that nails in comparison to some of the other stories.

[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.800]
I could tell you about my brother.

[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:02.880]
And what he said,

[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.900]
here to share some of those stories with us.

[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.740]
And the Jebber said, well, let's just say he was ranbunctions.

[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.240]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:09.820]
Ranbunctions like that abortion.

[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:11.900]
Can you remember that?

[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.680]
No, seriously, this is very serious business

[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.280]
that this man has just made one blanket statement about,

[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.320]
well, you know, I did not have a perfect record of youth

[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.460]
or whatever the words were.

[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.440]
And then that said, he believes in the media

[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.920]
and the public have a lot of them to get away with it.

[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.560]
That's a satisfactory answer.

[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.660]
And let me also say that for years after this DWI,

[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.420]
he was still drinking until he was 40 years old by his own admission.

[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.420]
Well, we've seen him drinking in 1992,

[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.380]
until he was last.

[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.740]
Right on our website, that's right.

[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.960]
Didn't touch a drop of it, but that was in my class.

[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.020]
Well, maybe it was just ice.

[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:44.760]
Gobb is in.

[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:45.220]
Okay.

[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.760]
Can Bush read, is George W. Bush illiterate?

[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.140]
From Michael Moore, director of Roger and me, TV nation, etc.

[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.560]
Although, I might take time to read this,

[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.920]
or maybe I'll have somebody read it to me.

[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.240]
You know, next thing, these Democrats are going to be telling

[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.540]
that social security is some kind of a federal program.

[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.400]
I hate to point out the most successful federal program

[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.300]
in the history of the country.

[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.200]
I hate to point that out.

[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.300]
I also hate to point out that nobody is ever

[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.200]
going to miss any social security payments.

[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.740]
It's political, dynamite.

[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.840]
It's never going to happen.

[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.600]
So it's really a move point.

[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.200]
But you know, when you have nothing else,

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.720]
when you've got eight years of unparalleled prosperity

[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.060]
and everybody working, and the stock market I see

[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.520]
is way up again today, sorry, just a little bit.

[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:33.520]

[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.340]
George, too bad about that.

[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.220]
See, George keeps waiting for these craft stocks

[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.120]
to drop some more, so we can buy some,

[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.140]
like Xerox and BBG.

[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.300]
I know you're beginning to understand what it's all about.

[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.840]
You think you've got it all planned out,

[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:46.660]
and you're going to move in it.

[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.260]
And then before you have a chance to even fart,

[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.300]
all of a sudden, oh, it's up more than what

[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.360]
you wanted to pay for it.

[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.480]
So it's BBG, I have it.

[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.580]
I don't know, and I don't care.

[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.640]
Three minutes before 11 and 5,

[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.980]
what I do care about is where the Hallorrharser

[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.720]
guards, is this man ever going to bring us just one,

[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.040]
just a crappy old, what your George is wearing

[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.700]
is nice, mixing our t-shirts today.

[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.260]
The last thing I've ever done.

[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.880]
That's the last thing we ever got from them.

[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.040]
If you people at NYX are listening down there,

[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.200]
and I'm sure that you are, this isn't the joke,

[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.160]
this isn't stick that Niels is doing on the radio,

[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.360]
this Frank son of a bitch down here in sales

[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.760]
has abscited with every single one of your great

[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.360]
cigars that was intended for us.

[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.140]
And we're getting pretty guy damn pork off about it.

[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:24.380]
Uh-huh.

[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.760]
Forte radio 560 WDQAM by Ami Port Lauderdale,

[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.640]

[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.560]
with a world.

[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.740]
The Neil Rogers Show,

[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.220]
Fox Lord of Sabred Homehold, starting right now on.

[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.200]
WDRZL, WQM.

[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.400]
Oh yeah, this is the subject that other girls want me to be talking about.

[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.400]
Do you know what I mean?

[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.660]
It's a song.

[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.380]
It's on every girl's mind.

[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.540]
That's right baby.

[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.040]
The closer my pants is,

[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:03.780]
how it's gonna miss,

[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.740]
it takes two hands to handle it.

[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:06.940]
When I job it,

[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:07.860]
lots of the fish,

[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.660]
the gay guys all are wanting it.

[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.680]
When I wear pants,

[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.660]
I tuck it at my side,

[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.640]
but when I get chubb and it's all the one,

[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.560]
if I show the king sing a last,

[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.320]
I'll go on a deal and it's low guy.

[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.640]

[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.980]
Let me sing it again.

[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.020]

I love you all.

[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.920]
Maybe you don't know better

[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.640]
the baby.

[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:38.780]
The most beautiful,

[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:39.820]
my son,

[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.180]
so so so so.

[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.920]
I love you, my beautiful son,

[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:43.900]
I love you.

[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.300]
I love you all.

[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.680]
I love you.

[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.180]
I love you.

[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.060]
My son, so so so so.

[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.720]
One, but all three at five, 60,

[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.080]
WQ, I'm happy Monday to you.

[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.020]
Let's see, QM is going to be out tonight

[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.480]
with a picket sports bar and grill

[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.120]
in deer field beach in the corner of Hillsborough,

[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.340]
Boulevard and Powerline road with the QM van.

[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.320]
And it came our plans there for Monday night football,

[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.800]
though, I have the best in the LCDs

[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:04.700]
and the key change.

[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.040]
And also the great new buttons

[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.040]
that Planned Parenthood made

[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.900]
with me as Buddha and a whole bunch of other things.

[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.960]
Extending my one finger greeting,

[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.120]
they're beautiful friends.

[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:14.680]
Thank you Planned Parenthood.

[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.340]
God bless you.

[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.400]
So that's tonight in the deer field beach

[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.140]
in the corner Hillsborough,

[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.300]
and Powerline, the QM are plies

[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.120]
there for Monday night football.

[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.080]
And of course, you can also read your specs.

[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.340]
Now, what was that lengthy message from Mark Hiddnik?

[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.940]
They were telling me about on your voice mail.

[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.520]
They don't have the key change.

[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:29.960]
It's back.

[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:30.980]
So we already know that.

[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:31.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.520]
Isn't everybody in the world know that?

[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.780]
We have the CDs and cassettes,

[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.720]
it's specs all over town

[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.940]
and also in Naples and Formars.

[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.260]
Did they have the key change?

[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:37.580]
No.

[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:37.860]
No.

[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:38.840]
Did we already know that?

[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.300]
Oh, yes.

[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:41.720]
Mark Hiddnik, does he work here?

[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.120]
No, he don't work here.

[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.780]
So what's he sticking his nose in this for?

[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.040]
Hibbi.

[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.320]
Did he work for him?

[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.060]
He works to make sure I set what a side for him.

[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.000]
He wants one?

[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.260]
No.

[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:51.640]
No.

[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:52.500]
No.

[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:53.160]
I got one.

[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.500]
That's the American's one.

[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.760]
And you're not getting it, Hibbi.

[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.820]
Well, who does he work for?

[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:58.920]
Does he still work for Cox?

[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.260]
I mean, broadcasting?

[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.720]
5670560, pound 560 out of AT&T

[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.820]
in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.040]
169 votes if you're voting the bar.

[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.400]
For whom you be voting?

[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.980]
Grill 120, Bush 29,

[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.120]
neither 9.

[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.600]
How do you like that, huh?

[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.140]
Beyond.

[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.000]
Pat, you can't in seven.

[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.020]
And Fudge, I, Harry Brown, four.

[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.200]
The libertarian.

[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:20.980]
Roofball.

[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.220]
Here's a lady mobile in Miami.

[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:23.560]
Hello.

[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.480]
Hi, Miriam.

[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:25.140]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:25.700]
How you doing?

[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:26.220]
Okay.

[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.820]
Don't you own the towel yet for Bush?

[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.420]
Give you a little seat.

[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.580]
Don't you own the towel for Bush?

[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.200]
Well, you know what I'm saying.

[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.160]
Couple of things.

[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:37.560]
First of all, before I pick...

[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.620]
I don't know if anyone told you about this,

[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.500]
but my Miami hurled on Sunday.

[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.080]
Came wrapped in a plastic wrapper that says,

[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:45.820]
Bush changed.

[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.800]
What's a Bush chainy and all Republican candidates?

[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.220]
Really?

[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.680]
Didn't you say that the hurled came out for Gourmet?

[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.700]
They endorsed all the Democratic candidates.

[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.520]
Yeah, well...

[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.100]
I endorsed the Nelson, they endorsed Elaine Bloom.

[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.820]
Well, I was so pissed.

[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:58.560]
I'm sorry.

[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.280]
You know, I'll see that.

[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.220]
I told the hurled and I ripped them of New York.

[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.220]
Why, what are they saying?

[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.240]
They said, well, you know, they paid for it.

[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.500]
Yeah.

[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:07.200]
Yeah.

[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:07.820]
All right.

[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:08.600]
Second thing.

[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.160]
As a volunteer working at the grassroots,

[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.540]
being on the phone, the day and hour, waving signs.

[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.260]
This is an unscientific poll, but given the poll...

[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.140]
This is good as a restaurant.

[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:18.960]
Thank you.

[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.740]
But we were on U.S. one yesterday around the fall.

[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.080]
We were there from 3 o'clock to 5'30.

[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.720]
And I would say 7 out of 10 cars

[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.660]
sums up cis-plumding for Gourmet.

[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:30.860]
Oh!

[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:31.780]
Yeah.

[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.520]
So, listen, all of you folks out there,

[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.320]
they want you to think Florida is over.

[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.120]
But I'm telling you, from my experience...

[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.300]
Gourmet today is 4.

[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.600]
He's still to points ahead.

[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.480]
Gourmet 47.

[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.480]
Well, they say they're internal polls say

[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.880]
that Bush is ahead by 7.

[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.040]
The point is every Democrat, if you have to crawl,

[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:50.960]
if you have...

[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.880]
You know, if you need someone,

[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.520]
just get out there,

[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.800]
can take Florida and don't listen to what people say.

[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.860]
Because my experience, from what I say,

[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.320]
and it's only grassroots,

[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.100]
but there are people out there,

[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.580]
and especially the Cuban Americans

[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.320]
who are referring to the Muslim Democrats,

[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.060]
you're going to have a grounds level.

[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.060]
So, just keep the face.

[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.420]
I'm going to feel survival.

[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.380]
Don't let anyone win.

[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.460]
Okay, keep it up, sweetheart.

[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.020]
Bye-bye.

[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.800]
Yeah, they're internal polls,

[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.460]
they're probably where they hide them.

[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.460]
Blackdome, yeah, that's where the intern is.

[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.160]
The intern is in their...

[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.280]
Blackdome, on my bubble,

[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.200]
who had them under their head,

[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:25.900]
who were under the table.

[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.640]
5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 6,

[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.940]
you see one thing that's going to happen.

[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.980]
Wednesday, I'm going to come in here,

[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:31.560]
Wednesday morning,

[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:32.900]
and then of course, if Bush wins,

[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:33.400]
what's there?

[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.220]
There's a very good chance.

[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.980]
Well, then they're going to get all these

[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:37.340]
childish idiotic...

[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.100]
I see what are you going to do now, Naila?

[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.040]
And then I'll still be getting the same paycheck,

[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.620]
and I'll be taking home a lot more of it too,

[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.760]
if that tax-cutting passes,

[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.980]
which you probably won't,

[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.260]
because it's more that voodoo...

[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.020]
See, Ronald Reagan was accused by

[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.620]
Papabrasia voodoo economics.

[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.880]
This is more like voodoo economics,

[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.380]
because it's a polish myth.

[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:56.840]
voodoo economics.

[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.360]
None of it makes any sense.

[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.480]
Here's Miami, hello.

[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.060]
Hello, Nia Hawi.

[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:04.640]
Okay, sir.

[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.780]
Okay, Bush is a blind,

[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.880]
and the bad can't see the like Reagan type of candidate.

[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.100]
He wants to initiate a stockman type government,

[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.120]
also he wants to trial errorism.

[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.000]
I mentioned global things.

[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.440]
I can go over Nia.

[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.300]
Yeah, I don't think so.

[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.540]
5670560, pound 560,

[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.580]
on the AT&T,

[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.100]
and Verizon Wireless One.

[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.600]
They forget Papabrasia CIA,

[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.680]
the trial-editable commission,

[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:30.420]
to build the burger.

[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:33.820]
You see how this wicked web

[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.300]
that they weave around us.

[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.900]
All these rich Texas oil billionaires,

[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:39.880]
and all these special interests,

[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.380]
they decided long ago that W

[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.060]
was going to be the next in heriter.

[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.420]
He was going to be the next torchbearer.

[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.120]
He's bearing it.

[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.800]
Here's a lady in Hollywood, hello.

[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:52.920]
Hi, Nia.

[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:53.560]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:55.420]
Yes, I guess this first time I ever

[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.940]
recall the talks has some a little nervous.

[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.280]
Okay.

[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.500]
The American public is just making it crazy.

[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.100]
I can't believe how close this is.

[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:01.540]
I know.

[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.960]
To me, it's so obvious how instant

[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.680]
fear and arrogant and disgusting

[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.340]
bush shits.

[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.300]
But what I wanted to bring up was years ago,

[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.780]
Lara Bush ran a stop sign in Kildamian.

[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.960]
Now, if that had happened to Tipper Gourd,

[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.600]
how do you know how broad did that come from?

[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.100]
It was in People's Magazine,

[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.820]
October 9th issue,

[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.060]
in Black and White,

[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.280]
and they do their research to put a print in it.

[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.120]
And when she was 17 years old,

[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:24.800]
she was in a car,

[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.580]
she was driving,

[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.700]
and she killed a man.

[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.580]
Thanks for Kildamian's stop sign.

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.280]
But if that had happened to Tipper,

[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.680]
or Hillary, the media would have destroyed them.

[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:33.880]
Yeah.

[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:34.720]
It's destroyed.

[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.200]
I never even heard that story.

[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.480]
It's been pushed under the rug.

[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.340]
That it was in People's Magazine.

[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.500]
Just like the volcano rest in 72

[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:42.700]
has been pushed under the rug,

[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.060]
just like that abortion that Lara

[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:45.080]
Flint's been talking about,

[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.560]
and just like all of these other things

[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.620]
that come under the heading of

[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.780]
youthful indiscretion

[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.160]
that he was and then want to talk about.

[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:50.900]
Exactly.

[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:51.860]
Exactly.

[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.740]
So I just wanted to bring it up,

[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.840]
because if you haven't heard it,

[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.580]
then that means other people have a need for it.

[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:56.900]
Exactly.

[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.160]
And I read it several weeks ago,

[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.620]
and I thought it here in black and white.

[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:02.900]
Well, here I'll guarantee you,

[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.520]
I'm not letting either one of them drive me anywhere.

[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:04.960]
Yeah.

[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:05.820]
Got that right.

[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:06.580]
Have a great day, Su.

[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.080]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:07.740]
Bye-bye.

[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.640]
520 votes, 143 for Gore,

[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.680]
35 for Bush,

[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.440]
9 for Nader,

[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:13.160]
8 for Buchanan,

[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.100]
5 for little downtown,

[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.120]
Harry Brown.

[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.120]
9 minutes after 11 and 5,

[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.180]
60 WDQM,

[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.660]
what percentage have we got for Nader?

[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:22.500]
A 4 and a half percent.

[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.900]
So far for Nader.

[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.140]
You see, you people,

[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.060]
I'm going to say it again.

[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.220]
You native people.

[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:28.940]
It's a free country,

[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.700]
at least so far.

[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.460]
You're entitled,

[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:31.100]
whatever you like.

[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:32.880]
But keep in mind,

[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.320]
that if we can turn and blame you on Wednesday morning,

[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.620]
this is only the beginning.

[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.640]
This could only be the beginning

[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.540]
of many, many, many elections like this,

[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.360]
or a very small group of far left.

[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.040]
See, I thought I was about as liberal as you can get,

[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:46.560]
but I'm not.

[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.180]
These people are on the fringe,

[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.580]
just like the far, far right Christian evangelicals

[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:55.280]
are on the right wing,

[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:55.520]
friends.

[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:56.780]
These people are on the

[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:57.940]
diametrically opposed way

[00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:58.960]
on the left wing fringe.

[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.460]
They're not establishing any kind of a party

[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.820]
that's going to be a mainstream party

[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:04.500]
or have any influence in this country.

[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.400]
Not going to happen.

[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.360]
And over the weekend, like I said,

[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.300]
thank goodness the independent vote

[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.040]
and the independent liberals

[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.680]
and the native people

[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.620]
are coming back to gore in droves.

[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:17.780]
And that's going to happen

[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:18.920]
in these last 24 hours.

[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.220]
Come back to their senses.

[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:22.320]
Even Marlowe Thomas'

[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.500]
her husband has been doing too much wacky weed.

[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.440]
Or something like that.

[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.340]
She said, she said,

[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.460]
will she say he's an asshole?

[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:28.820]
Yeah.

[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.500]
Ten pants, the letter to 560 WDQM.

[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:41.180]
What the hell was that?

[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:41.880]
Say it again, Jim.

[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.080]
Were you fudge back in?

[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:46.980]
Unbelievable.

[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.120]
Anyways, 150 WDQM at 560 WDQM.

[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.920]
560 out at 0560,

[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.740]
0560 on the AT&T

[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.540]
and Verizon wireless lines.

[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.640]
Here's a mobile and four-moderate.

[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:57.880]
Hello?

[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:58.660]
Yeah.

[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.860]
Well, right wing disinformation.

[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.280]
First of all, that woman was correct at that.

[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.380]
Laura Bush did kill some guy

[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.100]
when she was 17 years old.

[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.360]
Nance Lawyer.

[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:10.580]
She was...

[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.700]
Then we're going to do that pull them out.

[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.080]
Who do you rather have to be your show for?

[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.360]
Laura Bush, George W.

[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:15.280]
Rick Sanchez,

[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:16.800]
Lassie, Organ Zollers,

[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.400]
or Ted Kennedy.

[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.480]
Or Dick Cheney.

[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:19.160]
Yeah.

[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.640]
Um, can we find anybody in this country

[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.620]
who could drive anymore?

[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:23.920]
Oh, god damn it.

[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.280]
Now, to that tachophonic New Yorker

[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.460]
from Del Rey Beach,

[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.080]
he said, first of all,

[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.680]
he said a lot of DS.

[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:31.580]
Number one,

[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.580]
he proposed the dodgy pull.

[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.460]
There's a reason why it's called the MSNBC Dodgy pull.

[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.060]
John Zodby was the most

[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.180]
after his pulcer

[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.180]
in the 92 and 96 presidential elections.

[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.920]
There's MSNBC could hire the pulcer.

[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:45.660]
The higher him.

[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.400]
Secondly, he called all day,

[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.480]
not just in the day,

[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.840]
from nine in the morning from nine at night,

[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.700]
and there's a reason why

[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.580]
W. was in Florida,

[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.520]
gone storm in the state yesterday,

[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.580]
because he's trailing.

[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.060]
He was in Jacksonville,

[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.200]
with on each Miami camp in Orlando.

[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.140]
His brother,

[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.880]
the bigger little brother,

[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.080]
was on four out of the five top shows,

[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.060]
because he's trailing.

[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.920]
His brother's, uh,

[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:12.700]
jet bush,

[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.360]
it's W. lose his Florida,

[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.420]
that jet bush is

[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.840]
political career in silk.

[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:19.400]
Mm-hmm.

[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.440]
And, um,

[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.560]
also as far as the F&T ballots,

[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.820]
100,000 people have a fly-pred in F&T ballots.

[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.480]
Not 100,000 Republicans have applied for ballots.

[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:31.960]
And then the service is being...

[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.720]
Don't get used to the facts, man.

[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:34.460]
Okay.

[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:39.160]
And lastly, in 1968 and 1976,

[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.700]
being a incumbent surge,

[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.020]
okay, because of buyers' remorse

[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.500]
over the Challenger.

[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.120]
And that's what's happening now.

[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:48.760]
We're seeing it in the Zodby Hall,

[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.100]
where it's now 46, 47.

[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.780]
We're seeing it in the Gallup Hall,

[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.460]
where it's 45, 47.

[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.540]
And the blacks are coming home,

[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:57.660]
the libel is coming home.

[00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.580]
And let me say one thing to the Nators supporters.

[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.520]
The Roth Nator is not going to win this election.

[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.540]
Roth Nator is not going to win one state.

[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.740]
Roth Nator is not going to win one electoral vote.

[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.000]
One county, one precinct, one district.

[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.840]
Roth Nator ain't winning buckets, okay?

[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.940]
He's not winning buckets, okay?

[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.260]
So you're just throwing away your votes.

[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.700]
If you want a vote for votes,

[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:17.000]
okay,

[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.280]
okay, come down.

[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.140]
That's our hysterical, well, man.

[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.220]
Well, listen, he least he's whipped up and fired up

[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:24.900]
and pissed off.

[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:25.960]
Let's hear it for him, okay?

[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:27.640]
Now if we can just get everybody else,

[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.720]
all those old folks, the old Jews, the Shrarches,

[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.640]
fangs, all the women out there who care about

[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.340]
keeping government out of their uterus,

[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.340]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T,

[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:39.300]
and for eyes on wireless lines.

[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.500]
How's that for common, tremendous respawn here?

[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.360]
236 votes.

[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.980]
If you're voting tomorrow, who you be voting for,

[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.060]
Al Gore 164, a little under 70%,

[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:50.280]
George W. 45, 19%.

[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.200]
Oh, now the Nator rights, they heard they weren't doing that great,

[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.860]
it's another 13, 5 and a half percent.

[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.920]
You can't innate in the Harry Fudge Brown 6.

[00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.860]
See, these Nator people, it's kind of like,

[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:01.060]
oh, you're worse stubborn,

[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.460]
and we're going to show you a thing or two,

[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.620]
all you goddamn Republicans and Democrats,

[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:06.540]
we're going to show you how we can mess it all up.

[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.360]
Well, go ahead.

[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.060]
Go ahead, because everything that you believe in

[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.660]
is going to go right into the toilet.

[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:16.100]
And you'll be responsible for it.

[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.680]
Here's Holly, would hello.

[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:20.340]
How you doing?

[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.700]
Oh, that's right, but I forgot Patty Smith is for Nator, I'm sorry.

[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:23.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.160]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.180]
You're absolutely right.

[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.940]
I have four things, I hope I can get them all in here.

[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:28.680]
Okay, number one.

[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:31.180]
Is you right about the Nator thing?

[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.060]
I think that there's a lot of people I know who like Nator,

[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.500]
including myself, but if he messes this up,

[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.580]
he's going to have a hell of a time trying to build a green party,

[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:42.320]
which I support, but it's going to take a long term,

[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.740]
a long-con commitment to build such a party up

[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.860]
if it's going to last.

[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.520]
And these people need, you know,

[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:50.200]
not going to last on the far left.

[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.480]
There's no constituents to you for it.

[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.240]
Well, he always,

[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.200]
always has a tiny minority party.

[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:56.000]
What's it going to accomplish?

[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.700]
Right, well, I'm saying even if so,

[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.780]
even for the sake of argument that it does,

[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.520]
they're still going to need our support.

[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.520]
And after four years of W,

[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.120]
if they mess this thing up,

[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.780]
they're not going to have our support.

[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.060]
So I mean, they should look at it that way.

[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.260]
We need their support.

[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.860]
Now, I'll be glad to sign anything for Nator

[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.520]
after the election over.

[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.500]
Right now, we need their support.

[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.840]
Second of all, George W. Bush,

[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.740]
the stuff that's coming out,

[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.000]
he's going to make Clinton look like a choir boy.

[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:23.400]
Okay?

[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.260]
Once he's going to mess up the economy,

[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.660]
people need to read the book you were talking about,

[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.800]
Paul Blagallas books,

[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:29.780]
and get information.

[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.920]
And this is not a partisan issue.

[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.080]
This is a disaster.

[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.700]
This man does not have the experience to run this country

[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.020]
and he's going to mess it up.

[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:38.940]
Third of all,

[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.060]
you were talking about,

[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.500]
I hear you talk a kidding leave,

[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.640]
vote three or four times.

[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:43.720]
We can't do that,

[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.740]
but we can get people out to the polls.

[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:46.960]
Talk to somebody,

[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.540]
take somebody out there,

[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.920]
let's get into it.

[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:50.880]
And fourth of all,

[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.980]
I got three rives to the polls here,

[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:53.400]
numbers,

[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.900]
if you could repeat these on your air,

[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.700]
so everybody can get out there.

[01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.120]
Okay?

[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:04.000]
And Dave Towney, it's 305-354-2770.

[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.920]
That's 305-354-2770.

[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:15.560]
Broward Towney, it's 954-923-8488.

[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.040]
923-8488.

[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:24.420]
Palm Beach is 561-279-4466.

[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.720]
561-279-4466.

[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.180]
There's no excuse not to go to the polls.

[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.240]
Get out there,

[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.980]
let's show a democratic turnout.

[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.780]
This guy George W is going to mess up this country.

[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.240]
We need to get out and vote for rights.

[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:39.600]
Okay.

[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.140]
Bye bye.

[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:40.960]
Go on, thank you. Wow.

[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.760]
Okay, we'll put numbers down.

[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.500]
George wrote them down,

[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.320]
so we'll have them for you.

[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:44.820]
And those excuse,

[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:46.780]
even if you're on your hand,

[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.780]
your legs on your last,

[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.400]
your legs,

[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.400]
free rides, they'll slip you,

[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.220]
they'll drag you there.

[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:58.380]
Here's a 560-560-560 on the AT&T

[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.140]
and provides a wireless line.

[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.160]
Here's a mobile and bokeh, hello.

[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.520]
Mobile and bokeh.

[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.720]
Sounds dead as it's running out to me.

[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.540]
Here's four miners again, hello.

[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:13.560]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.040]
Okay.

[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.080]
Hey, I think what if you think

[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.180]
there's a better country to live

[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.380]
than want to take your fact

[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.640]
to you butt-bell, okay?

[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:21.340]
Already have.

[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.380]
Already have.

[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.040]
Bye bye bye.

[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:23.800]
Yeah, bye bye bye.

[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.300]
There you go. There's always

[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.540]
now they're coming out

[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.120]
and four miners,

[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.820]
where we were nearly almost getting those calls,

[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.280]
but now they're all coming out together.

[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.680]
They finally let their sheep

[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.480]
below and they let them heal up a little bit this morning.

[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:34.960]
Got to the phone.

[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.080]
Hey, guess what, pal?

[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.060]
I'm not going anywhere.

[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.000]
And you're one of those many people

[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.280]
over there.

[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.240]
First of all, you're listening

[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.540]
voluntarily to this show,

[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.440]
which as finally as me,

[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.780]
because you got nothing to do with us

[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.660]
over here. Thank God.

[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:45.580]
And number two,

[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.960]
you're one of those people that just

[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.280]
die in between the noon and one o'clock,

[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.260]
or between noon and two,

[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.500]
depending on which day the week to be

[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.780]
when you're sad to screw up

[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.200]
with this show.

[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.780]
You know, what's hell to do with yourself?

[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.640]
Or your boyfriend?

[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.080]
Five, six, seven,

[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.060]
oh, five, six, eight,

[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:02.560]
come on out.

[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.700]
What up, place, man?

[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.160]
The Southwest Corridor.

[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.360]
Whatever the hell they call it.

[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.660]
Fort Malia in Collier County.

[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:12.860]
God, see, that's my luck.

[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.580]
And that's that's the beastly's idea

[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.800]
of putting the on Nationwide

[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.940]
is the Fort Myers and Naples.

[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:19.960]
Wow.

[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.380]
Just like the time we were on in Tampa.

[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.460]
Remember those couple of years?

[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.700]
Those were good.

[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:28.920]
That's my luck.

[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.000]
Here's a mobile incendol.

[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:31.760]

[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:32.640]
Yeah.

[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:33.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.460]
Hello, it's Tom.

[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.000]
It's all up to the front of the year.

[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.360]
Some suns that drive many years

[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.400]
and point he lived out here.

[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.600]
I'm a good old faithful Republican

[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.020]
who voted for Nixon.

[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:44.380]
Uh,

[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:45.100]

[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.380]
Ford Bush.

[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.900]
And I'm happy to say I voted for

[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.940]
Clinton last year election.

[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.140]
But I'm not here with a couple of

[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.120]
brutal being Democrat friends of mine.

[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200]
We want to know if you've had any

[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.040]
information on the border

[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.400]
reality that I can sunset out.

[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:56.840]
Stoppage.

[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.840]
Yeah, somebody just called a little while ago.

[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.100]
Can you get that information

[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.340]
out over the air force?

[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.080]
Well, she gave it on the air.

[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.560]
Well, go and get it.

[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.740]
I didn't know if anybody wrote it down

[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.060]
or somebody could call back later.

[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:08.440]
And uh,

[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.740]
see if we could get it.

[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.260]
Okay.

[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.560]
Somebody called back.

[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.320]
Okay, thank you.

[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.280]
What do you say?

[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:15.900]
Five, what are you going to

[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.960]
so animate it for in here?

[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:17.620]
You're getting this in

[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.320]
crazy, yeah, crazy.

[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.360]
Oh, yeah, they're hostile.

[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.080]
What about?

[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.420]
What do you think?

[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.880]
That always red next color of us.

[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.260]
The station where all the clear

[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.920]
is the neighbors call up to talk

[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.460]
about there.

[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.060]
Yes, that's that cause that's

[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:30.680]
the station right.

[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.500]
This is the one.

[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.500]
So it's obviously not your station.

[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.040]
Okay, find your own state.

[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:36.880]
In fact, a lot of us.

[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.920]
I think is beyond pretty soon.

[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.300]
Fat ass will be on there.

[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.520]
Spouting that same

[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.340]
typical right wing bullcrap.

[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.420]
Had a great thanks about that

[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.760]
about how when the bubble was

[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.320]
you know caught with his pants down.

[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.660]
All that stuff on and on.

[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.060]
About the tremendous hysteria

[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.440]
and the outrage in the psychosis.

[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.940]
And now that we turn it around,

[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:56.960]
it's like oh boy,

[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:57.920]
he mums the word.

[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.700]
How purely political this all is.

[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.800]
And look at the timing and yadda yadda yadda.

[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.920]
Here's a mobile and pember pine.

[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:07.240]
Hello.

[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.580]
Hello, Neil.

[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:08.980]
Yes.

[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.700]
I think the wise destroyer

[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.360]
I agree with you is because you go with

[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.160]
gore however I'm very much

[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.520]
interested in the third party.

[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.000]
When you listen to Ralph Nader

[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.240]
and I really believe a lot of what

[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.840]
he points out is very accurate.

[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.500]
And he he seems to be if he has a lot

[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.560]
of the points in mind that you discuss.

[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:29.400]
Oh, you mean like a

[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.080]
eliminating the Senate and

[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.660]
eliminating the military.

[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.600]
Well, I mean I have a

[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.540]
campaign reform.

[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.160]
How about the you know the far

[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.200]
well you're you're picking and

[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:38.920]
you're pulling and you're

[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.800]
pulling and drugs.

[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.340]
Sir, you're picking and choosing

[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.740]
and there is no question that there

[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.020]
are a few of the things that he

[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.780]
talks about that I agree with whole

[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.060]
heartedly makes a lot of sense.

[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.560]
But the fact is that when you look

[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.440]
at the entire party,

[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.760]
platform of the green party,

[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.500]
in fact, even he doesn't agree with

[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.560]
the entire platform of the green

[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.600]
party. That's what makes it so

[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.020]
ridiculous.

[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.040]
Well then how do we get all the

[01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.820]
disaffected? I mean I think a third

[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.960]
party can easily summon up in maybe

[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.180]
four years from now.

[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.760]
Now if we get the if they get the

[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.140]
five now, not a third party on

[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.580]
the far left of the far right in

[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.620]
Ralph Nader isn't the one who's

[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.120]
going to leave it.

[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:12.820]
It's going to have to be

[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:13.620]
somebody more moderate.

[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.600]
It's never going to happen in this

[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:14.880]
country.

[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.960]
Well, I mean, but do you think a

[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.080]
third party can can get 20 percent?

[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.640]
But the pro got 19 percent eight

[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.140]
years ago.

[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:22.720]
Yeah.

[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.580]
And he's a moron.

[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.120]
So yeah, if there were a third

[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.240]
party that appealed more to the

[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.280]
mainstream, that was a real

[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.300]
populist party.

[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:28.640]
Sure.

[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.080]
So I'm like a just event.

[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:30.320]
Sure.

[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.940]
Well, maybe although you can't

[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.960]
see what imagine what they would

[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.480]
do to him.

[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.680]
Mr. Atheist, just

[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.000]
event.

[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:37.280]
Sure.

[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.000]
He'd be done.

[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:38.660]
No, seriously.

[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:39.920]
He'd be done before he started.

[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.120]
He thinks.

[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.020]
I don't think I know.

[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:43.660]
I know.

[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.780]
Just ask you, Louisville.

[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.260]
But he'll tell you.

[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.020]
We need to bring faith back.

[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.160]
We need to help those faith-based

[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:49.740]
chillies.

[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.340]
We need to put a lot more full-page

[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:52.920]
ads in there,

[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.100]
condemning everybody in their

[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.160]
brother and name of Jesus.

[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.740]
That's what it's all about.

[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160]
You better get with it, Mr.

[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.080]
20.

[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.320]
So just like those calls you

[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.340]
talking about off the air.

[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.740]
All those wonderful people.

[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.200]
I am much dope.

[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.400]
Biggest smoke are you wrong,

[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:07.760]
vacation.

[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:08.440]
Not enough.

[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.100]
20.

[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:10.860]
So just after a while,

[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.180]
that's 5.

[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:11.680]
60 W.

[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.680]
If you haven't probably not as

[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.620]
much as George W.

[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.260]
Didn't do no cocaine.

[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.480]
Didn't get new D.

[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.760]
DUI's would be W.

[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.120]
Didn't show open essence.

[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.740]
But Neil Roger shows

[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.820]
New Sports Radio.

[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.280]
Line 60's.

[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:26.800]
You.

[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:27.220]
A.

[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.240]
And I've got to keep you

[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.260]
a judge straight here.

[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.500]
I saw all the Jones.

[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.640]
In penthouse today.

[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.440]
Light up, car crash.

[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.920]
To look away.

[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.900]
It's burned my eyes.

[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.300]
What Janice.

[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.200]
If there's one thing.

[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.540]
Worse than her friend.

[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.380]
It's a late white open.

[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.320]
It's also bad science.

[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:09.200]
No rise.

[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.280]
She sends them saber.

[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.240]
And they.

[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.160]
She showed us.

[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:14.700]
They're.

[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.400]
They will.

[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.740]
They try to.

[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.120]
With the next bottle.

[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.300]
And next thing we're going to be

[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.780]
telling us that social security

[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.040]
is some kind of federal program.

[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.000]
God damn it.

[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:29.140]
Let me.

[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:30.660]
32 to 5 60 WQM.

[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.240]
Here's a nice note card on

[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.340]
that's a beautiful plan for

[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:33.580]
Randy.

[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.820]
Multi-tasked defense thing.

[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:35.420]
Thanks, Randy.

[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:37.480]
Thanks to the defense thing.

[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.620]
You guys are the best every year.

[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:39.120]
Never fail.

[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.080]
Always come true.

[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:42.520]
I think we'll just leave that one here.

[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.660]
You've taken enough crap on.

[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.580]
Oh, and you missed out the beautiful roses.

[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.840]
The pink roses that wound up over

[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.740]
Joe Castellas lady friend.

[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:50.460]
So, huh?

[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.020]
The youth.

[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.760]
They were pink.

[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.520]
You know who they were from.

[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:55.780]
Just told.

[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.280]
No, but you're getting close.

[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.180]
I'll give you a clue.

[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.060]
I'm a fat.

[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:00.600]
Ah, you.

[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.000]
Yeah, Mr. Suckerbott.

[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.680]
Oh, that's right.

[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:02.980]
I forgot.

[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.540]
He put your picture in the screw.

[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:06.940]
Although I don't want to tell you

[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:07.460]
where he said.

[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.800]
You know, I showed you a tongue.

[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.060]
I don't want to tell you where he said

[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:10.600]
your tongue was.

[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.000]
Anyway, Roger,

[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:13.840]
I brought Roger more.

[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:14.440]
Michael Moore,

[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.440]
director of Roger and me,

[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.240]
TV nation, etc.

[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:16.600]
writes.

[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.100]
And this goes back a month.

[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.260]
But that is still good reading.

[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.640]
He says, as I write this,

[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.200]
there are two presidential debates left.

[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.800]
I have a suggestion for Jim Lerr.

[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.820]
Don't ask George W. Bush any further questions

[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.700]
about social security or prescription drugs

[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.800]
or mandatory testing for students and teachers.

[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.760]
Just get up out of your moderate state

[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.880]
and take a copy of a book.

[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:35.600]
Any book.

[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.240]
Walk over to Governor Bush.

[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.480]
Hand it to him and ask him to read.

[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.360]
That's right.

[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.040]
Just ask him to read from anywhere in the book.

[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.580]
I have a hunch that he can't read.

[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.760]
I know this is not where he is saying to say,

[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.440]
I have no proof.

[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.040]
It's just been an impression that's

[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.680]
been sticking in my cloth for some time.

[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.300]
I'm reluctant to make this observation,

[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.780]
not only because it seems so cool,

[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.900]
but also just the possibility of the source

[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.900]
to real and unlikely that no sane man

[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.940]
would ever utter such a thing.

[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.820]
But I was struck by something

[01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.660]
in life with each debate.

[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.060]
Bush never wrote down even a single word

[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.740]
on the legal pattern in front of him during the debate.

[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.880]
I've never seen a debate.

[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:08.360]
Or even Ronald Reagan refused to jot even one word down.

[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.920]
So he wouldn't forget to respond to it.

[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.540]
It was Bush not writing anything

[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.020]
because his mind is a steel trap

[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.360]
where they enhance memory storage

[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.300]
and impeccable collating capabilities.

[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.540]
I'm honestly worried you can't read

[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.820]
and write at an adult level.

[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:20.840]
Back in the primary,

[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.760]
who was asked what his favorite book was as a child,

[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.660]
he replied to very hungry caterpillar.

[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:25.700]
As it turned out,

[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.580]
that book wasn't published

[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.920]
until he was in his 20s.

[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.200]
Everyone laughed it off at the time.

[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:30.920]
From that point on,

[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.360]
his response has been his favorite book

[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:32.940]
he is the Bible

[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.480]
and his favorite hero is Jesus

[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.280]
and his favorite philosopher is Jesus.

[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.880]
And when Oprah asked him what are your sure of,

[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.440]
he replied, Jesus, and the Bible.

[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:41.540]
Christopher Hitchens,

[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.920]
no friend of the Clinton Gord administration,

[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.360]
reports in the nation this month

[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.060]
that when Bush's age would give him briefing papers to read,

[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.940]
he would ask others to read them for him

[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.560]
or just give him a verbal summary.

[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.600]
Of course, a briefing paper is just that,

[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:53.480]
a summary, a brief,

[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.360]
no one at team saw Bush read them.

[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.160]
G. L. Sheehy and Vanity Fairwrights

[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.320]
that Bush has a learning disability

[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.440]
that he's dyslexic.

[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.460]
This is a serious and frustrating hand

[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.780]
he kept faced by millions of Americans,

[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.080]
but it's not a scarlet letter.

[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.600]
Lots of people I know are dyslexic

[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.720]
and there are things they need to overcome.

[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.420]
But the Bush can't deny the charge

[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.020]
and no one in the media followed up.

[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.740]
The median fact has stopped reporting how consistent

[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.460]
and how often Bush mixes up his words

[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.000]
and just says the wrong damn thing.

[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.660]
At first it was cute and funny

[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.940]
and Archie bunker short away,

[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.420]
but it's not just the word

[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.220]
sublimible that he has a problem with,

[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.360]
the mangling of the language happens

[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.260]
in virtually every speech I've heard the governor make.

[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.280]
Even though every speech is scripted

[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.580]
and he repeats it almost verbatim

[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.760]
in friendly robot-like tones

[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:31.760]
that if he can't paint stuff,

[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.220]
he can't help but lose himself

[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.500]
in words he is supposed to say.

[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.120]
It was no mistake that at one point during the debate

[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.580]
when he started down his robot path,

[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.320]
he realized he wasn't answering the question

[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.380]
when silent and then said,

[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.520]
I forgot the question

[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.220]
when looking like a law schoolboy.

[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:45.800]
Now how can he wrong?

[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.860]
I don't point this out with any glee or condescension.

[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.760]
I'm not exactly Mr. Intelligence here.

[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.060]
Just read any of these columns

[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:51.960]
or my internet letters

[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.540]
and you'll find them chock full of misspellings

[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.460]
in proper grammar

[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.540]
and bizarre syntax

[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.780]
in spite of my best efforts

[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.120]
to the editors or staff assistance

[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.340]
who are simply overwhelmed

[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.200]
and defeated by lying assault on the King's English.

[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.680]
But I'm not running for president of the United States.

[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.100]
And I'm not attacking teachers

[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.140]
who do a lot of the job.

[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.680]
And I'm not making thorny promises

[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.820]
that not one child should be left behind

[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.960]
when in the state of Texas

[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.240]
more poor kids go without help

[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.760]
care than any other state in the country.

[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.400]
I got a call as we come somewhat out of nowhere

[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:16.720]
year,

[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:17.960]
but further the person that secretly

[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.100]
gone to the records facility

[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.640]
and looked at the original transcript

[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.660]
of George W. Bush

[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.520]
from 1964 to 1968.

[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.100]
Not only with grades

[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.000]
all that we've heard about,

[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:27.920]
C's and D's and not a single A,

[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.200]
but it looked as if they were written

[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.820]
on a file card over other grades

[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:31.600]
that had been erased.

[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.560]
Could there have been original

[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.940]
grades that were worst in the ones

[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:35.820]
he's admitted to?

[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.060]
Uh-huh.

[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.800]
I'm all for the dumb guys being one myself.

[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.720]
I dropped out of college after the first year.

[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.600]
I still don't know if a amount has one A or two,

[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.180]
but the leader of the three worlds should

[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.120]
at least be able to say

[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.260]
to read or say explicit instead of

[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.440]
exquisite as boosted in Detroit in September

[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.820]
when he referred to the exquisite

[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.180]
second violence in the movies.

[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:54.900]
Though it is your better,

[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:55.800]
Mr. Ler,

[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.160]
Governor Bush here's a copy of Green Eggs in Hand.

[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.280]
Please turn to page 12 and read for us.

[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.240]
Can we sum it up by saying?

[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:07.500]
Eeeeh!

[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.120]
He's dumb.

[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.400]
and the elotist of people that were calling you off the air,

[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.580]
what are they having common with him?

[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:15.260]
They're dumb.

[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:16.260]
Yeah.

[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.240]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:17.380]
Yeah.

[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:18.180]
We're either a feather,

[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:18.940]
flock together.

[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.100]
I remember as a kid.

[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.400]
The first time I paid any attention

[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.300]
because I was older off,

[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.860]
I was 10 years old, 1952,

[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.580]
was when I was now a renegade to Adelaide Stevenson.

[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.400]
Adelaide Stevenson was an A-Kid.

[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.380]
I mean a brilliant man,

[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.240]
a genius, a great,

[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.260]
articulate speaker.

[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.420]
And Eisenhower was a war hero,

[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:36.840]
but almost illiterate.

[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.600]
He had a lot of interest in what was going on.

[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.840]
Hey, there were just so many words,

[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.640]
just kind of like this guy that he couldn't pronounce.

[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:44.900]
Landslide, Eisenhower.

[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.080]
And then I remember in 1956,

[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.960]
Stevenson ran again against Eisenhower.

[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:49.960]
No chance.

[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:50.880]
War in hero.

[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.060]
He had a lot of interest in what was going on.

[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.060]
He had Alan,

[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.020]
John Fausty,

[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:56.280]
a dollar,

[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.220]
a secretary of state

[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.460]
who was largely responsible

[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.380]
for what's going on in the world at end of the Middle East.

[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.240]
But we're not supposed to think about that,

[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:04.020]
about those mistakes.

[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.920]
So never overestimate the intelligence of the American people

[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.240]
when taking their leaders because they like to pick

[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.860]
somebody who better reflects their own intelligence

[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:14.700]
or lack their wealth.

[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.940]
They gravitate toward dumb.

[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.900]
As in what color is an orange on the reader's show?

[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:22.840]
What color is an orange?

[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:23.880]
That's why they chose so-

[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.500]
but now they like that.

[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.220]
They like the question,

[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.940]
because they can actually answer some of them.

[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:29.160]
Like a hundred dollar question.

[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.980]
22 and here's the information.

[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.720]
10 o'clock on South Beach,

[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.700]
Ocean Drive between six and seven streets

[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.100]
is the rally night,

[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.420]
Al Gore and CD Wonder will be there.

[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.100]
And who else did you say?

[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.500]
Separate copy.

[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:42.840]
Don't say that.

[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.280]
Free tickets at Democratic headquarters

[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.420]
just call if you don't know

[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.700]
while whether Democratic headquarters

[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.500]
are by you and data.

[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:49.740]
But I would just call information

[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.220]
and ask for the Democratic headquarters

[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:51.900]
and they'll give you a number.

[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.080]
And if the marathon apparently

[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:53.820]
will be going on,

[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.820]
I'll not eat in some of the malls.

[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.860]
Starting at 10 o'clock tonight,

[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:57.920]
not on South Beach.

[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.040]
Free drugs are here.

[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:02.300]
560560,

[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:04.100]
pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.760]
And Verizon wireless line.

[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.140]
22 before 11 o'Cuehway.

[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.300]
On the, my queen.

[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:10.880]
Girl.

[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.800]
Tonight on Fox,

[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.800]
lock up the bagels and cream cheese

[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.380]
and prepare for a wild ride

[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.400]
when Fox presents

[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.760]
Wenzhu the TAC.

[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.380]
sponsor by the committee to

[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.800]
elect George W Bush and by TFB,

[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.300]
where you can get the new GOP bucket.

[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.360]
The GOP bucket is all white meat

[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.500]
right wings in only 29.95.

[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.820]
Right. Wenzhu the TAC.

[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.260]
Tonight on Fox.

[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.720]
George W's going to be watching.

[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.660]
And you still didn't see

[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:36.760]
McLaughlin in the company, did you?

[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.300]
No, I didn't.

[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:38.300]
Goddamn it.

[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.260]
Bye bye.

[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:43.700]
560560, pound 560.

[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.240]
We're going to, I'm not even going to ask,

[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.360]
you know, they just don't care.

[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.620]
Am I ever going to get to that point

[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.900]
where I can just say, give me the money

[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.020]
and screw it.

[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.480]
I'm working on it, real hard.

[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:53.860]
I got my, uh,

[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:55.700]
see my bishops putty in my hand right now.

[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:56.800]
I'm squeezing it real hard

[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.720]
and the putty too.

[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:58.640]
Got my, uh,

[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.560]
little finger on it.

[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.280]
There's a lady mobil in type of fine.

[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:02.600]
Hello.

[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:04.600]
Hello.

[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.340]
Yes, man.

[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.020]
Hi.

[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.360]
Somebody saw my thunder with a vanity

[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.060]
say on it.

[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:10.720]
I'm surprised nobody said anything

[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.800]
before about about the guy who

[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.360]
would be baseball commissioner.

[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.600]
And this is a government by

[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:17.960]
committing when you're dealing with

[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.580]
with him.

[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.820]
People are voting for him.

[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.180]
You know what I'm going to do?

[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.020]
Anybody would even a small brain

[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.460]
should realize he's just a figurehead.

[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:24.940]
He's a puppet.

[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.400]
That's exactly right.

[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.060]
But you know, I'm not that smart.

[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:28.720]
But you know what?

[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.700]
What was running the country?

[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.780]
It certainly wants him to be

[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.880]
front smarter than I.

[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:32.140]
Right.

[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.800]
Well, why should anybody be?

[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.280]
Remember when the thing first came out

[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.920]
about a year ago about his grades at

[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.380]
Yale and about the C

[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:39.500]
of business, which I've at least

[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.100]
aligned now?

[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:42.520]
But and it was like people gravitated

[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.220]
to that like, oh yeah, he's like one of us.

[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.460]
He's a he's not too bright.

[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:46.420]
Yeah, but in fact,

[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.360]
who you want is a president.

[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.160]
I don't think so.

[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:49.120]
I don't think so.

[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:50.500]
And in addition to which he said,

[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:52.280]
you know, I know where Christopher

[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.900]
was on the map when somebody shows me.

[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:54.640]
Well, what is that?

[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.340]
Hello.

[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:55.940]
Yeah.

[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.520]
Not the mayor.

[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:56.780]
Well,

[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.220]
this is one of us.

[01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.800]
You for the information here.

[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.420]
You're spouting out there because

[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:03.800]
people need to make this decision

[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.940]
and get out there and vote.

[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:05.740]
Three or four times.

[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:06.300]
No, I'm for it.

[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.580]
Yeah, three or four times.

[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.440]
That's really I'm

[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.300]
plus you.

[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.340]
Neon have a good day.

[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:10.800]
Thanks.

[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:11.380]
Good work.

[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:12.400]
You know, next thing they're going to be

[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.660]
telling the social securities

[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:14.580]
of federal program.

[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.320]
Three and a three votes on it.

[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.840]
Now, let me just recommend very

[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.300]
enthusiastic.

[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.540]
If you couldn't do a Friday

[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.540]
or whether we can to go to our

[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.900]
website in your Rogers.com.

[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.400]
Not just the vote in our pool,

[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.280]
but also to take a look at that George W.

[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.520]
Bush Jr. stars in.

[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.180]
Where did this as in.

[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.180]
And I show that to George this

[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.260]
morning, I'm not thinking

[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.540]
conclusively that he's drunk out of

[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.920]
his mind and that film clip on.

[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.060]
There is but it sure is how it

[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.420]
looks like it to me and I'm also

[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.540]
going to tell you that the way he

[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.720]
chugs down the end of his drink

[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.220]
there at the at the end of the

[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.340]
video is be sure you watch the whole

[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:42.520]
thing.

[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.540]
People don't chug their ginger ale

[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:45.660]
or their club soda.

[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.060]
Believe me when I tell you.

[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.300]
They don't even chug their diet

[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.420]
the RC cola.

[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.300]
And then.

[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.520]
And then be sure and look

[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.600]
right under that under that

[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.180]
video clip.

[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.000]
The nation.

[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.500]
There's the Alfred Inumin picture

[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.420]
of George W George W. Bush Jr.

[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:03.300]
Skeleton closet.

[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.680]
Click that on and do some

[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.060]
reading do some real

[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.280]
interesting reading and then

[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.100]
make up your own mind.

[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.080]
I mean you can assume if you

[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.340]
want that it's all BS or

[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:10.900]
it's all propaganda.

[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.140]
Make up your own mind.

[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.000]
But it's there for you.

[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.120]
Here's Coral Gable.

[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:16.520]
So long.

[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.160]
All the people really getting

[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:18.900]
hysterical today.

[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:20.520]
Well, it's still have been

[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.020]
building us up to this for

[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:22.240]
months.

[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.040]
Well, as well.

[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.120]
We're about losing a public

[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.480]
housing and vouchers for new

[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:25.860]
cars.

[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:26.260]
Yeah.

[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:26.820]
Yeah.

[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:27.560]
Well, fair.

[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:27.820]
Yeah.

[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:28.600]
Yeah.

[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:29.180]
Well, they're all going to

[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:29.400]
jobs.

[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:29.900]
They're calling.

[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.080]
Yeah.

[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:30.340]
Okay.

[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:30.620]
Great.

[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:30.840]
What?

[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:31.180]
Yeah.

[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.640]
Well, I don't think it a job

[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.300]
is to the colony.

[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.020]
What are you doing?

[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:34.500]
As well.

[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.460]
Why don't they get a job instead

[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:37.180]
of calling me?

[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.120]
And here's the talk about the

[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.780]
top comic kettle real black

[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:42.800]
welfare, which the welfare

[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.600]
rules are reduced 44% in the

[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:45.440]
last eight years under

[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.980]
Clinton and Gork at all.

[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.280]
But everybody of course who's

[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.720]
rose against Bush is on

[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.520]
the welfare rules.

[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.160]
They don't have to depend on

[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.600]
those faith-based charities.

[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:56.340]
Yeah.

[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.280]
Hold your breath.

[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.940]
Same old crap.

[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.580]
Same anti-human assholes.

[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.700]
All they care about is their

[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:06.160]
fetus.

[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.140]
They don't care about you.

[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:07.740]
People who are living

[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.620]
who may be down and out.

[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.120]
You go a little bit of

[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:09.300]
help.

[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:10.360]
All they care about is the

[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.000]
fetus and those fetus

[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:12.300]
killers.

[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.080]
And I mean, you know,

[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.160]
all those people were

[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.000]
executed in Texas.

[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:17.920]
Just take a look at that

[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.380]
great record.

[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.560]
How crime has come down there.

[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.400]
That's because they're killing

[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:20.820]
everybody.

[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.600]
Even if your lawyer

[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.380]
sleeps through the trial,

[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:24.100]
no problem.

[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:24.400]
Come here.

[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:25.420]
Let's give you a little shot.

[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:28.640]
I'll say it again.

[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.240]
Just keep keep it in mind

[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.440]
when you're there voting tomorrow.

[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:32.640]
If you love the National

[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.560]
Rifle Association.

[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:35.360]
If you love the big

[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.320]
pharmaceutical companies

[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.180]
that are raping the public,

[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:38.060]
attack you know something.

[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.200]
I'm going to read that again.

[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:42.760]
I'm going to read that article again.

[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.580]
And if you love the tobacco

[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.740]
companies like Philip Morris,

[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.480]
which is the number one

[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.620]
intruded into the Bush campaign,

[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:49.640]
then by all means,

[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.280]
both for W.

[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:52.980]
Because that that's what it's all

[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:53.300]
about.

[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.860]
Just like the gore saying

[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:58.060]
out in his speeches about how,

[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:58.780]
you know, he's going to get

[01:19:58.780 --> 01:19:59.420]
along with people in

[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.520]
Washington and who are the

[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.180]
people he's going to get

[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:01.560]
along with.

[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.000]
I just give you a short list.

[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.160]
Here's that article again

[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.820]
from Newsweek last week.

[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.560]
The date October 30th.

[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.720]
Bush is paled the drug

[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.340]
lobbyist.

[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.800]
A Texas insider in his

[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.020]
links to a hot button political

[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.820]
issue by Michael Isacov.

[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.380]
To demonstrate his bipartisan

[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.660]
ways of land freeze debate,

[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:22.740]
George W. Bush introduced

[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:23.600]
the nation to

[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.920]
Hugh Grabberlanga, a

[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.860]
democratic friend in the

[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:26.280]
audience.

[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:27.640]
He's the chairman of the

[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.320]
health committee said,

[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.760]
Bush, he came here for a reason

[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.920]
to tell our record on health in

[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.260]
Texas.

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.500]
Some viewers in Austin were

[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.440]
surprised to hear that.

[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.160]
Berlanga once did share the

[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.100]
House Public Health Committee,

[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.160]
but he left the legislature

[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.380]
more than three years ago.

[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.140]
Now he's a lobbyist representing

[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:41.980]
corporate and healthcare

[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.180]
interest before the panel he

[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:43.880]
once chaired.

[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.820]
The revolving door career of

[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:46.860]
Berlanga is hardly unique

[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.100]
to the Texas State House.

[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.920]
Our boys advisors include Tom

[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.360]
Downey and ex-Congressman

[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.380]
who lobbies for clients like

[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:52.880]
Microsoft.

[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.600]
But Berlanga's emergency

[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.660]
has a voice spokesman on

[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:56.600]
health care, pictures

[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.620]
and one of the campaign's

[01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:58.360]
hot button issues.

[01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.800]
The debate over how to reduce

[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.660]
the prices that older

[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:01.820]
Americans pay for prescription

[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.200]
drugs.

[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:04.260]
While he was still a

[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.140]
Texas lawmaker,

[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.740]
Berlanga was well known for

[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.040]
defending one brand name drug

[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:08.720]
in particular,

[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.640]
Cuminum, a blood thinnest used

[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.580]
by two million people,

[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.760]
mostly heart patients

[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.360]
sending out of the

[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.660]
to prevent blood clots.

[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:15.860]
The drug was a

[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.180]
lucrative profit maker for two

[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.060]
big drug companies,

[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.820]
DuPont Pharmaceuticals and Merck,

[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.060]
which manufactured Cuminum

[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.220]
as part of a joint venture.

[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:23.700]
But in 1997,

[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.480]
the FDA approved the generic

[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.820]
alternative warfarin,

[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.100]
which showed for half as much.

[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:29.580]
DuPont quickly launched

[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:30.580]
the campaign in state

[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.640]
capitals to stifle warfarin sales.

[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:34.400]
And Texas, Berlanga

[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.280]
with Bush's support,

[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.740]
successfully led the effort.

[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.580]
Austin lobbyists say he threatened

[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.340]
to kill the bills of

[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.120]
colleagues who failed to

[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:40.820]
support his measure,

[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:41.720]
which would have required

[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:42.620]
pharmacists to double

[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.560]
double check with doctors

[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.020]
before dispensing warfarin.

[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:46.680]
Consumer groups who were

[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.300]
outraged.

[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.700]
In my mind, this was an attempt

[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.900]
to protect the market share of our

[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:50.240]
company,

[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.620]
say she the whole book wide

[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.740]
executive director of Texas

[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.580]
citizen action of one company.

[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.780]
Berlanga insists that his stand

[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.460]
was philosophical.

[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.580]
He thinks brand name

[01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.480]
drugs are safer than

[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.080]
generics.

[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.700]
That philosophy paid off,

[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.240]
immediately after the 1997

[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.160]
legislative session.

[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.180]
Berlanga set up shop as a lobbyist.

[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:07.400]
One of those first clients,

[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.560]
DuPont Pharmaceuticals,

[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.560]
which paid about 100 grand

[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.640]
to block efforts to

[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.720]
overturn his committed bill.

[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.060]
In the end,

[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:15.540]
of Texas, the Texas State

[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:16.540]
pharmacy board effectively

[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:17.720]
neutralized Berlanga's

[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.840]
measure and made war for

[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.800]
unavailable in the state.

[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.340]
But that hasn't hurt Berlanga's

[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:22.400]
lobbying career as

[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.940]
firm has become a mecca for

[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:24.620]
state contractors

[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:25.640]
and hospital chains.

[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:26.920]
He never pushes his

[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.800]
clients business with the

[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.100]
governor.

[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.180]
He insists all the way

[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.060]
acknowledges that I have

[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:31.020]
great entree to Bush

[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.080]
by mere nature of the

[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:32.840]
fact that we're very good

[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.200]
friends.

[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:34.600]
He also has one of the

[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.300]
nicknames that bush

[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.220]
these those on his favorite

[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:36.560]
pals.

[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.500]
Berlanga is Mr. Chairman.

[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.220]
There you go.

[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.520]
So like I said, if you love

[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.200]
the big pharmaceutical

[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.240]
companies that are

[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.200]
raping you and the

[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.080]
elderly, all of us at

[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.260]
all ages, then by all

[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.000]
means you know you're

[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.520]
mand tomorrow.

[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.200]
Well, man, you know,

[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:52.920]
something we must have

[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.740]
an awful lot of rich

[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.500]
rednecks out there,

[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:54.760]
you know.

[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:55.720]
Let's be there.

[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:56.640]
Must be doing fantastic.

[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:57.960]
Most of them are just

[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.660]
waiting for those

[01:22:58.660 --> 01:22:59.360]
tax cuts.

[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.740]
Here's for Waterdale.

[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:02.000]
Hello.

[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:02.900]
Hey, Neil.

[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:03.480]
How you doing?

[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:03.920]
Okay.

[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.560]
I've got a couple

[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.180]
things for you.

[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:07.780]
One of them is I

[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.440]
or the book on

[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.520]
is our children

[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:12.380]
learning?

[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.100]
And that book is for

[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:16.440]
$12.

[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.600]
Armed off your site,

[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.820]
I got a $8.

[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:21.420]
With everything included.

[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:22.120]
There you go.

[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:23.280]
What do you want?

[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.620]
What do you want?

[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:25.780]
Oh, no, they're great.

[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:28.400]
The second thing is is that the

[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.100]
I couldn't believe it after

[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:30.380]
a while.

[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.640]
You're talking about bush.

[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.620]
You know what the ad was

[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.440]
on right after that?

[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:35.480]
Whisper.

[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:36.680]
How do you like that?

[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.940]
And third thing is these people

[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.300]
over in Fort Myers.

[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.380]
I think the

[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.640]
practice animal husbandry on

[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:46.380]
sheep and goats.

[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:48.620]
Okay, and have a great day.

[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:49.640]
What do you say?

[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.420]
Lieberman could be

[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:54.380]
graced secret weapon.

[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.620]
George W said when aid,

[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:56.400]
I got to see what this

[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.480]
Jewish stuff is all about.

[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.700]
So off they went to a

[01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.360]
kosher restaurant.

[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.420]
The first course was set in

[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:00.740]
front of them.

[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:01.660]
My football suit.

[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.600]
George W was hesitant to

[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.620]
taste this strange looking

[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:04.860]
brew.

[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.000]
Gently the aid said,

[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:06.900]
just have a taste.

[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:07.500]
If he don't like it,

[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.400]
you don't have to finish it.

[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:09.740]
George W.

[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.040]
He's putting up a piece of

[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.200]
a matsu ball with some soup,

[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.660]
tasting it gingerly at first,

[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.780]
but quickly finishing the

[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:15.280]
entire bowl.

[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:15.700]
Bull.

[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.360]
That was delicious, George W.

[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:17.740]
You said.

[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.000]
Can you eat any other part of

[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000]
the matsu or they just eat the

[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:20.300]
balls?

[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.480]
Nice going whoever sent me that.

[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.100]
Count 5 60 on the AT&T

[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.720]
and for rise of wireless winds.

[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.480]
Here's Naples.

[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:36.780]
Hello?

[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:37.760]
Yeah, fine.

[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.480]
You know how you do.

[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:38.900]
Okay.

[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.240]
Listen, I'm sorry that this call

[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.020]
comes from the West.

[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:42.540]
Yeah, I know.

[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.600]
And we're sorry too.

[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.560]
Give it a last chronic.

[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:46.380]
Give it a rest.

[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.820]
Same old tire cramps.

[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.900]
Day after day after day.

[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:50.780]
I'm so sorry.

[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:51.300]
If I can, you know what?

[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.760]
I think we have to take out that

[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.280]
line.

[01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:54.660]
That's the eight.

[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.400]
That's just then.

[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.160]
They don't think that they

[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:56.940]
wouldn't jump at it.

[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.180]
I said, I'm thinking about it.

[01:24:59.340 --> 01:24:59.960]
Maybe if they get lined,

[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.080]
fish will take that line out.

[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.320]
It's just a waste of money.

[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.460]
You know, it's nothing to be on

[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:05.040]
there over there,

[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:05.960]
but the number of really

[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.180]
rational calls from the same

[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.180]
people that we get from any

[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:09.020]
world in the West Coast.

[01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:10.640]
You could stick deep inside your

[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:10.880]
vector.

[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:11.980]
You have a lot of room left over.

[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:12.500]
Believe me.

[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.960]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:16.180]
Hello.

[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:17.980]
Hi.

[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:18.660]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:19.920]
Hi, Neil.

[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.480]
Where are you?

[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:20.980]
Okay.

[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.020]
Listen, Neil.

[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.960]
Uh, well, I was looking at

[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.080]
Pete Stan this weekend.

[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:26.360]
Ralph's native was a

[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.080]
I'm so sorry.

[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:27.760]
And

[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.620]
and he's feeling the

[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:31.480]
Democratic boat.

[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.920]
He's actually in

[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.600]
who's with the Republican

[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.140]
party because he ran a ad.

[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.740]
They ran a ad where it was

[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:38.780]
sponsored by the Republican

[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:39.640]
party in the

[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.960]
and a couple of while they're

[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.740]
using his clothes.

[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:42.440]
Yeah, he doesn't.

[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:43.440]
He's not he's not he's not

[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.060]
happy about it.

[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:44.900]
There's nothing he can do about

[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:45.180]
it right?

[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.260]
Yeah, right.

[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.680]
Okay, I just wanted to

[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.040]
put that out and let people

[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.020]
know what's happening.

[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.520]
Okay, well, I better think

[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.680]
long and hard tomorrow before

[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.120]
they they

[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.800]
become the problem because if

[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.340]
they waste their

[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:57.880]
hold on later and winds up

[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.200]
being real close and

[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.300]
they're too wind-flowing or

[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:01.100]
Michigan or Pennsylvania

[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:01.880]
because of that.

[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:02.920]
They're the ones that are

[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:03.680]
going to stick us over

[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.640]
in the right wing for

[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.600]
next four probably eight

[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:05.860]
years.

[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.000]
You're absolutely right.

[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.240]
It's really scary that

[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.460]
George Bush may

[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:10.720]
you know become the president.

[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.000]
And the article and the article

[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.320]
and the article that I just read

[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.320]
again from Newsweek there.

[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.580]
Michael Lysikov's article about

[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:16.620]
the pharmaceutical companies

[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.180]
and about consumerism again.

[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:18.860]
Here you go.

[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:19.460]
That's supposedly

[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.760]
when the neighbors number one issue

[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:21.760]
consumerism.

[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.440]
The word hypocrite comes to mind

[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.060]
in all of this.

[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:28.620]
Too big words.

[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:29.660]
Ego and hypocrite.

[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:31.020]
That's what comes to mind

[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.180]
when I think about later.

[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.500]
One away ego.

[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.620]
Five six and you know I

[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:38.660]
don't disagree with a lot of

[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.680]
those people say why do

[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.600]
those two parties system

[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.820]
screw up in the sabbatical

[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.020]
something that's true.

[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.620]
But takes some time to work

[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:45.920]
up a meaningful third party.

[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.220]
I mean even the even the

[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.320]
people's party even lost

[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.060]
parole with all his

[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:49.920]
double talks about

[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.640]
working up your sleeves

[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.040]
and all that.

[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.260]
Even he had a broader

[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.440]
appeal than this group.

[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:54.780]
All

[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.340]
marginal third parties are

[01:26:58.340 --> 01:26:59.720]
meaningless or wasted time

[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.840]
especially with the way

[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.240]
off on the extreme left.

[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:05.840]
Here's

[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.200]
plantation.

[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:06.580]
Hello.

[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.120]
Hey Neil.

[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:07.560]
How you doing?

[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:07.920]
All right.

[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:08.920]
Speaking of how meaningless

[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.480]
you know,

[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.080]
neighbors like for 12 million

[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.300]
bucks from the government

[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.080]
you know from that

[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:13.700]
and fund.

[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.400]
The insurance industry

[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.420]
alone as of the summer

[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.920]
gave Bush and his

[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:19.700]
cronies the orange

[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:22.560]
the $175 million.

[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:23.340]
Yeah.

[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:24.620]
Just in this election.

[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:25.860]
But just one industry.

[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.780]
So I don't know how these

[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:28.580]
made or people think

[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:30.320]
you know big deal as they

[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.480]
were probably part

[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.040]
of that 12 million dollars

[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:33.840]
like two fixed.

[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.260]
It makes no difference.

[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.720]
12 million dollars is nothing.

[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.460]
Not much invention

[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.340]
in millions the NRA

[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.600]
contributed just last month

[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.580]
alone at the Bush campaign.

[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:42.200]
Millions and millions and millions.

[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.700]
And the other thing is the

[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.380]
Bush thing that came on the other day

[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:48.580]
and said how honorable

[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.880]
and how spectacular

[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.660]
Bush's performance was

[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:53.740]
in dealing with the DUI issue.

[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.320]
He said he was the most

[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.560]
honorable thing he's ever seen.

[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.100]
It brought tears to his eyes.

[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:00.620]
As opposed to you know

[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.740]
obviously he lied about

[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.320]
the fact that he had a

[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.180]
conviction and he never told about it.

[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.120]
And he called the reporter in 1998

[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.080]
that he had no conviction.

[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:12.920]
I mean that is

[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.940]
disclifying in any court of law.

[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:16.980]
It's if they're so hot

[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.640]
on Clinton saying you lied

[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.240]
and you know you lied on the

[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:20.420]
road.

[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:21.880]
Well I'm sure there are

[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.160]
applications out there that he

[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.440]
filled out he says that he

[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:25.540]
did not have conviction.

[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.400]
Expongedness does not take

[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.600]
away the fact that he was

[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.220]
convicted and the fire.

[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.500]
I should like to find out

[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.660]
sometime the next 12 hours

[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.280]
some of the rest of that stuff

[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:34.980]
that he says that he

[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:35.820]
doesn't want to talk about.

[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.160]
Yeah it's scary.

[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:39.400]
Have a great day, Paul.

[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.040]
Good luck to us.

[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:41.980]
One 56 at 5.60

[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:42.940]
I mean I was just looking

[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:43.780]
all over to see where my

[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.940]
coffee for pizza left was.

[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:45.760]
Not that I should need it

[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.360]
because I've been doing this

[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:46.940]
for so long time.

[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:47.960]
Jeff Carl was in here.

[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.040]
The names were scrolling.

[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:49.900]
He bought

[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.400]
10 or 10.

[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.040]
Well we said

[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.100]
yeah he was crawling all over

[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:55.940]
the floor as usual.

[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:57.300]
And you would believe

[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.000]
somebody I'll read his

[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:58.660]
crappy was saying.

[01:28:58.820 --> 01:28:59.580]
I didn't say sh**.

[01:28:59.760 --> 01:28:59.760]

[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.600]
They only sign of life

[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600]
in this miserable

[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.620]
s**t out.

[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.380]
But he'll not just show.

[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:07.420]
He's still on.

[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.120]
One two

[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:08.480]
four

[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.320]
seven

[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:09.840]
eight

[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:10.420]
eight

[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:10.980]
eight

[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:12.380]
eight

[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.040]
eight

[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:13.500]
eight

[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.160]
eight

[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:15.300]
eight

[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:15.880]

[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.580]
eight

[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:18.820]
eight

[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:18.820]

[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.560]
eight

[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:19.560]

[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.080]
eight

[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.080]

[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.080]

[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.080]

[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:25.620]
eight

[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:25.920]
eight

[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.760]
eight

[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.040]
eight

[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.220]
continues

[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:34.500]
he will

[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.460]
be

[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:43.460]

[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.980]
think

[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.960]
Okay

[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:54.640]
Hey

[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:02.360]
I'm not a local, but I think it's a

[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.980]
court for you.

[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.740]
Whatever it is today, you will

[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:09.620]
have a 100 day of in-day driving

[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:10.640]
in any time.

[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.140]
Oh, probably two or five, 60 WQM.

[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.280]
Here's something that I ought to open up

[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.920]
in your ears and maybe some other body part.

[01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:17.460]
Correct them.

[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:22.840]
From yesterday's London Sunday Times, which can't run

[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.760]
for president if he committed federal felony

[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.240]
concerning altering military records illegally

[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.900]
says these Sunday Times, a former senior

[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:32.800]
commanding officer in the Irrational Guard

[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.920]
has come forward to alleged that the Bush campaign

[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.320]
actually cleansed the Texas Irrational Guard records

[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.480]
in order to make them conform to the official

[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.320]
Bush biography that was being written at the time

[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.260]
of the cleansing.

[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:45.720]
The also alleges that records which would be

[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.260]
normally released under the FOIA request for

[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.100]
a service man's public records were missing

[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.620]
from the FOIA release and asserts that those

[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.460]
could clear up the question about Bush's military

[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:54.920]
career.

[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:58.600]
The critical question to me still is if GW really

[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.060]
completed his assigned six-year commitment, then why

[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.560]
was his surrogate Dan Bartlett, a senior national

[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.360]
guard officer to Texas, not provided his pay files

[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.460]
and complete retirement points listing, which are

[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.240]
the only two documents which officially provided

[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.620]
detailed evidence answered the question to prove

[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:14.140]
it and clear this issue from the campaign.

[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.960]
I mean, this goes on for two pages.

[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.400]
I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's

[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.480]
pretty damn interesting.

[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:24.100]
This testimony follows Dan Bartlett.

[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:27.320]
As the State Plans officer for the Texas National Guard,

[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:33.160]
I was on full-time duty at Camp Mabry when Dan Mabry was

[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.000]
cleansing the George W. Bush file prior to GW Bush's

[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:36.900]
presidential announcement.

[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.860]
For more soldiers at Camp Mabry, this was a

[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:40.800]
generally known event.

[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.880]
The archives were closely scrutinized to make

[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.420]
sure that the Bush autobiography of plans and

[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.760]
the record did not directly contradict each other.

[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.180]
In essence, it was descriptive the autobiography

[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.880]
with Dan Bartlett and his small team used the

[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.980]
scrubble file to be released.

[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:57.100]
The effort further involved General Daniel James and

[01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.200]
Chief of Staff, William W. Goodwin at Camp Mabry.

[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:03.080]
I knew one person who worked with a record scrub who

[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.340]
commented to me while at the smoke area that the

[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:07.180]
Bush files really showed some problems with his

[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.640]
blue blood service record.

[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:11.760]
If GW or anybody else can come forward to prove the case,

[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.140]
if GW was not AWOL, then that's great for them

[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:15.140]
and for the Bush candidacy.

[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.740]
I furnished Mr. It's blanked out that the

[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:20.560]
name of a person in Dallas who was the campaign supervisor for

[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.640]
Young George W. During the Alabama Senate campaign.

[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.780]
That person told me without batting an eye that GW was

[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:28.480]
partying, not working on the campaign, and in fact had

[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.620]
better, the beautiful young wife of an up and coming author

[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:34.160]
later to publish the book Forest Gump for whom he was

[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.900]
writing a garage apartment, from whom.

[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.740]
She further said that George W. It was neither sober nor

[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.480]
dependable throughout the entire campaign.

[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.200]
She indicated that George W. It was asked about his

[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.460]
drive requirements and when he was going to drill, he did not

[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:49.220]
provide feedback of any kind, or he might have been drilling

[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:49.600]
something.

[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.580]
Yes, the critical question to me is if GW really completed

[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:55.820]
his assigned six-year commitment, then why has his

[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:58.560]
surrogate Dan Butler or senior national guard officers of

[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.940]
Texas not provided those pay files and his complete

[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:01.900]
retirement points will stay?

[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:04.260]
And it goes on and on in great detail.

[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:08.220]
And we'll say it again, that would be a felony, but again we

[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:10.320]
got another Teflon candidate, leaving to the Republicans

[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:12.700]
maybe, they know how to do it, Teflon candidate.

[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.080]
And all those kind of slides on.

[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.040]
He needs right here with those three states, but he needs

[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.860]
65, so take me elsewhere.

[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:21.620]
Okay, well don't discount Iowa.

[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:22.660]
I mean, and-

[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:25.300]
Okay, how they doing the electoral shuffle on there?

[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.100]
See, I've got that figured out already.

[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.520]
Assuming that they know what they're talking about right now.

[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.260]
Now I got Bushwood 224 electoral votes wrapped up and

[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:40.420]
grow with 185, which means that Bushwood, when New Mexico,

[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:42.620]
Tennessee, Arkansas, West Virginia, Wisconsin,

[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:45.620]
and still come up short, that were given 262.

[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.600]
Gore, who has 185, they did five more, which means he would need

[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.520]
Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Iowa, Washington,

[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:53.960]
Oregon.

[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:57.380]
A crowd order, but possible.

[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:02.460]
If Gore loses either Florida, Pennsylvania or Michigan,

[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.620]
I think, canito.

[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.220]
Here's cross-springs, hello.

[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.660]
Cross-springs.

[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:09.960]
Hello.

[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:10.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.900]
Listen, Neil, you're absolutely right.

[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.760]
The people who have, at the time of the day, this game

[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.940]
don't know how to boost Bush or Gore, tell them to stay home.

[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.080]
But the people who are voting for NATO or Husty Brown,

[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:26.560]
the bad thing is to tell them that it's the Supreme Court stupid,

[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:31.000]
we could survive four years of Bush, but we can't survive 20 years

[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.880]
of the Supreme Court with Kelly and so much.

[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.440]
40 years.

[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:34.440]
That's right.

[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:38.320]
And, you know, those data people, everything they want,

[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.080]
the Supreme, when we ever have a NATO presidency, that's a bit.

[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.480]
They'll have everything that they adhere for them, will be already

[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.180]
decided by the Supreme Court, like, by an effort.

[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:49.960]
That's absolutely right.

[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.020]
Environment, education, everything we're taking care.

[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.140]
So don't waste your vote, because, you know, even if you ever get the presidency,

[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:59.440]
you will not be able to change anything that the Supreme,

[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.600]
a right-wing Supreme Court will take care of.

[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:02.360]
Amen. Well said.

[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.420]
Okay. Thanks.

[01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:04.600]
Good luck to us.

[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.340]
They're angry.

[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.540]
379 votes, and I'll pull so far as you're voting tomorrow for whom are you voting.

[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:14.340]
Al Gore 264, 70%, George W, 77%,

[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:17.600]
NATO 17, 4.4%,

[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.340]
Husty Brown, Harry Brown 12, 2.1%,

[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.340]
and Patrick Cannon, you know how many Patrick Cannon's got only?

[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:22.780]
Behind.

[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:24.160]
2.2%.

[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.380]
Now, see, that's our audience.

[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:30.260]
Of course, you expect the order to be having a big lead.

[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.820]
And, of course, a lot of the Bush people have gone by by.

[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:33.740]
They're very upset.

[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:35.000]
They hate us like poor as an owl.

[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:35.820]
Too bad.

[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:36.480]
See you.

[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.380]
See you someday.

[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:37.880]
We're not.

[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:40.360]
Here's already in Hellendale.

[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:40.660]
Hello.

[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:41.460]
Oh, hi.

[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:42.040]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:43.860]
Well, I heard something on the...

[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:44.620]
I'll make the purchase.

[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:45.740]
They made the...

[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.140]
Excuses were getting nervous.

[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:48.840]
I saw it.

[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.100]
Did you?

[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:50.500]
Yes.

[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.520]
But I have nothing to say about it.

[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:54.120]
Well, what is it?

[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:57.640]
The fact was, the fact that he said no money should be sent to Israel,

[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.460]
because he's against that,

[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:05.320]
because there are Palestinian grounds,

[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.120]
and the Palestinians are fighting with that.

[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:11.180]
Well, don't forget he's one of his mother's fathers.

[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.120]
But the mother's father is the only one here.

[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.860]
The Palestinian is fighting with rocks.

[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:15.360]
Yeah.

[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:16.480]
Well, let me say it again.

[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:17.540]
Talk to George about that.

[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:18.140]
I don't care.

[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.560]
5.6705.50.50.

[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:23.640]
No, George is going to be on for several weeks talking about the obnoxiousness

[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:24.860]
railings and how they smell bad.

[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:26.300]
9 minutes passed.

[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.280]
No, there's 5.60.

[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.260]
Where was it the other way around?

[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:28.860]
Was it the Palestinians?

[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:29.980]
Oh, they all smelled bad.

[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:30.440]
No, they all smelled bad.

[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:30.680]
Okay.

[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:33.360]
Well, maybe if they'd stopped showing those rocks and more marshmallows,

[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:34.520]
especially the Hasidim.

[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:35.560]
Oh, I like that.

[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:38.700]
How was Juleeber and Dil with all this stuff, with the Hasidim?

[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:40.440]
Thank God.

[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.860]
On this floor, there are 49.

[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.300]
Oh, this is brand new.

[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.180]
49 for Gore.

[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:45.720]
46 for Bush for Four for Nader.

[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:46.660]
That's brand new.

[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:47.540]
Is that brand new or not?

[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:49.760]
Let me take a look at the, uh, uh, no, it's old.

[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:51.180]
Well, I've been from yesterday.

[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.460]
It's the latest we got from MSNBC-Zogby-Slasher,

[01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:56.780]
or your Slasher-Slasher.

[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.020]
Like OJ would say, Slasher-Slasher.

[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:01.240]
I want to bang you in the butt, honey.

[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:06.960]
On the next cops, M&M shows how bad a white suburban gangster rapper can be.

[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:08.660]
There were a poach in the suspect.

[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:10.680]
Apparently he wasn't happy with his order,

[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:13.840]
and he's backing up the entire drive-through line.

[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.160]
Yeah, what the fuck?

[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.500]
You call this a happy meal?

[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.880]
You fucking deep fried and cold, G.

[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:23.000]
What the fuck is the pickles doing on this?

[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.620]
Watch as M&M gets arrested for vandalizing McDonald's playground clock.

[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.200]
All that and more on the next cop tonight on Fox.

[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.640]
1115 at 560 W.D. K.M.

[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:37.160]
Here's another one of the classic GW Bush quotes.

[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.340]
He says, and this is coming in just a day before a lesson day.

[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:46.100]
A low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls.

[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:50.120]
Oh, all right.

[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:51.420]
Let's hear it for W, okay?

[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:52.920]
Somebody read that to him.

[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.700]
You can go to a bushwatch.com on your computer there.

[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.740]
That's the website you can go to bushwatch.com and get all of that business

[01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:03.680]
about the appending of Bush's military records and all the other stuff about the DWD,

[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.460]
a WI, and all that other good stuff.

[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:07.060]
Bushwatch.com.

[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:10.980]
And of course the mainstream media, as usual,

[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:15.160]
doing a real crappy job, just like glossing over the thing about the reporter

[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.640]
from the Dallas Morning News.

[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:18.320]
Pragic.

[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.860]
See, if they were running on the A-Mural platform, then you'd say,

[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.100]
all right, at least they're consistent.

[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:26.100]
But they're running as the goody-two shoes people.

[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.680]
We've had all eight years of all this, what the hell did the William Bennett call for the other day?

[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.280]
You know, it was parole.

[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:35.600]
Parole called it an animal house, but eight years of animal house.

[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:41.160]
So if these are supposed to be the morality candidates, how the hell can that be?

[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.100]
Just don't get it.

[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.440]
Yeah, Bill Bennett was on there yesterday going,

[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.640]
she got out like that, open over again.

[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.260]
Of course, you know who his good friend always was until he became a candidate for Vice President?

[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:53.360]
You leave him in.

[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.660]
There is a good match for you.

[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:59.260]
See, no matter how the election comes out tomorrow, especially if Bush wins a real close race,

[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.760]
which it could be, or could be, who knows?

[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.240]
Horses haven't got any idea.

[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:06.140]
This kid, Schmittless, that they could be very, very wrong, and it could be.

[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:11.280]
But there's that silent anti-Semitic vote out there that you leave him in fact,

[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.880]
and leave it to the Democratic Party, don't even know how to do it.

[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.940]
Because I guarantee you that the overwhelming majority of Jews who are going to come out and vote for Gore,

[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:22.400]
would have voted almost no matter who the Vice President of Canada would have been.

[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.320]
Could have been Dick Gebhardt, did it come out for Dick?

[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:27.840]
And I would have.

[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:33.120]
But no, we had to see they didn't learn from, you know, Geraldine Faroe.

[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.240]
Not that Mondale had much of a chance in 84 against Teflon-1,

[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:39.280]
but the fact is that if he had any chance, she sealed his faith.

[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.360]
That was the need though.

[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:41.240]
That was the end.

[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:47.000]
See, if the middle put a candidate in the ballot who's got mafia connections in the family somewhere,

[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.280]
put somebody on it who's a great candidate like Mary Aquomo, that the public wouldn't care about.

[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:53.180]
Not Geraldine, frickin' Faroe.

[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.160]
Remember that deal with her husband with his mod connections?

[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:02.340]
And then I guess the public decided we didn't need to lure another volle movement.

[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:05.580]
That's the problem with those candidates who will devolve at the end of the round.

[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:06.540]
Their name, thing.

[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.040]
I'm in coherent.

[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.320]
Here's Pompano. Hello.

[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:11.780]
Hey, happy birthday.

[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:12.400]
Thank you.

[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:16.260]
I ran into a out-who-of-the-yes-they-comy-saint-year-dozen-pantsies.

[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:16.580]
Yeah.

[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.660]
Just two things real quick.

[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.540]
I was at the Barber County Library the other day.

[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.080]
And there was a young girl there that was working on one of the computer.

[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.300]
She has a white t-shirt on.

[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:27.780]
I am from a walk by her.

[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:33.100]
It says, on the back of her t-shirt in big blue letters, it's a white shirt, George W. Bush.

[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.820]
And the W is larger and it's in red.

[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.960]
Underneath the George W. Bush.

[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.720]
It says, the W stands for women.

[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:46.480]
I thought to myself that this girl was just so absolutely under form.

[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.380]
She had to be like 28, 30 years old.

[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.520]
I mean, how people can do...

[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.840]
Maybe she's a fetus hugger.

[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.260]
I just don't get all this.

[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:55.980]
I don't get it.

[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.660]
And nowadays, in this era, it's not where you're voting for.

[01:40:58.860 --> 01:40:59.880]
It's where you're voting again.

[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:04.440]
And, you know, the Ralph Native people, they're thinking we're voting against Bush too.

[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.760]
But we're going along the list.

[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:06.880]
We got totally different countries.

[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.300]
It's just through everything up.

[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:11.460]
I'm not a dwarf fan, but I just cannot see Bush getting in there.

[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.620]
Absolutely ridiculous.

[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.940]
I can't even see the idea that was a baby for the election.

[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:19.620]
And that he's either dead even or slightly ahead.

[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.360]
It's so implausible to me that it just...

[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.200]
It defies description.

[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.400]
I can give you the example of students in Eisenhower.

[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.580]
But at least Eisenhower was a famous origin.

[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:28.920]
It was a national hero.

[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.060]
What is this guy?

[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.220]
What is his claim to fame?

[01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:33.260]
No, it's absolutely ridiculous.

[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.120]
One and a half terms is a figurehead governor.

[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:39.300]
And a state where the governor has less power than any other state in America.

[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.180]
What was the deal with Nixon and Kennedy?

[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.840]
I mean, there's a debate and all that.

[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:46.200]
Was it as close then as this is now?

[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:49.120]
I think he was saying that Kennedy came out in the last three days.

[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:52.880]
Seven o'clock in the morning, the following day is when they finally announced the winner.

[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.060]
In fact, they showed an old Kinescope,

[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:57.600]
partly in Berkeley announcing seven o'clock the next morning.

[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.540]
It took till then to come up with a winner.

[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.800]
And they gave wrong information.

[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:02.460]
They said that Kennedy won California,

[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:04.700]
which later on he won a blues in, but he still won the election.

[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:05.260]
Wow.

[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:07.040]
Okay, listen, that's it.

[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:08.720]
Let's just pray for the best in God.

[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.300]
I saw Georgia's picture in their magazine.

[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:11.620]
What do you do with it?

[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:12.300]
Okay, I have everything.

[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:16.740]
See, that's your friend, Elle, giving you a lot of publicity with a brown tone.

[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:17.600]
It's all right.

[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:18.040]
I was eating.

[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.060]
Yeah, I know.

[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:21.480]
So, yeah.

[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:24.480]
Oh, come on.

[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:26.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:27.540]
Oh, that's a head roll thing.

[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:28.420]
I'm sure it's a head roll thing.

[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.560]
It was shaped like a biscotti.

[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:29.900]
Yeah.

[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:31.640]
Really?

[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:33.360]
Here's a mobile and keep cool.

[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:33.680]
Hello.

[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:34.580]
Neil.

[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.380]
Oh, Neil, please don't go off the other way.

[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:37.840]
No, let's close.

[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:38.720]
We need to get over here.

[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:40.760]
I can't take out a rest post that calls.

[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:41.780]
I get from over there, man.

[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:44.180]
Even their sheep would turn that crap off.

[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:47.640]
I'm telling, in 2004, I'm right here in Neil Rogers for president.

[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:48.980]
Yeah, you've got to get up there.

[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:51.100]
You need somebody with half a brain in there.

[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:53.540]
We've got to bless Neil, keep it up.

[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.200]
I love you, show you the best push.

[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.120]
We're going back to Europe.

[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:00.300]
We're not staying here anymore.

[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.000]
Okay.

[01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:02.200]
That's a lot to you.

[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:02.900]
How are we going to get you?

[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:03.440]
Bye-bye.

[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.880]
Let's see if we can do it.

[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:05.980]
Let's see.

[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:06.840]
Here's something else.

[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.100]
The facts are just pouring in here.

[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:12.100]
Why would any woman vote for George W. Bush?

[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:15.380]
By Jean Croc executive director of women leaders online.

[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:26.480]
Any woman who thinks she might give George W. the benefit of the doubt and vote for a so-called compassionate conservatism should consider how much compassionate showed Mary Lou Beats.

[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.460]
Most people have never heard of Beats.

[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:34.540]
She was a hearing impaired, learning disabled, brain damage-rake grandmother who's better childhood being sexually abused by her father.

[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:39.080]
She lived in poverty and violence, moving from one abuse of home, one abuse of man to another.

[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.340]
After years of physical and sexual abuse and no help from law enforcement, she killed her husband.

[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:52.260]
Beats was convicted in a trial that was handled so badly by an attorney who sold media rights to her story for his fee that a federal VISTA court judged ordered a new trial.

[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:57.640]
The state of Texas, however, convinced the appeals court to reinstate both the conviction and the death sentence.

[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:06.200]
Which brings us to Governor Bush, Texas law permits clemency on the basis of certain circumstances among the Mahistria that the defendant being battered by the victim.

[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:13.320]
But clemency is not in Bush's vocabulary, so he ordered the state of Texas to finish the job that Betty Lou Beats has father started years before.

[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:18.480]
If that doesn't give you pause, maybe you should consider his promise to do for the U.S. what he's done for Texas.

[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:38.940]
Deadly-assed in state government spending per capita, 49th in state appropriations for the arts, 46th in maximum monthly welfare payments for media families regardless of size, 45th in percent of population graduating from high school, 9th in percent of children living in poverty, 5th in toxic chemicals released in the year, and 2nd in prison incarceration rate.

[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.060]
Thanks to Bush's compassion, Texas gives many underdeveloped nations a run for their money.

[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:51.560]
Texas has among the highest rates of AIDS, tuberculosis, and teenage pregnancy in the nation, and is scraping the bottom on immunizations.

[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:59.640]
A huge percentage of Texas families have no health insurance, and the state is failed to reach out to thousands of children who could be enrolled or Medicaid.

[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.700]
Women in Texas are also slipping behind economically.

[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:15.600]
Texas women makes 75.2% of what loans start man-make, only 17.5% of women have four or more years of college, nearly one in four Texas women lives in poverty, and a state ranks 50th in economic autonomy for women.

[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:19.600]
The first election isn't just about numbers, it's about issues and attitudes.

[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:31.140]
Don issues George Bush opposes most pro-women policies from child care to pay equity to abortion rights, and he would implement policies in the point judges and candidate officers who would work to move women back to the battle days of no choices, no chances.

[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:34.580]
Perhaps most pernicious though is Bush's attitude toward women.

[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:42.860]
As a self-confessed party boy and liberty, Bush saw women in two roles, Madonna, Lauren Barbara Bush for example, or horror feminist for example.

[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:50.740]
And although he claims to have had an epiphany at the age of 40 when he stopped drinking, found God, and reformed himself, there was clear evidence that it continues in this world view.

[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:57.660]
At the 1988 Republican Convention, two years after Bush's supposed conversion, W was talking to David Sank of the Hartford Quran.

[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:02.440]
When you're not talking politics, think asked the Vice President's son, what do you and your father talk about?

[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:09.700]
Pussy replied the man who now wants women to trust them with their lives and futures and make them the next president of the United States.

[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:23.460]
Finally there were two words that should guarantee that no woman other than a man with vote for George Bush, Clarence Thomas, that's who W was named as his most admired Supreme Court justice, and if shrub makes it to the White House he could wind up appointing for more.

[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.200]
Pussy, what's been talking about your roles?

[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:40.500]
5670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon, what I was watching, and you missed a little bit of a sudden we had there last week when we found out that Joe was really like a closet little girl, Joe Rose.

[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:43.340]
But he's so big, it climbs a little girl.

[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.320]
Trust me, that's Pat.

[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.140]
Here's Miami, hello.

[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:49.160]
Hello.

[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:49.760]
Yes sir.

[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:50.660]
How are you doing, man?

[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:50.960]
Okay.

[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:57.060]
Hey, so people we even realize, could you imagine anybody else trying to get a job with an eight-year gap in your resume?

[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.040]
No, not really.

[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:08.380]
Ten years, ten years in which, look at George Bush, nobody knows where he was at, what he did, what he did for money, he told me back up to Father's company, but ten years of his life just told me God.

[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.640]
And that's what we're going to look for, President.

[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:13.560]
Good thing they handed over to the Texas Ranger baseball club, wasn't it?

[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:16.020]
That's his insane, and let me ask you one more thing, you know.

[01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:21.740]
Do you think, um, girl, what has done any better with the female running mate that was called?

[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:27.820]
No, no, he would have done better with like a moderate, gray-ish or candidate, not the, not some Orthodox Jew extremist.

[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:29.060]
Wow.

[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.060]
I mean, all right, eighties in here.

[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:31.700]
Okay, see you.

[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.900]
And I'll say it again, if there were hellbent and ticket of Jew, how about car 11 for Michigan?

[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:41.920]
First of all, car 11 wouldn't have had to give up the seat in the Senate like Lieberman is going to wind up costing them if they win, if that should happen.

[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:46.120]
And number two, car 11 is a brilliant man who happens to come from a state.

[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:50.820]
Michigan has got 18 legs with a boat, unlike Connecticut, which Democrats already win every time anyway.

[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.940]
So Lieberman brings nothing to the table.

[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:55.840]
He's an absolute detriment, reliability.

[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:00.480]
And don't give me the son of Nancy Baeho, he's going to bring out that gigantic Jewish boat.

[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.000]
They air every single one of them would have heard it for a girl anyway.

[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:07.680]
The ones who are going to vote for him now, except of course for those handful of Jews for a fascism.

[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:16.540]
Hell yeah, we got some of those and we got Blacks for racism and Jews for fascism and women for sexism and fags for homophobia.

[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.300]
See that's the one great thing about America.

[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:21.700]
We have a lot of people who are massacres. They love it.

[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:26.100]
They love going out there. They can't run fast enough to vote for somebody who would like to put them in a goddamn oven.

[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.120]
Here's North Miami. Hello.

[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:31.860]
Hello.

[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:32.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:33.100]
Hello.

[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:33.800]
Bill?

[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:34.340]
Yes.

[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.360]
I got a message here.

[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:38.300]
I'm going to vote for Google, but I got a thing here.

[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:41.340]
From CNN, from July 13, 1999.

[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:49.860]
It says, it says, he has Republican president, hopeful George Bush and his wife, so their Dallas home in 1995,

[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:55.500]
were the restricted cover that it would only be sold to whites, residents.

[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:59.560]
And this is from CNN, from July 13, 1999.

[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:00.960]
So the man is a picket.

[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:01.600]
There you go.

[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:03.720]
Arthur Gaffey would be proud. Thank you.

[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.120]
567-0560, 05-560 on it.

[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.940]
So when you know what he says, he'd like to meet one up close sometime, not too close.

[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:11.120]
Maybe you get a what, what?

[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:17.880]
567-0560, 05-560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Live.

[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:22.020]
Maybe that's why 91% of the dark folks out there are probably more than that are going to vote for our door.

[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:27.360]
And going to come out in big, gigantic numbers tomorrow and just tilt this whole goddamn,

[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:30.760]
wasp establishment of the GOP. That's what they're going to do.

[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:35.520]
This big and hateful, sexist, homophobic, racist goddamn GOP.

[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:40.200]
The trap lot and Jesse Helmscrow and Tom Delay and all these other,

[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:43.180]
and of course don't forget our good Bill McCollum down here right here in Florida.

[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:46.460]
Don't forget to vote for Bill Nelson, 5 or 10 times tomorrow too.

[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:49.560]
Because how do you do that? He ain't fooling anybody.

[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.540]
56th and noon at 560-WDQ-A.

[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.480]
And when you think that somebody like Bill McCollum, who was so rabid, leading the impeachment of a penis kid,

[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:07.900]
wouldn't you have thought that at least somebody like him would have had some moral indignation about Bush and the DWI.

[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.480]
Not just the fact that it happened, but the fact that it was covered up,

[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:14.220]
the fact that then the light of the report from the Dallas Morning News about his arrest and so on,

[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:15.920]
none, zero, zip and he do that.

[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:18.400]
This is the word hypocrite, come to mind.

[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:23.400]
Neil God, 1, 2, 3.

[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:26.760]
I made the truth college and averaged the same.

[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:29.680]
I have a lot of money, but not much of a brain.

[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:32.260]
Like most of you voters who were just this late.

[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:35.100]
But I can say one thing that you can.

[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:38.780]
My dad is the next president saying, I got money.

[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:40.580]
Power is up to blue.

[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:43.100]
I can do everything I choose.

[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.580]
A little bit of cash is all I've made.

[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.500]
It's a sign of ego and my greed.

[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:53.200]
Maniculated martyr beings all I use, the garner votes are more honest.

[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.060]
Just like you.

[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:57.720]
That's the school they put in the last.

[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:00.620]
I don't think I'll have that last.

[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:07.920]
Remember to vote for George Bush and those of you who don't, you can kiss my touch.

[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:10.540]
You see what matters to me about the presidency.

[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:13.460]
Is that it makes a nice conversation, please?

[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:16.980]
I'm the king of denial too.

[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.780]
I have no problem lying to you.

[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:24.820]
So why is it so important for you to know whether or not I did flow.

[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:30.240]
A little bit of cocaine, a mind knows, a little bit of tooth, a little blow.

[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:33.020]
When I'm elected out, I'll do it and do all that.

[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.880]
When I put it up the ground, the streets didn't come.

[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:36.680]
Good.

[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.520]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.300]
1232 at 560 QAM.

[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:49.180]
This just facts in.

[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:04.280]
It says the truth will come out with the elected and not Republicans.

[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.120]
Then you'll be confronted with a challenge.

[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:07.880]
The challenge is this.

[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:11.180]
Can you hold your head up and claim the high moral ground of character and integrity

[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:13.980]
all the while you're championing and voting for a man who has neither?

[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:19.640]
The details are rapidly becoming known.

[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:23.100]
Here's something for all you hypocritical pro-lifers.

[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:27.360]
Desperate measures, George W. Bush and abortion.

[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:32.760]
Apparently the story of the source of this story was due to go public this week

[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:36.860]
via publisher Larry Flint, but found out that Flint was planning to make a tabloid sale

[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:37.960]
and change her mind.

[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:41.880]
Like George W. Bush's intervention in commuting the sentence of serial killer

[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:45.340]
Henry Lee Lucas, this is a story that is circulating in the press packs

[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:49.900]
with a few people want to touch at the eleventh hour of the 2000 US presidential election.

[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:55.220]
In the winter of 1971, George W. Bush was dating a woman named Robin Lomond,

[01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:56.340]
now Robin Garner.

[01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:59.800]
Miss Lomond became pregnant by the farewell George W.

[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:05.180]
And he arranged for her to have an abortion, which in the great state of Texas in 1971 was very illegal.

[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:09.000]
Not to mention that George W. is running his approlive candidate for the presidency.

[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:13.240]
The unnamed source of this story was a friend of Robin Lomond,

[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.100]
who the girl friend of the man who arranged the abortion, his name is Robert Carl Chandler.

[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:20.220]
Mr. Chandler is a Bush friend and supporter from Wayback,

[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:24.500]
and maybe arrangements for Miss Lomond's abortion at the 12-box hospital in Houston, Texas,

[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:26.540]
now the Bayou City Medical Center.

[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:30.020]
The source of this story overheard the telephone call by Mr. Chandler

[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:34.580]
to arrange the abortion, and she visited Robin Lomond at the 12-box hospital after the procedure.

[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:37.720]
The source, meanwhile, is afraid of coming forward,

[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:40.040]
saying that she was threatened by Mr. Robert Chandler

[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:42.320]
and by another Bush friend and supporter named Jim Bath.

[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:47.680]
Mr. Jim Bath has longstanding intelligence connections and played a role in the BCCI scandal.

[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:51.440]
Robin Lomond now garners Mary DeGerry Lee Garner, who is an FBI agent.

[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:56.520]
So that's the story, an illegal backroom abortion arranged by the Republican Party presidential candidate,

[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.700]
who's running on a pro-life ticket.

[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:02.500]
So by their criteria, he's a murderer, right?

[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:03.700]
That's right.

[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:09.080]
And I'll say it again, 1971, abortion was illegal all over this country

[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:13.520]
that's two years before World War V Wade, which makes it a very serious felony.

[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:20.140]
So we got the felony, the alleged felony, of covering up the military records.

[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.780]
And we got this, this all makes the DWI look like child's play.

[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.420]
So we'd have to agree on that.

[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:30.500]
Pretty minor stuff compared to the rest of the good stuff he was doing during those lost years

[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:34.900]
when he was like, sowing his wild oats till he was 40, before he found Jesus.

[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:39.420]
Five, we got 444 votes already, that's staggering.

[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:43.780]
If you're voting tomorrow for whom are you voting? Al Gore 306, 59%.

[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:45.600]
Now I didn't make up that number.

[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:50.780]
George W, 95, 21.3%, Ralph Nader, 22, 4.9%,

[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:55.560]
Harry Fudge Brown, 12, 2.7%, and Patrick Cannon is still stuck there on.

[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:58.140]
Yeah, 2% for pro-PAT.

[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.400]
Okay, here's a call from Weston. Hello.

[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:03.500]
Good afternoon.

[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:04.220]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:10.200]
I was coming down university heading with her, 5.95, coming from South, and on Saturday.

[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:12.640]
And I've already had a few too many of the bad chicken wings, you know.

[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:17.680]
And I see what looked to be too homeless people because the way they are dressed was just so ridiculous.

[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.540]
That I thought, oh my god, they're going to come over and wash my window.

[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:25.480]
But low and be hauled before I could even see it, they were holding those placard signs.

[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.780]
You know, and they had, of course, a nice professional print of one that say bush in chaining,

[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:36.740]
but the lady who was wearing an faded paint t-shirt, which was stained and way too small for her gut,

[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:41.600]
it set underneath hers in a handwritten one, honked for bush.

[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:45.560]
People would dive in under the dashboards just connecting the horns.

[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:51.600]
You know, just across the street, the guy who was a smarmy shoe, he had just what he said, honked for...

[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:51.880]
Nick.

[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:53.020]
Honk for dick.

[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:54.320]
You know, so they have...

[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.120]
Now, I'm wondering, was this a Republican idea of like an attempt at humor?

[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:00.140]
Honk for dick and honk for bush.

[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:01.800]
They put a lot of honkies out there over the weekend.

[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:05.740]
Well, that was a quiet corner I'd ever seen about a county in my life.

[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:06.300]
On the hill.

[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:09.000]
I think everybody's forgetting them.

[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:11.920]
They probably were afraid that Prince Regent Ken Jenny was watching them.

[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:18.600]
All these things that people are talking about with regard to the personally morally responsible guy,

[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:21.160]
he's...look, it's okay.

[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:26.740]
It's like a Jeffrey Dahmer went ahead and became a Republican and then accepted religion

[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.480]
and apologized in public.

[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:28.920]
That's right.

[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.100]
He would be...he would be trotted out there.

[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:31.540]
Oh, I see.

[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:34.980]
That's the big thing with the evangelical Christians is the fallen sinner.

[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:37.380]
Once he comes back and repents for, he's better than anybody.

[01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:41.820]
He's better than...he's even better than a morally upstanding, fairly morally upstanding,

[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:47.520]
responsible adult who may be a little boring, but at the same token, you know,

[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:53.080]
has generally led a fairly clean and...and, you know, personally responsible life.

[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:56.140]
And you're forgetting about the most important fact that over the weekend,

[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:58.960]
a great world famous Getski Bill of Graham endorsed Gavin aboard.

[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:00.140]
Oh, well, he's from Texas.

[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:01.080]
Yeah.

[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:02.340]
Is he dead yet?

[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:02.800]
I'm sorry.

[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.040]
But not yet. He's working on it.

[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:05.760]
Did all Robert...

[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:08.220]
Did all Robert ever go to God?

[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:08.960]
I can't remember that.

[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.080]
I think it was Amal Robert.

[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.860]
Did you ever go to God ever call him home?

[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:13.900]
Or what? It's just...it's just amazing.

[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:20.180]
But the spin doctors, Republicans, and Tim, they can hammer Bill Clinton for pianist day

[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:24.660]
like you say all the time for the personally moral, legal, responsible decision he's made.

[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:28.200]
But apparently, because it's seen now...I'm supporting him.

[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:28.320]
He's been...

[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.180]
No, Tim, it's understands the Teflon man again.

[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:32.760]
I guess they scripted the operandi because he don't need it anymore.

[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:33.560]
It's not going to help him.

[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:37.140]
They script the Teflon awful or Ronnie and now they swipe it on W.

[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:39.580]
Well, I just say we vote 100 times each.

[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:40.840]
Okay, now look Bush tomorrow.

[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:41.500]
Okay.

[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:45.860]
56670560, 0.560 on the 18th.

[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:48.080]
That's what all of you are all men in America to be thinking about.

[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:49.780]
He's looking Bush tomorrow on Election Day.

[01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:50.280]
That's correct.

[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.560]
That should be the poster everywhere.

[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:57.380]
Big doorboards, big signs, front pages of newspapers, let's look Bush.

[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:01.580]
Here's a lady in Daniel.

[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:01.940]
Hello?

[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:03.540]
Hey, Neil, this is Jackie.

[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:04.600]
I just sent you the facts.

[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:05.220]
Thank you, Joe.

[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:06.200]
Thanks very much.

[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:07.600]
Amazing, isn't it?

[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:10.700]
The fact that this one actually has the names of all of you.

[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.560]
I think the first time I've seen this, it's so excited about guessing names.

[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.120]
What can we do about it?

[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:18.420]
I mean, 12 hours before the election and it's now out of the murderer.

[01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:19.680]
I don't know.

[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.460]
The main thing you need is just to verify like it says in here.

[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:24.660]
I just don't think that they're going to touch it.

[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:31.060]
But if they've actually got names and people and dates, what can we do before we do the election?

[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:33.340]
Just like I suspected, the intimidation factor.

[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:35.560]
And I think that's the reason why I think this woman was afraid to come forward

[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:38.320]
because she's been threatened by at least two or three people.

[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:40.000]
So they made her an offer she couldn't refuse.

[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:43.020]
But when the result came out of high, did she select it?

[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:43.640]
Of course not.

[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:44.880]
It's unbelievable.

[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:46.840]
And look what they did to Bill Clinton.

[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:48.860]
Unbelievable.

[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:49.760]
Well, that's all I'm over.

[01:58:49.820 --> 01:58:50.640]
It's about four or five years ago.

[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:52.280]
There are very hundreds of times tomorrow, Neil.

[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:53.440]
Okay, so you got to thank you again.

[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:53.640]
Thanks.

[01:58:54.460 --> 01:59:00.800]
The other thing that we just pressed the other thing, this presser key, maybe this thing will reset or not.

[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.080]
Oh, I have to go to the computer.

[01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:03.600]
Oh.

[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:09.020]
Like I said, while we're re-booting the telephone here and worrying about whether they're going to ever get to your phone fixed,

[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:09.660]
what do you want to talk?

[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:10.260]
Just this morning?

[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:10.780]
What's that?

[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:11.260]
Oh, yeah.

[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:12.700]
This is something moving exciting.

[01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:15.580]
The line five things been going on for like before we went on vacation, though.

[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.320]
Two and a half years.

[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.880]
We used to be six and moving up to five.

[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:19.100]
And we're just sitting here waiting.

[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.740]
Waiting for the day when they decide to get a regular assing year and do something.

[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:23.780]
Are they going to do something?

[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:24.180]
No.

[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:25.980]
Probably not because that's the beastly FM way.

[01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:27.680]
Don't buy that beastly stock, George.

[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.340]
Because if you do, I'm telling.

[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:32.140]
Twenty-one before one at QAM.

[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:35.560]
This is five-fixie QAM.

[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.560]
The Neil Roger show.

[01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:38.560]
Sports radio.

[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:39.760]
Five-sixies.

[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:41.040]
QA.

[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:41.460]
A.

[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:41.500]
A.

[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:41.560]

[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:44.440]

[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:44.440]

[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:44.440]

[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:48.600]
For the moments when you're in the middle of emotional.

[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:51.260]
And I always knew I hated you.

[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.280]
I just think for the sake of it.

[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.140]
For the moments when you're feeling this way.

[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:56.120]
Under the weather.

[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:56.800]
Under the weather.

[01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.860]
For those moments when you're just not yourself.

[02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:02.400]
And why did you take out two teeth at these?

[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:04.360]
Because you're having a fear.

[02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.400]
That's why.

[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:07.360]
For the strength and moments in life.

[02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:09.100]
Tiny extra tank scampers.

[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.260]
John didn't know this.

[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:11.700]
And they're going to revive it.

[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.200]
So shut up already.

[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.440]
And meet your strength and moment at the moment.

[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:16.340]
Thank you.

[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:16.780]
Thank you.

[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:17.620]
Thank you.

[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:21.640]
Six-eight-four-one-a-five-sixies-w-q-m.

[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:23.840]
I'm trying to think who the people are that are voting bush.

[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:25.500]
You got your red necks.

[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:27.120]
You got your right wing.

[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:28.000]
You're nanting within R.

[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:31.800]
Right wingness.

[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.660]
Right winged on refugees.

[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:35.720]
Yeah, right winged refugees.

[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:37.980]
Racists.

[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:42.280]
Red necks.

[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:43.160]
I just said that.

[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:43.440]
I'm sorry.

[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.060]
And rich people.

[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:45.840]
That's also within R.

[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:46.620]
Rich assholes.

[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:48.240]
Selfish Rich assholes.

[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:50.000]
What's my good friend?

[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.180]
A lot of the hockey team.

[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.000]
We still keep coming around.

[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:52.960]
But it won't leave me alone.

[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:53.200]
Yes.

[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:54.560]
So that's what I'm.

[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:54.560]

[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:54.960]
Yeah.

[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.240]
Use for fascism.

[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:58.760]
Here's Valkyrie.

[02:00:58.860 --> 02:00:59.000]
Hello.

[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:00.320]
Hello.

[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:00.920]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:04.160]
Neil, two points regarding George Bush.

[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:09.500]
One is, demand is an incredible hypocrite as well as a sleaze bag.

[02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:13.900]
And the perfect point of that was his race against John McCain in New York.

[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:17.600]
And keep in mind that the New York race was a pivotal race.

[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:24.540]
Whoever won that race for the Republican candidacy would have really catapulted them towards

[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:25.360]
the next primary.

[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:31.460]
And yet he used that breast cancer ad in the New York primaries to smear McCain, which

[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:32.760]
was a total misrepresentation.

[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:32.900]
Right.

[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:35.900]
As you know, McCain has a relative who has breast cancer.

[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:36.020]
Right.

[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.360]
It was totally discredited after the race.

[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:42.720]
George Bush never disassociated himself from it or condemned that.

[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:48.360]
And that really helped him, you know, catapulted into the, into the, uh,

[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:48.620]
Yeah.

[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:53.340]
Yesterday on one of the talking head shows they had Bob Kerry and John McCain going together.

[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:56.660]
And McCain was sitting there with a bandage on the side of the head with his, you know,

[02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:58.940]
going through the cancer therapy again.

[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.600]
And Bob Kerry pointed out that the campaign that W.R.A.N. against him in South Carolina was

[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:09.440]
the dirtiest, the filthyest, the most school-lessed campaign that's ever been won in the history of

[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:09.840]
those countries.

[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:12.380]
And McCain just kind of sat there and really even had much drama.

[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:13.040]
What could he say?

[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:14.000]
Really embarrassed.

[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:14.820]
He had one other thing.

[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.820]
And I really, this isn't appealed to the native voters today.

[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:21.680]
I admire your principle, but you're going to win the battle and you're going to lose the war.

[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:25.960]
And what I'm saying to the native people that are listening to your show now is, you know,

[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:31.220]
get real if you, if you both are native, you're going to wake up the next morning with an

[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:35.260]
intellectual lightweight who is going to be your worst nightmare, at least go or it's

[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:36.380]
closest to your position.

[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:39.760]
So, deep pragmatic people out there.

[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.000]
I admire your principles, but please, when you get to the voting booth,

[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:48.720]
do not elect this nightmare because you will rule the day for the next four years.

[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:49.220]
That's right.

[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:49.820]
Thank you, Nick.

[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:50.100]
Thanks.

[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.080]
And we'll be here to tell you every day you did it.

[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:52.720]
You did it.

[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.080]
Every single day we'll put it on tape.

[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:54.720]
You did it.

[02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:58.760]
You know, they like to talk about the politics of division.

[02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.820]
This is what really cracks me.

[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:02.060]
I'll talk about HIPHICRIT and all the bickering going on.

[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:06.820]
I guess the more on top, they must have forgotten about the last eight years, that started the day

[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:07.820]
that Clinton got in on.

[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:10.760]
And actually it started before that, when he first started voting in the primaries.

[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:15.280]
But from the day that he was inaugurated in 93, right on through eight solid years,

[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:16.100]
it's never stopped.

[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:17.640]
The politics of division.

[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.080]
Every time this man farted, and it was the wrong flavor, we had to have another investigation.

[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.120]
They had to spend another $5 billion of your taxpayer money.

[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.360]
It's just astonishing how stupid the public can be.

[02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:32.780]
About a tack edge and about dirty politics.

[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:38.060]
And then when the thing came out about the DWI, oh, right away, that's typical Democratic dirty tricks.

[02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:41.480]
Well, the term politically dirty tricks came out during the Nixon years.

[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:42.680]
We had nothing to do with Democrats.

[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:44.300]
And they were in water games.

[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:48.140]
And we've had eight years of non-soft 30 tricks.

[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:51.560]
And then all of a sudden they also had Bob Livingston, on one of the talking head shows,

[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:56.200]
who was on the CNBC over the weekend with all people, softball Chris Matthews.

[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:00.580]
And either Chris Matthews couldn't stand it, when the Livingston started whining about the fact that,

[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:03.220]
oh, they were out to get him and they got him, they nailed him.

[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:07.080]
Yeah, they nailed it because you were screwing around on your wife's sweetheart, because you were hypocrite.

[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:12.880]
And then he started reading all this paranoid right when Krap and Chris Matthews system,

[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:14.180]
what are you reading that from?

[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:15.740]
And he says, the drug report.

[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.100]
And Chris Matthew says, not anymore you're not.

[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.540]
And he made them stop reading it right there, cut him off in mid sentence.

[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:21.940]
The drug report.

[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:26.040]
Yeah.

[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:29.760]
And partisan is only when it's by the Democrats, when they turn out the truth.

[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:34.220]
Just like the business about wanting to protect his daughters.

[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:36.800]
When Bill Clinton said he didn't want to talk about his affair with Monica,

[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.880]
because he wanted to protect his family, then it was just a couple of.

[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.640]
But of course it was, but then they were all screaming it's just a couple of.

[02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:47.240]
But when G. W. says he didn't want to come forward and be honest about his D. W. I.

[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:50.340]
to protect his young daughters, then we're supposed to believe that.

[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:51.980]
Just amazing.

[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:56.260]
That's why I called another Teflon candidate the separate set of standards that the right wing is a God.

[02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:58.900]
You can do whatever you want if you're a Republican.

[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:02.800]
If you're a Democrat, all you got to do is like I said, is fart in the wrong flavor and gotcha.

[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:08.940]
But we need an end to the politics of the vision, and all of bickering in Washington.

[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:10.760]
Right.

[02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:15.700]
See, they're counting on the fact that most people are dola bird and they're right.

[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:16.740]
They're absolutely right.

[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:18.600]
Here's Davie. Hello.

[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:20.260]
Davie, yes sir.

[02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:21.220]
I think we need more vision.

[02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:22.040]
I quite agree.

[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:28.700]
I mean, there's nothing like having choices that are actually choices, you know, to choose from.

[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:33.160]
One thing that we don't need is both parties getting closer and closer together.

[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:33.740]
This is a problem.

[02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:36.980]
I noticed that in your website, was your birthday yesterday?

[02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:37.500]
Yes sir.

[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:38.240]
Happy birthday.

[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:39.060]
Thank you so much.

[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:42.580]
That was a great picture of Alfredi Newman that you had.

[02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:44.640]
That's the client.

[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:48.300]
It's almost as good as the stuff that's on the inside when you click it on.

[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:51.000]
Yeah, that's true, but that picture just kind of sums it all up.

[02:05:51.640 --> 02:06:00.340]
But listen, there's a way that the people that want that that nater lovers can have their cake and eat it too and still, and still, uh, lick-wish.

[02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:01.680]
Can we tell you how?

[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:05.600]
You're not going to tell me this sad, sorry thing about swapping boats here.

[02:06:05.780 --> 02:06:06.300]
What's the matter with that?

[02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:07.300]
It's pointless.

[02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:08.060]
What's the point?

[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:11.220]
Because you can, you can vote for nater and you can still vote for nater.

[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:12.740]
No sir, let me say it again.

[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:15.040]
If they vote for nater, we're going to wind up with the same thing.

[02:06:15.060 --> 02:06:15.900]
Oh, that is true now.

[02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:18.420]
No, no, I'm saying you can vote for, I already do that.

[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:20.800]
I already caught my buddy in the Yorkie vote for nater in New Yorkie.

[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:21.680]
He was going to vote for Gore.

[02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:23.360]
And I'm going to vote for Gore for him down here.

[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:23.700]
Oh God.

[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:26.200]
Because if New Yorkie was going to, it's, it's New York not a swing state.

[02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:27.620]
Gore is going to win their easily.

[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:27.980]
Yeah.

[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:33.820]
So he didn't need a favor of voting for nater in order for me to do him the favor of voting for Gore here in a swing state.

[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:34.900]
Doesn't that make sense?

[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:36.160]
No, not really.

[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:38.420]
What, could you knock a hole with it for me?

[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:43.320]
The whole, the whole, the whole, the fact is that you're, you're, you're, you're spinning your wheels.

[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:49.100]
You want to get the 12 million dollars so that the 5% can become eight or 9% which I don't think it's ever going to get to that point.

[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:49.280]
Right.

[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:51.560]
Then it's just going to be that much more of a detriment.

[02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:53.000]
And you're going to air me four years.

[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:55.160]
You're going to be a debt to any democratic candidate.

[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:55.920]
So now I understand.

[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:59.300]
So now what you're saying is that an alternative leftist party is never a good idea.

[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:00.800]
It's not just now it's not a good idea.

[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:03.360]
It's not just a leftist party.

[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:04.620]
It's an extreme leftist party.

[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:05.480]
No, not coming.

[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:06.700]
Oh, get out of here.

[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:08.080]
When you're, you're talking crap.

[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:11.420]
A ballast of US Senate and a ballast of military.

[02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:14.280]
Just take a, you don't even know what the platform of the green party is.

[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:15.800]
Or when I'll say it again, Ralph made it.

[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:17.800]
It doesn't support the platform of his party.

[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:19.240]
It's an ego trip.

[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:21.100]
Oh, come on.

[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:26.640]
All these pseudo intellectual young geniuses, man, he's so far.

[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:28.320]
Oh, yeah, we have to have a difference.

[02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:29.580]
Well, that's not the way to do it.

[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:35.980]
The day after tomorrow, if you want to have some differences, then start a grassroots organization

[02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:42.220]
and put together a moderate party, not an extreme left-wing, lack of party.

[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:47.280]
And these are the same green party people, by the way, that nearly destroyed the city of Seattle last year.

[02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:48.760]
But we're not, what's the purpose of a kid about that?

[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:50.660]
What's your lunatics?

[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:54.940]
I wonder what nature's got to say about, oh, that's right.

[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:55.600]
You forgot about it?

[02:07:58.140 --> 02:07:59.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3.

[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:01.460]
And I'll say it again.

[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:09.400]
Look at the skyline and Houston, the fact that they pollution in Texas is so bad that they can't even let the kids out to practice football some days because the air is so polluted.

[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.160]
Thanks to GW Bush and relaxation.

[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:16.880]
And of course, here's the guy who wants it to be voluntary compliant with those guy named EPA Guidelines.

[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:17.840]
He wants it to be voluntary.

[02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:22.960]
So here's the greatest enemy of the environment that you could possibly have running.

[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:28.500]
And the nature people are supposed to be the greatest environmentalist far beyond our grower, the tree hugger, far beyond him.

[02:08:28.820 --> 02:08:32.280]
What they're going to do is help a lunatic, a irresponsible man get it right through tomorrow.

[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:41.140]
I'll say it again, even the little puppy Ross Puro got 19% vote in 92%.

[02:08:41.140 --> 02:08:46.100]
In fact, the poll that they took a couple of days ago, 53% of the American people would like to have an alternative party.

[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:48.280]
They don't like the Democrats over the public and do it or candidates.

[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:50.260]
And I would do one of them too, I agree.

[02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:57.560]
But Ralph later and the Green Party ain't the answer. Believe me.

[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:00.920]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:02.380]
Hey, me, I have a...

[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:03.040]
Yes sir, okay.

[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:05.640]
Listen, I got a couple points to make about the 12 things.

[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:06.180]
Yes sir.

[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:12.700]
And here's got everybody talking about the abortion issue with Bush and all the pro-library jumping out on the band magazine.

[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:15.140]
He's going to stop abortion and everything like that.

[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:16.480]
He's not pro-life.

[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.700]
Look at all the Capitol cases and taxes.

[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:20.560]
Look at how many people he puts it down.

[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:21.700]
Look at all the...

[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:22.520]
He's anything about the abortion.

[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:27.040]
But you're missing the point here and that is pro-life means you love the fetus.

[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:28.060]
Not people who are alive.

[02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:30.040]
He's a fetus and he's a fetus hugger.

[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:31.300]
And they don't understand that.

[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:31.780]
You know?

[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:35.200]
And I'm a Catholic and I don't believe in abortion, but I don't believe in the government.

[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:37.580]
She told people whether or not they should have one or two.

[02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:37.720]
Right.

[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:40.700]
And another point I'd like to make is real quick is...

[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:45.300]
In addition to which does anybody see the hypocrisy of a man who's running based on the fetus hugging principle?

[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:49.900]
Who allegedly, I believe this to Rey and I believe it all along because now we even have names in the...

[02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:55.240]
These are the people involved in dates who pay to have somebody who knocked up or are getting abortion?

[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:55.740]
I know.

[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:56.340]
That's ridiculous.

[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:00.740]
And you know something I'd like to say, record the Bible, be supposed to be born in everything that...

[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:03.300]
The other day I was driving around Miami and they have one reason to corner out.

[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:05.200]
You know, holding up the signs in everything I've done.

[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:07.260]
I've got a chorus sticker in my car.

[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:09.760]
I hold it up the window so the guy who's showing me the sign.

[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:10.880]
I smile on that one.

[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:11.060]
You know?

[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:12.060]
He says, smile on that one.

[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:12.760]
I smile on that one.

[02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:15.820]
He gave me the signer because I hold up a quarter of the room inside.

[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:17.020]
That's ridiculous.

[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:17.540]
You know?

[02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:20.000]
It's like, I want to vote who I want to vote.

[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:22.300]
If I don't vote for this, you've been on an assholes.

[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:23.320]
That's the way you drew it.

[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:26.120]
Consider the source.

[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:26.620]
You know?

[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:27.000]
Yes.

[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:27.440]
All right.

[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:30.840]
Just like the people promised off the other day, consider the source.

[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:31.400]
Have a great day.

[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:31.620]
Now.

[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:35.940]
See, and it sits right in.

[02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:37.540]
At least the people for the most part.

[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:39.120]
I'm not going to say everybody votes for abortion.

[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:39.980]
It is like him.

[02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:42.160]
But there's a lot of similarity there.

[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.000]
He tracks the dumb.

[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:45.200]
He tracks the bigoted.

[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:46.160]
The narrow-minded.

[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:47.720]
The selfish.

[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:50.200]
The people who got there, they don't give a crap about anybody else.

[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.260]
That's what it's all about.

[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:54.320]
But it's the dumb part in the middle.

[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.600]
Those are the millions of dumb masses out there.

[02:10:56.860 --> 02:10:57.860]
Those are the ones that are influenced.

[02:10:57.860 --> 02:10:58.740]
What's going to happen to them all?

[02:10:58.780 --> 02:10:59.560]
That's what's really scary.

[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:00.840]
That's the most scary part of it all.

[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:04.900]
Just like the old guy that calls them in the first hour today says,

[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:07.320]
they tell us about these people called about chapacritic.

[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:10.280]
And what they forget is that ten Kennedy couldn't run for president

[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:11.320]
because of chapacritic.

[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.860]
And I said, what about 1980 when he ran against Jimmy Carter and the Democratic primers?

[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:18.680]
And he went, literally, oh, I didn't know about that.

[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:20.440]
He didn't know about that.

[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:24.920]
How was that possible?

[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:26.260]
Did he split syrup?

[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:28.740]
Was he taking too much nerf pound?

[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.800]
Was he squeezing the bag too much in those days?

[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:38.420]
You can't complain about, see this is why half of the people don't vote or more.

[02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:42.040]
Because most of them don't know anything about what's going on anyway.

[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:45.620]
I guarantee you this audience in this radio station,

[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:48.620]
you've got a hell of a lot better chance finding out who's going to be number one in the guy

[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:51.560]
that had colored football purer than finding out who the candidates are.

[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:54.020]
Give me the ball, give me the ball, give me the ball, baby,

[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:55.000]
because that's what it'd be all about.

[02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:59.040]
Now let's get those football players out there and vote several times tomorrow

[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:00.220]
because most of them are sources anyway.

[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:03.540]
This is 560, G-A-L.

[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:06.540]
If not just the one to two hour, it's a phenomenon.

[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:10.800]
Come on, America.

[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.020]
Time to grow up and step outside the closet.

[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:19.040]
Celebrate your secret and bring out the game.

[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:21.060]
Bring out the game.

[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:23.120]
Bring out the game.

[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:27.220]
Celebrate your secret and bring out the game.

[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:30.240]
From all the agents you can get,

[02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:33.800]
Christian, bridges and all the religious writers are not falling anymore.

[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:36.440]
It's in the papers of three days.

[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:38.940]
So why not get checked with the rest of the world?

[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:42.620]
In the title of this title, the truth is that you're going to be free.

[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:47.980]
Next time you want to reach out for good, reach for a handful of atoms.

[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:51.860]
Celebrate your secret and bring out the game.

[02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:53.820]
Bring out the game.

[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:55.840]
Bring out the game.

[02:12:56.260 --> 02:13:00.040]
Celebrate your secret and bring out the game.

[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:03.140]
Tell your disciples that you're dating.

[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:06.980]
All right, one o'clock right on the note is here at 560 WQM.

[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:07.600]
I'll pick one or two.

[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.760]
I'll hang from Shulis Day 2 coming up at 2 today.

[02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:13.700]
We've got Kimba Boat Camp, or 645 also from Shulis before Monday Night Football.

[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:18.080]
Like he's at the Packers at 845 ADK after Monday Night Football.

[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:25.200]
The Guardian Observer, another British paper, has in their Monday November 6th today's edition.

[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:29.920]
This story, a slavish press can, can I have the high GW Shady side.

[02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:32.860]
It says, to the Guinness Book of Records,

[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:34.860]
reserve a whole page under hypocrisy.

[02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:37.960]
It's for George W. Bush and the managers of his book for the White House.

[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:43.320]
It granted a campaign of character assassination, knowing that Al Gore has an intimidating grasp of issues.

[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:49.260]
They've used a very quick, every dollar of special interest money, every totty in the press, to smear the vice president as a liar.

[02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:54.200]
The cleverness of that diversionary tactic was that if it worked, it would relieve GW getting proper answers.

[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:57.340]
To the questions of substance he finds so bewildering, it worked.

[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:04.300]
Now, Bush has revealed as a liar on serious issues of character, and what happens, the smear artists are shouting, dirty politics.

[02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:14.340]
Given the anti-Gro bias of the mainstream press, last 30 nights of Revelation that Bush was erected for drug and driving in 1976, when he was 30, may have come too late to affect his lead.

[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:22.720]
The Republican spin machine has also been adept in damage control within 24 hours and almost managed to turn the story into, who leaked instead of why didn't he come clean.

[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:31.660]
It is true that the disclosure came from a main Democrat though not from the Gro campaign, but the point is that it is true when the real question is, the character of the candidate who tried to conceal his past.

[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:39.040]
He did confess the mistakes of his youth, but he would never be specific, hoping the mistakes would be thought of as youthful pranks, not serious crime.

[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:47.420]
It is an offense to apply for any federal office without devolving an arrest record, but not only went to great lengths to cover up his conviction, he lied about it too.

[02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:56.420]
In a 1998 interview with Dallas Morning News reporter asked Bush, if he had ever been arrested other than for a 1968 fraternity prank and Bush said flatly, no.

[02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:08.960]
The exchange was not reported at the time, it didn't seem newsworthy, and when Bush was called a jury service in a drug driving trial in Texas, he filed out the jury question there, but left blank the yes or no entry asking if he had ever been arrested in a civil or criminal case.

[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:12.880]
Then he hastily got himself excused on the basis that he was the governor of the state.

[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:25.100]
For example, he says for those of you in sodden Britain who might conclude that global warring for instance is a matter of concern, should know that Bush regarded as a leftist scared.

[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:35.840]
Asked what he would do, he responds that we need more study before ratifying the Kyoto agreement, putting the mind of a fire chief who arrives at the blaze to say, oh, I have to study the origins of the fire before trying to put it out.

[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:40.520]
See the bridge they got there some on it, they see through this crap.

[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:45.220]
Here's a mobile on Hollywood, hello.

[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:46.700]
Hey, now how you doing?

[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:47.100]
All right.

[02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:49.240]
Listen, a couple of things.

[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:53.060]
First one is you talk about the double standard, you could have been more right.

[02:15:53.220 --> 02:16:01.000]
And the most perfect example which the Republicans will never talk about is a ran, contraigated and the almighty Ronald Reagan.

[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:04.360]
And anybody is in should get in trouble.

[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:05.360]
It was Ronald Reagan.

[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:14.420]
Second thing, hope that people remember Bill McCollum is the one that spent, helped spend $50 million of our money on a fix affair after Bill Clinton.

[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:17.780]
So remember Bill Nelson is our man here in Florida.

[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:23.220]
And the third thing is you're talking about this abortion issue which is like the, I've heard it as ruler before today.

[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:24.600]
It seems like you have some more information.

[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:27.680]
It's a website that we can all go to to get this information.

[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:28.380]
It'll be on it.

[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.480]
It'll be on our website, neo-rogyne.com.

[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:31.520]
It'll be under this afternoon.

[02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:32.780]
Okay, great.

[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:33.100]
Thanks.

[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:33.880]
You know, I'm in debt.

[02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:34.340]
Thanks.

[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:37.360]
539 votes in our poor already.

[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:39.160]
Got a lot of people going to vote tomorrow.

[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.380]
Al Gore 372, 69%.

[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:45.640]
George W. Wait a minute, it's changing again.

[02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:46.520]
One moment please.

[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:47.620]
Now that once is here.

[02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:50.480]
Like I said, Al Gore 58.6%.

[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:54.380]
George W. 115, 21.1%, NATO 25, 4.6%.

[02:16:55.580 --> 02:16:57.380]
Harry Brown 21, 3.8%.

[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.100]
And Pat Buchanan is still stuck there down there at the SN.

[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:03.700]
Still stuck there at the eye.

[02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:04.380]
1.6%.

[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:13.000]
Which is getting right down there to the 1% that he's had in just about every pool, state by state nationwide, since the very beginning.

[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.900]
So at least we can feel a little bit better.

[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:18.960]
That only 1% of America are car-carrying four-forge Nazis.

[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:21.540]
With bad haircuts.

[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.560]
Here's a lady in the gables.

[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:23.860]
Hello.

[02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:24.820]
I know.

[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:25.480]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:28.280]
Do you remember the movie, Manchurian Candidate?

[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:29.240]
Sure, with thanks and after.

[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:29.780]
Right.

[02:17:30.140 --> 02:17:40.740]
And I'm never seeing that movie the last time I saw it in the horror and you've done because the evil that provided the machinery that was going to put this man in office.

[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:45.600]
And I get that cheesy feeling with this George W. Bush.

[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:49.420]
That same gut feeling of stunned horror.

[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.340]
And I feel a parallel is there.

[02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:55.360]
Like the same character at a venture in Canada.

[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:55.700]
Yeah.

[02:17:56.720 --> 02:17:57.640]
And I just want to say.

[02:17:57.640 --> 02:17:59.180]
Only this character is a lot dumber.

[02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:00.800]
And he's real.

[02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:01.220]
He's real.

[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:01.320]

[02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:02.120]
It's not a movie.

[02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:05.920]
It's like a bad dream come true.

[02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:07.740]
And I want to say too.

[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:09.840]
I mean, I registered two ways to vote.

[02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:15.420]
And please, whoever out there isn't going to vote and he's a Democrat for Gore.

[02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:17.980]
Please vote for me because I can't do it.

[02:18:17.980 --> 02:18:18.260]
Please.

[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:19.400]
Okay, I'll vote twice.

[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:20.480]
Thanks.

[02:18:21.580 --> 02:18:22.820]
5.6705.60.

[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:23.720]
05.560.

[02:18:23.900 --> 02:18:24.720]
RAT&T.

[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:26.320]
And Verizon Wireless Lines.

[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:32.160]
Don't forget we'll be with the QM van at the ticket sports bar and grill with BFO in Dear Field Beach tonight.

[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:35.500]
Corner Hillsboro Boulevard and Powerline Road and the Kmart Plaza from running that football.

[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:36.860]
And the nephew will be there.

[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:38.560]
And Roman Gell with the best of the LCDs.

[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:41.080]
Keychains, new one, new buttons and all that other good stuff.

[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:41.780]
The T-shirts.

[02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:48.260]
The ticket sports bar and grill in Dear Field Beach, Corner Hillsboro and Powerline Road in the Kmart Plaza tonight.

[02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:55.020]
And also don't forget speaking tonight that rally on the South Beach, 10 p.m. on Ocean Drive between 6 and 7 streets.

[02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:55.920]
Our grill will be there.

[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:56.520]
Stevie Wonder.

[02:18:56.760 --> 02:18:57.360]
And who is the other one?

[02:18:57.800 --> 02:18:58.640]
Nothing you got him off for.

[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:01.760]
Somebody is not going to be Patty Smith.

[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:02.420]
I'll say to that.

[02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:03.020]
Who is it?

[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:03.540]
Double clock.

[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:04.420]
Oh, never clock.

[02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:06.960]
And you can get food tickets tonight.

[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:07.500]
It's big event.

[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:09.960]
It'll go on all night at Democratic Headquarters.

[02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:12.560]
There's just no information that people have the number for the worst years by you.

[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:13.200]
What was it?

[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:13.880]
Double clock.

[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:14.380]
Oh, okay.

[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:15.100]
That's what I thought you said.

[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:17.420]
So I think you can say Brian.

[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:19.780]
Here's the Lady in Dear Field Beach.

[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:20.000]
Hello.

[02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:21.120]
Oh, hi, I'm Neil.

[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:21.720]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:22.480]
Happy related birthday.

[02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:23.020]
Thank you.

[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:26.060]
I want to say I'm a love being and I've been out for 30 years.

[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:29.420]
And for 30 years, I've voted in every election since the 19th.

[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:30.400]
Thirty years.

[02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:32.000]
I still don't have all my rights.

[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:32.360]
Yeah.

[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:38.880]
And the horror of thinking was worse coming in knowing that things would just go from bad to worse.

[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:39.100]
Right.

[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:44.140]
Everybody, every minority group in this country and women who are even in minority, but every group

[02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:50.800]
that's had to work like crazy to try to make any advancements in the last 50, 60, 70 years will take giant steps backward

[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:51.720]
of this crowned victim.

[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:52.720]
That's it, exactly.

[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:55.540]
I talked with some friends in games, a big community.

[02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:59.680]
And they said, well, you know, we want to put a protest vote in.

[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:01.460]
They said, you know, vote number.

[02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:02.860]
Wait a minute.

[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:03.940]
For maybe you're talking about it.

[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:04.620]
Yeah.

[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:10.920]
I'm going to go to the crazy, even if you just remember all the women that died on kitchen tables getting abortion.

[02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:11.300]
Yeah.

[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:14.720]
I said, that will we want to go back to, hey, I'm not going to need any abortion.

[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:17.280]
But I know all the women are done.

[02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:18.460]
And that's how they'll die.

[02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:20.980]
And this is like, this is the reality of all this.

[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:23.460]
And it's all about the Supreme Court.

[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:26.260]
Neil, you're the best.

[02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:26.980]
Okay, thanks.

[02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:27.380]
Bye-bye.

[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:27.820]
Hang in there.

[02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:30.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:35.040]
Lesby and his fornator or boy, all I can say is, oh my god.

[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:35.480]
Wow.

[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:39.960]
Yeah, he's an alternative.

[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:40.820]
Uh-huh.

[02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:42.480]
Is he going to win any state?

[02:20:42.620 --> 02:20:43.280]
No, any county?

[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:44.480]
No, any electoral vote?

[02:20:44.620 --> 02:20:45.400]
No, anything?

[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:45.800]
No.

[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:46.140]
No.

[02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:49.660]
You've got 24 hours.

[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:51.700]
Well, I said probably about 26.

[02:20:52.260 --> 02:20:54.720]
If you're going to vote late tomorrow, about 27 hours.

[02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:02.220]
To change your mind, to get off that crap, to get with it, and be part of the solution and not the problem.

[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:07.720]
And of course, like the caller said earlier in the show, the Bush people are loving it.

[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:12.240]
They are sucking it up big time, including running those spots showing nature, making anti-gore comments.

[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:19.080]
Using nature's words to get people out there to vote for Bush, or to vote against grow, or to vote for leader or Bush.

[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:19.760]
They're loving it.

[02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:26.240]
9 minutes after 1 at 560, WQF.

[02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:28.760]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.200]
It's right in the evening.

[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:46.220]
She's high 15b.

[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:49.740]
She's high 15b.

[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:49.740]

[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:49.740]

[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:49.740]

[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:56.540]
She's here to remain low and age to see more you.

[02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:05.700]
And then she asks me, do you have a lie?

[02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:12.660]
I say, missy, you're a powerful tonight.

[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:34.520]
I'm smelling some things, a cheesy substance, like the potato salad.

[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.460]
That's incited from up in me.

[02:22:42.140 --> 02:22:48.800]
And she asks me, can we make love tonight?

[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:55.820]
I say no chance, you smell like the monkey dance tonight.

[02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:06.100]
14 at 550, Julian.

[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:09.180]
Thanks to Brad, our friends over at Tony's Pizza for a great lunch.

[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:13.020]
Here's a tremendous thanks for Mark and Boker.

[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:18.400]
Since I'm a registered Republican at the very large portfolio of predominantly drug stocks,

[02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:21.480]
I'm all rallying on the anticipation of George W's election.

[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:24.180]
In the short run, I'm looking at a windfall in profits.

[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:32.520]
However, tomorrow I'm voting for Al Gore, because long-term no amount of money will be able to repair the damage that this moron and this colony will bring about in the next four years.

[02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:35.540]
Al Gore, president, Pat Burns for Coaches of the Panthers.

[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:44.020]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:45.500]
Lady Moby and Boker, hello.

[02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:46.900]
Hello, Boker.

[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:50.840]
I appreciate you taking my call, Leo.

[02:23:51.140 --> 02:24:00.140]
I'd like to made our people to consider that if Bush gets in and resigns, they'll have Cheney and Cheney voted again.

[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:05.100]
So, clean air and clean water can the made our people live with that.

[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:08.640]
We'll be, we'll be get back at 50 years.

[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:14.680]
And I'd like to made our people to treat, reconsider, who they're voting again.

[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:31.580]
Well, if they could force the NATO people, if they could sit them all down and tie them up for like five minutes and let them work at pictures of the Texas skyline, especially in Austin and Houston, but all over the state and see the damage that the big polluters, the big world companies and all George Bush's corporate friends have done in the last two or five years, then maybe they might rethink it.

[02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:39.920]
But I don't know. I mean, there's that core of NATO people who are just so stubborn and just so obstinate about this, they must be the same ones that throw parts in at all.

[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.860]
It's a sad situation.

[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:44.440]
Well, we'll overcome anyway.

[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:50.960]
560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless one.

[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:53.600]
We'll overcome anyway, won't we? Maybe. Or maybe not.

[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:57.680]
Here's a mobile and vocal. Hello.

[02:24:58.280 --> 02:24:59.820]
Hello. How are you doing? I'm doing good.

[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:08.060]
Listen, there's a word that we should use for these white wings fanatics who are four Bush no matter what, no matter is that stupid.

[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:13.560]
And that is Bush a hall like there are a bunch of Bush a hall like because they refuse to see.

[02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:17.220]
It can't get enough Bush. Yeah, they're intoxicated with him.

[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:23.100]
And that's all I have to say. Okay, thanks. Now with Bush a hall. Maybe in the next few hours, we can find a cure for that.

[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:25.780]
Yeah, I hope so. We're going to work it up.

[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:34.180]
560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless one. Thomas Friedman writes in the New York Times today.

[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:36.220]
The wrong answer.

[02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:49.000]
If there's been a load point for the press following the Bush Corps campaign, surely it's been the mass-wrested judgment that because George W. Bush was able to tick off old hotspots in the last debate, he understands foreign policy enough to be present.

[02:25:49.720 --> 02:26:00.280]
In fact, Mr. Bush uttered a stunning howler during that debate. When asked by Jim Lehrer, which of the recent US interventions have brought he would approve of, Mr. Bush said he did not approve of Haiti, but it would approve of Lebanon in 1982.

[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:05.500]
Oh, really? Who bad Mr. Lehrer didn't have time to ask him? Do you have an abortion? What was it you liked about Lebanon?

[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:12.300]
Was it the fact that President Reagan was in Lebanon out of guilt over the Sabra and Chatella massacres about any preparation?

[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:15.400]
And as a result, we became another fact in the Lebanese Civil War.

[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:22.060]
Was it the fact that we were engaged there in intensive nation building, training the whole Lebanese army, very nation building you opposed in Haiti?

[02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:31.760]
Was it the fact that we tried to build our policy in Lebanon around exercising all that military power you want to build up again, even showing Syrian troops with the battleship New Jersey and all that power for Qtile?

[02:26:32.180 --> 02:26:37.380]
Was it the fact that 241 US servicemen were killed in their sleep as a result of the futile exercise of power?

[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:49.800]
Was it the fact that your chief foreign policy adviser, George Schultz, was our secretary of state then, who negotiated the May 17, 1980s re-agreement for Israeli security in South Lebanon, which was so one-sided in Israel's favor that was never implemented,

[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:55.100]
blew up in our faces and resulted in Syrian domination of Lebanon. What exactly did you like about Lebanon, Governor?

[02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:07.760]
The failed US intervention in Lebanon was the direct outcome of having a president, Mr. Reagan, who was fuzzy on the details, susceptible to cliches, and totally dependent on foreign policy advisers, who themselves did not understand in the least.

[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:18.540]
President Clinton was enlisted by all the parties to this conflict. He wrote a sharmel sheet yesterday precisely because they believed he is someone who has mastered the details and understands the limits of force for resolving this issue?

[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:32.060]
Critics not proclaim can't they, but is a mistake. Nonsense. A who'd Milwaukee is no naive dove. He's a realist who felt he owed it to the Israelis who don't want to live forever in the barricade to test whether Israel had a Palestinian partner for a decent peace.

[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:42.740]
Mr. Clinton provided the framework for that test. The president was actually quite wary about it. He knew his customers, but he also knew America would suffer if it ran away from this problem in a region where we have so many strategic interests.

[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:55.060]
The trouble was that Mr. Clinton got so much from Mr. Barack that the answer airfout wasn't ready to respond. First Mr. Aira Fatt turned to the air breeze, he used for help and cover but they ran away. Then he went on the world tour to try to get help and was told to deal with Mr. Barack.

[02:27:55.900 --> 02:28:04.280]
And when he couldn't summon the will for that he blew things up. It never occurred to Mr. Aira Fatt that if he wanted more from Mr. Barack he should, so not like appeal directly to the Israeli people.

[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:14.100]
The Oslo peace process is now crashed. The parties have chosen to go back to fighting over who owns which olive tree. Eventually they'll like the Serbs who desire to be part of the world will beckon them back.

[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:23.580]
But only after they all pay an awful price. When it does maybe we'll have a more honest peace process. One of which Israel is not negotiating with one hand still building settlements with the other.

[02:28:23.580 --> 02:28:36.760]
One of which in which Mr. Aira Fatt is not negotiating with one hand and building hitting Israel israelis in Palestinian mosque and textbooks with the other. And one of which weak autocratic Arab leaders don't try to keep their people at bay by letting them off steam off on Israel.

[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:48.680]
The devil in this region and the solution is in the details. Foreign policy problems really come packaged in your ideal way. They always come messy spurred as much by the effectiveness of allies is the mandacity of enemies.

[02:28:48.680 --> 02:29:03.040]
And they can be solved only by some combination of military might details patient diplomacy and some cautious optimism. When you approach them with superficial cliches and on the willingness to master details and over reliance on military power you end up with America in love and in 1982.

[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:17.640]
One of George W. Bush's preferred foreign policy moments scary scary and he is scary. And anybody with a brain out there ought to be scared that a man who is proud enough to tell us that he was a craft student.

[02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:24.440]
And he is proud enough to tell us that if we showed him our course of always on the map he knew where it was. And this is your idea of a leader.

[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:35.640]
Shame on you. That's what I have to say here today. Shame on you. Whether you are doing it easy because of selfishness because you think you are going to get a tax cut you are going to get more goddamn money.

[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:42.740]
Whether you are doing it because you are a professional political hack that all you know is whatever is on the right of the ticket that is what you are going to vote for.

[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:54.560]
Don't call this get a big algorithm like I have told you a billion times at one point in the game not too many weeks ago I was going to vote at all.

[02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:58.800]
I said I would hold my nose and vote for go and especially that you leave them creep.

[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:11.000]
My vote is anti bush baby anti bush and everything he stands for and all those people all those rabid right wing zealous who are behind him or pulling the strings.

[02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:22.060]
Here South Miami. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes sir. You were right before when you said the letter all plays a big role in George W. Bush if I'll just read something real quick.

[02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:35.100]
Retard right wing Republican rich kid redneck who reads that a kindergarten level and he reads about the wall and he relishes revenge on daddy's was and his resume consists of running three oil companies into the ground and being handed brain your ownership.

[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:38.160]
Oh and his wife rough rough.

[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:42.060]
Okay well done to bad Sammy so said don't have more arson it.

[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:48.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:30:50.180 --> 02:30:51.980]
Here's a mobile and most Palm Beach hello.

[02:30:52.520 --> 02:31:03.520]
I got me right. Yes sir. I got found was right. Anybody as I off color evil for our public it is going to be a formal election you need to be.

[02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:12.480]
I I received a tax fair money but it ain't going to bother school the teacher's redneck how to hate any other colors or races.

[02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:20.480]
Now it's and then I understand it's in the racial war and the proper size of the Bible and I wonder if they can understand it better than that.

[02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:27.180]
Somebody say nothing about the Bible and talk about all back and books. How you going back but somebody just a fun reaction.

[02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:08.060]
Okay what do you say 5 6 7 0 5 6 6 5 6 5 6 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line as we're coming all over to the end here today baby.

[02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:12.820]
And tomorrow it's the election day and during the show we're not going to talk about it in the show tomorrow.

[02:32:13.020 --> 02:32:21.060]
You bet we are. We're going to have Greg read personally driving people all you folks that don't have a ride and we give them let me give those all give them tomorrow.

[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:29.500]
You'll forget about all those people need to ride to the polls we're going to have Greg driving everybody around personal taking you wherever you can as long as you promise to vote for Gore.

[02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:38.320]
You know Greg read you know who that is. Here's a letter that was sent from Dick Herman Washington lawyer and publisher.

[02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:48.480]
He says dear friends I haven't said much during the presidential campaign season but time is getting short I think I might regret not expressing myself on the matter of George W Bush possibly being elected president.

[02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:58.700]
I went to school with George in fact I knew him quite well both through athletics socializing joint classes and particularly as my immediate lab partner in the freshman science class.

[02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:05.120]
The fact that he is tantalizing with close to becoming the most powerful and important person in the world is both astonishing and terrifying.

[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:12.340]
I had quite a number of classmates who my thought might one day be worthy of incompetent to serve as president but George was definitely not one of them.

[02:33:13.220 --> 02:33:17.520]
I did not come away from my four years of interaction with him with the very positive feeling about him.

[02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:28.460]
He was intellectually lazy not particularly interested in anything serious rather arrogant contemptuous of studying and purposeless to think that someone so average could be leading this nation as a scary proposition.

[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:35.160]
Sure people change but not that much he would have to do a great deal more morphing in order to be up to the job with which he aspires.

[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:43.100]
One of our fellow class makes advances the theory that George is so limited in the narrow that he have to surmount himself with great advises hence there is nothing to fear.

[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:52.880]
I disagree ultimately presidents have to make big decisions and I worry about that the prospect that our children might have to survive and will heavily influenced by George should give anyone pause.

[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:59.980]
One other point one of his made been made by others but that I was witness to up close and personal George has never been tested.

[02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:06.640]
He has lived a life of real privilege securing his name with a large s of the powerful influential people who circle his family.

[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:17.360]
No one has ever had a safety net like George whether it been getting in the end over Yale Harvard Business School the international guard when and take it from me and other 50 plus percent of my class that one of them are unactive do they have to graduation.

[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:20.480]
There were absolutely no guard or reserve slots available anywhere.

[02:34:21.140 --> 02:34:29.460]
The oil business extricating himself from his oil company the Texas Rangers the Grimitario Mansion and the presidential nomination a few more taken advantage of it.

[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:37.160]
Like Ann Richards once said he was born on third base and thought he had a triple please don't help him steal home.

[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:46.900]
Says their curman a Washington lawyer publisher who went to school with W who says basically he's a moron and dangerous.

[02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:53.900]
Pretty obvious I think I was watching listen 26 after one at 560 WDQM.

[02:34:54.980 --> 02:34:59.380]
The Neil Roger show sports radio 560 you.

[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:02.780]
Beware of exploding balls.

[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:13.680]
I went to an orgy at the county jail looking for a bullet and I could not.

[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:19.500]
Everyone's up with it and doing the thing we're all begging and they say we do that thing.

[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:20.720]
Well that's f*****.

[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:22.680]
Never find it.

[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:24.660]
That's f*****.

[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:27.600]
Thank you for these all over the cell phones.

[02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:30.200]
We're banging at the jail house.

[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:34.040]
Office of 47 was hanging in a tree.

[02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:36.600]
They were the cutest couple that I ever seen.

[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:39.420]
This one in May was hiring me with a switch.

[02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:42.400]
She said come over here so much to make it my best.

[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:44.080]
So let's f*****.

[02:35:44.860 --> 02:35:47.420]
Everybody let's f*****.

[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:50.540]
The naked body is in the cell box.

[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:53.180]
We're banging at the jail house.

[02:35:53.940 --> 02:35:56.740]
This one officer was standing on the loan.

[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:59.600]
And the bone in his pocket was hard as stone.

[02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:02.380]
The word dead body what you do it over there.

[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:04.360]
Bangers doesn't even make weed.

[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:05.440]
Wacking in that chair.

[02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:06.440]
That's f*****.

[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:09.280]
Everybody let's f*****.

[02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:13.420]
The naked body is in the cell box.

[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.100]
We're banging at the jail house.

[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:19.620]
And what was Steve Allen saying about that I'll ask you again.

[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:20.300]
You think you'd like it?

[02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:21.140]
Oh yeah.

[02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:24.340]
131 at 560 WQLN.

[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:29.840]
And I think until you break it down this way we don't really understand you.

[02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:31.920]
We keep talking about the closest race in all these years.

[02:36:32.260 --> 02:36:33.220]
It really is that close.

[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:36.540]
And these guys have been hammering away the same states.

[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:38.080]
But let's talk about it.

[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:38.680]
I love this one.

[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:40.500]
I met Adam Smith and we see they get the Republican.

[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:43.660]
A bunch of these the red states and the Democrats get the blue states.

[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:45.840]
And they go up to the map and they stick it.

[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:49.240]
They try to draw out their strategy for winning the electoral college.

[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:50.640]
They had a bunch of jackasses.

[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:53.540]
I think it was on one of the round tables on CNN last night.

[02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:55.480]
And all of them.

[02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:56.320]
Every one of them.

[02:36:56.420 --> 02:36:56.620]
Oh yeah.

[02:36:56.660 --> 02:36:59.800]
Well we really believe in the electoral college and the wrong favor of keeping it.

[02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:01.780]
And of course the obvious question is.

[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:05.780]
Even Thomas Jefferson hated the electoral college.

[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:08.020]
Said it was a like a cancer insanity.

[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:12.440]
Here's a mobile and tamarack hello.

[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:14.380]
I knew you would get afternoon.

[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:15.660]
This is Moshelevene.

[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:16.140]
How you doing?

[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:16.560]
Okay.

[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:22.040]
I call you every year and I'm only calling you now to wish you a happy and a healthy birthday.

[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:23.020]
Thank you.

[02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:23.620]
You're welcome.

[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:24.660]
I'll call you next year.

[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:25.160]
Okay.

[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:25.840]
Bye.

[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:26.700]
Zai Gazzan.

[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:27.500]
Thank you.

[02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:27.920]
Okay.

[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:28.980]
Take off that beanie.

[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:34.540]
5, 6, 7, 8, say how did you live them in 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, all your friends.

[02:37:35.340 --> 02:37:36.560]
I forgot to tell you this.

[02:37:36.620 --> 02:37:39.880]
Your good friend, your accountant David came to a hockey game while you won vacation one night.

[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:40.200]
Yes.

[02:37:41.060 --> 02:37:42.100]
And brought me a bag.

[02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:43.500]
I want to say this about David.

[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:45.040]
Cox on hoist.

[02:37:46.660 --> 02:37:49.120]
He brought me a bag of sugar free like wafers you know.

[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:49.620]
Mm-hmm.

[02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:50.360]
Communion wafers?

[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:50.920]
Yeah.

[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:51.980]
No seriously.

[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:53.140]
Sugar free allegedly.

[02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:55.920]
And it was like a plastic container.

[02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:57.640]
I mean, not a tremendous amount.

[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:00.940]
I love the cream so bad wafers things that they have.

[02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:02.840]
You know, the thin.

[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:05.240]
I can't think of the name that they have for those wafers.

[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:06.120]
They're like flaky.

[02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:06.800]
Right.

[02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:07.380]
Yeah.

[02:38:07.620 --> 02:38:07.820]
Yeah.

[02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:07.980]

[02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:08.240]
Yeah.

[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:08.380]

[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:08.380]

[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:13.960]
So during the course of the game, I mean, there's not much else going on because the panthers who used to are losing again, which is.

[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:15.840]
And so I ate the whole thing.

[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:16.480]
Yeah.

[02:38:16.740 --> 02:38:17.720]
Figuring this sugar free.

[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:20.400]
And I thought to myself, I didn't have any urge.

[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:21.700]
If you're not, listen to me.

[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:21.920]
Okay.

[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:23.040]
Yeah.

[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:25.420]
I didn't have any urge to ask.

[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:26.740]
So I knew I'm thinking of myself.

[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:31.320]
That's strange because I was hoping I had her doing that would give me a good excuse to run home early and get out of that awful game.

[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:33.940]
I get home.

[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:36.740]
My blood sugar is 363.

[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:40.880]
You have any idea how grotesque that is?

[02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:44.340]
It's bread with sugar free cream in the middle of it.

[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:48.180]
What did I try to tell you about those Israelis?

[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:49.180]
The killers.

[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:51.120]
It's your account for Christ's.

[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:52.260]
It's a whole thing.

[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:53.600]
It's stay away from me.

[02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:55.380]
I can out there to use it.

[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:56.080]
Those hockey games.

[02:38:56.180 --> 02:38:58.340]
You should both stay away from me.

[02:38:58.940 --> 02:39:00.360]
I can't get rid of the other one.

[02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:01.460]
I can't get rid of them.

[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:03.200]
On his Greg, he just came in with his limo.

[02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:04.700]
He's taken all the people out to vote tomorrow.

[02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:05.620]
And they were for more.

[02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:08.680]
He's going to drive him around the QM van and his woman's in.

[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:12.740]
We're going to keep John zero locked in the building because we understand he's a bushlicker.

[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:13.820]
We'll keep him locked in here.

[02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:14.680]
Piece of crap.

[02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:18.040]
Just remember all these people that drive those big jaguars.

[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:18.460]
Yeah.

[02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:22.240]
Want to be flashing all their money.

[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:25.460]
Here's a lady in Fort Waterdale.

[02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:25.760]
Hello.

[02:39:26.580 --> 02:39:27.540]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:27.940]
Hi.

[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:29.700]
She's doing great work.

[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.660]
I can't believe all of this is seen by pass by the regular media.

[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:35.720]
But it cleared to me.

[02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:39.220]
It said London Times report is true.

[02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:40.500]
It's true that W.

[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:41.640]
Went AOL.

[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:42.780]
And that he was a lawyer.

[02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:44.300]
It's not just in that report.

[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:46.940]
It's documented in another place.

[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:47.600]
Yeah, I know.

[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:48.040]
I know.

[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:48.440]
I know.

[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:53.940]
But also it's that he'd be behind cleansing proof of that from his military records.

[02:39:54.140 --> 02:39:55.480]
Both of federal crime.

[02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:55.820]
Right.

[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:00.860]
It would make him, you know, is able to run it for federal office of the Constitution.

[02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:01.420]
Uh-huh.

[02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:07.200]
And it's insolented and it's revealed after the election to have the president.

[02:40:08.580 --> 02:40:09.060]
Yeah.

[02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:12.020]
So, and then what if well?

[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:16.880]
Well, maybe instead of preventing him from getting in there, maybe we'll be elected.

[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:20.320]
And then I'll ask you tomorrow, we can spend another 50 or 70 million dollars for big investigation.

[02:40:20.540 --> 02:40:22.440]
I think the state was a big right.

[02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:33.480]
But also, do you think that this might be part of a nefarious plot all around with training and the right, right wing republicans up to their old dirty tricks?

[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:35.800]
Can you learn that in the Nixon way, how?

[02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:38.260]
On the first part to do what?

[02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:40.220]
To exactly do this.

[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.160]
To, uh, without the information that W.

[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:46.300]
Committed federal crimes.

[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:49.340]
And, uh, and he's in all the prison changes.

[02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:51.260]
No, no, no, have a great case with us.

[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:53.080]
Say how to all your friends in the trial, I don't commission.

[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:56.520]
Oh, God, the conspiratorial mind.

[02:40:56.740 --> 02:40:58.660]
It just, you know, we got enough funds to do this.

[02:40:58.680 --> 02:40:59.840]
Let's not make any up, okay?

[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:05.160]
Let's not start fabricating all sorts of wild theories and conspiracies.

[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:06.460]
God.

[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:08.560]
Yeah, that's the way they're going to do it.

[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:13.460]
And of course, you must keep in mind, uh, I mean, she does have one minor point or maybe it's a major point to some.

[02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:16.480]
And you want to be in changes in those because as proper gallop ones, uh,

[02:41:16.780 --> 02:41:18.780]
pop a picture, Dick, Cheney, pop a pic dick.

[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:21.020]
That'd be a good song when it's pop a pic dick.

[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:24.940]
Be good over there and form my name, so they could go to that.

[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:28.680]
Who is the pop of secretary of defense?

[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:31.260]
Yeah, but let's get back to those and have the same core of, uh,

[02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:33.720]
the world of misfits who got tossed out eight years ago.

[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:35.260]
They're going to wind up back in there again.

[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:36.980]
They just been biting their time.

[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:41.260]
They couldn't get bubble out there with penis skits, so now they're going to come in the back door if you pardon that expression.

[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:41.680]
Back door.

[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:41.900]
Yeah.

[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:46.300]
23, 4, 2, 5, 60, WQM.

[02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:48.500]
Deal.

[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:51.860]
Uh, feminine closing statements.

[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.560]
You began Senator DeVagramon.

[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:59.160]
Bernie Al Gore and I are committed to making America's public schools crumbling classrooms.

[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:06.440]
I have tried the very hard in my career to act in a way that brings down the institutions of government and each of us individually.

[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:12.660]
And for a while, I was drilling a white pedassa and the deeper I got, that's I was not Senator.

[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:13.360]
Thank you, sir.

[02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:21.240]
This is secretary George Bush is a good man, an honorable man, a man of high taxes, and Governor Bush and I want to reform the social security system so that, uh,

[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:23.120]
senior citizen suffer this winter.

[02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:25.780]
I'm like a first grade president secretary J.A.D.

[02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:26.960]
Senior Lieberman.

[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:28.000]
We thank you.

[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:29.300]
142 at 560.

[02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:31.100]
I want to thought is right, especially on Shabbat.

[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:31.940]
They don't do it on Shabbat.

[02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:32.760]
No, oh god.

[02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:33.260]
I hope not.

[02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:36.380]
560, 560.

[02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:38.040]
We got 18 minutes ago.

[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:41.400]
Baby is the clock and it is ticking.

[02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:44.160]
Here's Miami.

[02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:44.440]
Hello.

[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:46.460]
I need you.

[02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:46.880]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:50.800]
Yeah, I just wanted to know, what is your show going to be like on Wednesday?

[02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:54.100]
What are you going to talk about on Wednesday when George Bush is the next person in the other state?

[02:42:54.100 --> 02:42:54.500]
I don't know.

[02:42:54.640 --> 02:42:56.240]
One, two and a one, which I'm sure you will.

[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:56.840]
We'll find out.

[02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:57.400]
Asshole.

[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:01.260]
We'll talk about whatever I want to talk about and you'll be listening to.

[02:43:01.780 --> 02:43:01.900]
Stick.

[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:07.460]
When you're a little boyfriend, like the same old, tired, tired, but not, don't you guys ever wear it out?

[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:09.000]
I must have a strap on those kids.

[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:10.460]
I must have a spear.

[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:17.040]
567, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lines.

[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:18.780]
20 of open lines.

[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:19.980]
You got 17 minutes to go here.

[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:21.020]
Can you keep it up till two?

[02:43:21.020 --> 02:43:21.840]
I doubt it.

[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:24.040]
That's why some dumb fork like him gets in there.

[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:25.700]
Here's open part.

[02:43:26.020 --> 02:43:26.020]

[02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:26.800]
Hi, Neil.

[02:43:27.140 --> 02:43:27.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:29.800]
I'm going to want to hear a caller also.

[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:30.940]
I call you want to hear.

[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:33.960]
I think we're spending our wheels with this election.

[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:35.680]
We're spending our wheels?

[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:37.080]
Oh, it's kind of silly.

[02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:38.080]
You don't have to work out.

[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:38.780]
Nobody really.

[02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:40.600]
It doesn't matter who wins.

[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:42.460]
Let's talk about the dolphins.

[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:43.040]
No.

[02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:45.160]
They all have Hank and talk about the dolphins.

[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:45.560]
Okay.

[02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:46.280]
Not interested.

[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:49.440]
We got 20 hours a day.

[02:43:52.100 --> 02:43:53.480]
Of that stuff on the station.

[02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:53.720]
Okay.

[02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:54.480]
And at the office, yeah.

[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:55.480]
Maybe they'll win the Super Bowl.

[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:56.060]
Okay. Great.

[02:43:56.920 --> 02:43:57.500]
Park Coons.

[02:43:57.580 --> 02:43:58.360]
Maybe they'll be number one.

[02:43:58.460 --> 02:43:58.640]
Great.

[02:43:59.000 --> 02:43:59.420]
You know something?

[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:00.240]
Who cares?

[02:44:02.300 --> 02:44:04.760]
You got the presidential election comes once every four years.

[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:08.440]
And some of your people, like I said, so many times that's all you care about is a ballgame.

[02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:10.240]
Who's going to win a Super Bowl game?

[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:13.400]
Because that's the American F&W maybe.

[02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:17.800]
You see, the European's digging out of the system of those soccer matches.

[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:21.720]
They go and why they get all their pet up hostility and frustration in the side courses.

[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:26.560]
I would, any carry on like a lunatic during the side, then they go back and they pay attention to business.

[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:30.940]
Here, it's only monkey business around the clock.

[02:44:31.080 --> 02:44:32.640]
That's all the American public knows monkey business.

[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:34.020]
And let's talk about the dolphins.

[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:34.680]
No, let's not.

[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:35.180]
Okay.

[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:39.580]
Here's Pember Pine.

[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:39.900]
Hello.

[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:41.020]
Hey, Neal, how you doing?

[02:44:41.140 --> 02:44:41.680]
I'm doing good.

[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:43.760]
The problem is too many long heads out there.

[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:44.080]
Uh-huh.

[02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:46.160]
Listen, I got done with the Bavaria's book.

[02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:47.140]
It was a great read.

[02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:50.660]
I wish I could just be distributed every household in America.

[02:44:51.380 --> 02:44:52.060]
Big, but a bad one.

[02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:57.740]
I wanted to ask you, did you see a Saturday sunset and all the big full page spread by the Christian?

[02:44:58.080 --> 02:44:59.620]
Yeah, I thought I talked about the beginning of the show.

[02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:00.560]
I thought I'm sorry.

[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:03.860]
It was another one in the, uh, hell yesterday in the Saturday one in the sunset.

[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:04.740]
I was disgusting.

[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.220]
It's a, I, it's a polling, but actually to me it's great because I would think you would work in reverse.

[02:45:09.460 --> 02:45:11.200]
I don't know what they're trying to force down the whole world.

[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:14.140]
Well, I should be a good tip off on where the Bush people are coming from.

[02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:14.940]
What he's all about.

[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:19.280]
Yeah, because we want our nation to run according to God's stated laws in principle.

[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:19.640]
Right.

[02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:21.380]
Amazing stuff.

[02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:21.800]
Mm-hmm.

[02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:22.720]
Keep it up, New York.

[02:45:22.860 --> 02:45:24.360]
It's a scary net hell out of me.

[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:24.820]
Okay.

[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:29.720]
The fact that this man could possibly get in people, go out by the God's book if you're not sure.

[02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:31.780]
If you haven't decided yet, you're a bunch of idiots.

[02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:32.960]
Wrap yourself in, pal.

[02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:33.900]
Oh, God.

[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:36.240]
Get ready for a bumpy ride.

[02:45:37.860 --> 02:45:39.700]
Also, and again, Gorge's got to win Florida.

[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:41.220]
Michigan, Pennsylvania.

[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:42.460]
Absolutely positive.

[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:43.420]
They must win all three.

[02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:46.060]
You see the electoral college thing now, it's tough.

[02:45:47.100 --> 02:45:50.340]
He's there in St. Louis right now, but he's four points down in tracking pool in Missouri,

[02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:52.680]
which is about 11 electoral votes, more like that's going to Bush.

[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:57.400]
But the gr is, I'm not counting on West Virginia.

[02:45:57.700 --> 02:45:58.660]
I don't think that looks so good.

[02:45:58.880 --> 02:45:59.800]
Arkansas don't look so good.

[02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:02.160]
Tennessee, it was dead even 46, 40.

[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:03.580]
He finally pulled even in his home state.

[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:05.980]
And they kept saying, wow, let's take a look at this home state.

[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:08.260]
All the factors as many people are pointed out.

[02:46:08.540 --> 02:46:10.920]
In the last several years, Tennessee has become more and more Republican.

[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:14.460]
You stabbed mostly Democratic senators and governors.

[02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:17.260]
And now they got a Republican governor into Republican senators.

[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:21.880]
And they get more Republican by the day because of the changing demographics as in more and more red neck.

[02:46:22.540 --> 02:46:23.560]
If that's possible.

[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:29.740]
But, of course, absolutely got to win those three of the remaining biggest states.

[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:31.300]
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida.

[02:46:31.500 --> 02:46:33.620]
And certainly Oregon, a Washington one or the other.

[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:35.760]
I'm going to throw to absolutely.

[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:38.100]
And Wisconsin, where he's down a couple of points and ladies, pulling.

[02:46:38.100 --> 02:46:40.420]
You know who you can thank for him being down a couple of points and ladies, folks.

[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:44.360]
And Wisconsin, Ralph Frickinator and his goddamn long heads.

[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:45.280]
That's what we can thank.

[02:46:45.540 --> 02:46:48.220]
All those punks who think that like I said before,

[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:51.320]
are going to be running around the street, smoking a wicked weed out in the street tomorrow.

[02:46:53.660 --> 02:46:55.000]
Yeah, likely story.

[02:46:57.820 --> 02:47:00.300]
Young, naive, uninformed, stupid.

[02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:07.360]
Now, we always have an element of the electorate that's like that, especially dumb and especially uninformed and especially stupid.

[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:09.140]
But this time we can't afford it.

[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:10.720]
There will actually be we can't afford it.

[02:47:13.460 --> 02:47:14.780]
Here's a mobile and four-letter mail.

[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:14.940]
Hello.

[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:15.940]
Say, Neil.

[02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:16.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:18.640]
But today or yesterday?

[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:21.540]
I think yesterday, last time I checked, but I'm trying to lose track at this point.

[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:22.900]
Well, happy birthday, Neil.

[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:26.220]
Neil, I was watching MSNBC yesterday a little bit.

[02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:32.040]
And I just, you know, they have to map up with the Electoral College and they had to shade it in blue and yellow and red.

[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:39.900]
And it's all, that's all just their speculation on how it's going with the 270 votes that you need.

[02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:40.760]
And you're right.

[02:47:40.900 --> 02:47:49.520]
I mean, the key here is, I mean, the Florida Michigan and Pennsylvania, those are huge, but when they're showing on the bottom,

[02:47:49.980 --> 02:47:53.040]
Gore was winning its front to those by 8.78%.

[02:47:53.660 --> 02:47:55.040]
I mean, one was 49.40.

[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:57.500]
Florida was pretty close.

[02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:59.920]
The Pennsylvania was, two points.

[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:00.760]
Two points.

[02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:02.220]
47.45 for Gore.

[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:04.360]
But Michigan was, he had it on the white front.

[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:04.840]
Nine points.

[02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:08.200]
Yeah, he's got it on the white. Electoral is not in the running. Electoral is in safely in this camp.

[02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:08.900]
Right.

[02:48:09.380 --> 02:48:15.460]
So, you gotta understand, you gotta understand that if you believe the MSNBC, which they've been a little bit slow and giving state up,

[02:48:15.900 --> 02:48:18.760]
this ticket was 205 for Bush and 181 for Gore.

[02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:19.440]
Right.

[02:48:19.500 --> 02:48:22.140]
That means the Gore is already 24 electra votes behind.

[02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:27.280]
You only need 270, which would tell you that Bush needs only 65 and Gore needs 85.

[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:31.640]
We've gotta win those ones with the 23 and 25, many in those big things.

[02:48:32.020 --> 02:48:32.020]

[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:35.800]
Now, this is the way this crack-up system is.

[02:48:36.580 --> 02:48:42.880]
If Gore wins, excuse me, if Bush wins, Rick Torrell and Gore wins the popular, Bush is the first compressor.

[02:48:43.140 --> 02:48:45.320]
That's right. Or the other way around.

[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:50.520]
So, when do they have, Edgis Amy here, who's been 16 years since I graduated from high school,

[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:53.820]
when the hell do we have a runoff and what do they do on that?

[02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:55.580]
What do you mean a runoff?

[02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:59.380]
Well, don't think that hasn't been a presidential runoff at all.

[02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:04.420]
What do you mean a runoff? How can there be a runoff? There's no such thing as a runoff in a presidential election.

[02:49:05.340 --> 02:49:10.740]
If they tied with 269 electoral votes each, then it goes to the House. Then it goes to the House state by state.

[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:13.320]
And then the House votes on his run.

[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:15.760]
Right. The new House, the newly elected House after January.

[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:16.480]
Right.

[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:18.300]
All right, boy.

[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:18.840]

[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:20.380]
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:20.740]
Okay.

[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:22.220]
See you there.

[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:22.880]
See you.

[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:23.360]
Bye-bye.

[02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:24.060]
Bye-bye.

[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.560]
So, let them be 4205, 60WQA.

[02:49:27.900 --> 02:49:29.360]
The Neil Rogers Show.

[02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:30.420]
New Sports Radio.

[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:31.860]
560s.

[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:32.900]
QA.

[02:49:33.460 --> 02:49:33.460]

[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:35.640]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:39.360]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:42.800]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:10.440]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:11.900]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:11.900]

[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:11.900]

[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:11.900]

[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:11.900]

[02:50:12.020 --> 02:50:12.180]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:12.320]

[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:12.780]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:12.780]

[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:30.020]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:36.640]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:40.240]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:40.940]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:40.940]

[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:40.940]

[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:40.940]

[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:40.940]

[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:40.940]

[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:42.380]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:47.360]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:50.960]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:52.240]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:54.580]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:55.900]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:57.200]
Good luck to you, Edgis and Pizza.

[02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:01.060]
460, amen to that.

[02:51:02.260 --> 02:51:03.420]
694 votes already.

[02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:05.060]
If you're voting tomorrow for whom you be voting,

[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:11.820]
Al Gore 485, just under 70%, George W. 131, 1828%,

[02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:14.360]
Harry Brown, Fudge Brown, moving in a second place,

[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:19.980]
36 votes 5.1%, Ralph Nader 32, 4.6%, and Patrick Cannon.

[02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:21.940]
Alright, let's hear for Pat, he's up to 10.

[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:24.240]
Oh, he's got another one, took him about 2.5 hours,

[02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:26.300]
he's got 1.4%.

[02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:28.560]
And here's Al Gore and San Luis.

[02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:33.320]
Of Gene Garnerhan, you know what it means to keep the fire.

[02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:36.280]
That's right, let's vote for that dead guy and San Luis and the Missouri.

[02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:40.200]
And standing right next to Al Gore, there's Dick Gibhart.

[02:51:42.200 --> 02:51:44.480]
And there's that mindless tipper, stand all boy.

[02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:46.200]
She just gives me the creeps.

[02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:48.480]
Lynn Chaney gives me the creeps.

[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:50.300]
See, one thing about that, what is your name?

[02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:52.700]
Laura Bush, the burning Bush.

[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:55.020]
You don't see her, they kept her locked up some more.

[02:51:55.220 --> 02:51:57.420]
Maybe it's because of that guy that she killed at that time, you know?

[02:51:57.700 --> 02:51:58.100]
That pedestrian?

[02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:01.340]
We can get her hooked up with Rick Sanchez.

[02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:04.440]
Here's a mobile in some lines, hello?

[02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:06.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:08.120]
First of all, let me say,

[02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:10.180]
hello, I said, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:10.540]

[02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:13.200]
And my pleasure.

[02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:16.320]
And second of all, anybody that votes for Bush tomorrow?

[02:52:19.380 --> 02:52:20.340]
Basically, they're...

[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:22.680]
Okay, great, I will say that there's some more.

[02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:24.400]
Here's Pompano, hello?

[02:52:25.780 --> 02:52:26.260]
Pompano.

[02:52:26.980 --> 02:52:27.560]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:52:27.800 --> 02:52:28.100]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:29.800]
Question, how do you take...

[02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:33.360]
What's the take on the local and state votes for them?

[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:35.280]
Are you going to go what, Democrat or Republican?

[02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:36.760]
Democrat, all the way, sir.

[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:37.840]
My channel is...

[02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:40.460]
That's what I want to know because I agree with everything you say.

[02:52:40.540 --> 02:52:41.820]
And I'm going to follow your...

[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:43.280]
Every Democratic candidate.

[02:52:43.660 --> 02:52:44.240]
You got it.

[02:52:44.280 --> 02:52:45.880]
Including Peter Dorich who's unopposed.

[02:52:46.140 --> 02:52:46.960]
Just to make sure.

[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:47.660]
Thank you.

[02:52:47.860 --> 02:52:48.100]
Okay.

[02:52:50.020 --> 02:52:52.380]
You see, that guy that called it, or it's part of the call me,

[02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:54.140]
but I'll be sure and vote for Lane Bullock.

[02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:56.260]
I can vote for Lane Bullock unless I move over to the beach.

[02:52:56.440 --> 02:52:59.140]
That district, top 26, is right along the beaches.

[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:01.000]
From Miami Beach, all about to Fort Lauderdale Beach.

[02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:03.920]
A lot of going in that area, especially in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:06.940]
All those rich go in that live in Fort Lauderdale Beach.

[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:10.160]
So I think Clayshaw, I don't know, I hope the England kind of puts it through.

[02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:13.440]
But Clayshaw, just because they recognize the name, first of all,

[02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:14.400]
he's been there for 20 years.

[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:15.760]
And plus the rich go in there like him.

[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:18.240]
Don't forget, just say...

[02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:18.320]
Oh!

[02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:21.560]
To build a column tomorrow, just remember all at $60, $70 million,

[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:22.720]
the tax money wasted.

[02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:26.420]
Just remember his rabbit, his stilia, his paranoia with Pina Scotia.

[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:28.520]
He was the leader, the henchman, leader of the pack.

[02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:33.580]
And now that we have all this other stuff coming out about W,

[02:53:33.580 --> 02:53:34.860]
he's strangely silent.

[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:36.940]
Oh, it's a political thing, it's dirty tricks.

[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:40.140]
When a shoe is on the other foot, the right wing, they can't deal with it.

[02:53:40.300 --> 02:53:41.080]
They can't handle the heat.

[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:44.960]
Even that Bob Livingston starts reading from the goddamn drug report.

[02:53:45.260 --> 02:53:47.520]
And Chris Matthews had a shove of socket as well to shut him up.

[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:50.400]
Here's Delray Beach.

[02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:50.720]
How long?

[02:53:52.620 --> 02:53:53.160]
Delray Beach.

[02:53:53.380 --> 02:53:53.540]
Hello.

[02:53:53.900 --> 02:53:54.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:53:56.020 --> 02:53:57.820]
I'd like to just make several statements.

[02:53:58.180 --> 02:53:58.320]
Really?

[02:53:58.800 --> 02:54:01.080]
Number one, Andrea Trix was defeated.

[02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:03.680]
And of course, she's been taunted by the Republicans.

[02:54:03.680 --> 02:54:10.000]
But they forget to mention that they outspend her 30 to 1, 30 to 1.

[02:54:10.120 --> 02:54:10.360]
Uh-huh.

[02:54:10.760 --> 02:54:16.860]
And I would also add that the Republican Kingmaker's reinvention of George Bush

[02:54:16.860 --> 02:54:20.060]
will probably be one of the grossest mockery of our time.

[02:54:20.700 --> 02:54:23.760]
And so, apparently, when George Bush keeps repeating,

[02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:24.420]
and he's saying,
