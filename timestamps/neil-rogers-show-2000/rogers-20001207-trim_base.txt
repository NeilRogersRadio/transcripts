[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620]
The Neil Roger Show on 560 QAF

[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.480]
To talk to Neil

Call 567

[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.580]
Call 560

[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.980]
Call 3 in David Rower

[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.920]
Call 560 on your talk

[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.300]
The opinions of Neil is guests and callers

[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.540]
You not necessarily represent those of the beastly Roger at the crickets

[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.400]
Now, advertisers are agents now

[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.820]
Here's Neil Roger on 560 QAF

[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.400]
There's no cheese or light for Hanukkah

[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.920]
Go down the block the houses are darker

[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.560]
We are rich in, we will Christian on

[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560]
Because the song is not civilized children

[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.960]
For eight nights we light light

[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.160]
When the center be committed and light

[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.360]
All we get to light is our minority of bench Christmas

[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.580]
And since that's all right

[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.420]
Our holiday is really such a porous life

[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.860]
Something to avoid

[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.500]
All we get to light is our minority of bench Christmas

[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.740]
And that's all right

[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.720]
Our holiday is really such a porous life

[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.300]
Something to avoid

[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.540]
It's so hot for us to go shopping

[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.000]
We don't know when Hanukkah is happening

[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.300]
What is the date?

[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.340]
Are we too late?

[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.060]
You can normally see them go

[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.780]
Now, come on

[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.360]
What are we supposed to do?

[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.840]
Do you think it's easy to get guests when we only pay wholesale?

[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.000]
Now

[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.880]
All we get to light is our minority of bench Christmas

[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.300]
And that's all right

[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.260]
Our holiday is really such a porous life

[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.420]
Something to avoid

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.660]
All we get to light is our minority of bench

[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.540]
And that's all right

[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.480]
Our holiday is really such a porous life

[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.840]
Something to avoid

[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.820]
102 at 560 WQM yesterday

[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.720]
And I apologize for wasting the entire last half hour of the show

[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.580]
But see you then

[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.660]
As usually blue within

[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.000]
Have any idea what they were talking about

[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.520]
Oh Florida Supreme Court announcement coming any moment

[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.380]
And then finally like a minute after two o'clock

[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.980]
They had some talking head brought on there

[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.160]
Well, they may be telling us about the briefs that were filed this morning

[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.280]
Does anybody care about what briefs they were wearing?

[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.380]
No, I mean who gives a crap?

[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.140]
As opposed to like somebody thought there was an announcement coming

[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.400]
And was there an announcement coming?

[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.620]
No

[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.620]
Now the Florida Supreme Court hearing is going to be going on

[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.560]
Starting any second

[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.960]
See I'm getting sucked into this again

[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.320]
Again this morning

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.060]
But it is I mean supposed to be happening

[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.040]
And as usual they're dittling around

[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.960]
They're dicking around

[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.940]
And we will carry it this hour

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.080]
It's supposed to only take an hour

[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.660]
And as a result because

[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.280]
Especially since our sales department ain't telling

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.180]
I mean why should the sales department be selling anything

[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.420]
It's only Christmas and Hanukkah

[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.380]
It's only the holidays

[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.380]
Georgian hour lamenting

[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.420]
Every year that we've been here

[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.120]
We talk about this

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.140]
This is the only radio station in America

[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.360]
That when it comes to the height of the shot

[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.520]
Holiday shopping season

[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.460]
The program log is empty

[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.020]
So that's a bonus for you people out there

[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.920]
That get tired of hearing so many goddamn commercials

[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.960]
Oh yeah it's good

[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.820]
The holidays are great

[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.160]
Not only you get to eat all that crap

[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.280]
But you don't have to hear all those commercials on the radio

[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.380]
So we've been able to juggle a log around a little bit

[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.280]
Yeah and when we do come back

[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.060]
I got a great article that somebody faxed me

[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.960]
I thank you profusely

[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.920]
From today's New York Times

[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.840]
By Bob Herbert

[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.460]
It's titled In America Keep Them Out

[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.460]
About the state of Florida

[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.420]
And about this choice point

[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.840]
Organization

[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.380]
That came up with this list of 173 names

[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.300]
And correctly just thousands of them incorrect

[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.680]
But don't confuse them of the facts

[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.840]
The names that were purged from the voter rolls

[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.280]
Because the essence of the whole deal is

[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.480]
Keep those shfartses from voting anywhere you can

[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.420]
And in Florida they did a real good job of that

[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.820]
Not that you can prove it now

[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.580]
But it's a great article I will read it

[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.820]
Also I'll spend probably an hour

[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.140]
Did they rip in the Panther organization

[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.580]
Let me just say this

[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.580]
We got Mike Russo in a Sunsetnel

[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.920]
We got David J. Neal in the Herald

[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.500]
Between the two of them

[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.340]
Or here come the Justices

[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.960]
Between the two of them is hopeless

[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.720]
Because obviously they've been sufficiently intimidated

[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.680]
By the organization

[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.780]
That they just really won't tell it like it is

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.500]
That performance last night at the

[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.980]
Macarena

[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.560]
There should have been refunds after the game

[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.680]
And why they could expect anyone

[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.120]
To spend that kind of money

[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.220]
To go see that performance

[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.180]
They got to be out of their minds

[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.880]
And guess what?

[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.680]
The people are rising up

[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.420]
They're not showing up

[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.420]
Good morning and welcome

[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.000]
Once again to the Florida Spring Court

[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.640]
Thank you

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.260]
We'll have our argument this morning

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.020]
In the case of Gore versus Harris

[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.260]
What a great talk up

[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.760]
And as an introduction

[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.960]
As we did when we had our argument

[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.420]
In this court

[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.660]
Approximately 10 days ago

[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.440]
This is the Charles Ways

[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.420]
No relation to Merlin

[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.600]
We welcome the Vistar

[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.920]
Here because of the limitations on time

[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.760]
Is absolutely necessary

[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.940]
We maintain order in the court

[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.020]
At all

[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.900]
Thank you, obviously

[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.360]
And we ask further

[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.080]
At the end of the argument

[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.500]
That council be allowed to leave the building

[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.300]
Together with their parties

[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.420]
Prior to the time that any of the vistas

[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.320]
Leave the building

[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.880]
And then hold off interviews

[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.600]
Outside the building

[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.100]
Once again council

[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.720]
We

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.440]
Are in the big question

[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.660]
It's not a matter of

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.440]
Like to

[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.420]
The issues at hand

[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.260]
And so

[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.100]
I believe

[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.580]
What numbers MSNBC there it is

[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.140]
Going to proceed first

[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.100]
I think I'm good on you

[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.680]
CNN

[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.960]
Stop me please the court

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.140]
My name is David Boys

[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.060]
And I represent the vice president

[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.020]
And Senator Lieberman

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.700]
Mr. Boys, let me start

[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.780]
Right off

[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.820]
You know on the case was here

[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.000]
Previously

[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.120]
In the protest

[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.220]
Part of the proceeding

[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.660]
No council for any party

[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.800]
In briefs or in argument

[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.280]
Raised with this court

[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.100]
The US Supreme Court case of

[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.760]
MacPherson versus Blacker

[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.100]
Seemingly because council did not believe that it was important

[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.060]
For our consideration

[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.280]
However that case was forcefully argued to the US Supreme Court

[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.740]
And the US Supreme Court has now called that case to this court's

[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.580]
Attention and the opinion that came out is Monday

[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.880]
And now once again no council has argued that

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.780]
Case to this court but I want to know from each council

[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.280]
It's important here my reading of that case is if the US Supreme Court has said

[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.000]
That the state legislature has plenary power

[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.380]
Full power

[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.080]
In respect to appointment of presidential electors

[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.660]
And that power cannot be eroded even by the state constitution

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.180]
Now accepting that as controlling law

[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.940]
Why does that not mean

[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.440]
That the courts of this state

[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.900]
Can only be involved in resolving controversies

[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.300]
In contest where the legislature explicit

[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.760]
gives this court that power or a court

[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.100]
That power

[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.920]
Which it has not done in respect to presidential electors in 102.168

[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:12.260]
And secondly even if 102.168 is read to implicitly apply to presidential electors

[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.080]
Why is it not judicial review given to the circuit court

[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.880]
And not this court

[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.080]
Since the only means by which there is a right to a pellet review in Florida

[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.540]
Is through the state constitution

[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.940]
Would you please address that and I would like the other council to address that

[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.900]
Yes, Your Honor

[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:41.520]
Um first with respect to whether the appropriate the forum is the district court of appeal or is this court

[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.320]
Um the district court of appeal has of course certified this issue as a matter of great

[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.500]
Public importance and a issue that needs immediate attention

[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.520]
I understand that you're sticks my my question is the pellet reviewed with that is not expressly given in 168

[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:06.000]
We would say your honor that under 168 this court has the power to review both

[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:15.460]
Directly because it has been certified up and under this court's mandamus power which we've also alternatively put forward in our brief

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.020]
Where where is it where do we get our right to review

[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.460]
Uh the the pellet review from the rules and from the constitution

[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.780]
It doesn't that create a federal question

[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:38.340]
I don't think so your honor because what you're doing is you're reviewing and and reviewing an ordinary

[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.320]
Judicial interpretation way the statutes of the state that is

[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.200]
I don't think the constitution of the United States in any way

[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.820]
Means that the legislature has to sit both as a legislative body and a judicial body

[00:08:52.820 --> 00:09:00.100]
Just because an election of presidential electors is involved. Well, why isn't this like sovereign immunity?

[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.660]
Where courts only have such power to resolve

[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:11.880]
disputes and claims that is expressly given to it by the legislature

[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.480]
Where if the legislature in this state says courts are not to decide claims in excess of $100,000

[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.300]
Those are matters that are taken to the legislature and the claims bill

[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.820]
Well, hasn't this an hour this to that because what I would respectfully suggest your honor is that the

[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.820]
legislature has provided this court

[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.740]
With the authority to interpret the to interpret these laws

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.880]
Whenever the legislature passes a law

[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:45.780]
What the legislature is doing is passing a law that is known to be going to be interpreted by the courts

[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.100]
That is in terms of

[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.800]
Section 168

[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:59.060]
This is a law that the legislature did not say we're only going to apply this law to non-presidential elections

[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:05.720]
Prior to this case, I don't think anyone would have contemplated that this law did not apply to presidential

[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:12.980]
And certainly no one not this court and not either party so contemplated the last time we were here before the court

[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:20.700]
This is a situation in which you have a statute that the legislature has passed that provides very specific remedies

[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:28.680]
And we think that those remedies are the remedies this court has the jurisdiction to enforce both in terms of a

[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.500]
Review and under its original

[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.400]
Mandamus authority. This is not a situation in which the Constitution of the United States has said a

[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.020]
State legislature has to sit as a judicial body in enforcing the laws or the spectral elections

[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:50.920]
It is merely said that the legislature can specify the manner of appointment of the electors

[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:58.620]
Incidentally the manner of appointment not the time of appointment the time of appointment is something that is reserved

[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.840]
For Congress and we would suggest that Congress has set that time and that time is November 7th

[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.780]
So if you agree that when the United States Supreme Court

[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:16.560]
It said that there is plenary power in the appointment of electors in the state legislature

[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.280]
That that means that they've got full power

[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.540]
Well, you're on I think they have the plenary power to determine the manner of the selection

[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:33.960]
Um, I don't think they've got the plenary power to determine the time choosing because that under the United States Constitution is reserved to Congress of the United States

[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.100]
And the Congress of the United States has selected the time of choosing which was November 7th

[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:46.380]
So I think there is a distinction between the time that the electors have to be chosen and the manner that they've been chosen

[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.000]
Um the legislature of this state of course

[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:57.520]
Selected the manner in which electors were were to be chosen and that manner was by direct election by the people

[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:05.200]
Um and pursuant to that decision by the state legislature and the decision by the Congress of the United States

[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.360]
That the time of that selection must be November 7th there was an election on November 7th

[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.560]
And we think that is the issue that is before the court now which is a contest of that election

[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.140]
where we have identified

[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.680]
Separately five groups of ballots

[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:31.900]
That we believe either should have been received and were not or in one case were received and should not have been

[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:39.740]
Under specific Florida state law if we accept this your jurisdictional position we get across the the jurisdictional issue

[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.140]
The concept of rejection of legal vote is somewhat concerning

[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.600]
And we can look to other states New Jersey as a similar although not identical

[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.560]
And the application becomes pretty clear when individuals are prohibited from tendering and ballot

[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.280]
However it becomes lesser

[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.980]
When there is something with regard to how that ballot is read

[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.940]
Here you're challenging it seems a category of under votes

[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:11.400]
And that's not the same as one person coming to the precinct seeking to

[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.040]
To vote if the category exists that seems

[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.740]
As though it must exist statewide

[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:24.860]
If we have under votes in one location and those are considered then you've demonstrated that there's legal votes

[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.760]
That have not been counted

[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:35.240]
Why would that not exist in other counties and why would this not require if any judicial relief that be applied in a statewide

[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.880]
Undervote I think there are two questions there. Let me try to address them separately the first question

[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:51.200]
Is whether a rejection on legal votes applies to the undervote category or whether it only applies when somebody comes to vote and is turned away

[00:13:51.720 --> 00:14:00.420]
I think going back 1917 in Darby against state this court has looked at the rejection of legal votes category as meaning where

[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.180]
Somebody has come submitted a ballot

[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.540]
But for some reason that ballot has not been counted in the early days

[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.720]
It was often that the expats was on the wrong side the paper or underneath the

[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:22.100]
Electors name or maybe it was circled instead of crossed out and in each case this court held that that was a rejection of a legal vote

[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.340]
Where the intent of the voter could be made clear

[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:34.520]
Jumping from the early days to the most recent case which is the bedroom case in that case the court looked at ballots

[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:40.980]
That these were optical ballots not punch card ballots, but they were optical ballots that had been defectively marked

[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.220]
That is they had not been used in number two pencil. They've been circled or filled in a name

[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:54.960]
But in some way they had been defectively marked so they could not be machine red and this court held that those ballots could not be rejected

[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.100]
So I think that in terms of what constitutes a rejection of legal votes and to one thing is you always

[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.400]
Just sorting but why does that not have statewide application?

[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.800]
You are I think that it does have statewide application if anybody

[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:18.420]
Contests ballots other than in the particular categories that we have contested about

[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.600]
Judge Salis in his order referred to the opinion of the attorney general that indicated that if this type of

[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:32.100]
Result happen that they would be serious or potential federal and state constitutional

[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.580]
Questions and and that the vote would be in jeopardy

[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:43.960]
Rana, I think there's a two two points of that first if merely having a manual recount in some areas and not in others

[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:52.000]
Would make the election effective then this election would already be effective because there were manual recounts in a number of counties

[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.480]
That were included in the certified results of the secretary of state

[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.500]
Second with respect to the attorney general's opinion. I think that opinion

[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:10.300]
Was pointed to the plight to the point that if a manual recount was requested and received in one place and requested and not received

[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.260]
pursuant to state law in another case

[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.880]
That would involve the disparity. I don't think that opinion addresses the situation where

[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.040]
You have a request in certain counties, but no request in other counties

[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.440]
There's never been a suggestion under the state law that you should have a recount where it was not requested

[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.500]
But this guy go ahead mr. Boyson

[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.100]
The 168 in his present form has only been there since 1999

[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:43.540]
Now this court said in 1981 that there's no common law right to

[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.720]
Contest boats that that

[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.360]
Judicial restraint should be exercised because of the fact that

[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:59.000]
Elections are political questions. We said in board right before that

[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.960]
That the

[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.240]
We would get involved courts would get involved if there were allegations of fraud

[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.800]
Now we lowered that threshold somewhat

[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.440]
and

[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:19.460]
And bextra by saying that that we would get involved of courts would get involved if there was substantial non-compliance with

[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:28.800]
Election laws, but that aren't what was you're asking this court to do is to have the courts this state get involved in

[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:35.440]
Any instance in which someone comes in and merely alleges that there would there needs to be a count

[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.080]
Because there were legal votes left out

[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.180]
Now I've gone through the canvassing boards, but legal votes left out

[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.760]
And then that and that would have to do in election someone would save they left they lost

[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.500]
130,000 votes in date county and we'd have to count the court count those votes

[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.820]
You're right. I don't think that's what we're arguing

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.340]
Um, this is not a situation in which somebody has simply come in and said

[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.900]
We've lost we'd like to have a recount under the contest statute

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.120]
This is a situation in which we have identified specific votes

[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:20.380]
Many of which were agreed by the district court were votes in which you could clearly discern the voters intent

[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.740]
You had 215 vows that are not included in the certified results in Palm Beach County

[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.380]
Where the circuit court found on undisputed evidence that there was a clear

[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.100]
voter

[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.560]
Intent expressed on those ballots and they were not counted

[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:42.620]
Got 168 ballots in date county that were counted before that county prematurely stopped his count

[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:49.500]
Where the circuit court found that that these were ballots that expressed the voters intent that the

[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.920]
Canvassing board had properly identified those ballots

[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.420]
So these are ballots where we know that if you look at the under votes

[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:07.380]
You find balanced that can clearly have a discernible intent of the voter found from them and yet they're not counted

[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:14.480]
Uh, this is a situation in which the evidence is clear and undisputed that there are

[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.080]
voter errors and machine errors that create this under voting punch card equipment

[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.300]
In fact the court found the district court the the trial court found at page 10 of the opinion

[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.760]
That this wasn't had been known to county officials for many years

[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:38.660]
So you this is not a situation in which you simply have somebody coming in and saying there's a we lost and want to have another chance at it

[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.220]
This is what do you contend then as the standard

[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:49.820]
But you have that we have to apply to this in order to get a recount there are two issues here

[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:55.760]
One is whether or not you demonstrated you were entitled to a recount of those 9,000 votes

[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.840]
The other issue is whether or not you would

[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.760]
Actually win the contact which I think are two different issues

[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.980]
So what is the standard to apply to the first one that is

[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:13.460]
Are you entitled to a recount and what did you demonstrate to the trial court that you

[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:23.140]
Contend to us demonstrate that entitlement we demonstrated first that there were a large number of ballots that were not counted

[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.980]
By the punch card machines we demonstrated second that

[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:36.000]
When you have a very close election you have to have a manual review of those ballots in order to have an accurate talent

[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.460]
That was not just our expert that was their expert mr. Aiman who testified that you had to have a

[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.580]
Manual recount in a close election

[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:52.820]
So why wouldn't that apply to all the other counties at least the punch card counties where

[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.240]
There are undervotes and those votes also

[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.220]
Haven't been counted if we're looking for accuracy

[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.040]
Which is what has been

[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.500]
The statement from day one then why haven't

[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:12.300]
The why isn't the request made and why wouldn't it be proper for any court if there's an order any relief

[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.760]
To count the undervotes in all of the counties

[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:22.480]
Where the very least punch card systems were operating in other words. There's something different about day

[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:29.940]
Frowered and Palm Beach and their use of the punch card then the 17 other counties that also use punch card

[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.720]
I think the first difference is that that's where ballots were contested

[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.000]
That's where first a manual recount was requested and that's where ballots were contested and

[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:45.980]
Throughout the interpretation not only the current version of 168 but prior versions of the contest statute

[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.540]
This and other courts have looked not at the entire

[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.860]
Type of ballot that may have been involved but only those ballots who were actually contested by a party

[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:02.920]
Had a statewide contest have we in this date? Well, I'm actually back in 1916 in the gubernatorial race

[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.440]
There was an attempt to bring a contest by mandamus to this court

[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.980]
But in the modern year. I think the court is right. You have not had a

[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.560]
Statewide contest, but the so are you saying make a distinction?

[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.200]
Is there a connection then between the protests?

[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.660]
These are the what you contested these ballots through through the original protest

[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:33.240]
So do you have to have done that in order to bring a contest a party could not bring a contest without having gone

[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:42.520]
Under section 166 previously. No, I think your honor a party could have brought a contest without having gone to 166 route

[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.260]
But think but not of the ballot

[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.320]
No, I think you could contest the ballots even if you had not protested the ballots

[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.860]
I think 168 and 166 are

[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:56.680]
alternative remedies and I think this court so held the last time we were before

[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.460]
That those are alternative remedies and I don't think in 166

[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.860]
Protests would be a condition however

[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.120]
Where there where there has been a protest

[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:08.700]
isn't

[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.900]
It isn't 168 and 166 or

[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.100]
Inextricably linked I mean what we've got okay. We have to do a commercial break

[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.620]
You're listening to oral arguments in front of the Florida Supreme Court and the Goros appeal

[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.460]
And they want to count the damn votes dammit 23 after 10 at 560 QAM

[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.700]
This is 560 QAM

This is God's House Group Inc.

[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.100]
It's the first for the standard 168 which has all a place in doubt

[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:45.040]
And is inconsistent with the way a trial goes which is that you look at the evidence before you reach that you or in your belt

[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.540]
I'm just as hard as one question

[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.060]
I tell the man looking at the ballots

[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:54.200]
I know they were introduced into evidence before the trial judge and I probably asked his question as an

[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.440]
I was going to say oh, but as a former

[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.160]
car judge

[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.120]
Did anyone ever pick up one of the ballots

[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.120]
And

[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:13.300]
Hold it up and show it to the judge and say this is an example of a ballot which was rejected but which a vote

[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:21.740]
Is reflected I'm not not a particular ballot runner. We offered the groupings of ballots that we had segregated

[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:28.060]
All of those of course in order to prevent contamination. We're not given to the lawyers. They were kept under the control

[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.380]
of the clerk of the court and

[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.460]
But nobody asked the court for permission to do that or showed

[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.560]
Him one of those one of those not an individual one although we did

[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.320]
tend to them in evidence and we did ask him

[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.980]
Feetively to look at the ballots as far to the outcome your deeply and your rebuttal term is to point

[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.300]
I'm sorry

[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.100]
Yeah

[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:53.900]
I

[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.920]
You're all micromancer. Let's get with it. Oh

[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:08.260]
You're welcome. Let's go let's get with directions. Yeah, please the court here. We go here go to bush people

[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.260]
Very rich here. I got it right here

[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.900]
George W. Bush and Richard Cheney Mr

[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:19.080]
Wish let me start with my question that I asked mr. Boyce when this case was here before

[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:19.400]
or

[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:29.800]
Council for mr. Bush is back not present in any argument on the Pearson versus Blacker yet when it got this framework council

[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.400]
for mr. Bush

[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.340]
Of course we argue the Pearson versus backer now. I know

[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:41.220]
A blacker now. I know that it's no it's not argued again here. Is it

[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.940]
Position of mr. Bush that that case does not have any bearing on this matter? Oh, you're on

[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.440]
I think that the case has substantial bearing on the matter

[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.700]
I think that would my first and b blacker tells us

[00:25:52.360 --> 00:26:02.440]
Is exactly as your honor suggested it which is bad this court does not have the ability in this particular case involving president of electors

[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.740]
To disregard the statutory scheme and fashion of remedy based upon extraordinary

[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:15.740]
equitable powers of the court said forth in the constitution. Do we have the right to review the action of the circuit court?

[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.900]
Indeed you do your honor, but we come here

[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:24.740]
In a significantly different posture than we did before what we come here with now

[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:31.160]
Is relied by the nature of the litigants and the public interest in fact

[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:38.160]
This is nothing more than a garden variety appeal from a final judgment by a lower court that reviewed

[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:45.680]
After an entire full evidentiary hearing but the legislature having plenary power said that the

[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:52.260]
Circuit court will make that determination. Well, I agree with you here honor and I would not suggest to this court that the circuit court

[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.940]
Is not subject to any appeal. I believe that the circuit court is subject to appeal

[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:03.440]
But in a very limited fashion and I also think that one reason that we have not placed

[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:11.400]
Emphasis upon the person versus blacker is because in fact this court said the same thing in an earlier McPherson case

[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.680]
Which just as well

[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:19.780]
Referred to McPherson versus Flynn in which this court said since there is no common law right to contest elections

[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:27.520]
Any statutory grant must necessarily be construed to court grant only such rights as are explicitly set out

[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:35.860]
By the legislature the legislature in section 168 has given us five and only five grounds for an election contest

[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:40.680]
And one of them is not that there is a close election in which

[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.820]
Vogue thematic machines are used to the bottom the bottom worrying if I understand that though of your

[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:53.280]
Answer to the chief justice this question is that this court does have a palliative jurisdiction over the trial court

[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.660]
Truly is the one to understand that to be your answer. I think that this court has limited a palliative jurisdiction over in the

[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:07.300]
Pearson case the federal McPherson case not this court's from Pearson case does not affect that a palliative jurisdiction

[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:15.560]
No, sir. I believe that I certainly believe that this court has the ability to review what a circuit court did to determine whether the circuit court

[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:21.880]
violated the traditional rules much in the way we would be reviewing it if it was another of

[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:29.680]
County commissioner or an election for some other office a member of Congress in a contest was brought

[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:36.180]
Precisely or honor the court is the great level or in the sense that it doesn't make any difference whether we're talking about

[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.880]
School teachers and waivers or presidents and kings the rules of the same

[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:45.000]
And the rules in this case are very clear. There are two questions that this court must answer

[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.940]
Was their substantial competent evidence in the record below to support the judges findings and did the judge properly apply

[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.460]
Long established law

[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.040]
referring referring to the substantial

[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.800]
confident evidence issue

[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.040]
Isn't highly unusual for a trial court to admit into evidence

[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:13.580]
Certain documents that the one party claims will be controlling which reference to the claim they bring to the court in yet never

[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.600]
Examine those documents before making their decision

[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.780]
And then that happened here with the trial court admitting the disputed ballots into evidence

[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:28.000]
But yet never looking at those documents. Well, I think that the trial court admitted

[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:35.040]
Theoretically admitted the ballot and ballots for the theoretically or did the decision mean the trial court either did or did not

[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.620]
The ballots in new evidence did the trial court admit those in evidence my recollection is that the trial court did

[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:46.760]
There were thousands of ballots which were which were embargoed and my recollection is that the trial court did

[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.860]
It was not a substantial dispute over whether or not the court could technically admit them into evidence did the trial court

[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.940]
Examined those documents know you're honored because I think there was no basis and law off of the trial court to do those

[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.640]
To do that until after the plaintiff had carried its burden of proving that there was some necessity to do so and this leads to the core of

[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.560]
Then what what is subsection eight mean the subsection that was

[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.160]
Specifically added in 1999 and even followed we've got to follow the statute

[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:23.060]
That the section that says that the circuit court is to do whatever is necessary to ensure

[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:29.300]
Which is rather unusual language to use in such a to ensure that each allegation in the complaint is

[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.420]
Investigated examined or checked

[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:38.460]
If it isn't to mean that the circuit court is to look at the very ballots that have been

[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.740]
brought to the court for investigation. What does that statute?

[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.580]
What does that section mean in the context of this litigation?

[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.780]
Your honor this brings us back to McPherson versus blacker

[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:58.440]
Neither the circuit court has no greater power than this court to disregard the scheme that the legislature has provided us with and that scheme is crystal clear

[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.860]
In fact this court recognized that 10 days ago in the Harris case when it said

[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:09.700]
The decision whether to conduct a manual recount he is vested in the sound discretion of the board

[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:15.460]
And cited hogan the hogan case was indeed precisely the same as this case

[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:22.540]
Was a case in which the canvassing board elected not to conduct the manual recount and this court

[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.740]
reference that case in which they said that the application of section 168

[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:36.200]
Does not change the necessity to show an abuse of discretion when it arrives at the court. We had an absolute

[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:45.160]
Failure on the part of the plaintiffs here this court gave the plaintiffs the opportunity to have a trial to prove their case

[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:52.600]
And it was an absolute failure in the record of this case to establish an abuse of discretion by any of the challenged canvassing boards

[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.740]
Well excuse me council you seem to be suggesting then

[00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:01.540]
That you can never have a contest unless what has occurred has already been through the protest

[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.300]
A process under 166

[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.320]
What would council do to circumstances that come to life

[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:15.200]
Later for example the precincts of one valve of the the ballots of one precinct just simply did not get included

[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.260]
In the certification that would not be part of the protest

[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.660]
situations where it comes to life that

[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.500]
Violence is used to keep people away from the polls that would not come to life during a protest

[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:31.540]
Are you suggesting that those kinds of circumstances then cannot be addressed under a contest?

[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.420]
No, sir. We don't find ourselves in that posture

[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:41.760]
We find ourselves in a posture in which canvassing boards to which the legislature has delegated the authority have made decisions

[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.460]
And this is no different than any of the hundreds of cases that come to our district courts of the field and

[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.260]
Ultimately sometimes to this court in which an administrative agency given discretion has

[00:32:52.260 --> 00:33:00.160]
Exercise the discretion and the rule for time immemorial has been that the standard of review is whether or not

[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.820]
That agency has abused its discretion one of the highest standards known to the law

[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.360]
We have a ruling here. Do we not from a district court of appeal?

[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:15.080]
But on an application for mandatements that has said that the date county canvassing board had a mandatory duty

[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.300]
To continue the counting of the ballots once they decided to have a recount

[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.780]
And that only because it could not meet a filing date

[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.620]
Would they not grant a red of mandatements?

[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.300]
So indeed we have a review do we not of the very specific

[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:35.940]
Canvassing board that made a decision here and we have a legal ruling

[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.200]
By a district court of appeal as you say

[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.920]
That is held that they aired in that that they did have a mandatory obligation to continue the count

[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.760]
How can we overturn that ruling?

[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.920]
District court of appeal determined not to continue to count for two reasons

[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.740]
The first reason was that they were district court of appeal or sorry

[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.920]
The canvassing board determined not to continue to count for two reasons

[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.080]
The first reason was that after they had done the initial one percent three percent count

[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:09.020]
They found six votes difference in favor of vice president Gore

[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.300]
The canvassing board made the determination that based upon that six votes

[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:19.920]
There was no reason to believe that there would be a change in the result of the election

[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:26.060]
One of the critical elements of subsection 168 now that issue was tried

[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.580]
Before judge sol's and he resolved conflicting evidence in favor of the fact

[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.200]
Where is the reigning finding by judge sol's

[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:38.920]
That the reason that the recount was discontinued in date counting

[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.120]
Was because the canvassing board had initially decided

[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.640]
That there would be no merit to having a recount

[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.740]
There such a finding he does not make that finding but he does make the finding

[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:58.300]
That there would not have been a difference in the result and that was within his discretion to make that finding because he had conflicting evidence

[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:03.840]
We all agree that in the third district's opinion that they only set out that there was a single reason

[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:10.200]
A single reason for stopping the recount and that single reason was the inability to meet a deadline

[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.240]
Yes, sir, and I will address that reason as well

[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.200]
But have helped me with the the record in this case that we have

[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:26.160]
Where it shows a contrary finding or holding with that holding of the third district court of appeal

[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.680]
Well, let you know in other words where would I start in this record let me address both of your questions

[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.480]
And so let me begin with the one that you asked

[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.340]
The the canvassing board it is beyond dispute made the decision

[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:45.160]
Not to continue because they determined that once this court had said a deadline of November 26th that they could not possibly meet that deadline

[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:51.420]
Now I pause here to note that in retrospect they apparently made the right decision because Palm Beach County

[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:59.700]
Which is a smaller county was well into their count as of that time and was unable to meet that deadline and the law of this state from time in memorial

[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:06.760]
Says no no governmental agency and no person is required by law to engage in a few lack

[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:12.240]
That alone is sufficient to uphold the decision of the canvassing board because they clearly

[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:20.700]
One cannot say that reasonable men could not differ as would you hold that hold that thought for a moment because in our earlier decision

[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.060]
Interpreting the statutes with reference to the filing date

[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:30.740]
We in essence said that the secretary of state could refuse a filing

[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.920]
Okay, by a particular county only if one it would interfere

[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:45.800]
With the federal obligation to have the electors determined by a fixed state or two that it would interfere with a contest

[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.660]
Now has there been any showing in this case

[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:56.760]
That that either of those issues would applied to the decision by the canvassing board to stop their counting

[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.880]
Oh, sir, but this court also said you must have your votes and from until but November 26th the canvassing board

[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.360]
Have in made the decision was impossible had two choices

[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:12.000]
One was to not submit the certificate not to continue the count and the second was to send up a partial count

[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.900]
Which according to the evidence before the board would have cut off a substantial number

[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.180]
Not only of precincts that might have been significantly different from the result

[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:26.660]
But also that would have disenfranchised a particular minority within day county

[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.580]
One cannot say that reasonable men and women

[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:34.200]
Would not be able to differ as to the decision of that canvassing board

[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.720]
But the other point that I would like to make is that subsequent to the decision of the third district court of appeal

[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.080]
There was a trial and in that trial judge solves

[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:51.100]
Resolved conflicting evidence as to the question of whether in fact there would have been a change in the election regarding day county

[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.440]
And determined that there would not have been there was substantial

[00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:01.140]
Just if you keep on using the language that there should be a reasonable probability of a change and you've said that

[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:09.260]
Again, we've got to stick to the statute my reading of the statute says that it says sufficient to change or place him down

[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.620]
The results of the election

[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:17.080]
Place him down is a different standard and a reasonable probability of a different result. Do you agree with that?

[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.020]
I'm not sure justice perientee

[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:24.200]
But I don't think we need to address that issue at this time because there was virtually no evidence in the record

[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:30.180]
Upon which one could conclude there was no evidence of any single voting machine that that

[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:37.200]
Misoperated there was no evidence of any voter whose vote was was not properly recorded

[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.040]
Your position is that the in the contest

[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.160]
That

[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:50.540]
Errors or under voting as we've been referring to it is that is the failure of the machine to read a vote that might otherwise be

[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:57.980]
Properly cast for a candidate that it is not the role of the judiciary in a contest to evaluate

[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.500]
Undervotes is that your position today?

[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.760]
Well, my position is twofold the first one that one position

[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.680]
That is that you did that this election contest statute

[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.500]
Does not best within the judiciary the authority to review

[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.260]
Both that were properly cast but never counted

[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:27.060]
Well number one it is not the role of the judiciary to do so when a canvassing board has already done so and has made a reasonable decision

[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:34.160]
And that happened in Palm Beach County and I can conceive of no standard that this or any other court would impose upon the Palm Beach County

[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.940]
Canvassing board

[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:39.420]
It's referred as it was stay with day county where it's disputed that 9,000 votes

[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.080]
That have been the subject of requests since

[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:49.580]
November 9th have never been counted. Well, I think it is disputed Justice Barriani

[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:56.640]
All we know in in day county is that the voting apparatus which nobody proved was defected

[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.120]
Determined that 9,000 votes were not properly recorded

[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:08.020]
By the voter we know that in the first 20 percent that 434 or something more or less were

[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:13.300]
Legal votes were recovered. We've already said that we shouldn't challenge Palm Beach County

[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.480]
We know that somewhere between whether it's 174

[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.660]
215 votes were recovered and

[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.180]
Foured counties whose certification has been included has

[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.040]
several hundred votes all with the same type of machine

[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.260]
Are you really saying that for votes the 9,000 votes in

[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:36.580]
Dayed county which are the exact same votes that were looked at in Palm Beach County and Broward County

[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:41.800]
Should not be looked at in the contest action not at this point. You're on our for two reasons

[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:49.180]
The first is that the canvassing board made the judgment that at the deadline that this court

[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.420]
Said for everybody they could not conceivably complete their count

[00:40:53.420 --> 00:41:00.700]
And I would suggest to this court that based upon what the Florida legislature has told us that they did not have the authority to submit a

[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:08.840]
Farshall count only a full count and had they done so they probably would have violated the federal voting rights act and the United States

[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:16.960]
Constitution that's the first reason and this court has no basis in this record to determine that the canvassing board abused its

[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.180]
The square can make in that position let me get an understanding of what

[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:27.000]
Your position is that we're talking about when we say an under vote

[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:34.020]
Are these these vote these ballots been sent through the machine?

[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.500]
Have your honor

[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:43.060]
I got from reading somewhere that whoa hey very good joke of the tele-heisting talk to Florida's

[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.820]
Just like that is it

[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:54.520]
Our ballots which have not been manually counted is that correct your honor the record indicates that every one of these votes was sent through the machine

[00:41:54.520 --> 00:42:01.740]
They were rejected by the machine because of the parameters that had been said the machine determined that the votes had not been properly

[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.480]
Mark on the ballots

[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:10.160]
Well, that goes to that goes to the rejection issue you would agree with that is that that you're saying that they've gone through the equipment

[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.580]
So therefore they were not rejected is that is that a fair reading of your argument? Yes, your honor

[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:21.660]
It's to the angle the one next statement. Unless let's say you want to step further if if that is not accept or is it's contrary to floor to law

[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.060]
that

[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:33.620]
Those are considered to be rejected do you do you agree with the the standards that have been applied in other states with regard to very similar statutory

[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:39.960]
Language as to what you do to determine if there could be a change in the election or

[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.100]
As to the result

[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.180]
In the election I look to see as to first just whether there's enough votes that we're not counted

[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.760]
Not as to who they would be for you agree with that standard

[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.280]
I don't agree that it applies under these circumstances here are

[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.300]
The standard is where I'm looking to

[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.600]
Do you disagree with that standard or what standard would you have applied if you assume that they were rejected?

[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.760]
How does one prove that there would have been a change in result or doubt as to the result?

[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:14.500]
Well, if we are in a if we are in a circumstance in which it is appropriate to look at ballots

[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:19.400]
Then it is the job of the canvassing board to do precisely what the Palm Beach canvassing board did

[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.860]
And that is to use the standard that the Palm Beach canvassing board use now

[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.660]
For us here to point out that it's our belief that the Palm Beach stand in

[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.960]
Canvassing board violated federal law because they changed the rule in midstream

[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.000]
And in fact should not have counted any gimpils, but having said that

[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.120]
Assuming that you are going to make a decision you use the standard that the polling case used and that this court

[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:48.420]
By reference to pull and adopt it as the appropriate standard the record suggests that that's exactly what the Palm Beach canvassing board did

[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.620]
But we never reached that stage

[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:58.200]
There are 64 counties in the state of Florida that did no manual recount and what mr. Voices suggesting is that every one of those counties

[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.800]
Simply because they had a

[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:06.900]
Punch card system must automatically do a manual recount and the speaking of the standard of evaluating the ballot

[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:12.820]
Yeah, I'm speaking of the stand with regard to how does one demonstrate that there that there would be

[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.680]
sufficient to change your place and doubt

[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:20.760]
For example, you Jersey seems to suggest that in interpreting a very similar statute

[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.660]
That you were looked at to see if there's enough votes there and assume that they would be for the challenging candidate

[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.940]
And that is enough to place that it could change the results are you suggesting a different standard than that?

[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.780]
No, I think the standards are the same standard of burden that every plaintiff carries in every case

[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:44.900]
Which is to come into court and to prove that there is something wrong with some ballot or some machine somewhere

[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.980]
And that there are enough of those that we can say that whatever we call it

[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.960]
It would place the election in doubt

[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.580]
This plaintiff did not do so

[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:57.080]
Well, I do accept that first poem that Justice Lewis is

[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:03.500]
Ask you if you have agreed with and at least a non-nature whether it seems that you have said that you do agree with

[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.060]
And that is that other courts have said

[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:09.460]
At first you have to show that there are a sufficient number

[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.600]
Of contested or challenged or questionable ballots that would make a difference

[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.680]
Now if you do accept that standard that has been set out in some other state of court's decisions

[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.000]
Wouldn't you agree that at least that and for that preliminary

[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:32.780]
Step that the the plaintiffs here have met that that is they have submitted that there are like 9,000 or whatever the number is

[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:39.600]
Challenge ballots and that there is a difference in the outcome of the election that is presently made only in

[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:45.620]
Conference of ballots so at least that preliminary step of saying the number of challenge ballots

[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:51.960]
Would quote a place in question the outcome of the election that they've at least met that preliminary step. Oh, sorry

[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.620]
I'm fatically disagree with that

[00:45:53.620 --> 00:46:00.420]
Are indeed disagree on the basis of applying that standard or does this agree on the basis that they haven't met that standard

[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:05.800]
They have not met their burden of proof and the reason is the only thing they did was put two witnesses

[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:11.460]
Understand to say that they were speculating that voter-matic machines are inherently unreliable

[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:17.280]
And so in essence what mr. Boyz is saying to this court is anytime there's a voter-matic machine in a close election

[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.040]
And somebody says count all the ballots you must do so this court in the flood delk several days ago

[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:30.120]
Said that voter confusion and voter mistake is not sufficient to throw out a ballot as talk sure as a question

[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.280]
Just fan stairs question

[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.740]
seemingly early on

[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:37.980]
Judge Saul

[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.780]
Set a

[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.120]
threshold and said that in effect that

[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.280]
All the plaintiffs could not prevail

[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.480]
Even if no evidence was put on until they met this threshold and

[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.060]
Ultimately he decided that he did not have to look at

[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.420]
The ballots because that threshold is that been that is that correct?

[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.680]
um

[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.780]
What did you see that threshold being?

[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:21.820]
Well, it's been the same as every plaintiff carries in every case and that is to bring in sufficient evidence to meet the elements of the case in this instance

[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:27.760]
To show that there was any reason to believe that any voter was denied the right to vote

[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.120]
Because of something other than the voters own fault

[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:38.620]
There was not a single shred of evidence in this case on a single voter to show that there was nothing here

[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:45.740]
But the speculation of two witnesses that voter-matic machines do not always show the voters intent that's all

[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:51.000]
Is that standard that you have to show that the mistake was made

[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:57.540]
Through no fault of the voter and it seems to me that that we've gotten off of

[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:03.820]
What the standard is for showing the rejection of votes and and it seems to me that the statute

[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.700]
subsection three says that rejection of votes which

[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.480]
May put and doubt

[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:16.540]
Resolve of the election and so that is not that you have to demonstrate

[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:21.180]
That the election really that aren't going to win

[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.940]
But it is in doubt that I that I did not win

[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:33.820]
So isn't that a different standard? I I'm really having a problem with the reasonable probability of a different result

[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:41.700]
Standard the judge solves talks about versus the rejection of votes that would put the the election endout

[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:48.340]
Because they explain the difference in the truth. I don't think it's a necessary for us to distinguish given the

[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:55.660]
Razor-thin record we have in this case the only way that one can conclude that either of those standards

[00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:03.400]
Was not met in this case based upon this record is to conclude that in every case in which a

[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:10.740]
Voting-matic machine is used and the race is close that we must manually recount in every county that used those machines

[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:15.540]
Because that's what the evidence was that was used in this case. We better get Mr. Glock a chance

[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:20.040]
If I may or honors is just one other issue too that I think we cannot lose sight

[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.160]
I want to warn council. We're we're going to observe our time limits here

[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:33.460]
So you and mr. Locker see I would just will take one second your honor and that is that you also have to establish the second element

[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:39.000]
Which is that it whenever standard you use it would have changed the result of the election

[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.320]
If you look at the evidence here and you look at the

[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:48.980]
lower court judges determination no matter which standard you use it was insufficient evidence

[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:56.480]
To indicate that and this court cannot reverse the lower court judge unless there is a

[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:02.380]
Complete lack of substantial competent evidence in the record to support his decision regardless of the standard

[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:07.720]
Thank you. Okay. I'm very richard borderline out of control 1054 560 WQAM

[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:15.900]
This is 560 QAM 420 560 WQAM Miami Court Lauderdale of Beasley

[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.080]
Rodcast group station

[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:24.020]
Then you run a foul section 5 and the safe harbor

[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:29.660]
And that's it's holding that that the interpretation or construction of a sentence is a change in law

[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:37.900]
But because probably for the first time if if a dispute arises somebody must say if the legislature is written the sentence in two sides

[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.440]
Don't agree

[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:44.220]
It it seems as though a court must try to do its best to see what that legislature wanted done

[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.540]
But Justice Lewis does just so much baggage the word interpretation can carry on its back

[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.620]
Before it becomes more of a change than is an interpretation and that's the situation we have here

[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:57.360]
And not unfairly to the court again the court was dealing with the situation in front of it

[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.720]
But interpretation going from seven days to 19 days

[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.780]
That's a lot of baggage for the word to carry in that regard

[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:08.600]
I think that the Harris decision was bottomed on a number of principles common law principles

[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.400]
Equal principles constitutional principles, but forget all of that if you want to if you want to try to go back to just

[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.620]
statutory construction you have a problem because the interpretation is sufficiently broad

[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:25.260]
That I think fairly viewed the constitutes a change in the law under section five of title three

[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.340]
The only measure today just looking at 168

[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:34.300]
I that's what I'm looking at is the one sentence that seems to be the really dispute here and that is whether

[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:42.260]
Legal votes were rejected and it would have made or or or change the result or place in doubt the result now

[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:48.860]
Is it impossible for this court to apply that to the facts that we had without doing a change in the law?

[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:54.020]
Yes, Your Honor because the problem is is that you have to create a pile of law to do it

[00:51:54.020 --> 00:52:01.080]
You have to do a number of things you have to first find that in a presidential race where you are electing 27 electors

[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.420]
That you can do it on a county by county basis

[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:10.340]
Then you have to figure out a way of having the contest statute used to establish a standard when the only standard that applied

[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:17.440]
Anywhere for manual recount which as we argued before the court previously was limited to the situations in 166

[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.660]
Which were brought about because of mechanical problems

[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:27.280]
But put that aside the only basis and as they hoors the common law obviously to have a manual recount is in section 166

[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.860]
And that closed for finding the voters in 10

[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:35.660]
But it also adds three specific people that are on a uniform basis throughout the state

[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:40.860]
The combination of whatever the voters intent is plus the three people is what is done there

[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:48.620]
We go from there to a circuit judge in Leon County who then I suppose has to come up with a standard that is not articulated in the law

[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:54.160]
And as your honor pointed out each time you ask the question you talked about legislation in other states

[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:59.960]
That's where it has to come from there is no indication that the Florida legislature intended by

[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:08.160]
acknowledging and respecting the power of the state judiciary to interpret laws that the judiciary would be in a position of having to create

[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.200]
The standards that would be applied in this kind of situation

[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:16.860]
And that's what you have your your time as a thanks very much my mom is the choice

[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:23.000]
I will give you one extra minute since mr. blocks answer that question. Thank you. I'll see

[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:30.120]
Let me begin by emphasizing what I think all three counsel have spoken today agree on first is that this court has

[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.640]
First section over this case

[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.300]
Second that 168 applies to presidential elections

[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:42.600]
Third point that I think there is a agreement on and that is that this court should not change the law

[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.280]
It may have to interpret the law that exists. It should not change the law

[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:47.720]
Mr

[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:53.800]
Let me let me ask you by another that the part of that us supreme court in you know Monday that

[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.640]
Mr

[00:53:54.640 --> 00:54:03.640]
Clock just referred to and that is that the us supreme court did say that a legislative wish to take advantage of the safe harbor

[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:10.740]
Would counsel against any construction election code that Congress might be deemed to be a change in the law

[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.000]
However, doesn't that also

[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:19.140]
Mean that if we're going to have it take advantage of section five

[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:24.940]
That all of these contests have to be concluded as you told me before

[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:32.920]
When we were here before by December the 12th and we don't have a remedy here that can do that

[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.260]
By December the 12th

[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.580]
Your Honor, I think you do have a remedy that can do that by December 12th. I think first

[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:47.460]
Almost almost all of the issues in terms of number of issues although not in terms of number of the ballots are

[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.640]
Now legal issues before the court the 215th

[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:58.700]
Balance in net net votes for vice president Gore has already been identified as legal votes by the Palm Beach

[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.280]
Canvassing Board and are not disputed by the defense

[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.540]
On that there was in

[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.420]
I said governor Bush's brief a

[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:17.120]
Reference to an audited return that showed 174 and since numbers seem to be pretty critical here when there's such a small difference

[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.060]
you agree that it was that later

[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.260]
Number from Palm Beach County

[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:30.540]
We don't agree to it, but even even their offer of proof which was submitted after the trial was over and which is where that number comes from

[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.000]
I think only related to the numbers submitted as of 5 p.m

[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.620]
The 215 number is a number that goes through 90 minutes

[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:43.340]
Afterwards when they completed their count and that information's in this record

[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:49.200]
That's in the record it's in the Palm Beach answer to paragraph 60 of the complaint and it was in

[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.300]
Mr. Judge Burton

[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.780]
Test of testimony

[00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:00.320]
At page 278 of the trial transfer the only reason that was rejected was because

[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:04.320]
The deadline that this court has said of November 25th for the certification

[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:09.220]
Yes, and as this court said in Harris the certification is one process

[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:15.300]
But the contest is another process if those votes existed and had never been certified or never been counted

[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:20.880]
But we knew those votes were there under the contest procedure. They would have to be included

[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.820]
Let me ask you another question realizing time you short

[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:32.120]
But going back to a couple of the questions if just a saluest ask about the purpose of this particular provision

[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:38.740]
In the contest statue as far as legal votes not being counted or illegal votes of the encounter

[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:46.120]
Why do you think it would be that the legislature would set out a totally different scheme for recounts

[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.380]
That to be decided by local

[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:53.860]
Canvas in boards in one section and therefore have a procedure in place

[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:58.860]
for recounts and under votes and that kind of thing and yet

[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.420]
Still reserved in a contest statue

[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:08.100]
allowing a circuit court to do it all over again or or to do it to do it in any case

[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:12.200]
Does that really does that really make sense in an overall

[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:17.960]
scheme here i want you to address that question and in my second question to you is

[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:24.800]
Why wouldn't we conclude here that it most all that you have demonstrated in the trial court

[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:32.880]
Is a possibility that there may be a difference in the outcome because as you have conceded no one has looked at the

[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.880]
9,000 votes that you're talking about could you answer those two questions

[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.840]
With respect to the reason for 166 and 168

[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.220]
We believe that 168 was intended by the legislature to

[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:52.160]
promote the certification process to get that process done and that's the responsibility of the

[00:57:52.160 --> 00:58:00.080]
Canocy boards has this court held in Harris once that certification is done the responsibility shifts from the canocy boards to the courts

[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.960]
Now there aren't very many contests

[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.600]
Usually people accept the results of the canocy boards

[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.320]
You have a contest only when some party believes that they've got

[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:17.800]
The reason and that goes to the second question that you asked and that is why do we believe we've we've shown what we've

[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:22.800]
What we're showing and we've shown the 215 and the 168 that gets you up to 300

[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.020]
You still have to get to the day county

[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.720]
votes do you not know

[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.520]
But at that point you're down to a hundred votes, Your Honor

[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:33.360]
Well, when you get when you get to the day county votes you're down to a hundred votes

[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:39.660]
And remember day county was finding about one out of every four under votes to be a vote

[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:46.300]
But master under under procedure for the five more if we're looking at this through the protest statute

[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:53.360]
Then it's it's certain that the only recount manual recount that there could be done

[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:01.280]
The under the statute would be to recount all the ballots that's specifically what statutes as is it not?

[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.320]
I you're a real recount manually recount all the ballots

[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:11.100]
But the day county board had done is to say before they stopped on on November 22nd

[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.360]
They had decided what they were going to do is count all the under votes

[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:18.260]
We think that would have been an exception that was definitely be a change in the law

[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:26.120]
Because the statute says they can only if they decide upon a manual recount manually recount all the balance

[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.440]
But I I think that's right, Your Honor

[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.020]
I think that you could interpret the law that way

[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:36.620]
I think you would also interpret the law in the sense of saying all the ballots that were requested to be manually recounted

[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:41.980]
If neither party requested the others to be manually recounted and if the machine was recording votes

[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:47.240]
I don't think you would necessarily under that statute have to interpret it that you would have to do that

[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.720]
In any of them the court blow rule that the

[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:54.880]
Pop the day county board had discretion to make the decisions that it made

[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:02.560]
One of the decisions that it made that the district court blows trial court blows that it had a discretion to make was the decision to

[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:09.020]
Simply manually recount the under votes and they stopped only because they didn't have time

[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.560]
And is that a disputed on this record?

[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:19.700]
Or can you agree with Mr. Richard and follow here that is that he says that that is not the only reason

[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.920]
That there was not a recount and date count on I don't think there's any other reason on the record, Your Honor

[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:32.000]
First man named a question whether to do a manual recount they then decided to do a manual recount

[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.400]
They were undertaking a manual recount and the morning of December 22

[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:42.460]
They said they were going to manually recount all of the under votes. They then stopped 12 hours later

[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:48.120]
Is that transcript of the all three of those decisions by the date county

[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.000]
I think the icing board and the record it is it is your honor speaking of time

[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.120]
And going back to what just as well as was asking

[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:00.200]
In terms of the remedy and now specifically as to the Miami-Dade

[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:06.120]
Fodes that you are contesting what is the time we're we're here today December 7th

[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.940]
What is the time parameter for being able to

[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.900]
complete account of those

[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.580]
Under votes the record shows that that the Camercy boards were doing about 300 an hour

[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.620]
250 to 300 an hour

[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:27.240]
That was with three people looking at every ballot that was obviously slower than it would be if it were being done by

[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.380]
By one judicial officer

[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.140]
We believe these ballots can be

[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.260]
Accounted in the time available

[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.520]
Obviously time is getting very short

[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.040]
We have been trying to get these ballots counted as this court knows

[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.460]
For for for many weeks now with the chief's indulgence of one last question and then really

[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:48.700]
ties in

[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.380]
Actually the truth

[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.380]
I'm not before the court in the first oral argument that we had here

[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.240]
That is of this problem that

[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.620]
Continues to reoccur in the case

[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.420]
Of not having recounts in other counties

[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:10.120]
Where the same voting mechanism were used and the way there may have been under votes

[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.220]
But that the proportion of votes for instance may have favored your opponent and

[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:21.920]
That we we we're now here on December the 7th with December the 12th you know fast approaching

[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.140]
At the last proceeding

[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.660]
Nighter side

[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:35.960]
Took us up on whether it was an offer or not at least it was a concern of the court in terms of the appearance of fairness or equity

[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:40.680]
But it's quite how can we resolve an issue like that at this late date

[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.100]
two-point-chiron first

[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:43.660]
Um

[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:49.700]
There's never been a rule that says you have to recount all the ballots in election contest

[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:57.380]
In fact every case that we cited has has been a case including the vex from case or only the contested ballots

[01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:01.420]
You were reviewed to make a different rule would be a change in the law

[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:06.660]
The second point is that every party has a white to contest

[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.580]
But no party is required to contest

[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:15.980]
What the sense seems to be is that somehow governor Bush's governor Bush's campaign should be

[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:20.420]
Protected from governor Bush's lawyers that they didn't ask for a recount and therefore

[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:24.980]
There should be a recount anyway, even if they didn't ask for it. Thank you, Mr. Voice

[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.500]
I think your your time is up. We very much appreciate

[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:33.340]
All counsel's assistance in the court

[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:42.200]
It's resolution of this matter now per the instructions at the beginning if there one will remain seated until

[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.320]
counsel and the parties have exited the building and then

[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.340]
We ask that you'd be

[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.760]
Received in an orderly way and we okay

[01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:01.720]
God it's 11 after 11 at 560 WQ and 50 there you go to four supreme court good job, Neil

[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:06.120]
Thank you. We did a pretty damn good job. Thanks to our sales department. We're not having too much on the log today

[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.480]
Especially when you're in this holiday time of the year. Oh, I'm excited without him couldn't the amount of what I you guys done there

[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.480]
Because you'd be the best they are fantastic. Just when you need a lot of extra time

[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.880]
plenty of open spaces there

[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.720]
Anyway coast to show that we're really learning fast voter errors repeated in election in Fort Lauderdale. Do you see this?

[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.920]
This is just yesterday

[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:30.660]
Our two days ago in the tiny low turnout race Tuesday for a city commission seat

[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:36.120]
86 voters made the effort to go to the polls of road absentee only to have their votes count for nobody at all

[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:41.020]
The ballots were disqualified because voters either punched for more than one candidate

[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:48.500]
For no candidate or even after all the public discussion of the presidential election they managed only to dimple a Chad

[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.360]
This was two days ago. This is on Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale

[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:58.480]
Carlton Moore won the race to represent the northwest and southwest communities in Fort Lauderdale

[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.600]
But he nearly avoided a runoff with Deborah Brown Frederick the 86 votes had they've been for one of his three opponents

[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.240]
Would have robbed them of his outweighed victory and forced to run off

[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.580]
What it really shows is it's been very appropriate for the return of the supervisor of elections more said

[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:17.660]
Referring to supervisor Jane Carroll returns at the end of the year the two-day special election was the Lancet Carroll's Broward County career

[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.220]
Thank God

[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.820]
We've had an antiquated system in place too long

[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:25.900]
And it's time for the voters of Broward County and the state to further modernization the voting process said more to which I say

[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.400]
Hey man nice going there

[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.840]
Carlton Moore or Clayton Moore or whoever that was the lone ranger

[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:37.000]
Isn't that pathetic two days ago and there's still punch in more than one name and there's still dimpling and pimpling

[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.140]
Because number one you got a lot of stupid people and number two because we have an antiquated ridiculous

[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.860]
We are holding all elections in this state in most places in this country

[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.460]
And they can stand up there and they can argue all they want from roughly at a time

[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.300]
There's not no equitable way in the spurs that would a clock running along the way

[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.040]
They could have counted the votes not only in Dade County and Palm Beach County

[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.420]
But in every county in the state they could have counted them ten times

[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.920]
With all they screw in around it's been going on

[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.520]
So obviously they run out the clock strategy the bush people's been very very effective

[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:14.340]
And then of course the Florida legislature now they're looking in the back ground or in the foreground now you see that last night

[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.460]
That Tom Feney boy. He just Tom don't call me delay Feney

[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:24.780]
He is one step away from Tom delay he is and does anybody believe him or

[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.200]
John the K anybody believe them about oh no because the courts could they could recount the votes in Gorka

[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.220]
Would by 20,000 votes like the Harold said he did

[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:37.120]
And you think that they're gonna certify a slate of electors for Gore under any circumstance?

[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.120]
No, no

[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:44.380]
And then they they could agri is that once they certify their slate of electors you know who signs that before they say in the Washington

[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.660]
Jeb don't call me a young brother bush

[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:52.620]
Any like that also sounds pretty kosher to me

[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.780]
820 votes on our poll yesterday after this close election to more he wish you had voted

[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:06.300]
Don't blame me. I did vote 662 80.7% of our very area-died audience

[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.040]
Yes, I didn't vote, but I wish I had 97 12.12% how does that make you feel now you 12%

[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:20.680]
Because there's 97 and if you say this is like one out of every I don't know 150 people that we have listening will get on these polls

[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.380]
That would be 97 that would be about 12,000 votes

[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:31.160]
And since about 70 ready percent of this audience supported Gore that would be see right there. There's the votes. There you go judge

[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.540]
You're gonna take it. Oh, sorry

[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.700]
And no, I still wouldn't vote even after all this 60 people said screw it 7.3%

[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.780]
Here's one lonely call mobile and court Lauderdale. Hello

[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.480]
Yeah, how you doing Neil? Okay, sure

[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.560]
You know, I worked for Jane Carol for numerous numerous years and uh

[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:55.300]
I just got to say the dinosaur is dead and uh, it's thank God it will be dead after this election

[01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:03.520]
Because see uh when she ran that office she ran it by the uh the whim of luck that this never happened before like to the extent that it's

[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:07.120]
Now, yeah, I mean it is incredible to think that this is not

[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:11.600]
You know, this controversy hasn't existed before to be degree that it exists now

[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.200]
And you notice once once she got onto robust mentality right there before Thanksgiving and once you got out of town

[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.140]
Everything moved along very well. They got all the votes counted and Bradwara wrapped it up and that was the end of it

[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:28.480]
Oh no doubt it this lady uh, she was a school teacher 32 years ago and she still has that type of mentality with regard to just

[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.380]
Like it's her way and education wise and she did run the office the way she pleases

[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:37.160]
She's autonomous. She can do what she wants. She doesn't have to answer to anybody

[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.640]
You know, she said she was stressed about from all this stuff and she shouldn't have ran four years ago

[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.300]
But I don't see her returning on 100,000 plus salaries. She got over the last four years

[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:51.960]
And I don't see her returning a 32-year pension to Brad County because she's stressed out

[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:58.100]
Why why is that male? I mean, why don't we have to work for these people in elected offices that our church dinosaur

[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:03.620]
And it's just like you know, were you working for your radio station where everything you know is backwards? Yeah

[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.760]
Why is that in Brad County? I'll just keep taking the money. Thanks

[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.980]
Well, just just to be glad she's on a way out

[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:15.020]
Bye-bye Jane. See and of course if dead County would wise up they would do the same with that David Leahy boy. Oh boy

[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:19.440]
He's an answer. He is of course if they say goodbye to him, he'd probably faint again, you know

[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.580]
Here's this great article in New York Times today by Bob Herbert in America. Keep them out

[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.520]
The tactics have changed, but the goal remains depressingly the same

[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.560]
Keep the colors the blacks the African Americans whatever they're called in the particular instance

[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:39.060]
Keep them out of the voting booths. Do not let them vote if you can find a way to stop them stop them

[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.460]
So here we go again this time in Florida

[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:50.040]
It turns out that the state of Florida is using a private company with close ties to the Republican party to help cleanse the state's voter registration rules

[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:59.360]
Would it surprise anyone anywhere to learn that the cleansing process somehow managed to improperly prevent large numbers of African American voters from voting in the presidential election

[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.760]
Would it surprise anyone? Oh

[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:05.900]
Gregory Pulasch they reported with the online magazine salon is the number of articles on this

[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:12.980]
He noted that the company choice point and its subsidiary database technologies ink came up with a scrub list of

[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.780]
173,000 names

[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:20.920]
These were the names of people registered to vote in the Florida who according to choice point could be knocked off the rules for one reason or another

[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.520]
There was good reason for Florida to be concerned about the integrity of its voter registration rules

[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:30.640]
In 1997 the mayor of Vimy was removed from office because widespread fraud had occurred in the election

[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:37.320]
The following year a law was passed requiring counties in Florida to purge the rules of duplicate registrations the names of the seats

[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.740]
Persons and felons so far so good

[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:47.340]
The problems developed when the state turned to choice point which compiles and sells vast amounts of frequently shaky information about individuals

[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:54.880]
Choice point which acquired DBT last May was fired by the state of Pennsylvania for breaching the confidentiality of driving records

[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.380]
With this private outfit in the picture it soon became clear the top Republican officials

[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:03.900]
When we tried to repay partisan political advantage from a law designed to correct any gregious wrong

[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.880]
And that partisan advantage would be realized in large part by trampling on the voting rights of minorities

[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:15.940]
Over the spring and summer choice point was forced to acknowledge that 8,000 votes at it listed voters that it listed as felons

[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:19.780]
In fact, it had been guilty only of misdemeanors, which would not have affected their right to vote

[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.740]
What is maddening is that when such an erroneous list of names gets in the hands of county election officials

[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.980]
As this one did it is very difficult often impossible to find out what's corrected what's not correct

[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.120]
That's snickering you hear us from Republican operatives who know that these kinds of follow-ups because they're based on criminal records

[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.780]
Well disproportionately affect minority voters

[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:45.140]
Choice point eventually came up with a corrected list of 173,000 names of people that targeted as ineligible

[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:49.160]
Because they were deceased or were registered more than once or had been convicted of felony

[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.620]
But it was a lousy list riddled with mistakes

[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:59.920]
And in an interview with me yesterday Marty Fagan a choice point vice president said there had never been any expectation that the list would be particularly accurate

[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.720]
Remember now we're talking about a list that would be used to strip Americans of the precious right to vote

[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.020]
Mr

[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:12.500]
Fagan said the list focused on people who might have been deceased or might have been listed twice or possible felons

[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:18.100]
He said it was important to know that the information needed to be verified by county election officials

[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:25.080]
That was interesting because choice point came up with 58,000 people people registered to vote who would fall into the category

[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.900]
He calls possible felons

[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:32.260]
How in the world were county election officials supposed to check out each and every one and find out if they were felons or not

[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.560]
They couldn't and they didn't

[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:40.620]
The horror stories about perfectly innocent black voters being turned away from the polls because they had been targeted as convicted felons

[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.320]
Starting coming in early on the morning of November 7 election day and they're still coming in

[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.180]
Blacks turned out to vote in record numbers in Florida this year

[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:53.900]
But huge numbers were systematically turned away for one species reason or another the tactics have changed

[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:59.940]
But the girl remains the same end of article great article by Bob Herbert in the New York Times today

[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:04.060]
So I'm going to say it again if there's anybody

[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:09.500]
Who believes that this election was one or even stolen fair and square your dream

[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.500]
You're in the twilight zone no matter who your support you're out of your mind

[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:18.580]
This was and we've had voter fraud for since probably the first lesson they ever had in this country

[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.100]
I mean, it's run rampant

[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.580]
But I think at least in my lifetime

[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:26.060]
This is the most fraudulent national election we've ever had it's just unbelievable

[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:35.620]
And especially right here in the hotbed or fraud and hanky-panky good old FLA or do we know how to do it or what or the experts had it

[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.760]
See I did the wrong thing and look at it now both phones are working here

[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.840]
So you see there's not anybody on the phone. That's good

[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.340]
Chase them all away because they don't want to hear the floor to support those oral arguments

[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.420]
Especially after all these leaks are they got nothing to say about that

[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:53.380]
That's okay because I got a lot of things I want to talk about including that atkins a food stuff

[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:56.280]
Somebody stole my car bus solutions. You're not fooling any of us

[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:00.520]
I don't know it's in your tent of it. No, it is not in my car. Okay

[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.880]
And didn't I in fact I was talking about that yesterday

[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:08.100]
We were discussing the fact that if you leave anything in here because everybody in the buildings out of key to this room

[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.900]
In spite of what we were promised when we came up here

[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:14.660]
So I had a whole tin of that stuff and probably it was something that ain't too happy over the fact that I'm doing car solutions

[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.660]
Well, you know what not to you

[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.040]
Atkins dr. Atkins, you know great diet

[01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:24.800]
Had him on the air. We did the other thing there sold him a lot of books got a lot of people lost a lot of weight

[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.160]
With his I believe in it for a lot of people. It's very good

[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.600]
Great vitamins excellent a lot of other great books besides just the diet books read them all

[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.960]
But you know something when you're good at one thing stick to that

[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.160]
That's my best advice don't try to be all things to all people because whether comes to food products

[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:48.780]
Those atkins bars haven't I always said this at least I'm consistent because Peter Leonard slept in here yesterday a bunch of stuff after you heard me talking about the

[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:50.740]
Club solution stuff

[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.260]
Come solutions is great

[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.860]
I've lost five pounds and three days. I feel sensational and it's delicious

[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.220]
I took I said okay. I'll give it a shot. We got the cans of that atkins the stuff in the

[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.120]
refrigerator. Oh my god. It belongs in the can

[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.620]
Yeah, that can and I took the powder home yesterday. I made a milkshake

[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.440]
In my blender the good one that I have at home

[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:14.360]
Took one sip

[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.480]
Poured the rest down the sink

[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.500]
So Peter you can keep bringing dr. In here all you want the fact is I'm not gonna eat it

[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:27.220]
I'm not gonna plug it and it's just leave it out of here quit making me sick with your garbage

[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.220]
I found something that's sensational

[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:34.180]
I'm promoting it. I'm not getting paid to promote it. I don't have they haven't got any of it free yet and that's it

[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:35.060]
But it's great stuff

[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:43.220]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 teen Verizon wireless line 10 11 27

[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.460]
But Neil Roger show sports radio 5 60

[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.080]
You a little guy

[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.740]
Okay, our full question for right now. We'll do this for about an hour and a half because it's going to be very you know

[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.700]
There's no interest in the panthers. There's no interest in hockey

[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:02.860]
But I just thought I'd give the panther fans and outlet here since there's you know

[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.300]
I came in this morning. I was talking to guilty before the show

[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:10.740]
He was under commercial break and he was telling me that they actually had people calling on the worst team this morning saying that the

[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:15.780]
Bob L. Burry trade was bad because Eddie Jovonowski's playing so good for Vancouver now

[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.680]
You know what I would like to do to people who call in talks. You're even say that in private even in their toilet

[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.440]
Chuten in the lake. Yeah, I try to knock some sense in them

[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:30.720]
Not only if we got almost nobody showing up in the building there were maybe seven eight thousand people are last night

[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.060]
maybe and then when the third period started about

[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:38.000]
2500 and I'm not I'm not really blaming anybody because if I had a pay for those tickets

[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.540]
I wouldn't pay to see the crap they put out their last night that was pathetic. That was tragic

[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:49.400]
But the fact is that of those seven or eight thousand people the small handful of people who even have any concept

[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:54.620]
They're understanding of what's going on continues to be so dismal and so minimal that you just have to wonder

[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:58.140]
What are we doing with a hockey team here? What? Well, this is not a sports town

[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:04.400]
We're still after 25 years. I'm still trying to figure out what kind of a town it is besides filled with hate and early burdeners

[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:09.020]
But other than that I don't know what it is, but they're sure there's sure no knowledge about that a small handful

[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:14.660]
Which I can relate to a small handful of people have some concept and the rest of them even after all these years now

[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.880]
They still haven't caught on

[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:20.620]
The big spartures out there getting a lot of penalties and getting rid of the stupid meaningless fights

[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.920]
Hey, there you go painter. I just do not understand it

[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.300]
Same old tired crap and to show you about great coverage. We got maybe this is part of the reason

[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.140]
Here's today's Miami hero. This is supposed to be a great newspaper

[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.860]
This is supposed to be a paper that knows how to get something right

[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.460]
Page 4D in these sports acting at least in the Broadway edition this morning. I'm looking at the standings and national hockey league

[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.180]
Here's the results from last night. Here's two days results. Here's tonight's schedule

[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:54.000]
And listen to these games that are supposed to be in the NHL and I'd according to the hero denverred Orlando

[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.020]
Phoenix that Milwaukee

[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.260]
New York at San Antonio

[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.300]
Washington, Minnesota and Vancouver at Utah

[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:10.780]
Even Georgia I think if he stopped and taught about it for just a second Vancouver and Utah you the Utah jazz don't they play hockey

[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:11.920]
No

[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.640]
They play basketball

[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:23.700]
That's probably tonight's NBA schedule, but in the hero that's the NHL schedule and also on the same page 4D

[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:29.100]
Since they give such great coverage in this newspaper Panthers give on a way to the islander says David J. Niel

[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.140]
And more to this article is about well Bill Tories says we're gonna get the all-star game in 2003

[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:40.240]
I got news for you. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't even have a hockey team in 2003 unless Wayne Hype Pingo

[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:44.300]
Finally wakes up and says you know something. I'm trying to one load the team

[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:48.660]
There's nobody in the stand the team is one five games. They think they're joined out

[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:53.880]
They lose consistently the worst teams in the league over and over again. They that it's just it's pathetic

[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.920]
And those people in the building even the ones who don't really understand the game all though

[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:03.440]
Well, there's pretty much unanimous and it's time to say to the Murray boys

[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:07.400]
So let's do a brief pull here Eric just for maybe an hour and a half

[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.540]
I'm gonna be five choices

[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:15.280]
The Florida Panthers need to hear your five choices fire Terry Murray

[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.160]
Fire Brian Murray fire both

[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.680]
Make a traitor to or I don't care about the Panthers

[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:27.020]
There are your five choices the Florida Panthers need to do fire Terry Murray fire Brian Murray

[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.820]
Fire both make a traitor to or I don't care about the

[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.060]
Panthers you see here's the saddest part of the whole deal

[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:38.480]
Especially after the euphoria we had a few years ago with a stand the cup finals and everybody running all the front running phonies

[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.360]
And they're running around with their little flags on the cars

[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.520]
We actually had to enthusiasm

[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:49.460]
And speaking of that beavers must have given him tremendous satisfaction to come back to this

[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:55.500]
unforgiving unappreciative front running phony town and the kick their ass last night for the honor's

[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:02.340]
And now that this this organization they have systematically destroyed the franchise

[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:07.300]
They've torn it apart. There's very little left you've got Burray who did again scored the one goal

[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:08.660]
They got last night what a coincidence

[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:14.260]
17 girls he's got and you idiots out there who want Eddie Jovenoski back how many goals would he have scored our defenseman

[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:17.540]
Even if he were playing that good for us, which he wouldn't have been even if he would have been

[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:20.660]
How many goals would he have scored here four or five

[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.980]
If we didn't have pop out Burray this team wouldn't want a game this year

[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.960]
And then you see how many people would be in that building this spent what was it?

[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:33.000]
$182 million to build that beautiful Mac arena

[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.600]
Stated the art and yeah, he put too many seats in every he's a greedy prick Wayne

[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.500]
And so so the seats in the quarters are too small and there's some other problems

[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:48.740]
But generally speaking it's a hell of a building sure blows away that that Phantom arena date count is what everybody tells me no contest

[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:57.300]
But the prices are grotesque the concession prices are ridiculous not to mention the quality of the food ridiculous

[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.000]
And the product they're putting out there you can't expect people to spend their harder money to go see that

[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:06.540]
Especially when it's a marginal sports found in the first place

[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.900]
You've destroyed the franchise guys

[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.300]
There's almost nothing left

[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:17.360]
I'm gonna make a lot of money even though I'm gonna have to charge high prices

[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.880]
I guess but the people that come there are used to that

[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:23.200]
I'm gonna have to book in the flashlight franchises no seriously when you come in the door

[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.060]
I'm gonna be sitting there and I'm gonna rent you books in flashlight

[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.800]
So they're doing the game you'll have something to do

[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:29.800]
But what's wrong with that?

[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.840]
Yeah, do a little bit of reading will have some you know, I don't know

[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.740]
All different kinds of crap

[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:41.040]
Harry Potter books. I mean, well, whatever you like crossword puzzle crossword puzzles

[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.440]
pornography whatever turns you on okay

[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.560]
Just so that somebody might have something interesting to be doing during those three hours that we're not building

[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.140]
It is brutal. It's unacceptable

[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:57.600]
And how long this bald-headed geek up there is gonna sit back and allow this crap to go on

[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:00.120]
I have no idea. He's trying to sell the team

[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:05.820]
What lunatic is gonna come along and buy this franchise when there's nobody coming to the games

[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:11.080]
And when the team I hate to put use this word because I got people I like on that team

[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.980]
But the team generally speaking stinks and even even a player who have ability on the team most of them aren't playing for Terry Murray

[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.060]
They're not playing for this organization

[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:24.980]
Which has made so many mistakes and then I read in the paper this morning the same always maybe was the Sun sent

[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:29.780]
Oh, they're looking to get you know, oh, Jake from Philadelphia. Yeah, that's gotta do. Let's get another groan out there

[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:35.100]
He's gonna score a lot of goals any oh, we need a lot another groan so we can increase our league leading already penalty minutes

[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:44.700]
I'm embarrassed. I'm really embarrassed. There's a 42 year long hockey fan died in the wool

[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:47.060]
Nice go on by the way Leafs, but anyway

[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.340]
I'm just embarrassed for the whole the whole thing every aspect of it

[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.420]
There's nothing you can point to and say well, you know

[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.920]
I'm not saying that there aren't some players like Trevor Q to last night wasn't all that great

[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.360]
But he's played some great games and Bre and that's about it. That's about it right there

[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.660]
There's nothing else you can point to and say well, you know

[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:08.640]
We got hope over here again

[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.440]
No, and they're still trying to pedal the same old tired bull crap

[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.120]
The Robbie Needom irons in the Peter War well and the same I'm surprised they're not gonna bring Chris

[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.380]
We'll try to get Chris Wells back and pedal into the public

[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:21.400]
I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this because I know I'm wistling into what I'm farting into a wind storm

[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.640]
There's no point I've wasted my time doing at V4 and and they're still here

[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:35.380]
How could anybody possibly do a worse job or I should say a better job if destroying a franchise in any sports than the Murray's have done and still have their job

[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:41.260]
Coaches and general managers and professional sports drop-like flies that goes with the territory

[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:44.780]
That's that's part of the deal when they get hired they expect to get fired

[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.120]
Just a matter of time

[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.560]
And I just I just don't know how much more patience

[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.540]
This time's gonna have

[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:00.760]
Even those people who already bought their tickets and feel compelled to show up like Saturday when Colorado is here

[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.160]
I don't want to be the voice of doom and gloom

[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:09.600]
But that could be you think last night was grotesque and ugly just wait that could be really ugly

[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.220]
And and where are you sports writers in this town?

[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.440]
When are you gonna come out fit a beat in your own to bush like Dave Joseph a few days ago

[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.300]
We're not over here. Well somebody's gonna have to take their blame. Did he really say anything?

[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:28.460]
Oh, you are the biggest bunch of bush leagers in this goddamn town. You don't have the balls to come out really say anything

[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:34.820]
And it makes me sick to my stomach if this was a real hockey town or real sports town

[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:41.100]
The fakers who have held on in this town for years they would have been ridden out of this town on a rig a long time ago

[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:45.120]
And it's the same with the politicians and all the other fakers

[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:50.840]
But because you got virtually newspapers bush leag reporters people would ball the size of a baby

[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.740]
And that's why these people continue to go on and just destroy everything that we once upon a time used to enjoy

[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:05.200]
Very very sad tragic. It's enough to make you want to cry. Am I gonna cry over it? No, no, at least one

[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.140]
20 to noon at 560 WQ

[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:13.180]
But Neil Roger shows to sports radio 560

[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:14.660]

Where's our leave him over there?

[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:54.140]
Disguise those guys. Yes. Is this the guy who makes my baby food? No

[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:59.480]
Now simply punch a hole in the 1959 Univac key punch card

[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.320]
Where over there? Here use this microscope

[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.700]
Oh there is that it? No

[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.540]
Okay, I'll punch you again

[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:11.120]
Is this all? No that invalidates your vote

[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.780]

And I'll punch you again. I'll punch you

[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.840]
I'll also foot magic. Are you?

[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.180]
All right

[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:22.900]
Duttering old heave

[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:29.320]
Remember comrades if you want to live in Florida exercise your right to vote in accordance to the little brother

[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.580]
I just showed the Hank the a hero NHL schedule for tonight with all those uh

[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:37.700]
Well, I guess maybe Utah's got a new team now. I don't know. Gary Vettman likes his bench

[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:40.480]
And let's get to Denver a hockey team. I mean we already had the you know

[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.060]
Oh, they got the Colorado Avalanche. I'm say they'll be your Saturday. Well, it's called Denver now

[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:50.100]
Oh my god this town that you can't complain about the journalism here because there isn't any

[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:54.060]
I just I don't want to get all worked up and frustrated about because at least it's consistent. Is it ever gonna change?

[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.880]
No, no the Bush league town

[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:02.300]
Look for George this Saturday from 11 to 1 at Bill Sydles Nissan in Miami. He's expecting a whale of a crowd

[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:09.820]
I'm 36 to each is west of 27th Avalanche also find Bill Sydles Mitsubishi and Suzuki George will have the best needle CD

[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:14.000]
Cassette and T-shirts and I bet you're gonna rake in a fortune for plan parent on Saturday

[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.540]
I'm gonna buy one of those books. You're gonna be selling at the stadium booking a flashlight shape

[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:24.340]
Also to help us out as we're trying to get to 100 grand this year for our fundraiser because it'd be pretty embarrassing to me personally

[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:29.080]
If we don't raise 100 grand for plan parent joke cost double and by the way, we still don't want that guy's money from Philadelphia

[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:29.940]
no

[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:36.240]
I joke cost double being a QM van tomorrow from 11 to 1 with the best and you'll stop at the sound advice on federal highway between

[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:44.140]
Oakland and commercial and you can go to specs all the specs music stores all over dig-bought Palm Beach Naples four buyers and pick up your best meal CDs and cassettes

[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:51.160]
23 votes so far on our pool the Florida Panthers need to fire carry Marie one

[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:58.720]
Fire by and Marie none make a traitor to one fire both 12 and I don't care about the Panthers

[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:03.080]
Well, look at how many we got I don't care about the Panthers behind yeah, well, we don't care about you either

[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:08.100]
I mean, I just put it on there just because we got a lot of sour pushes out there like to be negative about whatever you ask

[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.280]
So I just give them an opportunity they enjoy it

[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.680]
They tingle from it they fell

[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:23.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line martin trowney colla trial is the closing arguments are underway there and closing arguments in

[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.640]
Seminole County last night before my good friend Nikki Clark

[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:29.920]
What you like her? Yeah, she's all right, but I don't think she's gonna do it though

[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.820]
I do not believe she could be gonna throw an owl's balance. I could be wrong

[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:37.480]
I do think there's a possibility though that the um what the hell's her name?

[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:41.140]
Warren Henning. I'm sorry. That's from the islanders. What else the broads name up there in San

[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:46.760]
O'County well, what are your Sandra Gourd? I think she might just wind up in jail for perjury not so much for fraud

[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.700]
But for perjury but anyway, we'll see

[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:57.380]
Here's Bokeh. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Okay. Actually I did talk about the Panthers, but you summed it up perfectly in your last little

[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:06.140]
Diet ride there. So I will say this as to the Murray Brothers at John McLaughlin would say bye-bye. Yeah

[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.940]
Okay, bye-bye

[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:15.480]
Here's the fact that says I'm a Cuban American and I'm a consider myself very very intelligent. I

[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:21.160]
Evoted the what is it? I know I know I voted for the right candidate Speller. I know a jury boy. What is this?

[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.500]
I thought this maybe was gonna make some sense. Does it make any sense? Oh, no, it's another Cuban hating facts

[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:30.500]
They hate the Cubans. Let's take a poll on that. Do you hate the Cubans? Are we already know the answer?

[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:39.240]
560560. Oh, here's a call from Tallahassee. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi, what's all the election news and the hockey? I don't know

[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:44.500]
I think hammer is gonna beat you with the ratings today for the first time in a while. Yeah, it's just

[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.480]
I don't know. I love your show. What is it? Let me ask you. What does that mean?

[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:57.980]
I'm just falling asleep here. I'm listening to you over the computer. I'm talking about you. So in other words, you're making hearing is it's almost noon.

[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.400]
You're making the effort to listen on the internet up in Tallahassee and yet you're telling me that the show is boring and you're falling asleep.

[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:13.160]
It's still the best available, but I mean it's not the best Neil Rogers effort. Yeah, well, I would agree with that because the stuff from the Florida Supreme Court was pretty boring

[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.180]
But you know something sometime boring is important to some people so blow it out your ass and get a life. How do you like that?

[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:23.180]
Here's the next kid's gonna be perfect down here, which he's obviously from here. He's gonna be great.

[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.440]
He'll be one of those cranky old senior citizens who come down here to bitch and grab about everything.

[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:35.640]
He's listening like somebody's got a gun that we said, but he don't like it. See, I still don't understand that, but you know, fine. Have a wonderful life.

[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:42.440]
See, again, I thought I was doing something worthwhile just like when I put on the stuff from the US Supreme Court.

[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:47.500]
It's very rare that we get an opportunity to hear these things and since supposedly 99% of the people out there

[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:53.020]
This has only been talking about for the last month and today being December 7th, the election was one month ago November 7th

[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:55.420]
You think that some people might be interested in, wouldn't you?

[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:55.660]
No!

[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.200]
I got something I should admit we should have got that kid's address.

[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:04.480]
We should mail to somebody brought it to me at the game last night.

[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.240]
The bag of seeds.

[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.660]
They probably like a bag of seeds. He could plant them in his rectum.

[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:18.500]
Texas Homegrown Dope from the Bush League Seed Company. It's got to put your W on the front with those big years on a pot plant.

[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:26.640]
He's planting instructions using a silver spoon plant in a shallow hole, protect from draft, feed with loads of family and soft money.

[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:33.740]
And on the back it's got some more great stuff. Texas Homegrown Legalized Dope. Beautiful stuff.

[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:40.640]
Nice artwork too. I maybe will send that to him and he can do it with it. Maybe sift out the seeds from the plant.

[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:46.140]
Very sad pal. He just tear my kishkis out. He was on there for a long time.

[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.420]
It was called a long time ago. Was he on about a half an hour?

[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.180]
I mean half an hour a pound you could have probably done something in the squirt squirt.

[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.320]
Worth a while if you could have found it.

[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.140]
On his dime? No less.

[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.940]
Yeah on his dime. Well I'm sure on mommy and daddy's dime.

[01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.120]
Here's a mobile in homestead. Hello.

[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:05.660]
Neil, I was just listening to your broadcast of the Airing Before the Florida Supreme Court.

[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:10.720]
And I'm not a statistician and I'm in my car but tell me if my math is wrong here.

[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:15.740]
The attorney for Gore, a boy said that there were 9,000 undervotes in Day County.

[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:25.200]
If you round that to about 10,000 for easy-figuring, he said that 25% of the undervotes result in a vote

[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.500]
if they examine them by hand. That's 2,500.

[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:35.080]
In Day County, Gore got 53% Bush got 47 which is a difference of 6%.

[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:45.080]
So if the net votes go in favor 6% for Gore, 6% of 2,500 is 150 votes

[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:48.980]
that Gore would net out of Day County. So what's the big deal?

[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:54.340]
Yeah. Did I say there was a big deal?

[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.160]
No I'm just saying everything.

[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:00.240]
First of all, you can't extrapolate based on anything and the absentee ballots say it.

[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:04.660]
Hey look, the fact is that there is no equitable way, at least this is my opinion.

[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:09.040]
There's no equitable way to start recounting anything now at this point because like

[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:14.000]
one of the justices asked or a two of them asked, how can you possibly recount selective undervotes

[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.020]
from two or three counties when obviously there were undervotes in all 67 counties?

[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.160]
I said weeks ago and I'll say it again today.

[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.060]
If there was going to be a recount, they should have recounted all the counties

[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:26.380]
and which the Gore people offered but obviously the Bush people didn't want because they

[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:28.620]
figured they probably lost and then now it's too late.

[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:30.400]
Okay, I agree with that.

[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.100]
Just running out.

[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:37.280]
But what I'm saying is I just think the point's got to be made that people tend to think that

[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.880]
there's something treasure trove of votes for the Democrats in Day County and my position is

[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.780]
that there's really only 150 now.

[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.400]
Let me say this to you right now. Nobody knows.

[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:50.820]
And until the herald and the other organizations go in there after this is all over,

[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.300]
nobody will ever know. Trust me when I tell you.

[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.480]
And then what and see how embarrassed are you and some of the people going to be when they do

[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.260]
count them and come to find out. Oh, I guess what?

[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.680]
See, they had did you see the statistician they had on from the Seminole County case last

[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:06.380]
time? Not only was he I thought he was going to crawl under the table or maybe blow his brain

[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:09.780]
to I have never seen such a nervous witness in my life.

[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:12.180]
He made Mark Ferman look pretty secure.

[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.920]
Man, this guy was was prophetic.

[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.760]
And why they let I mean she must have been in a good mood that hang in judge your last night

[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.760]
because she just and even the attorneys he just kept making little speeches.

[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.540]
And finally you can see the look on their faces.

[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:28.120]
They start getting real exasperated and cut him off of the pass.

[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:30.120]
He wouldn't respond to the questions.

[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.800]
You can take every statistician in the world and you know what you can do with them as far as I'm concerned.

[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.600]
Every single one of them.

[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:37.620]
Shit in the lake.

[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.880]
Yeah, which in his case might have helped out.

[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:44.760]
He might have hopped off of there and run down the hallway and he was he was prophetic.

[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.580]
And he kept he was sweating and he kept rubbing his hands like this.

[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:51.040]
And he didn't know whether a scream or reach a kid has been in.

[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:53.720]
Statistician life fat ass.

[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:59.480]
This business of bringing in statisticians and speculating that that's not a way to have an election.

[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.840]
Well, it might be this and it's probably this.

[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.860]
Yeah, and you're probably an asshole.

[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.660]
Mariela Mio plans to return to the ice for hockey fans out there.

[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.280]
Penguin's owner, Mariela, was expected when it's early next week.

[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.780]
He's planning to come back as a player within 30 days for all your Penguin fans out there.

[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:14.960]
Get excited about it.

[01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:19.560]
It says that he's been feeling great.

[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.820]
He feels his team is a contender and he's given his body a chance to reenergize itself.

[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.400]
He thinks he can still play, which I'm sure he can better and most of the guys on our team.

[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:29.700]
And Mariela is coming back.

[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.580]
That'll be great for the game and for the Penguin's.

[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:32.740]
Bad for us.

[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.520]
5, 6, 7, 8.

[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:35.460]
How's that pool coming?

[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.300]
73 votes.

[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:39.000]
I don't care about the Panthers as a close second right now.

[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:39.780]
31 of course.

[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.140]
35 votes say fire both the Maurice.

[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:44.880]
In fact, maybe we ought to say it all together now.

[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:45.160]
Come on.

[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:45.820]
1, 2, 3.

[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:46.740]
Bye, bye, bye.

[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:47.780]
Fire both the Maurice.

[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.320]
35.

[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.800]
Fire Terry Marie 5.

[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:50.780]
Brian Marie 0.

[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.560]
And make a traitor to 2.

[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.860]
Out of 73 votes.

[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:54.760]
Yeah, make a traitor to.

[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:56.260]
Uh-huh.

[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.280]
I put it on there just for amusement's sake.

[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.420]
It's 11.55 at 5.

[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:02.540]
So let's Bill Schneider say it.

[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:02.780]
It's spoken.

[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:03.660]
Count the votes.

[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:04.940]
Okay, count the votes.

[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.140]
They're not going to count the votes.

[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.100]
You think they're going to count the votes?

[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.500]
That'll be our poll question later.

[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:13.380]
When we look at what this poll thing on here one o'clock

[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:14.660]
is most people don't care about this.

[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.340]
Which I understand.

[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.120]
And of course, uh,

[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.160]
the powers that be don't want to understand.

[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:20.000]
Wayne don't want to understand.

[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.140]
The organization though.

[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:23.640]
And they're talking about an all-starging here in 2003.

[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:25.420]
Well, I'll tell you one thing Mr. Boatay.

[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.380]
You got some real hoods, but man, you're unbelievable.

[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:29.880]
There were rumors.

[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.920]
I don't want to say in the Toronto Sun over the weekend.

[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:33.200]
Just rumors.

[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.280]
I'll be rumors about this.

[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.120]
I can't take it to guys named multi-billionaire.

[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.840]
Who's allegedly talking about maybe buying the team

[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.040]
and moving them to Portland, Oregon.

[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.460]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.840]
Of course, the organization's vehemently dies there,

[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:45.280]
but I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.420]
Come on down on my thumb.

[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:57.220]
Who's the people in that Hanukkah songs?

[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:00.840]
Hanukkah, please lower and make it in.

[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:03.640]
Don't want to hear this song again.

[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.980]
Hanukkah songs on.

[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.700]
Too much time is here.

[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:17.260]
It's played more times than grandma got run over by our rainy season.

[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:22.540]
And when you feel like the only kid in town was tired of his song.

[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.060]
Here's how the people more fit up.

[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:29.900]
This is rather long.

[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:38.280]
And the firsthost Mother Livets again

[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.720]
and 노래�i oh

[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.300]
Guess you may have been listening and probably never will be.

[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:53.140]
Rapper's new doggy dog, Jay-Z and Bob Daddy.

[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:58.540]
Garts, corpses, thick of it, Travis Trin and Sue.

[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:03.840]
Even Bruce Springfield won't sing along, it's true.

[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:06.580]
They don't think it's funny.

[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:12.660]
If Max is playing as hell, they'd rather listen to the dog's noise.

[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:15.160]
The Barfting Django bell is not fun.

[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.940]
Good songs, your blotin' and Hanukkah songs, here again.

[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:29.120]
Please lower and make it in, because Adam Sandler is in life, friends.

[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:36.700]
Pebble 205.62 on Hankys with a building, he'll be along at 2.00

[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.200]
and the Bremen Honda at 6 o'clock tonight.

[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:42.960]
You got Boog Shobby 8 to 10 to the K after a Boog.

[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:47.540]
I come on the air this morning, we play the Florida Supreme Court, we put the Audi 1 to the air,

[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:50.420]
because there are a lot of people in their cars, a lot of people in their work, we figure this is like,

[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:53.860]
we're coming to the culmination of all of the weeks of this crack going on.

[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:57.240]
People probably would want to hear the oral arguments and the anal arguments.

[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.220]
Wouldn't you think that?

[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:03.840]
I read this article at somebody and I thank the original person who facts me.

[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.220]
The article by Bob Herbert in The New York Times today.

[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:09.880]
I read the whole thing about the black people being disenfranchised from their vote.

[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:13.780]
And I just reached over to the facts machine a couple of minutes ago, and guess what I get?

[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.060]
From Peter who says, please read.

[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:18.420]
Facts is me these three pages.

[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:21.100]
Keep them out by Bob Herbert in The New York Times.

[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:24.540]
Yeah.

[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:35.760]
5.6705.60.

[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.260]
Many, many open lines here.

[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:38.840]
I think the kid in Tallahassee was right.

[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:40.020]
Blue way, the whole audience here.

[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.680]
I apologize, never do it again.

[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.280]
Never ever do it again.

[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.480]
I don't care if they're blowing up the whole goddamn world.

[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:46.580]
I will not put it on the air.

[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:52.680]
Well, this city here makes funny noises and it's hard a lot and have a good time while the mushroom cloud is forming over our heads.

[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.180]
5.6705.60.

[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.460]
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon One.

[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:04.400]
And then the thing I compounded that by taking five whole minutes and talking about hockey, I mean, you know, there couldn't be anybody left now.

[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:04.700]
Could there?

[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:05.800]
No. No. You're right.

[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.100]
Never learn my lesson.

[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:09.660]
Here's Bokeh. Hello.

[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:10.540]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:11.660]
Yes, sir?

[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.160]
What do you have against Peter Wurrell?

[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.260]
He can't play.

[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:16.880]
Yeah, but he's the only excitement right now.

[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:17.760]
No, he's not exciting.

[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.360]
He's had an appendly box most of the game.

[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:19.880]
Thank goodness.

[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.220]
Well, are you telling me that you don't like a good hockey fighter, Renelle and then?

[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.660]
No, I don't. He does.

[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:25.660]
First of all, he doesn't get...

[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.540]
Well, what did that accomplish last night, all those fights?

[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.360]
What did that get done?

[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.860]
Well, there has to be some payback when I'm sure...

[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:32.180]
Let me say it again.

[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.460]
Let me say it again.

[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.440]
Did it fire up the team last night?

[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:36.500]
No.

[01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:37.860]
What did it accomplish?

[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:39.680]
Well, you have to protect Tallah.

[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.280]
First of all, he wasn't protecting.

[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.740]
That was Melanby that protected him.

[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:45.600]
If you were watching the same game that I was, that was Melanby that came out there,

[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:46.460]
went after Kevin Howard.

[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.020]
So you don't even know what you're watching, like most of the other people, sir.

[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:51.280]
Peter Wurrell wasn't fighting to protect Bob Elbruri.

[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.480]
Peter Wurrell was fighting because, as always, he winds up an appendly box.

[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.540]
Because he had a thing going with God damn it with a big goop ball.

[01:40:59.220 --> 01:40:59.540]
Tallah.

[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:02.700]
Got it all, mighty.

[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:03.820]
Here's another guy.

[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:05.140]
Don't you like a good fight now?

[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.120]
Maybe if it's in a contact of a good game, it was terminal.

[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:09.940]
It was ponderous.

[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:13.240]
And if that's your idea, if you're willing to pay to go to see that, hey, great.

[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.520]
Don't take all the suckers like you in the world.

[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:18.620]
Good fight.

[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.040]
How many people ever really saw a good fight in a hockey game?

[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.720]
Because 99% of the fights, nothing happens anyway.

[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.900]
They're holding onto each other's jersey and they're this and they're that.

[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.820]
Maybe once in a while you'll see some punches landed.

[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.180]
And once in a while, if you're into blood and guts, you'll see a real fight where guys

[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.060]
leave all bloodied out.

[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.320]
And of course, this guy, I'm sure, loves that.

[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:41.740]
But that very rarely happens.

[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:45.420]
And then they tumble down there and the ice and one guy falls on top.

[01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:46.720]
It's like putting a guy in wrestling.

[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.960]
And of course, we know about the wrestling.

[01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:49.300]
But that's what it is.

[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.000]
It's boring.

[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.520]
It's boring, to be honest with you.

[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:55.340]
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:57.800]
Here's Orlando.

[01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:58.140]
Hello.

[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:03.660]
Yeah, Neil, the closing argument, Sneaky Clark's case, it starts at 1pm today.

[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:08.160]
But I tell you, the case that's really going to nail the bushes is this Martin County.

[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:11.200]
That judge is, he, I don't know about Clark.

[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.580]
I'm a little concerned about her.

[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:17.220]
No, the judge, the judge in the Martin County case is the same one that Lewis.

[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.840]
Lewis, Judge Lewis, he can be a turn down the road.

[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:23.480]
It's the same name, but they're different guys because I knew what they both look like.

[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.820]
This is the different, he has the same name, but he's a different judge.

[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.300]
Can't be, he looks like the same Lewis that I saw.

[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:29.520]
Uh, Terry Lewis.

[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.480]
I don't know, but I'll tell you what, I watched last night and he's, I don't, I feel very confident

[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.660]
that Martin County's ballots are, that's going to go goers way.

[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.000]
And probably some little county too.

[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.040]
So, you know, you're looking at, well, where are you coming up with this?

[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.640]
Probably, probably based on what?

[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:48.200]
I watched most of that some real county stuff last, yesterday afternoon last night.

[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:49.120]
Where are you coming up with that?

[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:54.100]
Well, the, the way I looked at it, when I saw the Martin County case, that's just so egregious

[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:56.400]
and so, so illegal what they did.

[01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:02.000]
I, I think that's going to go, that's going to go good for, well, that's, that's what I think it's going to go well for Gore.

[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:09.960]
So, you know, I think when, and also the special session, now they've called that too late, because let's just say, one or two of those cases go goers way.

[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.760]
And he wins by five, ten, fifteen thousand votes.

[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:19.120]
Special session is starting tomorrow at noon, but they're really going to crank it up next week, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:21.240]
One of these cases goes, goes goers way.

[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:25.560]
It's too late, they'll, they'll still go ahead and try to put those electors in Bush's column.

[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:31.440]
But the re-certification and, and the, the election, the election, the election results going for Gore.

[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.640]
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, what re-certification are you talking about? Who's going to re-certify it?

[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:41.000]
The court will re-certify it with, if, if one of those court courts don't certify votes in elections.

[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:47.460]
Yeah, they will in this case because, sir, let me say it again, because I, I'm hoping to have a conversation, but I don't think I'm having one.

[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.720]
Courts don't certify elections.

[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:52.500]
Well, they will direct Harris to re-certify for Gore.

[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.740]
And you really believe that's going to happen?

[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.020]
I really believe the Martin County case is going to go very far as well.

[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:01.380]
I'll come in the morning, okay? Wow.

[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:02.700]
Woo!

[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.660]
Is it, is it just me or is it, was that guy all over the place, out of his mind?

[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:11.820]
Sounds like switch, we'll think of the major.

[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.480]
And it is the same, Joe, Joe, Terry Lewis.

[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:21.500]
Remember, he was the one that turned him down and they had to go over him to the, the Florida Supreme Court the first time about counting the votes.

[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:24.880]
Now, it just happens to look alike.

[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:27.580]
Here's a mobile implantation. Hello, and have the same name. Hello.

[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:29.480]
Yes. Yes, sir.

[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.680]
Neil, Panther fan, hockey fan.

[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:40.900]
And I would say that if last year when the Panthers were on their slide and lost two jersey and four,

[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:46.660]
that any hockey town would have ran Mr. Murray out of town right then and there.

[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:55.680]
Now we're stuck with them through this, and there's no way that this guy can keep, and should be in town,

[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.140]
and papers have got to start picking this up and telling the way it is.

[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:02.800]
So the papers aren't going to pick it up and tell it like, is he's got that intimidate.

[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:07.000]
You don't have any real columnists to know anything about the game, so they don't write anything.

[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:11.620]
And you've got a couple of beat reporters there who are intimidated, and every time they look at them cross-eyed, they get them all,

[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:15.300]
they plant the stuff for them to write, like the puff piece about neomire over the weekend.

[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:16.740]
Right. Right.

[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:18.100]
Which is, it's all happening right on the same day.

[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:22.100]
Right. I'm reading that in the paper, as you're saying, in the Sunsigno,

[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:26.400]
and they never really said anything about the team.

[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.600]
They just like, just beat around the whole blushing, just made it look,

[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:33.580]
just used to hearing there and how we're hurt, listen to that.

[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:37.100]
So the fact is they have destroyed this franchise.

[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:40.420]
They have destroyed it. It's been butchered.

[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.300]
And nobody in this town wants to say that except me.

[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:47.180]
All right. I go to, I try to make two games each month.

[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:53.280]
And when I saw New Jersey come to town, I was one of the games I circulated,

[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.460]
I said, we're going to go to that game.

[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.340]
And when I went to that game, and the way they lost in the last minutes,

[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.960]
like they seem to do, because they scored that one beautiful goal every game.

[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:09.900]
And I'm looking around in the stadium, and I'm seeing myself, boy, I'm one of those doing 10,000 here.

[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.100]
I open up the paper next day, and they said there's 13,000.

[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:15.840]
Oh, it says the same thing with me, but that's ticket sold.

[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.380]
That's not people's asses in the seat.

[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:18.340]
Right, that's nothing.

[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.920]
Right, that's not the actual people that show up there.

[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:21.280]
Yeah.

[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:24.660]
It's like, you know, when you can't draw from New Jersey,

[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:26.420]
and I was looking at that schedule coming up.

[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:28.480]
What are you talking about? New Jersey doesn't draw at home.

[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:31.220]
What does that mean? New Jersey doesn't draw.

[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:32.920]
Well, I'm not like, why?

[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.280]
And they've only want to spend like, up twice in the last few years.

[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.500]
So what are you talking about?

[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.380]
What I'm talking about?

[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:38.340]
I'm talking about the elders last night.

[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.440]
They don't draw. They draw 4,000 people a year.

[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:44.240]
Right. But I'm talking about for us to draw, for people to come out.

[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:46.620]
I mean, like, it's not about going to I wonder,

[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.640]
Dan, I said, no, I want to see Colorado come in.

[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:51.100]
I mean, we want to see the better teams come in.

[01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:53.320]
You know, I hope your team can beat them.

[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.140]
But, I don't know, we're in a lot of problems down here.

[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:56.920]
We got a lot of trouble.

[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.260]
Yeah, I see a Saturday, pal. Good luck to us.

[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:01.720]
It's not a hockey town, and the price is always ridiculous.

[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:04.020]
And the team blows, and you put all those ingredients together,

[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.000]
and you got a recipe for a disaster.

[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.040]
And is that what we have now?

[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:07.840]
That's what a disaster.

[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:08.640]
Terminal.

[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:09.640]
And nobody cares anyway.

[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:12.080]
10 past noon at 5.60 W.C.Y.M.

[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:16.000]
The Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio 560.

[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.960]
Q.A.M.

[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.800]
This is a session with Hokey.

[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:23.140]
Good question. Excellent question.

[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:30.240]
Thanks to her, we also have the

[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.160]
Builders always break the light.

[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:37.920]
She's the one the next best I owe.

[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.180]
We're a season every night.

[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.420]
It's your birthday light.

[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.200]
Holy Holy.

[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:49.140]
With her 30 double-decyte.

[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:50.700]
With her 50-type.

[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:52.820]
Holy Holy.

[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:56.520]
She gives us young guys quite a ride.

[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:59.120]
Yeah, what do we behind, George?

[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:00.280]
One break it.

[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:00.660]
No.

[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:01.100]
We recount.

[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:02.000]
No.

[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:02.820]
Oh, oh, recount.

[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.280]
Oh, we're having a recon.

[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.140]
We're going to do a manual.

[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:06.860]
Okay, let me put a dimple in it.

[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:07.680]
Here you go.

[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:08.800]
How about that?

[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:09.520]
We catch up.

[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.860]
No, the next break is short.

[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.200]
You can stick a couple of stuff in there.

[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:13.620]
We're working.

[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:14.040]
I did.

[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:14.940]
Yeah.

[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:16.440]
We're not one break behind.

[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:17.460]
Hot shot.

[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:17.840]
Okay.

[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:18.720]
I don't think.

[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:20.300]
Just to move on a lot of spots.

[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:20.660]
Okay.

[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:21.840]
In fact, we'll go over a couple of minutes.

[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:22.380]
I think don't mind.

[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.060]
He used the long breaks.

[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:25.440]
567.

[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.280]
And by the way, George, you're wise up here.

[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.560]
You know how to get some people out there at that thing on Saturday?

[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:30.120]
That's right.

[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.160]
Oh, you should have seen the scene last time.

[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:32.980]
We had food there before.

[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:33.800]
Oh, you did?

[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.380]
I have food for the employees.

[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:36.400]
I mean, there were the only ones there.

[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.960]
But I don't recall telling anybody about that.

[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:39.420]
That would have brought a hell of a crowd out.

[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.960]
You're going to have maybe no chasing stuff like that?

[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:42.340]
No.

[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:45.120]
We're going to have food provided by Atlantic City Sub's on Hollywood.

[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:46.620]
In Hollywood, on Sheridan Street.

[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.340]
And Miguel came in here was writing and writing.

[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:50.340]
And so what are you writing all of?

[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:51.140]
And he said, I'm writing a book.

[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.220]
It's what we're going to sell at the arena.

[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.220]
The employees had the nerve to complain that we didn't find.

[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.100]
And napkins and paper plates for them.

[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.200]
Now, aren't you going to be there this Saturday?

[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.360]
And you're knocking the employees?

[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:01.440]
You're going to have to go crazy again.

[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:02.380]
They were in this show.

[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:02.760]
Huh?

[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:05.120]
They don't listen to this show.

[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:06.300]
They don't say, I'm going to be in Glace, IE.

[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:06.940]
Is that what you're saying?

[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:07.240]
Oh.

[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:07.860]
Oh.

[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.340]
Well, in that case.

[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.800]
What did you say that cut them so pissed off?

[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:14.640]
They're fooling with the unlucky.

[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.580]
What for George this Saturday, 11 to 11,

[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:18.060]
and Bill Sattles, Nissan and Miami,

[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:19.160]
where they don't speak no English.

[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:20.840]
36 to eat just less than 20.

[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.220]
Well, what are you, are they sending you out there?

[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:23.760]
Just because you're a spick, is that what it is?

[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:25.100]
What are they doing at the moment?

[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.100]
I don't understand the logic of it either, but none of the less.

[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.340]
Oh, but anyone has questions.

[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:29.800]
Go out there because George will have the best

[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.140]
in the LCDs, consists in T-shirts,

[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.840]
and food provided by Atlantic City Subbs,

[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:33.980]
in Hollywood on Sheridan Street.

[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:35.420]
Okay, there you go.

[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.940]
He'll take them on the anyway.

[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:40.060]
Okay, let's do a mobile and lake worth.

[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:40.320]
Hello?

[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:42.940]
Mobile and lake worth.

[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:45.280]
Going once.

[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:47.280]
Well, he's listening on the, I'm going to give him a chance.

[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.000]
Going once.

[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:49.540]
Going twice.

[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:50.400]
I hate it.

[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:50.780]
How are you?

[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:51.120]
Okay.

[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:53.420]
Okay.

[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:55.280]
Yes sir, speak to me.

[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:56.780]
Okay, that was the call.

[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:57.380]
Neil, how are you?

[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:57.920]
That was the end of it.

[01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.480]
5, 6, 7, and then that's it.

[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:00.520]
It's 50, yes I did.

[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.760]
I did get lost.

[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:03.980]
Here's South Beach.

[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:04.220]

[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.360]
Hello, Neil.

[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:05.880]
Yes sir.

[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:06.380]
How are you doing?

[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:06.780]
Okay.

[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:07.800]
I'm Neil.

[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.060]
Big problem.

[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.500]
I blame the whole thing here.

[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:13.240]
I blame the whole thing.

[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:14.260]
What whole thing is that sir?

[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:15.500]
Which whole are you talking about?

[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:16.480]
Well, the big picture.

[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:18.980]
The big picture?

[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:19.460]
Yeah.

[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:20.200]
Uh-huh.

[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:20.760]
In other words.

[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:21.480]
All of these things.

[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:24.900]
Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Lines,

[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:28.940]
out of townline, 877-785-6345.

[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:29.860]
Here's Dear Field.

[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:30.140]
Hello.

[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:31.840]
Hello, is it my aunt?

[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:33.100]
It sounds like you, yeah.

[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:33.840]
Sounds like me.

[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.860]
I tell you, I know when people call you out in the,

[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.980]
they ask you what you have against people well.

[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:41.860]
It's, it's you can do.

[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:43.560]
Yeah, but didn't you, were you at the game or did you?

[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.060]
I was at the game and it's like-

[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:47.120]
And didn't you hear the cheering every time you saw one of those minions?

[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:47.360]
Well, this is funny.

[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:52.080]
You know, it's like, it's in a team because it's hysterical.

[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.120]
When you watch this guy,

[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:55.220]
it's like a fight of the gate.

[01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:58.260]
It's like that the legs are in front of the upper body.

[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:00.840]
He looks like a kid at the skating rink,

[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:02.420]
and a little kid had to try to skate.

[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:05.040]
Yeah, and of course last night somebody would probably say,

[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.740]
well, you know, we got an assist on the Burray girls.

[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:10.100]
You only got, the only reason we got an assist is because somebody made a pass

[01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:11.000]
from inside a blue line.

[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.680]
It tipped off of his stick.

[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:13.120]
Exactly.

[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:14.120]

[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:16.700]
And it's amazing.

[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.880]
As usual, he missed the pass,

[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:22.700]
and Burray picked it off off of his stick and went in alone and made the great goal.

[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:26.160]
But the fact is that this guy cannot play the game.

[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:32.040]
He is so used to, he is an average minor league hockey player at that.

[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:32.360]

[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:36.380]
And you know something, he's not even a good goon.

[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.620]
He can't even fight.

[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:39.800]
And all he does is grab people and fight.

[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:40.940]
Now he can't even fight.

[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:43.340]
And I'm surprised he actually got into it with Charles last night

[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:44.180]
because he's a big guy.

[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:46.360]
He usually picks on guys like Ty Dohmia,

[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:47.480]
who come up to his belt buckle.

[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:48.340]
Exactly.

[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:51.400]
But you know what bothers me about this whole thing?

[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:53.380]
The Marines are never going to get fired

[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:56.260]
because creative faith is the one that makes that decision.

[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:56.840]
Am I correct?

[01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:58.020]
Well let me ask you this.

[01:51:58.140 --> 01:51:59.660]
If you're trying to sell the team what do you want to do?

[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:02.200]
Wait until it's completely valueless and then try to sell it?

[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.920]
I mean, even he's not that stupid.

[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.840]
Well, he seems pretty stupid to me because it seems to me there's no,

[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:11.400]
there's nothing you never see him or nobody's ever questioning him.

[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:11.920]
What do you get?

[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:13.860]
There's a guy that got fired from Boston.

[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.400]
They call Pat Burns, or I'd love to see that.

[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:16.560]
Right.

[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:19.780]
I told people that last night that he might say they ought to sign up Pat Burns tomorrow

[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:20.960]
and put him behind the bench.

[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.180]
Anybody but these people.

[01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:26.520]
I mean, you know, you look at this game and it's like they're down three to one.

[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:27.580]
There's about eight minutes left.

[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:31.560]
And there's no one so he has to be playing like there's no sense of urgency

[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:34.040]
after just skating around, doing figure eight.

[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:34.600]
It's amazing.

[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:36.980]
And how Robert Spayler can still be on that team?

[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.700]
I was screaming to him last night on a month.

[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:40.020]
The miracle I can even speak to them.

[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.300]
So, who is from screaming?

[01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:44.100]
This guy, they should put him on a bus and just send him out of town.

[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:44.860]
A bus to nowhere.

[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:45.900]
They're just pathetic.

[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.400]
Thank God I still have my leg.

[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:48.200]
Okay.

[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:50.560]
And I'll be, I've been a leaf fan like you forever,

[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:53.780]
but I'll tell you, I still like to, you know, you still like to see your home team.

[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:54.120]
Right.

[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:54.700]
You're home town.

[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.180]
Of course.

[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.520]
And because if you only games you go down and see.

[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.080]
I find there's more assignments in there watching the scroll board and leaf school out of town

[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:01.960]
than there was in watching what's going on.

[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.480]
Oh, what happened to leaf last night?

[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:04.560]
Treen up and leafs, baby.

[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:05.060]
And Detroit.

[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:05.680]
There you go.

[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:06.760]
Krujo, shout out.

[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:07.700]
Great shot.

[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:08.880]
Well, that's what it sounds like to me.

[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.300]
A 29 saves played great.

[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:11.240]
Okay, have a great day, sir.

[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:12.980]
You start with too much hockey talk here.

[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:13.600]
It'll be all over.

[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.560]
Two worlds for Sunday in one free, Antic Puro.

[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:16.540]
But too much hockey duck.

[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:22.160]
You're talking about staff that nobody carries about.

[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.220]
Don't you understand?

[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.980]
We want to talk about important things like the gap.

[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:28.860]
Social security.

[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.740]
How come old people can't vote?

[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:34.160]
How come we voted for a Nazi?

[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:35.320]
Things like that.

[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.840]
That's what they want to hear about.

[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:38.280]
All these yethos down here.

[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.020]
What was that bid I played today about?

[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.980]
Oh, is that Clinton thing about the quits and unless you're old people?

[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:47.360]
Quits on all the old people that floored and bought you off the hook.

[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:48.760]
Amen.

[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:51.640]
And then the real caper, the whole thing.

[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:53.600]
I get somebody living and breathing under the age of 100.

[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:56.400]
Some punk hit up there at the FSU and tell a hazy on the phone.

[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.180]
It's listening on the internet.

[01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.180]
And he's ripping the O out, it's boring.

[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:01.880]
Just keep yanking on the pal.

[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.080]
Maybe something on half-grids.

[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:03.360]
What's going on?

[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:03.860]
Already did.

[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.240]
Jesus Christ.

[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:09.460]
One dimensional freaking ass town.

[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.020]
And it's all happening here.

[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:11.720]
It's all about you.

[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.340]
Not about me.

[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:13.040]
I voted right.

[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:13.880]
It's all about you.

[01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:19.940]
And I'm sitting here thinking I'm trying to do something positive and to give me a little...

[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:20.320]
Oh, no.

[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:20.940]
I don't know.

[01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:21.460]
I was boring.

[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:23.360]
Entertainers, tickle us.

[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:23.580]
Okay.

[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:24.140]
Make us laugh.

[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:24.900]
Tickle us.

[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:25.760]
Stick your finger in our...

[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:28.260]
Let's see what a dark it is.

[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:30.500]
Uh-oh.

[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:32.180]
Here's a mobile and lake worth.

[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:32.420]
Hello.

[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:33.160]
Hello.

[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:34.020]
Okay.

[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.660]
Excuse my loss of words.

[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:39.720]
George taught me at a quick moment.

[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:45.720]
I was going to say about earlier the election problem up here in the same over-overbeaten...

[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:46.820]
The bush.

[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.380]
Unable to beat the bush in Palm Beach County.

[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:58.900]
If anybody couldn't see before what was set up to be just what they're doing now, they worked as far as they could to the courts and cats and now were going to just call it a new body of electors.

[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:03.500]
Because just like what says in Stay One, they were bound to steal the vote.

[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:11.920]
And everybody who keeps complaining and saying that I'll make up that the Democrats are changing the rules and crying now, it's been the same thing since November 7th.

[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:16.400]
They just won't let you say it in one body or one form so enough people to hear it.

[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.940]
It's got to be in you on, though, and nobody said it like outgore.

[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:20.600]
It's not going to make a statement about it.

[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:21.500]
Yeah.

[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:23.140]
I've just got ridiculous.

[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.820]
It's at the point now where you've had...

[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:31.180]
At least when the election was over, we thought of November 70th you could figure that 50% of the people that country voted each way.

[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.800]
50% of the people that voted.

[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:37.480]
So then you could figure that only half the people are on your idiots because they voted for Bush.

[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:40.180]
Well now it's up to the 70%, 75% range.

[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:40.780]
I'm getting worried.

[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:45.060]
75% of what?

[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:45.720]
What is it?

[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:52.220]
The way it's going now and more and more people say, of course you just give up and quit whining.

[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:52.500]
Yeah.

[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.320]
Instead of it being the fact that he's actually trying to do something for the party.

[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.440]
Well, I mean, not everybody...

[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.780]
I hate to break the news here, not everybody's going to agree with you.

[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:00.560]
That's just the way it is.

[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.900]
I voted the other day when we took the poll last time.

[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:03.580]
The other can see it.

[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:05.020]
I think it's time to get it over with.

[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:05.720]
That's my opinion.

[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:06.820]
Get it over with.

[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.680]
You guys have got a China and the Shansen hell, especially when the legislation is going to appoint Bush electors anyway.

[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:14.320]
They're all poised and ready to put the final nails in the conference.

[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:15.600]
Get it over with already.

[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.220]
And I happen to agree, by the way, with the blood.

[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:25.500]
I don't agree with them on lunch and he is a bozo, but the fact is, how in the world now can you just pick out the 9000 of our all-day bozo?

[01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:26.500]
Oh, well, we like these.

[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:28.120]
Okay. This is where we're going to find some votes.

[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:29.640]
And there's no credibility there.

[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:30.640]
That's ridiculous.

[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:38.060]
I told you weeks ago, and I told you a half an hour ago, and I'll say it again,

[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:43.260]
if you're going to have any recount, which is way too late, they should have been recounting the entire state.

[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.120]
If this is so important, and if they really wanted an accurate count,

[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:47.440]
then they want an accurate count?

[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:47.760]
No.

[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:52.900]
Now, the Bush people like it the way it is, cut it off now because we're ahead, and we've been ahead, keep trying to cut it off,

[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.500]
and the group people want to recount only in certain areas, because they've turned it pretty confident that's going to put them ahead.

[01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:58.640]
You can't do that.

[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:03.960]
The only ones who are going to have the accurate count like I told you is going to be either the hero,

[01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:08.240]
or these other news organizations that are going to come in under the Freedom of Information Act,

[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:10.780]
get a hold of all the ballots from all over the state, do the count,

[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:14.160]
and then months down the road, whenever it's going to be, they're going to say, hey, guess what? Here it is.

[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:16.340]
And who knows what it's going to be?

[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:17.600]
I can't tell you what it's going to be.

[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:24.740]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:29.200]
I mean, don't you like to see a good fight out there, and you know what, what's wrong with you?

[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:30.200]
Isn't that entertaining?

[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:30.580]
No.

[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:34.740]
Seeing a couple of guys rattle around, grabbing each other's jersey, and watching all these idiot fans,

[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:37.340]
and they're like, yeah, yeah, forming a demolition yelling and screaming.

[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:40.500]
Uh-huh.

[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:41.840]
Right.

[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.920]
That's certainly worth like 50, 60 bucks for a ticket to go see that.

[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:45.280]
No.

[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:45.620]
Not?

[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:50.080]
I think these people have a better time at the cock fight, if they ask me.

[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:51.700]
That's probably where all the people were last night.

[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:57.060]
Or maybe just fighting with their conscience.

[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:01.200]
26th afternoon at 560WQM.

[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.200]
The Neil Roger Show Sports Radio.

[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:07.000]
560QAM.

[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:08.320]
I drink it right, my pipe.

[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:13.500]
I believe poor as well as the rich, women and men alike citizens of every race,

[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:15.720]
create, and color all are equal.

[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:19.840]
They are equal, that is, so long as all of their votes, choose me.

[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:27.100]
If the people do not in the end choose me, I would then commit to contest this inaccurate and incomplete count.

[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:33.900]
In order to ensure they choose me, this is some America recount after recount God Bless America.

[01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:34.580]
All right.

[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:35.840]
1230 at 560WQAM.

[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:37.620]
Here's our poll so far.

[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:38.560]
This is our first poll.

[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.240]
We'll change it at 1 o'clock to something that somebody might be interested in, which they're not in this.

[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:44.480]
I mean, how could they be interested in this?

[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:47.800]
When a guy like Pavel Burick can't even put people in the stands, is anybody else going to do it?

[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:48.000]
No.

[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.260]
They don't even know who that is.

[01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:53.380]
And then this stupid headline in the Sun Central, Pavel's policeman on the way,

[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:56.280]
questioned Mark with another prof piece about from the organization,

[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:58.740]
all is below me by Michael Russo about Geno Ojic.

[01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.780]
Do we need Geno Ojic?

[01:58:59.840 --> 01:58:59.940]
Oh.

[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.040]
Another rule hack, Goon.

[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:02.160]
Just what we need.

[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:04.460]
Is that the problem Pavel needs a policeman?

[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:04.740]
No.

[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:05.560]
What, oh.

[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:09.200]
How do you guys that write this crap have any self respect?

[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:10.820]
I'd like to ask that question.

[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:12.260]
Anybody got an answer?

[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:12.820]
Oh, yeah.

[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:13.740]
Well, get the answer.

[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:16.340]
The same day, Michael Maywell apologizes to Dave Halberstam.

[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:17.480]
That's what we'll get the answer.

[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:19.280]
156 votes.

[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:21.560]
The Florida Panthers need the Fire Brian Murray won.

[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.160]
Fire Terry Murray 7.

[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:24.820]
Fire both of them 72.

[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.100]
Make a traitor to 8.

[01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:28.640]
Don't care about the Panthers at all.

[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:29.280]
68.

[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:33.580]
So if you take the 68 out of way from 156 is 8 and 86.

[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.280]
72 out of 86, Panther people say, fire both the rest.

[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:37.960]
How do you like that?

[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:38.940]
I like it.

[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:40.100]
Now let's do it.

[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.280]
Let's quit talking about it.

[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:42.180]
Let's do it.

[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:46.360]
Like Martha Washington said, let's do it.

[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:48.640]
Here's Kendall.

[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:48.940]
Hello.

[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:49.660]
Yeah, hello.

[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:50.860]
She would look cute in the red dress.

[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:51.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:51.860]
Hello, Neil.

[01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:52.700]
Yes, I am.

[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:58.760]
Listen, Neil, up until last night I thought the same way you thought there was no possible chance

[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:01.160]
for God to get in.

[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:01.640]
Uh-huh.

[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:09.420]
Now, some people before some time ago, I had a woman that they sent her a water registration

[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:10.700]
card.

[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:11.280]
Yeah.

[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.300]
And she was not even a citizen.

[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:15.860]
And she was afraid.

[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:17.220]
You know, she told me about it.

[02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:18.640]
So I told her, I said, just carry it up.

[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:27.200]
Now, last night when I was watching the Leon County Court, these employees that were in there,

[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:34.140]
when they were testifying, they were talking like they gave their statements, but the way they were saying like it,

[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:37.380]
they say, look, if there's anything wrong, I don't know nothing about it.

[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:39.600]
You know, that's the way they were talking.

[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:40.160]
Yeah.

[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:42.060]
So I look at that.

[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:43.160]
So what is there?

[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:43.980]
So what is that, Terry?

[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:46.720]
The judge is going to throw out 15,000 amps in the ballots because they didn't.

[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.840]
No, he doesn't have to throw out 15,000.

[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:52.520]
He can throw out the ones that they had the dispute with.

[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:57.220]
Otherwise, you can call in and you can give a number.

[02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:00.300]
Do you know how the people get fake IDs?

[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:02.480]
You go to a point here.

[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:04.940]
Don't go off on a tangent, please.

[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:06.320]
It's confusing enough already.

[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:08.480]
Don't go off on a tangent about fake IDs.

[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:09.840]
It's too late for that, okay?

[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:10.460]
Yeah, I know.

[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:12.660]
Yeah, but you're right, Neil.

[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:14.160]
Thank you.

[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:18.080]
Hooray!

[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:26.740]
Four half-bond of questions about the US Supreme Court.

[02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:30.280]
Well, I guess those perceptions are in...

[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:33.860]
566-705-60, 05-60, 05-60, 08-10-10-10-10-10-10-10.

[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:34.620]
For lives in wireless land.

[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:36.100]
Let's go go with some fake ID.

[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:37.120]
Of course, be aware of that.

[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:38.020]
I see a club in Lannis.

[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:39.000]
The owner is still.

[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:39.960]
He's hanging in there.

[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:40.960]
He's playing a hard ball.

[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:42.680]
He's hard.

[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:49.420]
You see that first of all they haven't kicked anybody out under 21 even though the city of Fort Lauderdale said you got to do it

[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:52.280]
They're not doing it in addition to what now is company the new scam

[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:56.260]
He's going to hire the underage crowd to duck the Lauderdale rule against young customers

[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:06.180]
It says the new legion of Atlantis employees will be paid $5.50 intense an hour for one hour each month to distribute fries critical of city officials

[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:12.260]
I'm a civic-minded individual my intent is to be the largest employer in South Florida said owner Michael Canterbury Island

[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:18.580]
We're just going to grid the entire city these are young people obviously wait the establishment and then more excited about it than I am

[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:23.960]
Can't set his new promotional assistance will carry employee ID cards have sexual harassment

[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:27.880]
Prevention training and will necessitate is hiring two more payroll quirks

[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:32.100]
When they show up at the late night ocean front club they'll pay a cover charges

[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:35.160]
They always have but they'll be off duty employees exempt from the law

[02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:40.080]
Vice mayor Tim Smith he's an asshole says isn't that crazy?

[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:46.780]
Do you think it's crazy? I don't think it's crazy. It's a way to get around an unfair law a discriminatory law

[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:54.800]
What do you think if they had some kind of an establishment some kind of a restaurant some kind of a well maybe a bar slash restaurant

[02:02:54.800 --> 02:03:00.200]
And they said well, we're second-tired of all these old people stealing the sweet and low and drooling all over the table and

[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:07.200]
Messing their pants and their bags are spilling over and we're gonna like just banned people over the years of our 65 not tip and skipping on the check

[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.380]
How long you think that would last in this town about

[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:11.360]
Half a second

[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:18.440]
Do you talk about the gay the great Panthers or the Florida Panthers?

[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:22.580]
I mean there they'd be a we're on the streets. They'd be blood. They'd be squeezing their bags out

[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:25.300]
And think of on the streets if they try to pull crap like that

[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:31.380]
But oh no, we can discriminate against young people because generally speaking. This is Florida and we hate young people

[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:36.780]
Not that we dislike them. We hate them like poison and we're a scared of them

[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:39.520]
Here's Fort Myers. Hello

[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:43.020]
Hey, yeah, there's a couple points about the election that um

[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:43.920]
uh

[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.800]
You know don't you think it should be illegal that ballots are sent out just to Republicans

[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:54.040]
Yeah, you know, I mean they weren't ballots. They were applications you're talking about yeah

[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:57.780]
What are they gonna be doing next going door to door and you know just telling them all

[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:03.320]
Oh here just sign on the ballot. How about Jeb Bush those letters? He sent out recruiting voters to a vote from the comfort of their home

[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:07.160]
He wasn't sending any letters out to democrats and I'm a I'm an independent voter

[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:14.680]
The only thing that I got in the mail was a forum stating that my polling place had been moved and for me to be able to vote

[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:15.160]
um

[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:18.140]
This year and of course I voted two years ago

[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:25.600]
It's the same place that I would have to go and come down to the voters registration and fill out all the forms paperwork

[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:26.400]
blah blah blah

[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:31.120]
And uh that was the only way that I was gonna be able to vote and when I initially got that was about

[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:33.860]
I was learning for anyone else got that too

[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:39.640]
But it was about four or five months before the election and at that time I just threw it away because it was kind of a big hassle

[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:46.120]
And I ended up calling about three weeks before the election and uh to the voter registration

[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:51.400]
I told me there was no problem my polling place had not been moved and there was no problem

[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:58.160]
And I was just wondering if any other people that might have got this just you know and threw it away

[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:01.700]
It just thought well, you know, it's just a big hassle. I'm not even gonna bother about it

[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:03.900]
We were having calls on the election day

[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:10.640]
From people who were going to polling places a ring tool that they were in the wrong place or that they couldn't voted a certain precinct

[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:13.800]
Even though they had already notified of the change of address

[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.860]
There were more irregularities than uh than there are

[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:21.780]
The movements among senior citizens in this town for in this election and it's it's unbelievable

[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:27.740]
Any else something nobody will ever know the answer nobody will ever know the story ridiculous

[02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:33.940]
But the whole thing well good luck to us pal hang on tight and fire the murders. Okay fire the murders. There you go

[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:38.740]
85 say fire both of them out of a hundred and uh two

[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:43.520]
106 who really care about it. I'm I'm the action advanced that I don't care about the panthers. You know what?

[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.680]
We don't care either

[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:49.660]
All right, that's gonna be our poor question someday. Do you care about anything?

[02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:54.580]
No, I'm not seriously. Do you care about anything? Yes or no? We don't want to make it complicated

[02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:56.560]
I guarantee there'll be people will say no

[02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.720]
More guarantee

[02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:03.900]
You care about anything oh

[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:05.680]
Well, let me just say

[02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:12.040]
Great you live a lot longer that way 22 to 1 at 560 QAM

[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:15.360]
This is 560 QAM

[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:18.760]
Just in time for Christmas

[02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:24.020]
It's the most dangerous toy on the planet daddy. I gotta have one

[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:27.780]
So it's a detonator daddy. I want it

[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:32.540]
Oh, a detonator

[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:38.940]
It'll break your head. Prope out your eye break your neck and give you diarrhea for a week to 10 days

[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:40.480]
The

[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:44.460]
Maybe harmful it's well

[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:49.480]

[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:52.780]
Okay, five six mommy you don't want to get carried away and do a whole thing

[02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:54.540]
I actually have two or two people show up

[02:06:55.100 --> 02:07:01.560]
Food provided by see that's really something when you have free food good food too from our buddies. I run Scott

[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:07.360]
At Atlantic City, Substant Hollywood good food and nobody shows up. They know it's a lost cause

[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:13.120]
Now that's your good friend Johnny that keeps doing that to you nice going Johnny. You know Johnny. He's an asshole

[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:15.040]
Here's Wellington. Hello

[02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:16.800]
Uncle Neil. Yes, sir

[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:19.040]
First of all I wish you happy

[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:24.280]
The holiday and the same to you and anyway, I'm calling on Noah hockey expert, you know

[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:30.500]
But I finally went to my first Panther game. What was that and that was Friday night with the Red Wings game

[02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:33.200]
I was in section 125 roast seven. Uh-huh

[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:36.780]
Well, at least we had some people in there that night most of more Red Wings fans, but we had some

[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:40.960]
Anyway, it was incredible. I really really enjoyed myself. I did notice that the

[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:43.620]
Panthers were somewhat sluggish in that game

[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:47.700]
Some were sluggish in that game. That's the best game they played in the other than the Leafs game

[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:51.340]
But that's the best home game they played in a long time. Yeah, um, and it wasn't that good

[02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:55.500]
Well, I you know for the seats. I see here. They run about $60 a ticket here

[02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:58.440]
Uh-huh, and you look like you pay a dollar for a seat

[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:01.340]
seat fee and

[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.700]
With the tax on that way out of my league

[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:06.420]
But I wanted to say that I really enjoyed it

[02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:08.860]
And if no one has ever been to a game they must

[02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:13.340]
Experience it because it was just incredible had a great time had a good fans around me and all that

[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:20.060]
And uh, well, yeah, I mean you were lucky there was there was a pretty entertaining game at least I mean the Red Wings weren't even that good either

[02:08:20.060 --> 02:08:21.460]
I it was pretty mediocre

[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:24.520]
But I mean compare if you would have been there for the Carolina game last Wednesday

[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:27.800]
Or if you would have made a disastrous decision and decided to show up last night

[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:30.640]
I don't think you'd be saying the same thing. You know saying I want to refund

[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:34.480]
Well, for the first time it was it was just incredible. I really enjoyed it

[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:38.160]
And one thing I want to tell people who go for the first time make sure you bring a sweater

[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:43.120]
Yeah, it was I was freezing my buns off and a book in a flashlight. Okay. Thanks. I'm glad you had a good time

[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:47.100]
Thank you. Yeah, I've been trying for years to get people to come out especially when the crowds are doing like me

[02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:50.040]
But I'm not gonna do that anymore because I can't do it in good conscience

[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:54.360]
I can't tell you to go and spend that kind of money and come out in the night after night after night

[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.500]
See what we saw like this is like two years ago was the same thing

[02:08:58.560 --> 02:08:59.820]
karma coma city

[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:06.140]
And even when they played teams the girls teams like Atlanta and the islanders you think okay

[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:11.460]
We're gonna go out there kicks a mess at least it'll be exciting pick on some little girls there and and they forget their ass kicked

[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:17.900]
It's a disaster. It's it's the disaster of if you care about it even even minimally

[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:22.680]
It's a disaster of humongous proportions and yet nobody seems to understand it

[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:27.140]
Which is why these people who she had been out here a long time ago are still employed

[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:30.180]
Still seeing a paycheck like a lot of people are on here

[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:34.380]
All I guess it was up in our book and our box last night the Q&A box

[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:38.120]
Gary Sarner was up there and so I don't want to say I don't even know the guy's name

[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.740]
But somebody came down. I guess one of our sponsors is somebody who's a fan of this show

[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:46.560]
And he said oh, you know Gary Sarner's up there in your Q&A box. I said yeah, he said you're right. He said he's an asshole

[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:54.420]
Here's a Davie hello, hey deal. Yes, sir. I can't agree with you that gorsha give up now

[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.700]
I mean, I think he it's important that he's fought as long as he has yeah, I thought the good fight

[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:03.960]
Well, I want point you give up well, there's what it was the date. What's the date?

[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:08.580]
Uh, that's a good question, but hey, depending on what this opinion says

[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:13.260]
I mean as far as the the the state Supreme Court to depend on what the reasoning is either way, but

[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:19.300]
Right now we didn't really I don't think the people. I don't know if they still do understand or understood before that

[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:22.180]
There's really no right to vote with respect to the presidency

[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:24.940]
There's there is no such right and not only is there no such right

[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:30.800]
But there's not there's actually a constitutional guarantee that there will never be a right in that regard

[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:37.380]
That can't be taken away that the state legislature is the soul is the soul body that basically controls all these things

[02:10:37.380 --> 02:10:42.500]
I think it's important that people understand that that that issue be flushed out and it's interesting

[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:47.780]
I mean when you when you when you complain that everybody in the whole state should should have their vote recounted

[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:52.220]
I don't really disagree with you is in terms of equity like that would be the right thing to do

[02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:58.380]
But according to the to the Supreme Court's opinion their last opinion they pretty much said that what's right doesn't really matter

[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:04.220]
The only thing that matters is what the law says what the what the legislature said and the legislature didn't say anything about a

[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:11.680]
So so in other words if Gora can go and steal the election now if he can if his lawyers can go in there in finagle and get them to all account

[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:17.460]
Those 9,000 votes or 14,000 weapons going to be and if he can eat can head by 100 or 200 votes in in that amount

[02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:20.100]
Then that's gonna make people happy then that's the way we ought to do it

[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:23.580]
But what you're saying I would I'm saying I mean here we are all of us grow people

[02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:25.060]
We were not can bush for trying to steal

[02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:27.060]
Yeah, look and can I say something?

[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:29.960]
Yes, I try to run out the clock and what you're saying is well

[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:35.700]
It's just a matter of illegal technicality if Gorkin still doesn't he ought to steal it well not it sort of that's not exactly

[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:41.720]
But what I'm really saying is that is it in reality more people really did vote for Gora for a lot of different reasons

[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:48.780]
I mean in in West Palm Beach and in in Seminole County if the Democrats had been that would have the same advantages the Republicans had

[02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:50.620]
And all the rest there were a lot of basic

[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.180]
Issues of unfairness

[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:55.260]
Well, that it's gorge getting the majority of the vote and I wait a minute

[02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:57.660]
Unfairness like the people of voter from Buchanan

[02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:02.060]
Uh, and I think that the ballot was illegal, but the Supreme Court said it wasn't illegal

[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:05.980]
I'm because courts aren't gonna throw out elections it almost never happened right

[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:11.140]
I'm not really disagree with that, but I what I'm saying is I'm the merits in terms of what the people of Florida really wanted

[02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:15.340]
The majority of people that went to vote really did go there to vote for Gora

[02:12:15.340 --> 02:12:18.380]
Yeah, well you you can't you can't have results of elections based on

[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:19.640]
I agree

[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:24.980]
I'm not sort of okay bringing experts like kaiatris that we've already had we've already had the statisticians now

[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:30.320]
Let's bring in some mind readers and tarot card readers and have them read the minds of the electorate and decide what they really wanted

[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.480]
You can't decide an election that way you know that

[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.040]
So what you're saying is that we should decide the election based on the law and if we're gonna decide the election based on the law

[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:38.040]
Then we've got to do it right

[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:42.920]
You know, we've got it. We've got it. We have to follow it through all the way what you're saying is it may be illegal

[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:45.600]
Technicality the results in Gora winning the election

[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:51.060]
But at least he'll win on a technicality and he'll win on the merits too because he should have been elected anyways

[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:55.420]
Well, I think if we would have had a good candidate he probably would I completely agree? I didn't vote for him either

[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:57.920]
Yeah, I mean, you know you used to yell at me a lot about that

[02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:59.600]
But you know you're probably gonna hang up coming now

[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:01.580]
No more because you didn't vote for Gora

[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:05.920]
Yeah, I wouldn't vote I mean I couldn't vote for him. I couldn't I couldn't make myself vote for him

[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:09.620]
Even though I can't stand but I had to take a burium anime in the morning of election day just to again

[02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:12.220]
I have to go and do it. I'd like to watch that. Thanks. Thanks

[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:18.200]
Gonna hang up on him because he didn't vote for Gora talk to all kinds of people over your vote for Gora even one or two voted for Bush

[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:19.680]
560

[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:20.760]
0560

[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:26.520]
pound 560 on the 18th day this David boys. He's getting on my nerves. I don't like him. I like the guy from

[02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:31.680]
The Jewish guy from what was named that was up there in Seminole County. I can't think of his name again when they ran against the

[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:32.300]
Rosanna Dana

[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:36.120]
He's good and the other one I like was the guy that was also up there in

[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:36.880]
judge

[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:37.200]
um

[02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:38.980]
Sal's court

[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:42.080]
I got to look like Bob Eisenberg with a better hairdo

[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:45.240]
You know the one I'm sorry. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. He was great

[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:50.080]
He wasn't taking any crap see what I think very richard did this morning in front of the Florida Supreme Court

[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:51.000]
And I'm no expert

[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:56.300]
But I think that when you're having oral arguments in front of the US Supreme Court or any states of Supreme Court

[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:59.980]
You don't go to tell a hashi and talk to a bunch of guys like that like that

[02:14:00.580 --> 02:14:03.100]
Huh to good thing for them. Oh green was none that panel

[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:13.540]
He he wasn't arguing he was lecturing he kept lecturing them and he was uh, I thought gonna he was on the verge of losing it a couple of times

[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:19.620]
Not that that's gonna make any difference, but I just thought that his ambiance his whole decorum spunk

[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.480]
In addition to which how come he won't really tell us we voted for come on Barry. We know who you voted for

[02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:31.620]
Rhymes with okay, thank you very much. We're gonna send you to telehansi and you and the guy the kid that called before

[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:34.300]
You can have a two-way with yourselves

Martin County

[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:19.580]
Republicans yeah, and when they were being questioned they all have a

[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:25.780]
Lawson memory and then they also said they did not know the law that it was against the law

[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:28.280]
To uh tamper with a

[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:30.420]
Gallup to change them

[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:35.380]
Well, no, we win another 10 there now all of a sudden they were tampering with the balance

[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:43.920]
With a ballot request. Oh, they get the application the applications. They took the ballot the allegations of anybody tampering with ballots

[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:48.120]
Yeah, no, they took the ballot request home right to change the numbers right

[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:52.700]
Okay, they all pleaded that they didn't know it was a

[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:59.460]
Foundation of the law. Yeah, I had a nuncle it did nine months there for for accepting two used tires that somebody gave him

[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:02.400]
All right, you didn't know the law right that's right. You know some laws

[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:09.800]
In jail uh-huh and ignorance is no excuse there. Oh, that's what I would say to most of the callers right right and uh

[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:15.980]
This is just an extension of uh the second president second the term that the old man

[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:20.800]
Well, thank you because yeah, I'm getting an urban my ibs in my uh is coming back again

[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:23.940]
No, it is in my grud in my auditor from listening to that voice

[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:26.700]
No, is that aren't you getting agitated?

[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:30.800]
Man, oh man if he could just have one good explosive

[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:33.900]

[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.420]
Let's get those buttons ready again one for each older BM and TM

[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:44.000]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:46.840]

[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:50.180]
Yeah, how you doing? Okay, first time caller um

[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:55.760]
What do you think about after all this is done the next election when goers gonna run against push again

[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:59.880]
That's gonna be the old voice not gonna run again. There was no china man chance that's gonna happen

[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:04.080]
Uh, that'd be like a circus. I think that he's playing all this out too

[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:08.060]
Did you did you did anything? I just say register. Did you hear it? We've got a bad connection

[02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:11.540]
Goers not gonna be the democratic candidate nine in 2004

[02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:14.000]
There was many chance of that

[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:18.500]
Yeah, well if he if he loses I mean if by some nuric only one of course that would be different

[02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:23.620]
But if he push wins goers not gonna run against him again. Okay. Well, what do you think now with uh

[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:26.260]
J W you know W getting in and

[02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:32.060]
Kib bushes the governor wouldn't it be better for Florida since he's the president and governor's

[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:33.660]
Kib oh, yeah

[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:39.760]
Yeah, you know what's gonna be better for florida in two years when we elected new governor. That's what's gonna be better for a flow. Yeah

[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.860]
567 now that I noticed call from LA now it can only be is it the same person that call it?

[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:49.740]
Uh, is this the same person we've talked to twice already this week from LA?

[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:52.220]
No, I'm not the same person

[02:17:53.960 --> 02:18:02.480]
Yeah, I just wanted to say I think the ballot reason why gore has lost it as you say and I believe that he has lost

[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:06.000]
It's because they sent alien back to Cuba. Yeah

[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:09.700]
That was a big mistake because that crossed him a couple of years ago

[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:13.980]
This is the same person that called early and we could probably not in the LA and probably in a that said the same thing

[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:15.000]
A couple of days ago

[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:20.540]
We're not interested in alien. Okay. I don't give a flying crap about alien happy birthday to him

[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:24.720]
Yesterday and that's it and the hope he enjoys his happy meal or unhappy meal

[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:31.000]
Like I told you during the midst of what it was going on alien Gonzalez doesn't know about to a goddamn p-hole in the snow

[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:31.760]
Okay

[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:35.820]
It wasn't an important story then it's not an important story now

[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:41.260]
Just like the five-year-old boy that's over there with his mother that ran off of 150 grand for some reason evidently

[02:18:41.260 --> 02:18:44.440]
They decided that wasn't important story. There is nobody talking about that

[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:53.400]
And people vote for all kinds of reasons and if you were expecting if our gore would all have his stupid pandering

[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:54.700]
With that crap about well

[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:58.300]
I think it should have been in the family course with that garbage and by sending

[02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:03.840]
Jewel Lieberman down a Jewel Lieberman to Jorge Moss's tombstone and to stand there and cry crocodile tears

[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:07.060]
If that was going to have any influence of the damn Cuban community in San Florida

[02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:09.060]
Then I got some very cheap old stale

[02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:12.600]
Hall of Auto said it wasn't going to work then and it didn't work

[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.880]
So if you want to start doing your Cuban bashing first of all

[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:22.760]
They'll keep telling us your call from LA number one and number two find someplace else to find a station in Sandy

[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:24.840]
Peyton is on okay like W.O.F.F

[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:32.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 to all we did have a point

[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:37.440]
12 50s I always say he did have a point just because you know because it makes a lot of a Cuban haters out there feel

[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:39.480]
But oh they start squeezing themselves. Oh yeah

[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:43.800]
Well, whatever you would like. Okay, whatever group you want to hate today because it is out Florida

[02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:48.680]
It is the state of hate then that go ahead feel better about it because you got nothing else to do down here

[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:53.380]
Maybe we should preface that poor question other than hate do you care about anything

[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:57.660]
Okay, here is our pool. Let me give you the result of this poor, which was a waste of time

[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:00.640]
But I just did it for my own satisfaction

[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:03.240]
The Florida Panthers need to

[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:07.420]
Fire Brian Marie to fire Terry Marie eight make a traitor to

[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:08.380]
13 right

[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:13.460]
Fire both Marie's 109 and I don't care about the panthers 87

[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:19.720]
Okay, let's get rid of that polar because like I said it was a waste of time. Here's our poll for today and tonight

[02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:24.840]
Do you think the Florida Supreme Court will order a recount of any votes?

[02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:28.060]
Yes, no or I don't care anymore

[02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:31.840]
Well, we got to start giving the indifferent people a reason to get on there

[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:35.520]
So I told him I got him crap was coming back my

[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:36.460]

Donner and Lutton,

[02:21:08.220 --> 02:21:09.840]
But to recall,

[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:14.640]
The most famous raindrops

[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:15.640]
A long,

[02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:19.020]
Rudolph's the well hung reindeer,

[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:22.620]
Had a very lengthy hoes,

[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:25.760]
And when he got excited,

[02:21:26.940 --> 02:21:29.260]
It stuck out way past his nose,

[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:32.760]
All of the other reindeer,

[02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:36.020]
Wanted water to let wooden go,

[02:21:37.380 --> 02:21:39.600]
Turns out that Rudy's organ,

[02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:42.760]
Was getting stuck in the snow,

[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:47.240]
Then one buggy Christmas scene,

[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:49.820]
With the Santa Claus to say,

[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:51.360]
Rudolph,

[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.100]
With your tooth so long,

[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:57.240]
Won't you drive me on the lawn?

[02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:00.060]
You're all of the reindeer hating,

[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:03.300]
He's the favorite one to come,

[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:06.960]
Rudolph the well hung reindeer,

[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:10.240]
Get to bang Mrs. Claus!

[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:11.620]
Oh, right!

[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:14.320]
102 at 560 WQM,

[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:16.000]
Here's another one of these ridiculous facts,

[02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:17.100]
Just wanted to let you know,

[02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:17.800]
If you didn't know already,

[02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:19.820]
Mary O'Lean is returning to the penguins this month.

[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:20.560]
Didn't I just,

[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:21.300]
A little while ago,

[02:22:21.460 --> 02:22:22.840]
Get you reading that thing on the...

[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:25.500]
Yeah.

[02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:31.100]
560, 705, 60 pound,

[02:22:31.220 --> 02:22:32.220]
I mean, what's the use, you know?

[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:33.960]
Are they listening?

[02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:34.420]
No.

[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:37.100]
They're listening about as much as what I'm talking to these people on the phone,

[02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:38.560]
And I'll listen to a word that I'm saying.

[02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:41.200]
Trying to get an edge-wise just,

[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:42.160]
At least to make it look good,

[02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:42.880]
Like I'm paying attention,

[02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:43.980]
Whatever's coming out of their push,

[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:46.020]
But it doesn't work, they don't care.

[02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:46.840]
They're not listening.

[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:50.020]
Here's a mobile and a fort waterdale, hello.

[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:53.940]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:54.840]
This is not mobile.

[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:56.660]
Here's a stationary and fort waterdale.

[02:22:56.720 --> 02:22:57.220]
There we go.

[02:22:57.420 --> 02:22:58.140]
Real quick.

[02:22:58.200 --> 02:22:58.960]
Neil, did you hear that?

[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:01.540]
I'm a job offer that was made to Al Gore,

[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:03.380]
If he, when he does not get the presidency.

[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:04.760]
Now, what is that, sir?

[02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:07.180]
He's offered to work at KAPC,

[02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:08.140]
I believe in Los Angeles.

[02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:08.640]
Yeah.

[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:11.080]
And he's with one of your favorite people.

[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:13.040]
Al, let's try to tell.

[02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:14.340]
That'll make your group quit out.

[02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:15.760]
I thought you'd find that interesting.

[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:16.580]
Two boring people.

[02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:19.380]
And then we got that Michael Jackson twerp on there,

[02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:20.060]
That British guy.

[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:20.940]
I don't know him.

[02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:21.860]
Three boring people.

[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:22.640]
There we go.

[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:23.740]
Okay, thanks for the good news.

[02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:24.020]
Welcome.

[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:24.400]
Thanks.

[02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:26.640]
Oh, boy, that should get some good ratings out.

[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:26.820]
No.

[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:28.720]
5607-0560,

[02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:30.560]
Pound 560 on the AT&T,

[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:32.240]
and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.220]
Here's a mobile and a cross-spring.

[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:35.540]
Hello.

[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:36.920]
Hey, hello.

[02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:37.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:39.980]
I'm short.

[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:40.880]
Don't be short.

[02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:41.800]
Long time, Lister.

[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:43.140]
First time colony.

[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:43.520]
Oh.

[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:45.180]
The Lister is about 10 years.

[02:23:46.100 --> 02:23:46.920]
About the Panthers.

[02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:50.420]
I haven't seen him take it holder.

[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:54.320]
And I've seen six and 121.

[02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:55.320]
I've seen you across the way.

[02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:56.320]
You're in 102, right?

[02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:57.300]
That is correct.

[02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:57.940]
Whatever it is.

[02:23:58.040 --> 02:23:58.220]
101.

[02:23:58.420 --> 02:23:58.540]
Yeah.

[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:00.240]
I'm a Rob Eddie.

[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:04.080]
Don't you think that Lister the playoffs,

[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:07.740]
they play poorly, very poorly last year?

[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.340]
I mean, I'm sorry?

[02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:09.880]
Yeah.

[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:12.320]
Well, and what I'm saying is that,

[02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:15.200]
I mean, it seems like it's a carryover from last year.

[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:18.360]
They have no desire to...

[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:20.260]
I don't think it has anything to do with last year.

[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:23.520]
I don't think a team plays a whole season the way they played for four games.

[02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:25.580]
They got swept and only played four games in the playoffs.

[02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:27.580]
I don't think one has got anything to do with the other.

[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:30.080]
I think this team suffers from a rack of talent.

[02:24:30.220 --> 02:24:32.420]
I keep telling people that you'll look at their roster.

[02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:33.500]
You look at the people on there.

[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:37.100]
They traded the way a 30-goal score who played last night in Stuckley,

[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:39.320]
and then they were in there to add salt to the wound.

[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:41.280]
Mark Parrish.

[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:42.620]
And they didn't replace him with anybody.

[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:43.980]
Only Yoke and into joke.

[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:44.800]
Yeah.

[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:46.140]
Well, I can agree with that.

[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:47.080]
But I can agree with that.

[02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:48.420]
Go ahead.

[02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:50.400]
It's damn discouraging, though,

[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:53.740]
and it's kind of money to go and see.

[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:55.280]
And I don't know.

[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:55.780]
I don't know.

[02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:57.460]
I agree with you.

[02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:59.540]
I don't blame people for not paying money to go see that.

[02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:00.980]
Last night, I'll say it again.

[02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:02.280]
They should have been given a refund sound.

[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:03.980]
No, I agree.

[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:07.960]
I mean, when you're there, you got 6,000 seats, you know, empty.

[02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:09.080]
I mean, just I don't know.

[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.460]
Like you said, it's a brooch league town.

[02:25:10.460 --> 02:25:10.960]
I don't know.

[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:11.960]
Okay.

[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:12.600]
Well, let me-

[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:13.180]
Good afternoon, Michelle.

[02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:14.020]
How about you, baby, anyway?

[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:16.520]
Don't pass us.

[02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:17.080]
Okay.

[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:19.780]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:20.900]
Woo!

[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:25.300]
What I really meant was,

[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:26.440]
ahhhh!

[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:30.200]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60.

[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:34.060]
On the 18T got all lots and lots of open lines here now.

[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:35.140]
Lots of lines.

[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:36.940]
How's the pool coming so far, the new one?

[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:40.100]
You think the Florida Supreme Court will order a recount of any votes?

[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:43.040]
Yes, 3, but no.

[02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:44.240]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:45.980]
Now, including me, I voted no.

[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:48.840]
Here's plantation.

[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:49.300]
Hello.

[02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:50.460]
Hello.

[02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:50.960]
Yes.

[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:56.780]
I want to know, why is it that nobody has brought up the subject that-

[02:25:58.020 --> 02:25:58.940]
What's his name?

[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:01.720]
The presidential candidate with Bush, Cheney.

[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:06.560]
He's not really in Missouri or is it with Wyoming?

[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:12.020]
And that he was not able to vote only in Texas.

[02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:15.860]
And I thought the president and the vice president of the presidential candidate-

[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:17.500]
Let me answer this question.

[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:19.160]
What difference does that make now?

[02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:20.900]
Because it's against the law.

[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:22.820]
You mean like Hillary Clinton living in New York?

[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:25.620]
She is a legal resident of New York.

[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:27.660]
Yeah, well, I'm sure he's got a legal residence in New York.

[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:29.660]
No, I believe he was turned down today.

[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:31.400]
What difference does it make?

[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:34.260]
Because then they shouldn't be able to run.

[02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:36.380]
Okay, well, he can't run too fast anyway.

[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:37.040]
He's got a bad heart.

[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:39.760]
56670560.

[02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:41.480]
Oh, God, say it again.

[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:41.760]
Oh!

[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:46.360]
He feels so much better every time I play that.

[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:48.160]
I'm just going to do that for four hours one day.

[02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:48.940]
Get out of my system.

[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:51.460]
I bet you all the grud the IBS and all those vanishes.

[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:54.160]
You just flow to right out like an internal exorcism.

[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:00.980]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Lines.

[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:04.120]
And then the Senate or county ballot truck closing arguments soon.

[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:06.920]
Here's a lady in Naples.

[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:07.200]
Hello.

[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:08.500]
Hi.

[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:09.340]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:14.820]
I just want to know how come nobody ever put the dots together for these Republicans and Dave County?

[02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:21.740]
Same one who were all upset about the citrus trees being cut down and how they never put it all together and said,

[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:23.540]
oh yeah, Republican governor.

[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:26.660]
Brotherhood, Republican candidate.

[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:27.300]
They're stupid.

[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:28.180]
They don't get it.

[02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:30.540]
These are the same people, or at least some of them.

[02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:33.660]
They're always screaming about the Cubans and about the Fidel and the Lian.

[02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:34.620]
Oh, no.

[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:36.640]
But when it comes politically, man, they're all jumping together.

[02:27:36.660 --> 02:27:36.980]
Oh, yeah.

[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:38.420]
That's like, duh.

[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:40.180]
I'll put two and two together already.

[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:40.720]
No, they're not.

[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:41.760]
You're giving them too much credit.

[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:47.340]
And then the other thing is, will somebody please find this a white version of Jesse Jackson and send him to Collier County?

[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:49.920]
Yeah, only when it's a convenient, only when we need him.

[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:51.260]
No, seriously.

[02:27:51.260 --> 02:28:00.460]
Because there was like major episodes of voter-dustin-fanshidesman over here, oddly enough, they were all Democrats who registered under the murder voter law.

[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:00.900]
Is that the coincidence?

[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:03.100]
Yeah, just the coincidence, for sure.

[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:03.400]

[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:03.800]
Well, good luck with that.

[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:05.740]
Nothing to do with the outcome of the election.

[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:08.040]
And don't forget if it doesn't fit your full-ish mitt.

[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:08.960]
Exactly.

[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:10.440]
Thank you.

[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:11.000]
Bye-bye.

[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:14.600]
Look at that mountain valley water just brought us in a whole crap load of great stuff.

[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:15.180]
Great water.

[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:15.620]
Thank you.

[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.180]
God bless America.

[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:16.920]
Isn't that great?

[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:19.840]
See, now we're starting to get back on the right track again.

[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:20.780]
We're getting some water.

[02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:23.620]
We're going to start holding our water and getting those.

[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:24.520]
What's going to happen next?

[02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:26.840]
Look at that.

[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:28.380]
Gee, there's enough there to sink a battleship.

[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:31.300]
Probably somebody will steal that just like they stole my carb.

[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:36.580]
We're not going to, we'll have a special mark on the bottles that we make special.

[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:39.540]
Yeah, we're going to start to take care of some of these baskets in this building.

[02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:41.800]
Keeps to stealing the crap like my whole can.

[02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:43.000]
And we'd like two scoops out of there.

[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:43.940]
And a whole can was sitting there.

[02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:45.140]
And I come in as more and it's gone.

[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:46.120]
And I predicted that tonight.

[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:46.360]
Yeah.

[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:50.480]
We're going to start putting like some real interesting crap underlying the ESC and that.

[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:51.720]
Well, you know, there's a lot in here.

[02:28:51.780 --> 02:28:52.980]
We're going to start leaving some bait.

[02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:54.760]
Those water bottles are already green.

[02:28:55.380 --> 02:28:55.700]
Yeah.

[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:57.280]
So, squirt, squirt.

[02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:58.480]
God only knows what's going to be there.

[02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:00.320]
In fact, Miguel's working on filling some of them right now.

[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:00.740]
Look at that.

[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:04.240]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60.

[02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:05.560]
Thank you, sir.

[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:07.560]
And God bless America, like I said.

[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:09.240]
Because at the end of the speech, you always have to say,

[02:29:09.380 --> 02:29:10.440]
that's what the politicians say.

[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:11.500]
God bless America.

[02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:12.600]
Does anybody impress by that?

[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:14.420]
Not only a bunch of Yahoo's and morons,

[02:29:14.420 --> 02:29:16.300]
which I think I'm being redundant now.

[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:19.660]
Thank God, both Mountain Valley Water Company.

[02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:20.560]
Boy, I love those folks.

[02:29:20.940 --> 02:29:22.020]
I could old buddy Bob Levin.

[02:29:23.380 --> 02:29:25.460]
And the new guys, which I don't remember what their name,

[02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:27.460]
or whatever they are, whoever they are, we love them.

[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:29.660]
Good stuff from Hot Spring Arkansas.

[02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:31.560]
We like anything from Arkansas.

[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:33.920]
Boba, Hot Springs, Mountain Valley Water.

[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:37.420]
In fact, you know, you probably read that a lot of the celebrities,

[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:41.940]
a lot of movies, there's other people when they go like on location to fill movies

[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:42.900]
or they go on vacations.

[02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:46.100]
They have Mountain Valley Water shipped in in their suites.

[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:47.260]
Yeah, no, it doesn't do.

[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:50.220]
I don't want to mention that Michael Jackson is one of those people.

[02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:53.460]
But, well, he can hold his water.

[02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:55.680]
And probably yours too, but you're too old.

[02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:59.820]
The Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio 560.

[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:01.280]
QA.

[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:03.500]
Okay, I bet you thought this was something important.

[02:30:03.660 --> 02:30:04.260]
You just brought me, right?

[02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:06.880]
No, well, maybe it is.

[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:07.200]
I'll get it.

[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:07.240]
I'll get it.

[02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:07.460]

[02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:08.660]
I'll get it.

[02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:09.220]
Magazine?

[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:10.000]
Yeah.

[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:11.320]
No.

[02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:14.120]
It's a catalog from the Evin Turumall.

[02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:15.960]
Oh.

[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:20.460]
And a bunch of holiday gift checks, discounts and stuff like that.

[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:22.260]
Well, thank you very much, Evin Turumall.

[02:30:23.220 --> 02:30:23.640]
It is good.

[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:24.280]
Yeah, huh?

[02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:25.260]
Like a good catalog?

[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:26.680]
Well, I don't know, you want it?

[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:27.240]
Yeah.

[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:28.320]
I got a shop.

[02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:31.280]
Okay, there you go.

[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:32.160]
Thank you, Evin Turumall.

[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:32.860]
That was something good.

[02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:34.700]
Thank you very much.

[02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:36.880]
Oh, we did get the Good Mountain Valley Water.

[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:38.400]
I got some very important stuff here.

[02:30:38.900 --> 02:30:40.360]
All the way to the second page of this.

[02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:42.220]
God dang.

[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:45.260]
Well, the second, third and fourth page that hasn't come over yet.

[02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:48.860]
That position is released in the Seminole case revealed

[02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:50.800]
new evidence of intentional fraud.

[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:53.960]
Many of the 2100.

[02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:56.940]
Now, if this was on last night while I was at the game and I wasn't aware of it

[02:30:56.940 --> 02:30:58.940]
and I haven't read or heard about it, which I don't know why,

[02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:00.600]
how come nobody has called about this today?

[02:31:02.140 --> 02:31:05.620]
Probably because most of our two busy going like that.

[02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:10.900]
Many of the 2126 voter ID numbers, the GOP operative Michael Leach,

[02:31:10.920 --> 02:31:14.660]
illegally edited a GOP absentee battle request proved to be incorrect.

[02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:18.800]
Elections office staff members stated under oath that supervisor Gordon

[02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:21.380]
struck them to accept all request forms filled in by Leach,

[02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:24.080]
whether the voter ID number was correct or incorrect.

[02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:27.780]
This from a journalist in the courtroom pending final confirmation

[02:31:27.780 --> 02:31:29.060]
with documents in hand.

[02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:33.260]
In contrast, trial testimony established that Gordon had repeatedly

[02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:37.100]
and publicly stated or policy that no absentee ballot request would be accepted

[02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:40.600]
without the voter ID filled in by the voter family member or guardian

[02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:41.980]
as required by Florida law.

[02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:46.960]
The defense did not contest that GOP operative Michael Leach worked 15 to 21 days

[02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:52.720]
unsupervised in the Seminolection offices adding voter IDs to 2126 GOP

[02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:54.160]
male absentee ballot form requests.

[02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:57.880]
Gordon had her staff separate those from the others who went to the discard pile.

[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:01.940]
Gordon had stated under oath that she didn't know either the GOP official or first-counter

[02:32:01.940 --> 02:32:04.900]
or the people working with Leach but plaintiff introduced warned that positions

[02:32:04.900 --> 02:32:08.180]
contradicting both those assertions which is why I said she's probably going to want up in jail

[02:32:08.180 --> 02:32:09.300]
and maybe this guy too.

[02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:11.040]
So how do you like that?

[02:32:12.900 --> 02:32:14.060]
So maybe there is a chance.

[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.480]
Like I said, don't give up now, Al.

[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:18.040]
Well, how come nobody told us about this?

[02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:22.100]
You know, you could sit here for like 20 hours and thanks to whoever faxed this to me.

[02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:23.060]
Thank you God bless America.

[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:27.960]
Also, here's a very interesting fax which I won't use the name of the person

[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:30.060]
because I value his life and I'm sure he does too.

[02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:34.120]
Heard you mentioned Jerry Richman yesterday and thought he'd appreciate the following.

[02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:37.820]
Upon the opening of the Claude Pepper seat, he died.

[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:41.700]
He was in a runoff against the Rosario Kennedy for the Democratic ticket.

[02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:46.040]
Kennedy plainly appealed into the Cuban vote was doing very little outside of her environment.

[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:51.060]
Richman seized the opportunity by claiming in one of his speeches that he wasn't just for the Cuban community

[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:52.200]
but for the entire community.

[02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:55.720]
Rosario twisted his words to be understood as anti-Cuban.

[02:32:56.240 --> 02:32:59.060]
Upon her loss to Richmond, she refused to endorse him for this reason,

[02:32:59.060 --> 02:33:02.200]
upon which the Republican bitch, Iliana Ross, Rosanna Dana,

[02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:06.940]
seeing the opportunity to exploit this issue, picked up where Rosario left off with the same rhetoric.

[02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:10.140]
My Cuban mother and I volunteered for his campaign.

[02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:12.820]
We received bomb threats and hate calls in Spanish.

[02:33:13.400 --> 02:33:14.980]
We were the only Latinos in his office.

[02:33:15.420 --> 02:33:20.240]
Richmond received worse death threats and even a man who was apprehended in his family on election day carrying a gun.

[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:22.080]
Needless to say, the bitch won.

[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:25.220]
Richmond went in a self-imposed exile more than likely to be forgotten.

[02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:29.160]
Another example of man too good for the job of public office, especially in South Florida.

[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:30.280]
How do you like that?

[02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:31.940]
God.

[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:38.080]
Yep, maybe that's why the mad dog keeps saying that same thing.

[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:38.820]
What a hell is he?

[02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:40.380]
I can't even close to him yet.

[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:41.340]
He's on here somewhere.

[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:44.400]
What is it he says?

[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:46.420]
Only in the Banana Republic, baby.

[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:47.400]
Only in Miami.

[02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:51.580]
Okay, so nobody filled me in on the Seminole County case but that's okay.

[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:53.220]
They are their clueless.

[02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:57.640]
5667-0560, 0560, 0560, only AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:33:57.900 --> 02:33:59.060]
47 votes so far.

[02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:01.320]
You think the Florida Supreme Court order we kind of any votes.

[02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:05.440]
30 no, 12 yes, 5 I just don't give a crap anymore.

[02:34:05.980 --> 02:34:06.440]
They don't care.

[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:08.840]
Mobile in Miami Beach, hello?

[02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:10.480]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:10.960]
Yes, sir.

[02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:13.820]
You know, a long con lesson or first time caller.

[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:14.320]
Okay.

[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:17.640]
One of your local networks came out with something interesting.

[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:18.380]
Yes, if anything.

[02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:26.100]
In the worst scenario as it's leaning towards, the Miami Herald will have a complete unofficial recap.

[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:31.980]
And I thought maybe on the day of this man's inauguration, I'll be a nice little gift telling him,

[02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:34.180]
we just inaugurated the Ronald President.

[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:39.240]
You say we'll come out with an official count since the ballots are public.

[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:40.040]
Right.

[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:42.960]
The Miami Herald has already put in a claim to-

[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:43.460]
Yeah, I know that.

[02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:44.540]
I'm talking about it.

[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:44.700]
Yeah.

[02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:50.840]
And just to end it, I'm going back to great school and I remember what that teacher once told me.

[02:34:51.140 --> 02:34:53.140]
Anybody could become president.

[02:34:54.060 --> 02:35:00.080]
And unfortunately now looking at the quality of this gentleman, she was right.

[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:00.600]
Mm-hmm.

[02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:02.980]
Especially if he's born with a silver spoon up his neck.

[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:03.300]
Correct him.

[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:04.020]
Yeah, that helps.

[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:05.180]
Okay, good luck to us, pal.

[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:05.560]
Thank you.

[02:35:05.980 --> 02:35:10.020]
560-50560, plenty of open lines, pound 560 on a AT&T line.

[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:13.700]
Out of town line is open 877-785-6345.

[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:18.340]
Mobile implantation, hello.

[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:19.680]
Hey, sir.

[02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:22.420]
Neil, what the dolphins really need?

[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:27.260]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line, like I just said.

[02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:28.900]
Here's Miami, hello.

[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:29.440]
Hi.

[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.100]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:34.080]
Yeah, I'm just wondering, I actually calling about the Murray's.

[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:35.100]
I'm from Detroit.

[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:35.600]
Yeah.

[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:43.620]
But I moved, came down here for school and I have to say, I feel sorry for the Panthers because Brian Murray took the wings nowhere.

[02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:46.760]
We reached one level with them and that's what's going to happen to them.

[02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:50.960]
It is not amazing what great success they had after he left after they blew his ass out.

[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:56.820]
Yeah, and you know, when the Panthers didn't have them, they were contenders, you know?

[02:35:57.160 --> 02:35:57.340]
Right.

[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:03.200]
And of course, I mean as soon as they were contenders, they happened to lose other players.

[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:05.520]
They were contenders without Brian Murray?

[02:36:06.500 --> 02:36:06.940]
What day?

[02:36:07.220 --> 02:36:07.440]
No.

[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:08.280]
Oh, they weren't.

[02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:11.200]
No, Bobby Clark, you mean when they had those Roger Nielsen teams, no?

[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:11.700]
Yeah.

[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:12.400]
No.

[02:36:13.880 --> 02:36:15.220]
Okay, and have a great day, sir.

[02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:19.160]
Do it again.

[02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:19.520]
Come on.

[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:19.880]
Ah!

[02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:22.460]
Much better.

[02:36:24.380 --> 02:36:27.420]
56670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:31.220]
Here's Miami.

[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:31.560]
Hello.

[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:32.360]
Hi.

[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:33.080]
How you doing, Nielsen?

[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:33.400]
Pretty good.

[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:34.060]
All right.

[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:36.180]
Listen, it couldn't get worse.

[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:37.300]
That's what we thought.

[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:39.700]
Now the whole world knows we love voter fraud.

[02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:41.580]
Florida or water shame.

[02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:44.500]
The Kiwis are happy and can't even pronounce his name.

[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:47.280]
Ooch, ooch, that's their battle cry.

[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:50.980]
I can't wait to the day I say, bye, bye, bye.

[02:36:51.220 --> 02:36:51.700]
All right.

[02:36:51.980 --> 02:36:53.160]
All right, Niel, take care, all right?

[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:54.420]
Okay, ask the Kiwis to meet us, pal.

[02:36:54.500 --> 02:36:54.840]
Nice job.

[02:36:56.460 --> 02:36:57.160]
Is that Walt Whitman?

[02:36:57.400 --> 02:36:58.580]
That's Hispanic Walt Whitman.

[02:36:58.740 --> 02:36:59.220]
Nice going.

[02:36:59.340 --> 02:36:59.980]
Okay, put it away.

[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:00.720]
It looked pretty interesting.

[02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:01.940]
Folded back up.

[02:37:03.500 --> 02:37:07.000]
56670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:08.680]
There's that expert on there.

[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:10.520]
He's been on there like 25 hours a day on CNN

[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:12.000]
and really he's looking up.

[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:14.100]
If they didn't make a effect, they outgrow the election.

[02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:15.400]
They're on the gas down on the AT&T.

[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:17.060]
He just boards the hell out of me outside.

[02:37:17.220 --> 02:37:17.860]
He's killing me.

[02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:19.720]
Here's Hollywood, hello.

[02:37:20.100 --> 02:37:22.080]
There's no Hollywood, where are you?

[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:25.600]
Yeah, he's hanging out with the Indians, okay?

[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:26.800]
Oh, yeah, it's bigger than the Indian.

[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:29.120]
Seven-O Indian casino is closed on Christmas Day.

[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:30.820]
So I did get one thing right today.

[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:31.700]
Thank you very much.

[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:32.680]
It is closed on Christmas.

[02:37:32.900 --> 02:37:34.940]
But every other day of your life, even on Nesha Buas,

[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:39.100]
can we do strive for a little bit of back-wrestling

[02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:40.160]
in spite of our sales department?

[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:41.720]
Because you know, when the world's right down,

[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:42.220]
they couldn't care.

[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:44.120]
If there's money on the table, it will take you.

[02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:46.520]
Just give us your effort and money and the town don't get in the way.

[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:48.920]
Here's a mobile and Palm Beach, hello.

[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:50.300]
How you doing, Neil?

[02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:50.680]
Great.

[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:52.300]
A couple of things.

[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:54.340]
First of all, with the Murray situation,

[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:57.540]
I mean, if they go, don't they both have to go?

[02:37:57.740 --> 02:37:59.600]
I mean, they don't see how one can go without the other.

[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:00.060]
I agree.

[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:02.580]
That's, I think they both, it's a package deal.

[02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:02.760]
Right.

[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:05.880]
And I think this team, what they need really is a coach GM,

[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:07.320]
one in the same person.

[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:11.400]
I think that's what they need.

[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:14.080]
Because I think the guy you play for and the guy that's going to pay you,

[02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:15.980]
I think that shakes you up a little bit anyway.

[02:38:16.620 --> 02:38:19.240]
But at the other point, I want to make it about the election.

[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:22.040]
I mean, it's really starting to get old and it's starting to get boring.

[02:38:22.300 --> 02:38:25.600]
But you know, you're starting to hear a lot of comments from people about,

[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:30.020]
isn't it going to be great when they count the votes, how we can show many

[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:32.180]
other programs that didn't show this and show that?

[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:34.440]
I just don't know what point it makes.

[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:35.060]
You know what I mean?

[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:37.300]
It's both exhausting all of their leads.

[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:50.460]
And I think that's what I think is going to be the most difficult thing to do.

[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:50.460]

[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:50.460]

[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:50.460]

[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:50.460]

[02:38:50.460 --> 02:38:50.560]
I think that's what I think is going to be the most difficult thing to do.

[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:51.920]
I think that's what I think is going to be the most difficult thing to do.

[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:54.160]

[02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:11.920]
Now if you let me pick who can stain who has to leave, I promise you this is my pledge

[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:12.620]

[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:15.740]
I plead you that within six months this would be paradise.

[02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:17.260]
You'd be loving it.

[02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:19.160]
Those who would be still here.

[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:23.900]
26 past one and five, what, what was that?

[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:26.760]
Just somebody running on the hall yelling again.

[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:27.400]
Oh yeah?

[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:31.860]
I want a bang in the butt, honey.

[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:02.420]
And someone seems so very long ago.

[02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:16.260]
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor with every four-year sign I've run.

[02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:23.260]
Take your days, be very and bright.

[02:43:30.260 --> 02:43:41.620]
And may all of you never ever be what I do.

[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:49.580]
What happens as a practical matter?

[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:53.320]
Well, she says, first, the person was there one or two days.

[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:58.060]
Then I'm deposition, I get her to say who did this long, is nine or ten days.

[02:43:58.700 --> 02:43:59.960]
She says, possibly.

[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:01.860]
Then we depose Mr. Leach.

[02:44:02.060 --> 02:44:05.400]
Mr. Leach says, at least fifteen days.

[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:05.800]
Nine.

[02:44:06.420 --> 02:44:09.700]
And then we go ahead and we get to depose their employees.

[02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:13.160]
And what are their employees says three weeks?

[02:44:13.740 --> 02:44:18.400]
Mr. Masciano says his estimate was that Mr. Leach was actually there for three weeks.

[02:44:19.220 --> 02:44:23.440]
Then Sandra Leach comes in, I'm sorry, Mrs. Gord comes in and she says,

[02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:29.800]
that with regard to the people that were there, first of all, I don't know who called me.

[02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:33.740]
Well, I would refer you to.

[02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:42.240]
The excerpt to deposition that everyone agreed to be put in for Mr. Spelling.

[02:44:42.420 --> 02:44:45.740]
Now, Mr. Spelling is vice chair of the Republican Party of Florida.

[02:44:48.460 --> 02:44:55.040]
And these are closing arguments in the state of the whole county.

[02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:56.240]
They don't reach them.

[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:56.780]
They don't reach them.

[02:44:56.780 --> 02:44:57.860]
It will be reading from is very short.

[02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:01.640]
It page 25 lines 11 through 24.

[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:07.060]
Because what was bothering us is, who is this person?

[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:10.040]
Indeed she had knowledge of who the person was.

[02:45:10.260 --> 02:45:13.400]
It didn't make sense when she said, I just don't know who the person is.

[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:16.760]
I don't remember who this unidentified person is, but I go ahead and I do it.

[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:20.640]
Mr. Spelling testifies question.

[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:26.540]
When you say that Mrs. Gord told you that Mr. Schneck was the one who called her.

[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:29.220]
Is that, did she mention his name?

[02:45:29.220 --> 02:45:31.440]
That he was the one who called her?

[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:34.260]
Answer actually, I know when that was now.

[02:45:34.540 --> 02:45:35.920]
Question one was answer.

[02:45:36.380 --> 02:45:40.860]
That was in here when Harry, that's referring to Harry Jacobs, plaintiff,

[02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:43.440]
was questioning her at the candidacy board, meeting with Jacobs.

[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:45.800]
Question what happened at that time?

[02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:46.580]
Answer.

[02:45:47.100 --> 02:45:49.880]
She said that she did not call anybody.

[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:51.020]
Question.

[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:54.020]
Did she say she got a call from Mr. Schneck?

[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:55.460]
Answer.

[02:45:55.740 --> 02:45:56.940]
Yes, she did.

[02:45:56.940 --> 02:46:01.040]
She said because she wanted to know how she found out and that's what she answered.

[02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:01.960]
Question.

[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:04.640]
And she specifically identified Mr. Schneck.

[02:46:05.020 --> 02:46:05.300]
Answer.

[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:06.400]
Yes, she did.

[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:11.720]
Now that we have a sudden loss of memory when her deposition is taken just a couple of weeks later.

[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:15.720]
I'll say again that bitch is going to jail.

[02:46:16.220 --> 02:46:16.380]
Then.

[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:20.960]
A couple of other excerpts relating directly to the story.

[02:46:22.100 --> 02:46:28.420]
Who wrote in volume two of her deposition it lines, page 19 line eight through 17.

[02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:29.820]
Question.

[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:34.880]
And you don't know how many days the other person came in, correct?

[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:35.680]
Answer.

[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:36.400]
Correct.

[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:37.660]
Question.

[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:41.280]
And you told us earlier, you don't recall the name of the other person.

[02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:44.600]
And just have given us a very limited description, correct?

[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:45.200]
Answer.

[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:45.460]
Yes.

[02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:46.120]
Question.

[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:49.100]
Do you know whether that other person worked for the Republican Party?

[02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:49.920]
Answer.

[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:51.960]
No, I don't.

[02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:54.040]
But then you have to test the line.

[02:46:54.380 --> 02:46:56.580]
I can't stand that for a lot.

[02:46:57.060 --> 02:46:57.380]
Yeah.

[02:46:57.540 --> 02:46:59.100]
From the excerpt.

[02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:01.360]
Mr. Leach.

[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:10.540]
And what does Mr. Leach say on that exact same issue at page 49 line 17 through 23?

[02:47:13.400 --> 02:47:14.000]
Question.

[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:19.120]
Did you ever introduce to her or identify to her either of the two other people that you mentioned?

[02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:24.080]
The other regional directors who were here brief periods of time according to your testimony.

[02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:25.580]
Answer.

[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:32.160]
She knows both Walde and Carlos from what I understand personally.

[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:33.100]
Questions.

[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:36.280]
So she would know both of these people who came into the back to assist you.

[02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:36.980]
Answer.

[02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:37.700]
That's correct.

[02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:38.460]
Question.

[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:41.840]
She would have been aware of the fact that they were here to assist you at the time they were here.

[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:42.520]
Answer.

[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:43.120]
That's correct.

[02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:43.940]
Question.

[02:47:44.740 --> 02:47:46.900]
Did you ever speak with either of them when they came in?

[02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:47.420]
Answer.

[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:49.040]
Not when they walked in the door.

[02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:49.540]
Question.

[02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:50.320]
But at any time?

[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:51.120]
Answer.

[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.020]
If she would come into the back, she would initial pleasantries.

[02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:55.560]
Hello.

[02:47:56.060 --> 02:47:56.600]
How are you?

[02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:57.100]
Question.

[02:47:57.540 --> 02:47:59.420]
So she clearly knew who they were.

[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:00.300]
Answer.

[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:01.480]
Clearly.

[02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:04.520]
And at page 49.

[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:08.920]
And then I asked also a question.

[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:13.040]
And did Sandra Gord, by the way, in regard to the two gentlemen you mentioned, I believe Carlos,

[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:13.760]
and what is it?

[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:14.960]
Answer Walde.

[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:15.500]
Question.

[02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:16.560]
Walde.

[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:19.320]
Refer to them by name when they were here.

[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:20.420]
Answer.

[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:21.860]
From what I remember.

[02:48:22.780 --> 02:48:23.180]
Yes.

[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:25.040]
Now.

[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:27.900]
Following up on that.

[02:48:28.140 --> 02:48:29.720]
So you've got basically the cover up.

[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:31.380]
She doesn't want to tell us who the people are.

[02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:33.640]
She doesn't want to tell us who from the party called her.

[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:37.320]
She's got to admit that somebody from the party did it because she's got to cover herself

[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:39.840]
as to why she went ahead and did it at all.

[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:42.060]
Now go to the next part.

[02:48:42.820 --> 02:48:43.260]
The party.

[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.960]
Now we know that it's Mr. Schneck who called.

[02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:50.120]
And we know that Mr. Schneck sends in Mr. Leach.

[02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:54.600]
And what does Mr. Leach do for Mr. Leuch's deposition?

[02:48:54.780 --> 02:49:00.160]
And this is so instructive in terms of what the party is doing in controlling this process

[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:02.980]
and taking over and effect the public office.

[02:49:03.080 --> 02:49:04.120]
You said the public is ready.

[02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:06.060]
We've already read the integrity of the process.

[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:07.820]
At page 20.

[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:14.000]
At line beginning basically about the line.

[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:21.080]
I don't have the actual numbers in here, but page 20 line 4 through page 21 line 1 is the excerpt.

[02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:21.800]
Question.

[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:31.600]
And this is in the context of where he is talking to Mr. Schneck about coming down to do the work.

[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:32.540]
Question.

[02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:40.180]
From your head you spoke to him before in terms of knowing how experienced he is referring to Mr. Schneck

[02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:42.660]
with regard to the law involving elections.

[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:43.480]
Answer.

[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:48.080]
I have full faith in confidence in touch, Nick Sabili's regarding the law and elections.

[02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:50.380]
He's been in politics for a long time.

[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:51.420]
Question.

[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:55.320]
So you just did whatever it is he told you to do in effect.

[02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:56.460]
Answer.

[02:49:57.220 --> 02:49:58.840]
I'm a military man.

[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:00.580]
I follow orders.

[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:05.720]
The orders in this case would to violate the law.

[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:08.300]
How do you like that?

[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:11.640]
I think what I tell you about your old Richmond.

[02:50:11.820 --> 02:50:13.060]
This is the best attorney we've seen.

[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:14.620]
I decided by a million miles under.

[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:16.820]
It makes me want to cry.

[02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:23.600]
When I sit here and I think that because it's years ago, because she's been in there for a coupons age that Ilyana Grosser was in.

[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:33.840]
I mean brilliant who want to be representing South Florida in Congress loses to a bitch like that Ilyana.

[02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:34.860]
I can't stand that.

[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:37.640]
Handering disgusting one-dimensional bitch.

[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:41.800]
And you think people want to be going to vote.

[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:43.860]
This is starting to look pretty damn bad for Bush.

[02:50:45.460 --> 02:50:48.360]
I think that's so we got a Bush in the hand and an ace in the hole.

[02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:48.720]
Correct.

[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:52.040]
If you ask me, yeah, that's our ace hole right there.

[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:53.320]
Is that Seminole County thing?

[02:50:53.700 --> 02:50:57.440]
Because I think at the very least she's got a good shot of throwing out those 2100 votes.

[02:50:59.360 --> 02:51:00.280]
Wouldn't that be something?

[02:51:00.420 --> 02:51:02.800]
Now, haven't I said all along that he ought to hang in there?

[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:03.080]
No.

[02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:04.080]
No, not seriously.

[02:51:04.340 --> 02:51:07.100]
I'm not one of those quitters one of those weak-est the-

[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:07.360]
No.

[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:08.140]
I would I say that.

[02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:13.260]
Well, see he's a better man than I am that frickin' boring algorithm.

[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:16.000]
Not as exciting or as enthusiastic or as emotional.

[02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:20.740]
But nevertheless, he's got the big pair.

[02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:23.760]
Even if he is, well, he is what he is.

[02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:27.720]
21 before 2 at 560 W. Keeleck Vincent, he is what he is.

[02:51:27.820 --> 02:51:27.940]
Well.

[02:51:29.080 --> 02:51:34.040]
The Neil Rogers Show Sports Radio 560 Q.A.

[02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:04.800]
Christmas Tree.

[02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:07.840]
It may be the last one that you see.

[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:12.300]
Deckal rate your house in green and red, cause someday you'll be dead.

[02:52:12.660 --> 02:52:12.880]
Oh!

[02:52:13.320 --> 02:52:14.620]
Dead, dead, dead.

[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:16.860]
Someday you'll be dead.

[02:52:17.660 --> 02:52:19.200]
Dead, dead, dead.

[02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:21.480]
Someday we'll all be dead.

[02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:29.320]
It might happen in a couple more short 50s from now.

[02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:34.960]
But no matter when it happens, it will still to soon to you.

[02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:40.040]
So we sure all the Christmas Eve will snuggle it.

[02:52:41.700 --> 02:52:46.380]
That you think God for your family, cause someday they'll be dead.

[02:52:47.340 --> 02:52:48.620]
Dead, dead, dead.

[02:52:49.320 --> 02:52:50.880]
Someday they'll be dead.

[02:52:51.620 --> 02:52:53.180]
Dead, dead, dead.

[02:52:53.740 --> 02:52:55.340]
Someday they'll all be dead.

[02:52:59.320 --> 02:53:03.200]
Who knows how many Christmas trees are left in their short life?

[02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:06.900]
Nobody knows, that's my point.

[02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:08.680]
Enjoyable while you can.

[02:53:09.900 --> 02:53:14.220]
And someone Christmas morning, that good tidings filled your bed.

[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:17.780]
What a festive season.

[02:53:18.540 --> 02:53:19.780]
Someday you'll be dead.

[02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:20.480]
Oh!

[02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:22.060]
Dead, dead, dead.

[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:24.260]
Someday we'll be dead.

[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:26.460]
Dead, dead, dead.

[02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:28.500]
Someday we'll be dead.

[02:53:29.940 --> 02:53:31.460]
Someday we'll be dead.

[02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:33.400]
Someday we'll be dead.

[02:53:39.660 --> 02:53:40.180]
Someday we'll be dead.

[02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:40.860]
Someday we'll be dead.

[02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:40.860]

[02:53:41.900 --> 02:53:44.060]
Happy Christmas everybody!

[02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:46.400]
146 at 560 WDQM.

[02:53:46.660 --> 02:53:48.720]
Happy Holidays from all the going over here.

[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:51.300]
Where we going, let's take a call from Miami.

[02:53:51.460 --> 02:53:51.600]
Hello.

[02:53:51.900 --> 02:53:52.440]
Hello, Neil.

[02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:52.920]
Yes, sir.

[02:53:53.260 --> 02:53:54.340]
I have a question.

[02:53:54.580 --> 02:53:57.240]
What are these news people going to do after this is over with?

[02:53:58.060 --> 02:53:59.020]
Are they going to be out of work?

[02:53:59.460 --> 02:54:01.380]
Well, they're going to hope OJ Kills somebody again, I guess.

[02:54:02.380 --> 02:54:02.700]
Sure.

[02:54:03.720 --> 02:54:05.140]
Get a 92's here this time.

[02:54:05.340 --> 02:54:08.700]
Or probably they'll look for like another truck to follow down the turnpike on.

[02:54:08.740 --> 02:54:10.380]
Yes, something to find another rider truck.

[02:54:11.580 --> 02:54:12.160]
All right, buddy.

[02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:13.160]
Okay, good luck to us, pal.

[02:54:13.280 --> 02:54:13.740]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:15.960]
They're crazy and they've got to have something to get hysterical about.

[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:16.980]
Get you all whipped up a bomb.

[02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:18.800]
567, let me say it again.

[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:21.260]
You know what somebody's called about Jerry Richmond because he's talking right now.

[02:54:21.260 --> 02:54:22.160]
And they're all watching at anyone.

[02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:25.260]
Be in love with how much I see entirely.

[02:54:27.700 --> 02:54:29.240]
I think that's not a long name.

[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:29.680]
I think that's not a long name.

[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:30.180]
I think that's a long name.

[02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:30.960]
But it could be.

[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:33.360]
I think you could have a long, long name to follow.

[02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:39.020]
So I think my question is, if anybody wants to see what people from all other parts of it.

[02:54:40.260 --> 02:54:44.220]
And the question for all of the bouncing is if the unskitter access.

[02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:49.480]
Registatly, the public in the Democrat, whoever else is the unskitter access.

[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:50.420]
Yes.

[02:54:50.420 --> 02:54:50.820]
The federal act.

[02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:52.260]
The vendors, the process.

[02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:53.660]
So compromise.

[02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:55.180]
Then I can't give it a fan.

[02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:58.660]
One better access to one party.

[02:54:58.980 --> 02:54:59.120]
Yes.

[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:02.140]
But is it an indicator that everybody has access?

[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:06.880]
I think what you probably have to say is you've got a really sloppy negligence supervisor.

[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:08.420]
And you probably have to know more.

[02:55:09.140 --> 02:55:13.220]
But she says here that anybody comes in and that's just being sloppy and negligent.

[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:14.740]
And that's not the issue before that.

[02:55:14.980 --> 02:55:16.000]
Exactly the point.

[02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:18.740]
That's why I said this is intentional going through.

[02:55:18.740 --> 02:55:20.800]
She intentionally did this.

[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:26.500]
She even testified because I was told that normally anybody comes in and would be supervised.

[02:55:27.260 --> 02:55:28.300]
For these people, what?

[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:31.300]
How do you like that?

[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:33.520]
I think she's going to jail.

[02:55:33.940 --> 02:55:34.420]
I really do.

[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:35.320]
That's fucking bitch.

[02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:35.700]

[02:55:36.700 --> 02:55:37.420]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:37.760]
Hello.

[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:39.060]
Hey, Neil.

[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:39.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:42.100]
A lot of people aren't going to like this.

[02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:43.500]
But I think that's okay.

[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:43.900]
That's good.

[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:44.600]
We like that.

[02:55:45.140 --> 02:55:48.860]
Society is becoming more and more like the old Soviet Union.

[02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:49.240]
Yeah.

[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:52.580]
Where we have party members and non-party members.

[02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:56.640]
Party members being the mysterious electoral college.

[02:55:56.800 --> 02:55:56.940]
Yeah.

[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:01.640]
And the non-party members being the rest of us who have to live with whatever their decisions might be.

[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:03.420]
Well, since you say that, let me ask you this.

[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:06.640]
Are you now or have you ever been a political advocate tour?

[02:56:07.740 --> 02:56:07.880]
Yeah.

[02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:09.800]
I'm fine.

[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:18.340]
I'm getting the same flag as you do when I complain about the election and say things like if this were held in any country in Southville or Central America.

[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:19.420]
Maybe it's an algorithm.

[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:20.440]
I'm going to anorea public.

[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:21.380]
Boy, look at those guys.

[02:56:21.600 --> 02:56:22.900]
Like those elections in Haiti, man.

[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:24.380]
Another damn banana republic.

[02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:27.840]
And people say to me, if I was for Bush, would I still be complaining?

[02:56:30.180 --> 02:56:31.660]
I'd say the answer is yeah.

[02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:35.240]
But because it's a crooked, freaking election that's an embarrassment in here.

[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:40.980]
These people are so partisan that they support this kind of a process, is though this is the way it's supposed to be.

[02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:42.240]
Those people need mental help.

[02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:44.360]
We have to be protected from those people.

[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:49.980]
Are these the same people telling me not to complain when I complain about South Florida telling me to leave?

[02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:50.660]
Yeah, right.

[02:56:50.780 --> 02:56:51.720]
If you don't like it, get out.

[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:52.380]
Yeah.

[02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:54.540]
Party members and non-party members.

[02:56:54.780 --> 02:57:00.900]
The party members are military, ex-military, the pigs with stars under license plate.

[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:04.480]
Or some other hands-off symbol on their license plate.

[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:04.820]
Right.

[02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:08.360]
And the non-party members are the rest of us shluppers.

[02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:10.920]
You have to put up with whatever trickles down.

[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:11.940]
The underlings, yeah.

[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:13.980]
I don't like it.

[02:57:14.260 --> 02:57:14.580]
Okay.

[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:18.100]
And when I call, I call George and I can't explain about it when you were talking.

[02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:18.740]
I'll let you know.

[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:24.740]
For the first time considering leaving the country relocating to a civilized country.

[02:57:24.840 --> 02:57:25.560]
Now you're talking.

[02:57:27.300 --> 02:57:28.280]
I'll see what it does.

[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:29.060]
It likes that idea.

[02:57:29.340 --> 02:57:29.600]
I know.

[02:57:29.780 --> 02:57:30.680]
And I can see his point.

[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:33.260]
You know, I'm an American and we should stay here and tough it out.

[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:34.900]
But why is that?

[02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:38.320]
Just like that song I just played, you only live once, man.

[02:57:38.420 --> 02:57:39.120]
The clock is running.

[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:42.680]
And if you got it, if you can afford to do it or if you can even do it part of the time, do it.

[02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:44.020]
I'll send you a postcard.

[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:44.300]
Okay.

[02:57:44.420 --> 02:57:45.000]
I'll see you there.

[02:57:45.940 --> 02:57:46.960]
I'll see you in the plane.

[02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:47.420]
Yeah.

[02:57:47.500 --> 02:57:49.280]
See a little taste of freedom and what we're real.

[02:57:49.580 --> 02:57:51.980]
See you people that think, oh, America is the greatest country in the world.

[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:53.080]
You're crazy people.

[02:57:53.340 --> 02:57:54.300]
You've been brainwashed.

[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:54.940]
Oh no.

[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:57.020]
It's only the communist and the Nazis that brainwashed.

[02:57:57.480 --> 02:57:57.720]
Right.

[02:57:59.940 --> 02:58:01.260]
And of course, you know, you've been nice.

[02:58:01.260 --> 02:58:09.620]
99% of the people who would say that would just assume turn around and say, oh yeah, but you know that Gonzalez family was that brainwashing that poor little kid while he was here.

[02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:10.880]
That's the point, see.

[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:13.140]
They were screaming.

[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:15.100]
It was only cashier that does the brainwashing.

[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:20.460]
In the meantime, they were doing a brainwashing and they were putting the words into his mouth with those little homemade videotapes.

[02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:25.060]
And God only knows what else they were putting into his mouth till the appellers came along and pulled it out.

[02:58:29.300 --> 02:58:30.260]
Propaganda brainwashing.

[02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:32.040]
Life isn't happy meals.

[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:33.940]
It's not script shopping centers.

[02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:35.480]
It's not shopping malls.

[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:38.100]
It's not glitzy, big, fancy cars.

[02:58:38.460 --> 02:58:40.540]
It's not a lot of goddamn super highways.

[02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:42.840]
That's not what freedom and life is all about.

[02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:46.780]
God damn it.

[02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:51.480]
Anyway, I'm telling you, sir, if he's a jail richman, he gets my vote.

[02:58:51.480 --> 02:58:52.120]
For this language.

[02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:53.780]
In any language?

[02:58:55.600 --> 02:58:56.700]
Come on, Jerry, get with it.

[02:58:56.960 --> 02:58:57.960]
The brothers of the...

[02:58:57.960 --> 02:58:58.980]
I smell spaghetti sauce.

[02:58:59.140 --> 02:58:59.900]
No, you know somebody's...

[02:58:59.900 --> 02:59:00.820]
I'm sure they ordered something.

[02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:03.260]
Oh, boy, it's a good thing I'm going to Monty's for a while.

[02:59:03.380 --> 02:59:04.080]
I'm meal this week.

[02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:06.100]
Hey, yo, man, what's up with the cut?

[02:59:06.240 --> 02:59:06.760]
The Ms. Pluck.

[02:59:08.180 --> 02:59:11.740]
There was a no farmer who lived on a rock.

[02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:15.560]
He sat in the middle just shaking his face.

[02:59:15.900 --> 02:59:18.580]
That some boys who were down by the brick.

[02:59:18.580 --> 02:59:20.760]
They're beating the waters.

[02:59:21.140 --> 02:59:23.900]
They're hands on their marbles and play things

[02:59:23.900 --> 02:59:25.460]
and at half past four.

[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:27.460]
They're team a young lady.

[02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:30.440]
She looked like a pretty young creature.

[02:59:30.740 --> 02:59:32.220]
She sat on the grass.

[02:59:32.820 --> 02:59:37.240]
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rubbles and laces

[02:59:37.240 --> 02:59:38.960]
and white fluffy duck.

[02:59:39.500 --> 02:59:44.040]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children,

[02:59:44.060 --> 02:59:45.880]
so they would not spend.

[02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:49.260]
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveled

[02:59:49.260 --> 02:59:52.660]
and they were left using later from yesterday's hunt.

[02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:56.580]
While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her eye

[02:59:56.580 --> 02:59:59.460]
that the fellow down by the dot.

[02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:04.540]
He looked like a man with a size of a home in the country

[03:00:04.540 --> 03:00:06.240]
with a big fence out front.

[03:00:06.740 --> 03:00:09.840]
If he has her from lightly, she'd show him her

[03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:13.200]
that the pet dog who was subject to pits.

[03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:17.500]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small dinner

[03:00:17.500 --> 03:00:19.960]
and with a movement so quick.

[03:00:20.460 --> 03:00:23.980]
And then she'd been over and suck on his candy

[03:00:23.980 --> 03:00:26.740]
so tasty made of butter, Scott.

[03:00:27.240 --> 03:00:30.760]
And then he spread with cream all over her cookie

[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:33.540]
that she had left out on her shelf.

[03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:37.400]
If you think this is dirty, you can go fuck yourself.

[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:41.260]
Oh, 157 and 560 WDQAM.

[03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:42.620]
Where do we go?

[03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:44.360]
Here's our poll results so far.

[03:00:44.780 --> 03:00:46.600]
Do you think the Florida Supreme Court will order a recount

[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:49.020]
of any votes? No, 57.

[03:00:49.800 --> 03:00:51.800]
Yes, 30. I don't give a crap anymore.

[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:52.620]
15.

[03:00:53.920 --> 03:00:55.280]
Here is Pemberer Park. Hello.

[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:57.320]
How are you, Neil? Yes, sir.

[03:00:57.520 --> 03:00:59.180]
Hey, I got a theory behind this whole deal.

[03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:00.740]
Okay. Bear with me here.

[03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:03.860]
I was watching this recovery channel show

[03:01:03.860 --> 03:01:06.520]
and they had a thing that was called a woodpecker

[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:07.080]
or something, rather.

[03:01:07.460 --> 03:01:08.540]
Did the Russians were working on?

[03:01:08.540 --> 03:01:10.600]
No, that's Castro's got the woodpecker.

[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:13.220]
That's what I think. He's got it, man. He's pointed right at Florida.

[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:15.000]
Right. I feel like a living man.

[03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:17.560]
You know, see, you're joking, but I've been saying that for years

[03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:19.420]
and people think I'm joking too. I believe it.

[03:01:19.560 --> 03:01:21.000]
You can see it on certain days.

[03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:22.900]
Now, sometimes it's the full moon. Really?

[03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:25.040]
It's like a binary thing.

[03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:27.260]
Now, if you do any driving, if you're out there in a highway

[03:01:27.260 --> 03:01:29.280]
and you see, like, when everybody seems to be crazy

[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:31.680]
except you, then you just know something's going on.

[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:32.320]
Yes, there's something.
