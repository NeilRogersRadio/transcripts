[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940]
The QAF.

[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.460]
The UK.

[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.840]
567, 560.

[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.560]
No free in Dave and Gweldhall.

[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.480]
Now 560 on your shelf hall.

[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.480]
Your opinions have revealed this guest in colors.

[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.480]
You must not necessarily represent those of the beastly blood cascading.

[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.020]
No that.

[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.780]
Advertisers are reality now.

[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.180]
Here's Neil Roger on 560 QAM.

[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.580]
Number one, did you say?

[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.880]
I feel really, really, really, really, f***ing...

[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.740]
I'm not going to go.

[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.900]
I've never wanted to play something like that.

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.860]
I wonder if you would think people can.

[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.480]
It's one of women who's eating the food though.

[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.060]
And that's what I like about yoga.

[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.340]
I'm going to eat this on a table.

[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.200]
The damn way they say,

[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.940]
and if they corner,

[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.840]
as a ball,

[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.000]
just after I want,

[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.780]
he's going to go to yoga.

[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.740]
And then,

[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.020]
I'm going to go to yoga.

[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.780]
And then,

[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.760]
I'm going to go to yoga.

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.760]

[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.760]
I'm going to go to yoga.

[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.740]
I'm going to go to yoga.

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.740]

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.740]

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.740]

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.740]

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.740]

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.280]
I'm going to go to yoga.

[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.800]
That's what I'm going to do.

[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.400]
I think about it.

[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.400]
You find it.

[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.880]
I find that it's all a good friend from CMBC.

[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.860]
I don't know what you're doing.

[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.440]
I'm going to show you today.

[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.200]
And my welcome to our good buddy, Ted David.

[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.280]
You think he might be down here?

[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.500]
Oh.

[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.920]
The guy with two first names

[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.460]
and Martian's $1 of the guys.

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.920]
David Favour and the rest of the other Graham.

[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.560]
So anyway, welcome down here.

[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.760]
Let's make sure the market goes down today.

[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.700]
Okay, you got it?

[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.880]
The market's got to go down today.

[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.760]
So far, it's going up,

[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.760]
which I'm not too happy about.

[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.360]
It's got to go down today.

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.080]
Hey, listen,

[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.640]
it's just, you got to be selfish.

[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.400]
Like some people,

[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.680]
I know it's getting to a little bit.

[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.020]
Selfish.

[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.400]
What kind of like Jews,

[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.740]
Republican Jews?

[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.540]
Yeah, selfish.

[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.140]
Notivated only by money,

[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.360]
having no ethics whatsoever.

[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.140]
But like I said,

[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.000]
I'll get about in a few minutes.

[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.660]
Last night,

[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.100]
after the Panther game,

[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.460]
there are seven consecutive game

[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.620]
without a victory.

[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.820]
So the Jews,

[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.320]
these scourers,

[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.660]
what was obviously going to be the winning goal

[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.680]
of the bottom end and I have to go.

[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.420]
So as soon as the red light comes on,

[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.160]
the puck is in the net,

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.800]
I both up out of my seat

[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.520]
and like a lot of other smart people,

[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.440]
go flying out there like a bad out of hell.

[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.480]
Beep the traffic.

[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.080]
Get the hell out.

[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.580]
When it's out, get the hell out.

[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.400]
It was entertaining.

[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.840]
Generally speaking,

[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.260]
a fairly good time was had by some,

[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.080]
including me.

[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.500]
It was okay.

[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.140]
So I'm making a b-line for the apartment lot,

[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.100]
and as I get about 10 steps outside the door,

[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.800]
I hear a voice.

[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.620]
Nail.

[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.920]
And I turn here to this middle-aged couple.

[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.560]
I'm trying to be delicate,

[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.920]
because this story,

[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.780]
the reason I'm telling you this little episode,

[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.620]
is because once again,

[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.780]
I've encountered an instance

[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.980]
that perfectly exemplifies everything that is wrong

[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.980]
with this place.

[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.940]
And believe me, that covers a lot of territory.

[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.440]
It covers a tremendous,

[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.420]
a big fat amount of territory.

[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.900]
So anyway,

[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.220]
this woman comes up to me,

[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.180]
which I've seen her before.

[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.640]
I guess it's the hockey games.

[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.540]
I hope no place else.

[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.600]
And she comes up.

[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.860]
No, I got to ask your question.

[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.220]
I said, well, you know,

[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.540]
quick, because I'm trying to get out of here,

[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.140]
and beat the traffic.

[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.500]
And of course, so obviously,

[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.260]
were they, because if they were so intense,

[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.580]
how come they were running out of there

[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.340]
with a minute and a half left

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.960]
to see if the panthers were going to make a comeback?

[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.120]
Were they going to make a comeback?

[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.620]
No.

[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.100]
Of course not.

[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.080]
But anyway, I got to ask your question.

[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.080]
So if she gets up,

[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.480]
this big, heavy-set woman,

[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.720]
right in my face,

[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.400]
and says,

[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.380]
how come you're not more enthusiastic?

[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.900]
I'm watching you with my binoculars

[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.820]
during a whole game,

[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.940]
and you're just sitting there

[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.540]
like a bump on a log.

[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.320]
Here's this like this,

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.560]
and she's giving me like a, you know,

[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.900]
a fancy-dicky motion here.

[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.720]
Now, I must have been,

[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.320]
I don't know, I guess I must have seen the least

[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.160]
with pounding the hell out of Minnesota on the scoreboard.

[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.200]
So I was in a pretty good mood,

[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.760]
and started the fact that panthers took it up the old shoot again.

[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.080]
I must have been in a very good mood,

[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.900]
because ordinarily,

[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.780]
what I should have said,

[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.720]
you know what I should have said?

[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.860]
Why don't you get a right,

[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.240]
and mind you own F and business,

[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.080]
that's fucking good.

[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.540]
Exactly.

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.760]
Very well said, Slee.

[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.820]
Right on.

[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.520]
I mean, if you're such a,

[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.320]
if you're so enthusiastic,

[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.060]
how come you got your binoculars watching me the whole game?

[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.260]
I thought that fans went there to watch the sporting event

[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.200]
whatever the hell it was.

[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.060]
Yenta,

[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.800]
I'm not just disgusting,

[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.120]
stereotypical frickin' Yenta.

[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.900]
That's fucking good.

[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.920]
Right, like I said.

[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.440]
How do you like that?

[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.680]
She's busy watching me the whole game.

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.340]
So my answer to her was,

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.120]
well you don't want to do something exciting going on.

[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.720]
I get excited to get the enthusiastic,

[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.040]
and I've waddled away.

[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.200]
I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened.

[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.380]
And not that it was that.

[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.960]
Actually she says,

[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.220]
oh, I've got to call you Emma.

[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.260]
You know something I hope you do call me today.

[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.580]
You don't have the balls to call me today sweetheart.

[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.360]
You bitch.

[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.380]
You disgusting piece of turd.

[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.420]
Like I have to go there to be on display for people.

[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.720]
You know,

[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.120]
it reminds me of the thing that the woman a couple years ago

[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.760]
in the Macarena.

[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.760]
The woman with the jacket.

[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.060]
I'm sitting there minding my own business.

[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.820]
I get there early.

[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.460]
I like trying to get my body temperature down

[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.220]
about 15 below,

[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.880]
because it's nice and cold in there before the game.

[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.320]
Sitting there minding my own business.

[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.600]
And here comes some other bitch.

[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.200]
See, I'll say it again.

[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.340]
I really feel sorry for the South Florida men.

[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.080]
I know we had a lot of burzos out there.

[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.700]
You know something?

[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.280]
Maybe they were bright decent guys once upon a time.

[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.020]
But take a look at the crop that they had to pick from down here.

[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.280]
Yeah.

[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.320]
A bitch crop.

[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.340]
So anyway, the other woman comes up to me.

[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.680]
I'm sitting there minding my own business company.

[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.220]
I'm sitting there with my maple leaf jacket,

[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.660]
which I wear to all hockey games.

[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.980]
40 years now.

[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.220]
42 years to be exact to being a Toronto fan.

[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.020]
I know, I know question what she's doing,

[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.900]
but anybody else is doing.

[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.280]
Mind your own effing business.

[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.880]
Do no harm.

[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.660]
My DNH.

[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.620]
So this woman comes up.

[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.060]
Yeah.

[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.780]
How come you want to match your minor jacket?

[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.200]
I'm not going to even tell you.

[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.960]
I'm going to be the reason for that story.

[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.240]
I got news for you assholes out there.

[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.440]
Okay, when I go to the game, I'm going to wear whatever.

[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.180]
If I want to wear a burlap sack, it'll probably be an improvement over my head.

[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.020]
It'll be an improvement.

[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.780]
If I want to go there with my underwear on.

[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.000]
If I want to go there with one shoe on my left ear and my other one deep inside my ass.

[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.160]
Correct.

[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.600]
Okay, that's up to me.

[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.380]
I don't go to hockey games or any place,

[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.860]
so I have to answer to anybody else.

[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.080]
I'm just, there's a spectator.

[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.980]
Okay, I'm not there to be on display.

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.460]
See, that some jerk is sitting there and they're standing watching me with their binoculars.

[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.780]
In fact, now I'm going to start throwing.

[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.500]
I'm going to start picking my nose during the games and hurling them up in the air so that

[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.540]
you can analize them.

[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.680]
Oh, that looks like a good one.

[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.240]
That looks really good.

[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.060]
Bitch, absolute shoe on the collar.

[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.940]
You mark my words.

[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.340]
And I found out those people that sit in front of me.

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.360]
Yeah, part of the plan showed up last night and come to find out the chigger in the wood pile.

[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.760]
Not to talk about where we live and again.

[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.200]
The chigger in the wood pile is a Murray, who is the grandpa.

[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.260]
He wasn't there last night.

[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.520]
You know, grandpa and grandma, the grandma's got these senior winces lips.

[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.980]
It's all right.

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.720]
It's all right.

[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.180]
You know, the one that remember he used to have the thing on his hand.

[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.540]
The face on it, that's her.

[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.340]
That was, oh, that was her.

[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.860]
That mouth, those lips.

[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.280]
That face on his hand with little rigged, that's her.

[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.640]
Mrs. Murray, or buddy, whatever it holds in it.

[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.520]
He's the problem.

[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.600]
Because these people confided in me last night and said, we're embarrassed too.

[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.720]
Rippin' the ass on here.

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.960]
I said, okay, I'll rip him an ass.

[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.500]
Murray, you will fog you disgusting, prophetic piece of crap.

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.160]
Sit your ass down next time you come there and stop using the kids.

[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.740]
This is a prop.

[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.120]
God.

[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.360]
Well, he gets the kids up there in here because from what I'm here in my sight,

[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.560]
that's the only thing you can get up.

[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.920]
Sit down, Murray.

[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.040]
Get out of everybody's way.

[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.500]
You have no such a sort of piece of crap.

[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.320]
Other than that, I had a great time.

[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.820]
Nine minutes after 10, at 5.63, W. Kim.

[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.480]
Can't you be a little more enthusiastic?

[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.320]
No.

[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.420]
No.

[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.040]
And just what bitch, we lost.

[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.540]
So why don't you see too much to be enthusiastic about?

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.880]
We scored one girl on a deflection no less.

[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.400]
We scored one fake and girl, but okay, not now better than we have been.

[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.980]
But I'm as per enthusiastic to make this bitch happy.

[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.960]
Because she's watching me through her binoculars because she has that bitch.

[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.500]
No social discerning, no publicity for that bitch.

[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.240]
Plus, wouldn't she mission a W. Kim.

[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.660]
And this is why she has so many.

[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.440]
So, ready and done as dirt.

[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.500]
Yes.

[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.420]
Well, she's got no fighting name and she flew up with it one night and now.

[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.380]
And she forgot all about the wind.

[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.420]
She said the subject is beat now.

[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.560]
And that's it in New York.

[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.280]
Pretty good.

[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.360]
And we want to vote.

[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.500]
And it's beat now.

[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.700]
Outrageous.

[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.820]
And she will find out that the number is down to the big one.

[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.000]
Well, she thought all along.

[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.620]
And she had to decide.

[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.320]
And she made it to the side.

[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.940]
And she was thinking that the rate was down to the hell.

[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.180]
And she said, what's that?

[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:38.380]

[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]
It's going to be her baby.

[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.820]
But she said, what's the point?

[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.000]
She's going to throw it out.

[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.260]
And I said, and I will find out that the number is down to the big one.

[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.260]
And she was really good with those.

[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.360]
And she will find out that the number is down to the big one.

[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.960]
14 to 5.60 W.Q.A.M.

[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.400]
And Israeli doctor said, medicine in my country is so advanced.

[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.740]
We can take a kidney out of one person, put it in another, and have him looking for work in six weeks.

[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.000]
The German doctor said that's nothing.

[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.120]
And Germany, we can take a lung out of one person, put it in another, and have him looking for work in four weeks.

[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:16.840]
A Russian doctor said, in my country, medicine is so advanced, we can take half a heart from one person, put it in another, and have them both working for work in two weeks.

[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:24.740]
The American doctor, not to be outdone, said, huh, we're about to take an asshole out of Texas, put him in the White House, and have the country be looking for work the next day.

[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.360]
Not bad?

[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.600]
Give it about an eight and a half on a scale of ten.

[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:38.120]
College football players sick with food poisoning transmitted virus to the posing team on the field in the first documenticative of the guidance board.

[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:48.740]
The Duke players vomited in the locker room on the sidelines during the September 19, 1998 game against FSU, which they lost 62 to 13.

[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.460]
The virus then spread to the other team.

[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.100]
The only contact between the two teams was on the playing field, the doctor Christine Moel, who said the Mo I see it.

[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.420]
I'll click where I get.

[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.800]
The virus was passed by people touching each other's contaminated hands.

[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.440]
Game film showed ill-dook players with vomit on their jersey, who's colliding with the proletariat, and Duke players wiping their mouthpieces on their hands, then touching a proletariat spaces and later shaking their hands.

[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:20.020]
Oh, shaking of shaking their hands, here's another little episode from last night, excitement at the Immacarina.

[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:29.280]
And this may be one other reason, maybe not as enthusiastic as I was since I had two cracked lips and a busted goddamn fractured bone in my hand to pitch.

[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:38.460]
See, even though when you're walking around without a cast, I'm not some obvious thing, even though I've been explaining on the year that I go for the hand therapy three times a week,

[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.100]
but thanks, Laura, as you're the best we'd art.

[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:53.840]
And even though my hand is coming along pretty good, and the cast is no longer there, not for a couple of weeks, the fact is that there's still pain in that little pinky because that last, that last widget, the last knuckle, was jammed in a cast for six weeks.

[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.760]
And it still hurts like a mother, so that when you shake somebody's hand, you really don't want to shake anybody's hand.

[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.540]
There was a very nice young lady, she's 24, very, listen to the show, she shook my hand, and that was just about right.

[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.380]
But these guys that shake their hands, they want to show you how manly they are, so that's the squeegee.

[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.040]
Quit squeegee, it's so hard in my hand too, okay? I'm not taking any more hands to lifting heels all off.

[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.920]
Do you have any idea how painful that is when there's when your bone is the pain and the one in your finger too?

[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.300]
It's pain in their squeegee.

[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:22.920]
It will fight.

[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.780]
Cut the crap you idiots.

[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.660]
So a lot of people are just to cut my left hand and say, you know, they're the ones still here on which it is, which it is, quit squeegee.

[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.680]
Or so she never called in that bitch, huh?

[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.800]
I'm going to call it a mile. I just, I would give my left nut.

[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.500]
So that bitch's to call.

[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.600]
How come you can't be more enthusiastic?

[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.760]
How come you can't mind your own effort and business, bitch? How come you're watching me with your binoculars?

[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.060]
I can think of a lot of other people in that place I'd be watching with binoculars, and I'm not one of them. Believe me.

[00:12:53.740 --> 00:13:01.640]
On speaking to people at some folks who don't watch with binoculars that Amy, uh, uh, simple MacPherson Murphy is still loud and just shrill.

[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.200]
Shrill. I mean, what do you, you know, you like the way she looks fine? Have, have added.

[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.920]
So to speak loud and shrill on an already loud and much too shrew up, he or she's system.

[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.900]
Dave Joseph says, taking a silver lining out of a dark cloud. At least we have some elbow room at the macarena.

[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.200]
You can't complain about the crowd last night because there was no, was that? Oh, none. It was pathetic.

[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:30.360]
And people tell me that we're there for the Carolina game, or we can go fight it. That that was not even much worse. That there was nobody there.

[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:37.360]
And speaking of nobody showing up, Michael Mayo for one. So this is the one side of the two or three times you have read a good column this year.

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:45.480]
Series of fallen classic about the fact that Fox is having a nervous breakdown because they spend all those billions of dollars for the right to carry baseball and their playoffs in the world.

[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:55.420]
And guess what? There's nobody watching except for New Yorkers who are well and thank goodness for the New Yorkers because that was the excuse to do your last night at the macarena when nobody showed up.

[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.480]
And I'm going to stick by my word. I said, I'm not going to be knocking people for not showing up the tickets are overpriced.

[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.060]
The food is gross and the tiny overpriced. They keep jacking up the prices every year on that food.

[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:13.460]
And the performance out there has been for the most part. Last night was better, but for the most part it's been pretty, pretty bad to say the best.

[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:22.840]
But you just keep playing and of course the good news I'm seeing is that with Pat Burns fired in Boston yesterday you can see him moving right on in here.

[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:33.160]
In fact, maybe even the organization pick it up a big chuck in his salary so the Harry Simmons doesn't have to pay out that 950 grand. Sounds good to me. Pat Burns great five I TM. See ya. See ya baby.

[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:41.240]
But when yesterday and on my door. He has a green thing on my door. Let me see a green thing on your door.

[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:52.040]
One of those things that they stick on your door. The state slash federal citrus canker eradication program will be inspecting trees in your area for citrus canker.

[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.480]
If you're next two weeks, please don't remove any citrus plants, plant parts or fruit from your property.

[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.180]
Well, I guess if we're going to remove fruit from our property, I'll have to move out.

[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.080]
How do you like that? Do I have any citrus? Oh, do I have any fruit tree? Oh, any citrus? No.

[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:17.440]
And oh. They showed a guy on the news live plant implantation. Some poor bands that was just hyperventilating and rightfully so.

[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:26.440]
Poppano plants canker battle in circuit court. Not only poppano beach is going to work, but also going to be joined in by a dear field beach course brings

[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.920]
the Elias Prykru Presidico, a creek pember of pines and late Wednesday plantation official voter,

[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:39.120]
considering filing a separate injunction against the citrus program or the fascist state, the chanko fascists are coming in and just tearing up your property.

[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:48.300]
Just keep in mind who's behind this. His last name is spelled with the BUSH. Okay. Just keep in mind he's the headhunch of the chanker police.

[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:57.760]
567-0560, Palm 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Now, the single call on the board here this morning after last night.

[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:07.780]
Well, they don't care about that. And that was pretty obvious by who he's there. So I could just go down the soil. I've got eight million things to him, including that great article from the Atlanta newspaper if I can ever find it.

[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:16.680]
It's here somewhere in the middle of all this other drug, all this other meaningless craft from the local papers. Like I said, it's in here somewhere George Goddamnit.

[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:24.640]
I've got four come out yesterday, by the way. I won't. George won big lucky for their. I got hit the kill I crap.

[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:31.660]
We'll be we hate the most on this show. George winning hands down. But if you love them both one, they're big. They're in a real loving movie yesterday,

[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:46.700]
which is unusual for this crowd. 377 out of 705. But they hate George the most. 236, 33 and a third up to 3% they said you tired of turn them hate you like poison. Hate them both equally 51 and hate

[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:57.860]
Neil the most only 40. However, 12.8, I'll lucky 13% hate for the bus. The same. So that there's a lot about this audience and also a lot about this market. Make no mistake about that.

[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:10.400]
I don't hate anybody except that bitch from the game last night. Here's a mobile and vocal hello. Okay, nice talking to you. Mobile and plantation hello.

[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:24.480]
Hey Neil, yes sir. I got two questions. One last night, do you think the turning point of the game was that will roll call against both of your interference which cost us a goal and gave them a power play and gave them a goal.

[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:35.720]
So let me let me say this here. Didn't give them a goal. You have to be able to kill penalties and they didn't kill the penalty. They never got it out of their own in one time on that power play. And usually past it around like there was nobody else on the ice before the only stuck it in there.

[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:46.220]
You can't win the officials when you played seven games and they had a run one and a dish in which you can't win any games without scoring goals. You can't win games without sticking the biscuit in the basket.

[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:58.280]
I can't argue with that and I I email the panthers asking for TM head and I got the response that Terry Murray with his 30 years of experience combined with Bill Cory.

[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:07.060]
No, it's more about hockey than I do and most of self-water really has these here to stay here to stay. You want to bet who I want to see what happens.

[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:13.260]
If they lose the national and the Ottawa Saturday which they will lose out of here Saturday. If they lose those two games I'm guarantee you by next week you'll be gone.

[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:27.360]
I'll be going to party. Okay, I'll be there with you. Okay, good going pal. That's what they always say that big voter confidence comes just before the big bond drops. Okay, TM, I don't want you to get nervous or insecure sweetheart but believe me they're not playing for you at all.

[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:38.960]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Latest post shows grow 4 points up in Florida. However CNN discovered that girl who was up one point in their 4 2 days ago.

[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:46.000]
Now he's 4 5 points behind Bush. Anybody believe in any of these balls? No, I don't. I mean they're just to his you know what they like. They like to get in stock market.

[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:54.640]
Historical way to hell up and then way to hell down it like everybody's peeing in their pants like those crazy Canadian people yesterday with that North Hell stock.

[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:01.260]
The TSE went down the Toronto Stock Exchange went out 850 points yesterday because North Hell represents a third of the whole guy they exchanged.

[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.660]
So when one stock like that takes a big crap and the whole thing goes in the in the crapper.

[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.320]
You've heard of a rational exuberance we have a rational hysteria. That's what's going on now.

[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.800]
Here's our poll question for today. What's the way a US Senate thing?

[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.980]
In fact, what we ought to do we ought to take a poll go out there and find out if the people know who's running for US Senate from the state of Florida.

[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:31.960]
Before I even get the names. That would be good. What percentage of people you think would know who the candidate are for the United States Senate?

[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:39.100]
So running for Connie Maxx. 10% or just 10 people maybe 10 people in the state. That's not that out of 15 million.

[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:46.580]
If the election were today who would you vote for for US Senate Bill Nelson, Bill McCallum or Lily Logan?

[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.500]
Who I guess is looking to be the chigger in the wood pile.

[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:57.780]
Yeah. Good old Uncle Tom Turing Code. Lily Logan. Remember Willie Horton? Here's Evan Ture. Hello.

[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.440]
Hello Neil. Yes. I called about something else that you just talked about hockey.

[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.200]
I'm talking about whatever you want. I'm not talking about hockey. Are you out of your mind?

[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.960]
Yeah. Talk about hockey will be off the year before noon. Last night on the telecast after the first period. Yeah.

[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.980]
They reviewed Len Berry. I saw it. Remember 6.000. Yeah. Yeah. And I saw Len, Len, Carl, a monitor who put him right on the spot.

[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.640]
You said that was the first 16 game rumor. Yeah. But anyway, one time I was trying to question you.

[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.460]
You see the 60 minutes? Someday? Yeah. On the little kids who made like $800,000. Right. Stop Mark.

[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.560]
I'm going to start calling him Jonathan was his name. I got his name and I'm going to call him for some stock tips.

[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.500]
Little John. Little John. But he didn't know what he thought about that.

[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.400]
That he was like innocent. He was. I got news for it. I'm glad that the CNBC people are down here.

[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.500]
Just like his lawyer said, he's a zillion times less guilty than all these stakers that they got one on their right now.

[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:54.420]
James White, state street research, CNBC is famous for this. They take all of these goddamn quacks and they put them on there

[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.700]
and they're promoting all his bull crap and come up with all these so-called expert opinions.

[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:03.800]
They're asked from your elbow and the meantime, all they do when they're typing up their own stocks that they got a vested interest in.

[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.900]
You're right. No one knows anything about anything. That's right. I also want things. 60 minutes later, it sounded like he was just ignorant of the law. He just didn't know it.

[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:19.780]
What he was doing. But that bell prevention was that when they went on a surprise visit to Little John's house. He had pinnups in his bedroom of Michael Milken and Ivan Bowske. Right.

[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.680]
So that kind of picked him off. Well, who was good enough for him on it and he came away from it with a half a million bucks. Right.

[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:32.060]
So that's wrong with that. It's American effort. Right, baby? He knew exactly exactly. By the way, me and my wife were the guiding light couple. Yeah.

[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:39.640]
We love now made a cigarette girl. Well, I haven't been watching lately. I don't know. I don't know who that is.

[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:46.220]
Oh, you know the one that's a Danny hired to me. Right. Okay. And Dr. Bauer, I was trying to push candy on her. Okay.

[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:54.620]
Dr. Bauer or Rick, I see I'm all confused. Let's do a guiding light show. No, let's do a hockey show. No, no, no.

[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.100]
26th after 10 at 560 WQM.

[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:57.740]
Very dope.

[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.560]
I need another portion and I need it.

[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:18.900]
I feel like a baby hanging out my ass. I'm hobbling and having trouble lifting my feet.

[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:31.320]
I'm going to quit the fake. I'm down the street. It's the Horton shuffle. Yeah, I never do this. I never interrupt a bit in the middle, but I'm going to do it just because this lady called in by request. Hello. Yes. Yes.

[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:41.980]
You said that I wouldn't have the merits to quit. I'm a bitch from the last night. Yeah. How you doing, bitch? But you give me less birth. Yeah. You're a dress for what?

[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:52.440]
I left not. Yeah. Yeah. I was trying to be you. You were you obnoxious. I was I was always disgusting. I was not. Am I not going to ask you if you're still want to see

[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.660]
asked to come you and your husband were high-tailing it out of there with a minute and a half to go. You know, I wish so much more

[00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.920]
to see as if then I am. I wouldn't sit there waiting on your ass for the pastors to use that last minute and a half inside the

[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:10.660]
game up and go it over time. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's my husband's choice. I always really think two minutes before the end of the game. I want to send my

[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.780]
sympathies to your husband and like I said to all the men out there because they have to put up with nagging nagging

[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:21.880]
Bet you women like you who just never stop. Okay. I mean, just imagine the hootspots somebody saying I got my

[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:27.320]
binoculars on you and how come you're not more enthusiastic. Why don't you watch the game instead of watching me?

[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.660]
Because you're more interested. No, I'm more interested in the game. Well, that's just a lot about your enthusiasm for the game. Let me say

[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.940]
something. You're a Yenta. You're a professional. Fick in Yenta. That's a lot of my sister. Yeah. And your mother even your mother can't

[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.780]
stand yet. What are you doing? Complaining about the food? You complain about the crowd? I don't understand. A million

[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:49.140]
of the position. Put yourself to that much effort. Let me ask you was there a big crowd there last night? No. Was the food

[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:55.120]
grace? Oh, you need it. Oh, I see. So how do you know? I've used Mr. Swerve. Or you do it. Complains. You should put it. It's

[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:00.720]
much easier to do the other than I am. Yes. I've been having one other person in this town who gets more people

[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:08.400]
than those games than I do. Then you want other person? I can't. Oh. That's why we will watch you. That's why you

[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:15.160]
want to watch me. Next time next time I best advice. Please watch the game. Leave the binoculars home. Unless you're watching

[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.000]
Ray Whitney and Pavellbury real close. Unless you're watching them. Leave the binoculars home and watch the game.

[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.860]
Thank you. I like it. We're all like I said.

[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:35.080]
Oh, we abortion and shuffle. So that's the time we end trouble. Leave me out on the double. Turn me in the

[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:45.620]
surf at the speedest. I don't want to pay. I can't swim with you because that I don't do work. I'm lactating. I don't fall over my

[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:52.940]
shirt. Walking like a pig and baby. That's why I'm a propagate spread and stretch. It's the abortion

[00:24:52.940 --> 00:25:02.480]
shuffle. We abortion shuffle. We abortion shuffle. We have a hanger on the double. We can find water by

[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.320]
the way.

[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:17.100]
And it is actually just thinking of preaching instruction. Let me tell you about a great friend of mine, Dr. Ron, who's been coming to the

[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.540]
games for as long as I can remember, who comes around. Nice guy giving us a nice big check for a Camilla

[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:27.920]
South and then center one in the US past every year. First it was a thousand and it was two thousand bucks, which I have always

[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.480]
appreciated very much. But I thought about it sitting here this morning. I thought about it last night. I thought about

[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.700]
my God this morning. And I'm thinking about it here before the show today. I'm not taking his money because he comes to me

[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:47.280]
before the game. We're talking I usual hockey talk and he's a very nice guy in some ways. But he's one of those jewels for Hitler.

[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.140]
You know, I'm talking about Republican Jews and Republican only in a self-serving financial way because he knows he's not

[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.920]
an immigrant guy. He's a very bright guy. He knows that Bush isn't dummy. I even brought that up to him. I had my

[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:04.320]
go and go and get his button on the really game last night. And he's in denial. He says instead of saying he's not a

[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.680]
moron. He says, well, he's going to show out himself with a lot of great people. I said, like who? Like Trent lot and like Jesse Helms.

[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.620]
And I went through the whole list of all these fascists, Pat Robertson, Gary Bauer. He's an older colon power.

[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.780]
That was the one man that keep coming up with the token like in Pekhich Forts. The colon power. Let's

[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.160]
say one claim to fame. And so many way he says to me, what's your cheer? What are you going to be this year?

[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.100]
As if he doesn't know because he's been back for a while down here. He's just over it. He's been back down here.

[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:33.720]
He knows it's planned parenthood. And didn't I tell you? Didn't I mention that to you? The about really wondered if he was going to come to you.

[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:40.020]
Now I will say this to show you what a nice guy he is. He says, well, I will give you a contribution because he looked at me when I said

[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:47.880]
that he was like, it looked like I just held the cross up and brought a Dracula and the wolf pain.

[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.280]
And I knew that would be his reaction. And he said, well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you the check.

[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:58.160]
But after the election is over because I don't want to find out that any of my money is going to those campaign ads that they're running.

[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.620]
And of course, he's talking about those very effective ads that plan parenthood put together.

[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:07.280]
The Republican women for choice, which you see those ads on there with all those women who voted Republican in the past,

[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.600]
or now voting Democratic right down the line because they're sick and tired of this fetus hugging crap.

[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.300]
Of these people who come on there like Bruce and say, oh, I believe in the people the people should make their own choices.

[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:23.240]
Except of course, when it comes to women, for example, just as one example, when it comes to personal liberties.

[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.160]
So I'm not going to take your money around. I appreciate the fact that you're still, you know, you're still waiting to give it.

[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.220]
I won't take it. In fact, if we come up a little short, which I doubt because it looks like we're going to have a big year raising money,

[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.000]
or if we come up a little short, I'll put another two grand in there myself before the end of December,

[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.060]
which I've already put my 10 grand in. I'll put another two grand in there because I don't want to take your money.

[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.680]
Not that you're a bad guy and you're willing to put it in there, but just because the whole principle nauseates me.

[00:27:52.260 --> 00:28:00.200]
Right wing Jews, Jews who support Jews who support Jerry Farwell and Pat Robertson and Gary Bauer and Trent Lot and Tom DeLay

[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.020]
and that whole bunch of anti-Semitic obnoxious only because of dollars and cents.

[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.580]
And like I put a lot of you during these discussions we've had last few weeks on the show.

[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.580]
If that's all you care about is you're 60-cent a day a ledge proposed tax cut that you think you're going to get,

[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:17.900]
or like the one guy said, oh, the two grand a year is going to make a big deal like he's going to get two grand a year,

[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:23.980]
which he won't, but if he did, if you were in the sellout, I'm printable for a few bucks, then you know,

[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.640]
it's a free country, at least so far, go right ahead. Not this kid.

[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.720]
It's not worth it to me and I guarantee you I would say by hell of a lot more than most of you every year, but I'm not going to do it.

[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.880]
Julius Fruitler, a very, very offensive to me.

[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.440]
Here's some rise. Sit on.

[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:47.640]
They have fun and the word principles should come up because the one thing I really enjoy your show about and enjoy your opinion,

[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.100]
you've been pretty consistent all the time about everything.

[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:50.500]
Yeah.

[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:57.240]
If you spent two years explaining why what you've done in the past doesn't matter because they're doing a good job,

[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.480]
you know, it's his own friggin business, what he did in his private time.

[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.760]
But now the only thing that seems to matter to you is that Bush did drugs 30 years ago or 20 years ago and

[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.380]
he drinks ever once a while, you cannot go on.

[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.120]
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:09.940]
Now I'm out there.

[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.160]
Sir, let me say it again.

[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.840]
Use there's a difference between somebody collapsing, which they all do and somebody having a substance of use problem

[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.700]
that you want to put with his button on the figure of nuclear weapons.

[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.860]
Don't you say the difference without the joy of your diaphragm.

[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:22.560]
So what do you say?

[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.740]
We check everybody out of their job that has a substance problem.

[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.720]
I think that the president shouldn't be somebody with a substance abuse problem and there is no sex thing in

[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.220]
spread of your attempt to rationalize.

[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.560]
There is no sex thing as an ex alcoholic.

[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.960]
That's like being a little bit pregnant.

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.700]
But that's all you care about.

[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.060]
Then that's all I care about.

[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:44.000]
And of course, how much have I talked about that compared, like 1% compared to the other 99% about the issues

[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.540]
and about the fact that he's a moron, which I got all kinds of material here for you, sir, which I know I won't

[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.100]
convince you.

[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:58.700]
If George, if George W is banging all kinds of broads on the side and an addition to which I guess we're also supposed to forget if it comes out

[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.760]
that he actually paid off for that abortion years ago in the early 70s.

[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.740]
If we're influenced, story turns out to be true.

[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.060]
What are you going to say then instead of worrying about what I'm saying and being consistent,

[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:13.020]
how about all you Monica penis gay people out there who've been condemning Barbara for getting the flu

[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.980]
a few blow jobs.

[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.900]
How about you people?

[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.600]
What are you going to say?

[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.340]
All you feeders, how do you say?

[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.300]
I'll kiss the Dan Ground.

[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:22.780]
I'll tell you that.

[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.360]
In fact, I'll kiss that brought from the hockey game last night to just call.

[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.180]
I'll kiss your run into the lips right in front of the arena for everybody to see they can put the picture on the front page

[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:29.780]
with the newspaper.

[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.360]
I'll kiss your run to the lips with either the little tongue for crying out loud.

[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:38.000]
If that Larry Funt Story comes out between now and the Russian day, that's how enthusiastic I am about that.

[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.420]
Because that's what you're dealing with is all this all-brain morality back all these hypocritical assholes,

[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.520]
these grave robbers.

[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.840]
Let me say it again.

[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:54.440]
Just take a look if you can go back in the internet and find the files from the pictures that they've had on there of Houston, Texas,

[00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:00.320]
on a nice sunny day when you can't see 15 feet in front of you because the Euro-Soup alluded from his good buddies in the world industry.

[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.280]
That's what he's going to do for your environment.

[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.640]
Just a big frickin puppet.

[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.380]
That's all he is.

[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.240]
Just a no nothing of underhead.

[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.100]
So you aren't.

[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.340]
So I'm supposed to forget the fact.

[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.080]
I mean, first of all, the fact is that Clinton happens to be a capable president.

[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.140]
He's been a tremendous leader.

[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.420]
He's also not a moron.

[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.620]
He's a very educated guy.

[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.320]
He knows where a person always under that and did a pretty dang good job there too, by the way.

[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.240]
And let me ask you, is Melissa Vittstill a little bit arrogant?

[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.880]
No, and you were sloppy and there was not.

[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.240]
But you like that.

[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.080]
But don't confuse this guy with the facts.

[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.300]
We're talking about somebody who A does have a substance abuse problem,

[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.860]
which we really don't know the extent of.

[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.860]
And B is a moron.

[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.500]
You put those two together and to me you got something very, very dangerous.

[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.300]
Speaking of something dangerous, our sales department continues being dangerous.

[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.560]
The choice draper would ever respond about Chuck Alphiery.

[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.800]
So we got two guys down there who look a lot like Trace Drapery and Todd Dreck,

[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:01.860]
names even sound like.

[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.720]
And they refuse to service their clients.

[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.800]
And Charles Alphiery's been on his show probably as long as anybody

[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.140]
under the sun. He's a great guy.

[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.540]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.880]
Take a pill of oxygen.

[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.200]
No, Dr. Vittstill we did it too.

[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.020]
You just hop on a day with the sicker who blew.

[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.560]
The trauma, trauma, hey, you feel the bullshit on me.

[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.900]
Speaking of abortion's queer channel communications,

[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.860]
the biggest US radio company reported the best quarter in their history.

[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.640]
And I read this only because I know a lot of people over there who work there.

[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.180]
Are going to be really upset just like we're reading about the beesleaf and all the money that they're making.

[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.300]
And the people who get real upset and nice, their teeth and pee all over the floor in the hallways.

[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.840]
Because they're so discreet with the fact that the beesleafs won't pay them on time

[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.100]
and it's just a bunch of cheap pricks.

[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:17.040]
Well, queer channel reported their best quarter in history with record net revenues of $1.6

[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.020]
billion dollars.

[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.500]
Only 60.

[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.780]
Up 98% of it the third quarter of last year and after task cash flow of 3M to 38.9 million

[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.340]
and increase the 55% from the third quarter of 1999.

[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.300]
And of course this goes right in line with what I've been telling about what you have

[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.460]
to see into this industry.

[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.000]
This is destroyed it butchered it.

[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.060]
And this earnings report right on the heels of the making all those budget cuts

[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.000]
and all the New York stations up there and all the morning and groaning in the bad morale

[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.380]
and people grumbling and bumming.

[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.880]
Nice go on cheap channel.

[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.060]
Assholes.

[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.080]
Here's the mobile and four-lotterdale.

[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.320]
Hello.

[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.040]
Yes, I am.

[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.740]
I'm nearly there.

[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.280]
I'm here.

[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.740]
Yes, Naila.

[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.160]
I'm very glad to be talking about because of the election.

[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.240]
What I'm surprised is that nobody's talking about dust haul and what a goddamn good man he is.

[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:58.960]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.580]
567-0560.

[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.440]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:03.920]
Here's the broker.

[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:04.240]
Hello.

[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.500]
Hi there, Naila.

[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:05.800]
How you doing?

[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920]
Good to see you.

[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.880]
I love listening to you.

[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.340]
I'm essentially the fact of the anti-bush site.

[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.120]
Yes.

[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.200]
Did you get it?

[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:12.500]
I got it.

[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:12.740]
I got it.

[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.280]
I got it.

[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.040]
Okay.

[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.200]
I don't know if you want to tell your listeners.

[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.680]
I mean it's pretty interesting when you go look at all the facts of the man's record and text.

[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.260]
Well, I'll get to it a little later but the fact is that the guy's like that first one

[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.060]
that's called here this morning.

[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.140]
He is interested in the fact.

[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.060]
He's made up his mind and this man could be the dumbest white man on the face of the globe

[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.400]
and it would make a difference to him.

[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:32.980]
Yep.

[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.820]
I agree with that.

[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.660]
This is amazing how it fits the personality thing.

[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.720]
That was anti-bush.

[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.100]
Well, if he's a personality thing or you have people who are professional Republicans like my

[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.740]
friend Ron there from the game last night who's just obsessed with how much money he's going to

[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.600]
save on taxes and that's all he cares about is big business and he's willing to look the other

[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:49.840]
way.

[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:50.180]
It's true.

[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.780]
All this principle down the toilet over the fact that these right wingers, these farbitioned

[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.980]
right wingers, I don't want to take it over the Republican Party.

[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.640]
I don't want to pull all the strings on Bush.

[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:58.420]
Doesn't care.

[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.220]
Yeah, I'd like you to just vote in like you.

[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.580]
I mean, I make good money and I'd probably be in one of the brackets and we get a lot

[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.100]
of money back.

[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:04.380]
Right.

[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:05.840]
But I had a conscience.

[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:06.960]
That's right.

[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.920]
I mean, you just can't throw the social service up when you go.

[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.860]
I mean, if you have no self-respect at all and if your price is that low that for a few

[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.300]
bucks of all in the cell out then you're not much of a person.

[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.320]
I'd rather make a little more money and throw it at more people.

[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:18.980]
There you go.

[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.680]
Oh, that was a good talk.

[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.860]
Let's just have a great day pal.

[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.580]
Thanks for your time.

[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.100]
Thanks for your info.

[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.600]
5, 6, 7, 05, 50 count.

[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.280]
How's our thinking?

[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.160]
I'd rather vote for money hall than Gus Hall.

[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.480]
At least money hall, not our number one.

[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.340]
He's Canadian number two.

[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:30.940]
He's still alive.

[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.440]
If the election were being held today, who would you vote for for?

[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.520]
US Senate here in the marginal state of Florida, Bill Nelson, 16, Bill McCallum, 11,

[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.840]
Willie Logan, 1.

[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.540]
Willie Logan, 1.

[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.260]
He'd be the chigger in the wood pile, baby.

[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.020]
Willie Logan.

[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.740]
He'd be pissed off because then our credit party snubbed him.

[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:52.120]
So first of all, he endorsed Jeff Bush and then Jeff Bush came out with his damn anti-affirmative

[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.460]
action and nothing and all the charges got all been out of shape.

[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.900]
And then Willie Logan's as well.

[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.620]
I guess what I want and try to throw this thing to Bill McCallum.

[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.560]
He wants to be the Ralph Nader here in Florida, screw up the goddamn election.

[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.940]
But so far, Willie only got one vote.

[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.280]
Here's a mobile in the Gables.

[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:07.540]
Hello?

[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:08.780]
Neil.

[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.340]
I'm glad I got through to you.

[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.840]
I'm a long time listener.

[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.520]
In fact, I'm also originally from Rochester, New York as well.

[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.640]
No, I'm nobody's perfect, yes.

[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.080]
I know.

[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:18.600]
I know.

[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:18.720]

[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.360]
I'm 50, 26 years ago to get out of there.

[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.040]
Anyway.

[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.120]
I just can't believe.

[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:29.380]
I mean, certainly this is the election where the lesser of two evils is going to win.

[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:29.800]

[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.220]
But the goal.

[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:39.860]
I mean, I just can't imagine anyone possibly voting for Gore and using as a criteria Bush's

[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.540]
personal history.

[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.040]
Gore is done as is right.

[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.840]
He is a liar.

[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.520]
He's done.

[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.800]
He's done based on what?

[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.280]
Based on the fact that number one, he's the least promising all things to all people.

[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.080]
No, no, he would know.

[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.060]
So I don't want a bunch of glittering generalities.

[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.380]
You said he's dumb based on what?

[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.560]
Based on the fact that number one, he's the least promising all things to all people.

[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:04.820]
Okay.

[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.460]
You can't have a conversation.

[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.320]
Go back to Rochester.

[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.780]
In fact, it wouldn't take you back.

[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.900]
They probably stick your ass in Cobb's Hill.

[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.360]
You're an idiot.

[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.220]
Nobody says Gore is dumb.

[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.240]
They may say he's a liar.

[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.520]
They may say this a lot of things.

[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.700]
It may say his personality is like a statue, which is true, but nobody, nobody anywhere

[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.240]
has the audacity to say that he's dumb.

[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.800]
And again, everything being relative and you're talking about the lesser of two evils,

[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.440]
compared to Bush, he's a goddamn rocket scientist.

[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.600]
In fact, compared to Bush, my little miniature pincher is a genius.

[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.760]
So you can continue obfuscating through an Apollo crap here when I ask you a very specific

[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.140]
question twice and you come back with the same non-answer.

[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.580]
That marks the end of our conversation, sir.

[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.200]
I would say I would see it done in Bob, but I hate to have, I don't think they would

[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:49.740]
let you in there.

[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.080]
And especially since I went to school right next door to done in Bob's at Brighton Elementary

[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.860]
School, I don't think that they'd let you in there either because even the elementary

[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.520]
school kids, they're going to school right now.

[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.660]
At this moment, as I speak, are certainly far more intelligent than you are.

[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.120]
You see, the rest of us thinking living and breathing people can envision, in fact, many

[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.320]
people came to me at the game last night and they all except for my friend Ron, of course,

[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.180]
who's a lifelong Republican because of the money factor and is a cop out in the cell

[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:14.340]
out.

[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.880]
Good guy but a cop out.

[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.820]
But other than that, every single one of them said the same thing.

[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:24.180]
They can't believe that anybody could vote for someone as obviously dumb as George W. Bush.

[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.260]
It's written on his face.

[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.060]
There it is.

[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:27.980]
It's written.

[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.840]
It's on his forehead.

[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:30.800]
It's his look at me.

[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.300]
Can you believe how dumb I am?

[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:32.500]
No.

[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.940]
That confused beer and the lights in the headlights look like,

[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.740]
but please somebody show me where I am on the map.

[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.580]
Far right wing suffers in silence is Bush's phrase.

[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.840]
I'm going to start reading these articles.

[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:49.180]
Okay.

[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.580]
I'm sick and tired of listening to all your stupid bush lickers out there who can't

[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.660]
conduct a conversation because you don't have the facts on your side.

[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.020]
You've got nothing on your side.

[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.960]
And now you're starting to get real panicky because every goddamn pool one day

[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.840]
it's one way when it's so goddamn close, you don't know what the scream or each

[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.420]
of heat is banana.

[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.460]
That's your problem.

[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.900]
Cynthia Tucker editorial paid editor of the Atlanta Constitution hardly a

[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.100]
neoliberal newspaper.

[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:21.000]
She says far right wing suffers in silence as Bush's raise, but the strings are

[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.860]
ready should he win.

[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.040]
This is no doubt that a challenging election season for James Dodson,

[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.520]
Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and other icons of the ultra conservative wing of

[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.300]
the Republican Party.

[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.620]
They've had to keep their mouths mostly shut.

[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.600]
They mostly out of sight and watches George W Bush publicly distance himself from

[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.240]
much that the fringe right has stood for over the past two decades.

[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.520]
What a change from just four years ago, then every major Republican politician

[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.020]
was required to kiss the rings of those self-annoyed arbiters of morality and

[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:48.740]
family values.

[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.780]
These days, Mr. Bush and his vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney regard any

[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.920]
public recognition of Mrs. Dopson Robertson that all is the kiss of death.

[00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.060]
But he gets it will power hungry and publicity seeking though they may be.

[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.660]
Reverend Robertson is right wing brethren have dealt with it.

[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.000]
They've resisted the temptation to chastise Mr. Bush too loudly or too often to

[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.120]
demand a public vow of fealty or to do anything to frighten off the independent

[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:10.380]
voters.

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.480]
Mr. Bush needs to win.

[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.860]
They're much too desperate for that.

[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.140]
After eight years of wandering in the wilderness of presidential politics,

[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.180]
the religious and social rights believe that within a hairs breadth of having

[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.360]
the white and the white house a man who will do their bidding.

[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.960]
Even if Mr. Bush is given in the stiff arm lately, they believe they can

[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.120]
control him if he wins.

[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.700]
There is no reason to believe that Mr. Bush harbors the same harsh and

[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.900]
their social views that they do.

[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.900]
He seems genuinely dedicated to diversity and social intolerance,

[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.480]
but there's also no reason to believe that Mr. Bush would do anything to stop

[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.100]
the fringe right from pushing its gay bashing woman hating agenda into law

[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:42.800]
where he'd be elected.

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.080]
After all the most outrageous exaggeration that Mr. Bush has offered during

[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.080]
the campaign among a host of his distortions that the Washington press

[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.500]
court is sourcing to either ignore or downplay is his insistence that he will

[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.980]
lead of all the characteristics that Mark.

[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.420]
Mr. Bush's tenure as governor of Texas leadership is not among them.

[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.480]
As head of a state with a weak governor system, Mr. Bush mostly went

[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.340]
along to get a law.

[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.040]
He never took on the Texas Texas death machine despite reams of evidence

[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.860]
that the criminal justice system there is riddled with racism and competence

[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.280]
and error.

[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.780]
He never challenged the Texas Republican Party, whose official platform

[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:19.100]
would appeal all minimum wage laws and abolish social security and

[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.260]
declares the homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental unchanging

[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.700]
truth that have been ordained by God.

[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.780]
He never stood up for the big business interest that during the air,

[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.440]
pollute the water or defy regulation.

[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.160]
Given Mr. Bush's record and wintersness, the retrowife feels certain

[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.020]
it can pull his strings.

[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.840]
So they've mostly stayed silent when he declared that he would not have

[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.380]
spent outlaw abortion until a lot of minds are changed or they wouldn't

[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.020]
try to revoke the FDA's approval of RU486.

[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.380]
They knew he was pervercating on the second point anyway, just a week or

[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.060]
so earlier, a Bush spokesman said that Mr. Bush would try to overturn

[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.400]
FDA approval of the drug.

[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.560]
And they purse their lips and grip their teeth when Mr. Bush and Mr.

[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.680]
Cheney, whose daughter Mary is a lesbian, refused during debates to

[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.920]
anonymously, religious rights, reflective condemnation of homosexuality as an

[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.480]
abomination.

[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.640]
Indeed, Mr. Cheney went so far to say that people should be free to

[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.580]
enter in any kind of relationship they want to enter into.

[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.020]
That probably provoked private fits from the Reverend Fallwell who once

[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.060]
took out after a PBS puppet aimed at toddlers as an agent of the

[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.040]
homosexual agenda.

[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.640]
But he and his fellow travelers were able to mute their rage and finding

[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.120]
their descent mostly the comments on the websites of their respective

[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.260]
right wing organizations.

[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.080]
They figured that if Mr. Bush can just hold on and not mangled any more

[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.180]
syntax or mix up any more world leaders, the fringe right will have as

[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.160]
NRA executives once put it, a president where we work out of their

[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.980]
office and they're probably right.

[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.620]
The Cynthia Tucker on the editorial page of the Atlanta Constitution.

[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.220]
Nice going Cynthia.

[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:44.960]
They're probably right as in far right and speaking of the NRA in the

[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.860]
last month, the National Rifle Association has contributed $950,000

[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:56.060]
to the George W. Bush campaign in the last one month, almost a

[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.040]
Philip Morris tobacco company was by the way my friend runs a lot of

[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.720]
Philip Morris tobacco stocky mentioned me in passing and realized what

[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.120]
he was saying.

[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.500]
Philip Morris tobacco number one contributor National Rifle Association

[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.340]
number three contributor, the pharmaceutical companies number four and

[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.980]
the big oil companies right in there in the top 10.

[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.680]
The great polluter and seller out of your rights and seller out to

[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.720]
corporate interests.

[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.400]
With or without the booze problem with or without a nose problem with

[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.980]
or without any of those problems a bulls a puppet of the dangerous

[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.380]
right.

[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.640]
So we don't need any other reasons.

[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.080]
But if Larry Flint's ready, we're ready.

[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.240]
For before 11 to 5 50 WQA.

[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.620]
Will you flood back the the ATH black casting call.

[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.200]
All right, Tom Broca.

[00:43:52.400 --> 00:44:03.200]
I'm going to second part one more.

[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:03.920]
All right.

[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.120]
Next my time.

[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.400]
My time.

[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.720]
Yes, my time.

[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.400]
My time.

[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.180]
Stop saying what I'm saying.

[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.160]
I say well, please.

[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.480]
I'm not again.

[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.460]
Again.

[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.260]
Next Jesse Jackson.

[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:18.940]
Up luck.

[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.680]
The best luck.

[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.420]
Jesse I'm sorry, but the duck is white.

[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:25.940]
Next.

[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.300]
Woody Allen.

[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.880]
Just nuts him into duck that talk.

[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.020]
Stay to the spread, Mr Allen.

[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.240]
It's crazy to sanity.

[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:34.640]
Great.

[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.440]
Align please.

[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.900]
Why would it duck speak?

[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:37.800]
Next.

[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.980]
The great Sean Connery sir.

[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.080]
How welcome sir.

[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:42.500]
Welcome.

[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:42.840]
Welcome.

[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:43.540]

[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.040]
Sir, just read the line, please.

[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:45.480]
Off.

[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.640]
Excuse me sir.

[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:47.960]
Again.

[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:48.420]
Off.

[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:48.780]

[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.560]
Sir, I'm sorry.

[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.100]
That second part in the line.

[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:52.780]
I don't.

[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.120]
I'm simply saying.

[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:54.540]
Off.

[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:55.880]
Next.

[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.220]
Oh God.

[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.680]
I guess we got Gilbert Godfried over here.

[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.420]
All right.

[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.240]
Give it to me Gilbert.

[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:03.920]
At what?

[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.500]
At one more time Gilbert.

[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.020]
At what?

[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.360]
Well Gilbert, I pretty much hate you.

[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.520]
And I think you're terrible.

[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.200]
But get a close thing we got.

[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:11.880]
You got the job.

[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.020]
11.020560 W2M.

[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.960]
See we can't really take a poll either on presidential

[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.600]
or the Senate or anything else because as soon as we do and it takes

[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.540]
usually about 40 minutes, 45 minutes.

[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.080]
And that's exactly what it took this time.

[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.220]
And then they get the word out and all of a sudden all these people aren't even listening to the show.

[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.480]
For example, Bill Nelson was ahead of Bill McCollum by about like 35 to 17 something like that.

[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.420]
And now all of a sudden it's 35 35 will really log in with 10.

[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.300]
Does anybody believe that?

[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.940]
Oh, and I guarantee you the next couple of flashes here probably by 11 30 Bill McCollum has been at 600 votes.

[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:40.760]
It wouldn't surprise me.

[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.140]
But I enjoy doing that because the coast is sure the degree of desperation.

[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:50.400]
Just like that fact we had from the guy was talking about how they're doing this on all these polls on every website all over America.

[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.560]
The degree of desperation.

[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.160]
These are the right way nut cases.

[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:54.700]
Desperate.

[00:45:55.060 --> 00:46:03.600]
And especially getting more and more desperate rattling their spears now that they see the last couple of days that the polls are really so damn close as opposed to the weekend when they thought Bush was really open in a big lead.

[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:08.280]
In fact, even on CNN yesterday, instead of now giving Bush a five-point lead nationally and a popular vote,

[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.820]
they showed five of the battleground states including Florida where they showed Gore four points ahead.

[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:18.440]
And other than Oregon where Bush was four points it was in every one of the states Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida.

[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.140]
I forget what the other one was four on the five.

[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.780]
So these nervous Nellies out there probably just have a fit a Smith fit.

[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.180]
Here's a call in Naples.

[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:30.520]
Hello.

[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:31.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.980]
Last caller was a complete idiot.

[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.060]
Which one was that?

[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.820]
The guy who was talking about Bush's gorge intelligent.

[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.740]
I mean that Bush is in when I asked her when I asked him why.

[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.620]
And he keeps, he can't answer the question.

[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:44.680]
Yeah.

[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.500]
Let me bring up to the point about the Rand Corporation study.

[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:48.940]
Yes.

[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.900]
My parents have a good friend whose daughter works for the corporation in Southern California.

[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.500]
It is an extremely conservative organization.

[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.600]
It is not a left wing liberal saint tank.

[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.080]
Yeah.

[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.600]
This is a very conservative organization.

[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.340]
His own people are telling him he's lying.

[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.740]
There's just no question about it.

[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.000]
Right.

[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.040]
The kids, the testing is rigged.

[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.300]
The kids are very stressed in that state.

[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.060]
When you put testing is the only criterion.

[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.180]
You put a lot of pressure on the kids.

[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.960]
They're not allowed to learn at their own level.

[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:24.480]
You know?

[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.480]
So these kids are stressed out.

[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.180]
All they're doing is teaching them to pass the test.

[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:29.380]
Yeah.

[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.860]
So the drop-off rate is much higher than they really have been reporting to.

[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.260]
Because a lot of these kids are just getting pushed out of the system.

[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.540]
If you can't make it, we're going to push you out of the system.

[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.860]
You become invisible.

[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:42.920]
Well, guess what?

[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.160]
You don't matter.

[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.700]
So I mean his own people.

[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.620]
This is a very conservative organization.

[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:52.520]
But isn't that interesting how the media put this kind of stuff like on page 20 like the hero of the yesterday.

[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.680]
The Sunsetdle didn't discover the story at all.

[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.520]
And the thing about the patient's Bill or Wright's and the fact that he lied about that.

[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.880]
And the Bush lies, blatant lies.

[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.040]
Yeah.

[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:02.780]
Policy lies.

[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.080]
And that stuff gets ignored.

[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.580]
And yet, if Gore is given a little bit of misinformation like about the girl standing.

[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.500]
Whether she stood in the classroom in Sarasota for one day or whatever, it was six months or whatever.

[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.060]
Then right away, oh, he's a liar.

[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.180]
He exaggerates on everything.

[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:15.140]
Anya, anya, anya.

[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.100]
It's shocking to me.

[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.320]
Which wasn't true, by the way, because there were other students that had it any.

[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.160]
And the media did correct that.

[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.500]
But it's like putting it on page 28 right under your bit.

[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:25.120]
It's too late.

[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:25.440]
It's that.

[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:25.940]
It's a fact.

[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.700]
And let me point on one other thing too.

[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.600]
I think people talk about Al Gore's being.

[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.320]
He is somewhat stiff.

[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.420]
Well, if it's hard for me, let me ask you this.

[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:36.900]
He's given that.

[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:37.260]
He's a guard.

[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.160]
I'll put him up.

[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:38.580]
Pull Indian.

[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:38.860]
Yeah.

[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:41.600]
Did you see that Al Smith dinner about a week ago?

[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:42.120]
No.

[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:42.640]
Oh, yeah.

[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.820]
I'm glad you bring this up.

[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.940]
Last night, where the hell did I see it?

[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.240]
I wish I was when I got home from the game after that bitch was confronting me in front of the arena.

[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.680]
I turned on Bloomberg TV to see what the futures were in the markets.

[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:57.080]
And they ran a clip of a, he was campaigning in Arkansas yesterday, Gore.

[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.320]
And I thought to myself, I wish I had the tape rolling.

[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:04.840]
If this man would campaign and speak the way he did there, he would be 50 points ahead.

[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.580]
I mean, he was talking naturally.

[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.200]
He was loose.

[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.240]
He was forceful.

[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.060]
He was really coming out with a heavy grip and a hell out of bush.

[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:11.740]
It was great.

[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.200]
And I thought to myself, where is this Al Gore been the last six months?

[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:15.520]

[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.520]
He was great.

[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.280]
He was funny at that dinner.

[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.880]
He came on, you know, you got best about interrupting.

[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.500]
And he's like, he comes out and he's like, well, I'm sorry.

[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.780]
I interrupted your dinner.

[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.580]
You know, and he's everybody's looking at him.

[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:26.780]
Yeah.

[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.160]
Well, this wasn't funny last night.

[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.200]
This was just great.

[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.060]
No holds barred the campaign.

[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:31.640]
He was fan.

[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.360]
I just, I don't know where he came from.

[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.440]
But Bush, when Bush got out there, he was so, his sense of humor was so stupid.

[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.260]
He was like, he came out.

[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.500]
He said, he's in a bonk system.

[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.480]
Bill Buckley, when he was at Yale, he started a party.

[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.760]
I started a few parties myself.

[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:48.760]
Yeah.

[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:49.520]
And finishing two.

[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:49.780]
Okay.

[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.240]
Have a great day.

[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.000]
Five six seven, oh five six.

[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:52.720]
He caught five six.

[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.780]
He caught five six.

[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:06.780]

[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:06.780]

[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:06.780]

[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:06.780]

[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:06.980]
He caught five six.

[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:06.980]

[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:06.980]

[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:07.860]
He caught five six.

[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.600]
He caught five six.

[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.860]
He caught five six.

[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:09.880]
He caught five six.

[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:09.880]

[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:09.880]

[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.060]
He caught five six.

[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:10.180]
He caught five six.

[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:10.300]
He caught five six.

[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:10.540]
He caught five six.

[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:10.540]

[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.300]
He caught five six.

[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.440]
He caught five six.

[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.160]
He caught five six.

[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.240]
He caught five six.

[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.980]
He caught five six.

[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.000]
He caught five six.

[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:18.560]
He caught five six.

[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.400]
He caught five six.

[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.040]
He caught five six.

[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:22.700]
He caught five six.

[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:33.020]
He caught five six.

[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:33.980]
He caught five six.

[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:33.980]

[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:33.980]

[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:33.980]

[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:34.860]
He caught five six.

[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:35.400]
He caught five six.

[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:35.860]
He caught five six.

[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.060]
He caught five six.

[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.660]
He caught five six.

[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:40.000]
He caught five six.

[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.060]
He caught five six.

[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.720]
He caught five six.

[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:42.500]
He caught five six.

[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.280]
He caught five six.

[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:43.740]
He caught five six.

[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:43.880]
He caught five six.

[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.140]
He caught five six.

[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.260]
He caught five six.

[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:47.420]
He caught five six.

[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:47.420]

[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:47.420]

[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:47.880]
He caught five six.

[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:47.880]

[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.800]
He caught five six.

[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:48.900]

[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.880]
He caught five six.

[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.380]
He caught five six.

[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.680]
He caught five six.

[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:15.600]
He caught five six.

[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:15.940]
He caught five six.

[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:16.640]
I just got a news that, uh,

[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:16.720]
I got a news from Richard tonight

[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.080]
probably because Curtis

[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:17.660]
had short-gow connected transcripts

[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:17.660]

[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:17.660]

[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:17.660]

[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:17.860]
as much as I think both

[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.840]
not only is the voice complaints

[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:20.940]
familiarry and

[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:22.540]
research witch

[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.520]
We're going to have we're going to have energy or we're going to abandon government.

[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.880]
Is that fine? Is that crap about big government?

[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:38.200]
No, but they need to employ smaller communities with their own laws instead of demanding federal regulations for education.

[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:44.620]
How about states rights, George W. Love states rights. You know what states rights is, don't you sir?

[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.700]
You know what that's code for?

[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:47.280]
No.

[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.720]
Okay, well look it up. Has somebody explained it to you?

[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.940]
Oh my god, I'm telling you, you know what we need? We need the voting police on a day.

[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.940]
On I did see that volunteer party and it's not like some big arena whatever that guy was talking about.

[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.400]
It's like a fire station there.

[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.740]
Victoria Park or whatever they call it on the corner sunrise in 118.

[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.200]
It's like a little fire station there in that park.

[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:15.000]
And if I can't vote there, I'll go a few other places in vote because I'm going to be voting anytime anyway.

[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.760]
I was, you know, they're not going to know the difference.

[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.440]
5, 6, 7, how about some counterfeit voter registration cards?

[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.060]
I know just the man in mind he was in C to get those.

[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:31.100]
Oh and also the reason that the Bush people are getting real nervous is in all these polls in Southeast Florida,

[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.220]
Gora is ahead of Bush 61 to 32%.

[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.080]
I want you to stop and put on your thinking cap for just a second.

[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.660]
You know where the gray matter used to be inside there? Put on your thinking cap.

[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:50.700]
If Gora's ahead 61 to 32 in Southeast Florida and you take out the green tooth element down there in little Havana.

[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.260]
Can you imagine what that leaves?

[00:52:53.780 --> 00:53:01.580]
So no wonder a lot of you lost the people calling in here seems very, very insecure and very lonely because you have a lot of company down here.

[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.960]
Most of the rest of the people here see through this crap.

[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.680]
9 minutes after 11 at 5.50 QA and 6 minutes I f*** the matter!

[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:26.500]
Can you be quick and quick and simple maybe between those eyes?

[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.500]
Huh?

[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.900]
You've become the invisible woman.

[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.540]
We're dead well.

[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.040]
We've got fake men.

[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.740]
Logan 15 to 5.60 WDQ and Democrats sue Bush on CO use that's Jeb.

[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:25.480]
The Florida Democratic Party on Wednesday filed sue against Governor Jeb Bush and the Republican Party of Florida asking for a statewide apology for the wholly inappropriate and shameful misuse of the state seal and to get out the vote letter penned by the governor.

[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:34.940]
The party is also asking that any absentee ballot request received by election supervisors and result of Bush's letter to be turned to the sender with or without Elvis.

[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:41.740]
Democrats claim a letter Bush wrote urging Republicans to cancel absentee ballots was illegally decorated with the official state seal.

[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.420]
It is unbelievable.

[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:51.860]
It is to be used for official state business not for partisan politics said the lawsuit filed in a court in Leon County, home in the state capital.

[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.420]
The seal is opposed to stand as the official symbol of the tremendous weight and power of the people of Florida.

[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:04.160]
Unfortunately, the Republican Party of Florida is demonstrated that to them the great state seal is nothing but a prop to be subverted at will for its own political purpose.

[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:13.420]
The GOP, lastly, said it used an older version of the state seal lifted from the state flag as a watermark on the letter and a spokeswoman for Bush scoffed at the lawsuit.

[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.440]
How do you like that?

[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:22.700]
Also, here's the thing that says many people have friends who say they're not going to vote because they think that if they vote they'll serve jury duty.

[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:27.020]
I hate to back to news to you but it's no longer got to do with voter registration rules or anything like that.

[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.780]
It has to do with your driver's license.

[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.640]
If you have a Florida driver's license they can call you and bug you for jury duty.

[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.140]
So that's really the lame, lame ass excuse for not voting.

[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.680]
Here's the fact from somebody obviously highly motivated who says it's the court stupid.

[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:49.360]
I am appealing to all voters those who believe in controlling their own destiny to cast their vote for a gorseless leaderman.

[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:55.300]
The risk of electing president like George W. in giving in the opportunity to appoint federal judges let alone to be court justice.

[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.100]
This is more than frightening abortion will become illegal.

[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:03.660]
We'll have prayer in the school rights to express your sexual preferences will be nullified and we'll have guns in every church in school.

[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.800]
This year it's more than the economy.

[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.460]
It's the court stupid vote for our go into a leaderman and keep choice alive.

[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:19.940]
And this poll of ours of course like I said it's totally bogus but I guess maybe they backed off a little bit because they don't want to be too obvious and put all 600 votes in there at one time.

[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:26.420]
On the US Senate race we got Bill Nelson with 56 Bill McCollum with 56 and Willie Logan with 15.

[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.780]
Oh yeah.

[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.020]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.280]
Yes sir how are you today?

[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:33.640]
Okay.

[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.220]
My plan on voting for our gore as we all should.

[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:36.640]
Yes.

[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:48.520]
However don't you think that your constant bashing of Mr. Lieberman might have a negative effect on his vote due to the limited mentality of most of your listeners?

[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.540]
What does that mean?

[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.180]
Well your cobbler is not supposed to sit here and lie.

[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.780]
No I will. I'm relentless in my criticism of Mr. Lieberman because he makes me nauseous.

[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:08.620]
He makes me want to puke and because I'm roast out by his wearing a religion on the sleeve and the succinct once again to make him part of the God squad and try to drag us all in that stupid vacuum in his.

[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:11.300]
I'm not arguing that point with you.

[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:16.080]
He's nauseating and it was a it was an act of political stupidity and the part of the group people to pick him.

[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.240]
I'm not arguing that point with you.

[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.560]
However just a little food for for.

[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:21.900]
No I'm not going to think about it.

[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:26.780]
I don't do this show based on calculating well let's see should I say this or should I.

[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:27.820]
I let it all hang out.

[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.780]
Well maybe you should if you want or elected as we all do.

[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.420]
Sir don't call the show and tell me what to say okay.

[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.880]
So waste of your time because it's not going to happen.

[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:37.700]
Maybe I should.

[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.360]
The answer is absolutely no.

[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.780]
I'm not easing off on Julie Lieberman.

[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:42.780]
He's he's anxious.

[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:43.880]
He's nauseating.

[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:50.120]
And I'll say it again I'm not the one that debated big channy and sucked his ear low for 90 minutes that night.

[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:56.380]
That was your man Lieberman that's out there like he was at a goddamn P party like he was at a Passover stator.

[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:03.000]
On G I don't know I thought we had a very socialized and civilized dialogue on the issue and then they took the full.

[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:09.740]
Two to one a channy people said channy seen more qualified to be presidential than Lieberman because Lieberman's a wimp in a mouse.

[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.680]
And just like this crappy was hucking over there at Notre Dame first he's down there at Horham,

[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:19.480]
Martin's a tombstone sucking up to the old Cubans who aren't going to vote for him anyway.

[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:22.500]
And then he's up there the other day in Notre Dame.

[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:29.680]
And speaking of being up there in Notre Dame I just might point out in the newspaper today from the hero wire services on the inside the page three.

[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.960]
New questions are raised on Pope silence during World War two.

[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.960]
Oh wait wait my time with right now.

[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.480]
But you might just want to take a look at that.

[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:49.940]
Since Mr. Lieberman was up there sucking rod at Notre Dame I'm talking about how we need to inject more religion into American society and how we have there are morals are all based on a higher power and all this other bulk that he espouses he makes me puke.

[00:58:52.580 --> 00:59:00.640]
So that's one thing about me I don't see it in a void letting certain things out because it might be politically expedient like I'm controlling the election if you believe that.

[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:09.980]
But you really shouldn't say those things even if they are true five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the 18 and 10 Verizon wireless line.

[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.320]
Let's get the show on the road here today. Let's wake up and smell the guy damn dandelions okay.

[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.760]
Here's Pember Pine tell us.

[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:18.360]
Hello Neil.

[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:18.920]
Yes sir.

[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.460]
I don't agree show.

[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:29.720]
I am not as old as you are but I go back as far as the kid twice in our one and never in the history have I ever remember a summer.

[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:34.400]
The qualifies the guy for one and for president as George Boy.

[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:44.760]
Yeah and if America both for this guy then we ought to go to the couch and get our head examined and and that a fixed looking guy was one and percent of them.

[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:46.980]
How do you do that?

[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.880]
I don't know my country in the election culture.

[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:49.380]
Mokaki.

[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.940]
Five six seven oh five 50 and this other guy is worried about am I being the two tough on Lieberman.

[00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.480]
You guys said it himself we got the average mentality out there.

[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:06.260]
Oldest points not just in this audience just in general that's America you can't complain about the education in this country because there isn't any.

[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:07.960]

I didn't know you've been talking about it I've been hoping and waiting to see.

[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:34.340]
Nobody is hoping more than I am I'm squeezing it right now I'm praying I'm getting my knees and praying to Buddha and Allah and Jesus and Moses and Abraham.

[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.060]
All right.

[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.100]

I'm warning you don't do that.

[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.200]
Oh it's not a smile.

[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:35.900]
I'm bleeding.

Give me back my f***ing dog.

[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.780]
I don't think so.

[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.280]
The vagmatic slides you and dies in and it's her age.

[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.540]

And it's an option.

[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.700]
You're trying to know what's not an option.

[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.200]
Bad dramatic sits against you nice.

[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.800]

It comes to feminine protection.

[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.060]
Nothing cuts the mustard like that.

[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.820]
Bad dramatic order now.

[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.320]
Call 1-800-866-742-6.

[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.060]
That's 1-800-866-4.

[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.560]
133-560-1.

[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.540]
R.A.Pol is really rolling along there with the Fony.

[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.720]
Both of them have about 40 Fony votes from McCollum.

[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:58.040]
It says McCollum 77-69.

[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.420]
It's really looking 17.

[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.580]
Is anybody buying that?

[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:00.800]
No.

[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:07.260]
Any attempt to take a political poll anywhere on the Internet including this show or anywhere else is atopless.

[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:14.900]
But Jonathan Cooper Smith who is an associate professor of history at Texas A&M University

[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:20.400]
and teaches the history of technology and is a writer for the history news service rights in the op-ed page in the Sun Sentinel today.

[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.120]
When Al Gore allegedly claimed he invented the Internet, comedians, punits and Republicans had a field a mocking him.

[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.000]
You're using humor and misrepresentation of what Gore said.

[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:35.060]
It hides the deeper issue about the relationship between political patrons and how technology is developed.

[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:39.580]
Or as actual role in the development of the Internet reveals just how important patrons are.

[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.160]
Technology don't suddenly emerge like popcorn from the microwave.

[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:50.840]
As they progress from my idea to reality, technology are pulled, pushed, shaped, prodded and otherwise objected to the actions and inactions of people they touch.

[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:56.480]
And without resources to revolve and grow, even the most promising technology will remain only in intriguing possibility.

[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.820]
Creating the fiber optic network along with the server software and other components of what became the Internet

[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:05.180]
didn't differ from the creation of hundreds of other new technologies in the past.

[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.900]
It demanded decades of work by skilled people, lots of money and many supporting technologies.

[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.980]
Like Jet Aircraft, the Internet's interchangeable parts, the Internet was financed and promoted by the federal government.

[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.480]
Government decisions like those in a business world did not occur in a vacuum.

[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.660]
Behind every major invention and inventor stands a patron for the Internet, Al Gore was that patron.

[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.300]
The historic image of a patron is the supporter of the arts that technologies need support too.

[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.760]
Try to imagine the history of the space program without the commitment of President John Kennedy to send them into the moon.

[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:40.740]
Kennedy didn't actually build the gigantic Saturn V rocket that launched the American to the space, nor do patrons of the arts actually paint the arts that now produces museum walls.

[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.200]
They do however supply the resources, usually financial, and other support that make it possible for others to do the work.

[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.980]
Elected representatives may advocate the development of new technologies.

[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.380]
Yes, one tends to find promoters of porkbirling directing money-dispersified projects more than two patrons.

[01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:01.280]
But distinguishing the two is easy. The patron works openly, not covertly, to advance his or her favorite technology.

[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:08.240]
The benefits do not flow only if at all to the patron's home state, and finally the patron promotes a broad vision instead of a specific project.

[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.720]
So what did Al Gore exactly do and claims he did?

[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:17.880]
In May 1999, Gore told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, during my service in the U.S. Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.

[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:22.420]
This quickly was mutated into, I created the Internet and became part of the presidential campaign.

[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.900]
As usual, in the history of the technology, the truth is more complex.

[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.620]
As the congressman in the 1970s, Gore was a leader in introducing computers into the Congress itself.

[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.240]
When he was a senator, he was sponsored several bills making the federal government of catalysts for the information superhighway.

[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:46.900]
While only the 1991 high-performance community, a computing act became law, his constant prodding gave the concept high visibility within government and among academic and industry leaders.

[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:53.360]
More important, Gore was responsible for mandating the 1987 Reagan White House policy study of government computer networks.

[01:11:53.760 --> 01:12:00.340]
The 1991 law directed more than a billion dollars to connecting computers and international networks linking university schools and other institutions.

[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:09.400]
Even more important than the money where the goals are improving public access, creating digital libraries and pushing unclassified technology from the military into the publishing commercial spheres.

[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:13.900]
These activities laid the foundation for the explosive growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s.

[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:20.240]
In sponsoring his 1991 bill, Gore envisioned a national network that would provide for teleconferencing.

[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:27.160]
Link your computer to millions of computers around the country, give you access to huge digital libraries of information and deliver services that cannot yet imagine.

[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.440]
Not a bad or inaccurate vision.

[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:35.620]
Gore did not plan your own programs or built computers, but as a congressman senator and vice president, it was more important.

[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:42.020]
He promoted a national policy to transfer defense-funded computer research to the private and educational worlds and to promote universal access.

[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:50.980]
Some may argue that the Internet would have developed anyway, while true it would probably have occurred with less public and educational access and it definitely would have developed in the forest-lower pace.

[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:59.020]
Gore's early initiatives helped shape the Internet into a more open and universal system with more access to federal and universal databases than it would have otherwise done.

[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.280]
We decisions have benefited directly because of this.

[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.140]
So writes Jonathan Cooper Smith, associate professor of history at Texas and in the university.

[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:10.500]
How do you like that?

[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.900]
But don't you fuse them with the facts because he's a big liar, you know, and done.

[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.280]
And don't be picking on that two-lea-verment.

[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.100]
22 before noon at 5.50 W.D.Q.

[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.620]
What's my love for?

[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.700]
That's incredible to me.

[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.360]
Incredible, what an embarrassing.

[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.140]
I'm so happy.

[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.320]
Every night I have you cast gold.

[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:52.700]
I cast gold and now I see gold.

[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.920]
All that's okay.

[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.760]
What is this thing?

[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.380]
Inside the local public health streets made.

[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.220]
There is a path to death.

[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.840]
That's my job.

[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.920]
Only forty-eight days of time to get.

[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:19.780]
He bought a key to inherit over Thursday's life.

[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.780]
He was born into money, but he's so kind and dumb.

[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:36.800]
We sat in a meeting with the only fun couple.

[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.800]
Life of the party in the college days.

[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.540]
That's interesting.

[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.800]
There was four fun friends and a nasal touch again.

[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.860]
That's the reason we spoke to the Vicky.

[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.420]
He has a nasal touch again.

[01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:02.020]
I thought my kids could send them home in five.

[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.400]
That's all I was trying.

[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.640]
That would be really bad news for the bush.

[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.200]
Three or four days of late-night stuff may have come out.

[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:11.780]
That's the last one.

[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.520]
We just got in the course of the camp verify.

[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.140]
The legal details are checking.

[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.180]
The ins and the ins.

[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.100]
Within three or four days.

[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.100]
What do you think the impact of that's going to be for the bush.

[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.020]
This is typical.

[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.380]
It's funny how you have a collar.

[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:30.800]
You can say, I was super.

[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.360]
You ask him how is worse to.

[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.820]
Because the man tried to answer you with something you didn't like the year.

[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.680]
First of all, let me interject right here in this fact.

[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.460]
He didn't answer with something I wanted.

[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.500]
He didn't answer a period.

[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.440]
He went on with an on-secular.

[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.140]
He came back with the same non-secular.

[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.920]
At that point, yes, I did hang up on it.

[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.980]
Most people have no basis in fact.

[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.540]
He refused to have a conversation.

[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:57.000]
Now he goes on to say, then you turn around and call George W. Bush and Indian and stupid.

[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.460]
You're a reason for calling this because he looks stupid.

[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.780]
Really bright reason, you know, nothing but put down.

[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.500]
Typical liberal.

[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.300]
Well, is that the reason I say he's stupid is because he looks stupid?

[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.020]
Oh, that's only a part of it.

[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.080]
The overwhelming majority.

[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.480]
Heaven, I've been reading from this book is our children learning.

[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.580]
I've called the Gallup for weeks on this program.

[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.140]
And I haven't been doing getting you specifics.

[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.860]
I haven't been giving you specific quotes.

[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.120]
But I'll give you some more, okay?

[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.060]
Mr. Wright-Winger.

[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.560]
New York Daily News February 19th.

[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.880]
George W. says, I understand small business growth.

[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:24.640]
I was one.

[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.180]
Interview with Associated Press March 8th.

[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.420]
He says, it's evolutionary going from governor to president.

[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:33.520]
And this is a significant step to be able to vote for yourself on the ballot.

[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.240]
And I'll be able to do so next fall, I hope.

[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.380]
New Zower with Jim Lehrer, April 27, 2000.

[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.420]
Governor Bush, the picture on the newspaper just seems so so un-American to me.

[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.960]
The picture of the guy storming the house with a scared little boy there.

[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.220]
I talked to my brother, Jed.

[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.680]
I haven't told this to many people.

[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:49.660]
But he's the governor of.

[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.820]
I shouldn't call him my little brother.

[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.800]
My brother, Jed, the great governor of Texas.

[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.140]
Jim Lehrer, Florida, Governor Bush, Florida, the state of Florida.

[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.760]
Los Angeles Times, April 8th.

[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.440]
I was raised in the west, the west of Texas.

[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.840]
It's pretty close to California.

[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.280]
And more ways than Washington, DC, is close to California.

[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.200]
Hope for its South Carolina for more 16th.

[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.780]
How do you know if you don't measure if you have a system that simply suckled kids through?

[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.440]
During New Hampshire Perseverance Month.

[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.780]
During Perseverance Month, a National New Hampshire January 28th.

[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.800]
He says, this is preservation month.

[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:29.920]
I appreciate preservation.

[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.720]
It's what you do when you run for president.

[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.460]
You got to preserve.

[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.440]
Maybe he had schmuckers on his mind, huh?

[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.100]
Maybe it looked in the mirror while shaving in the morning and thought of schmuckers.

[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.660]
During New Hampshire Perseverance Month, he's talking about preservation.

[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:43.800]
You got to preserve.

[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.780]
Mason Adams says, be sure and preserve.

[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:47.680]
And spread it on real quick.

[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.320]
Which is what he's been doing for months, George W.

[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.040]
So we're not to say because he looks to, but we got facts.

[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.000]
We got quotes.

[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:57.760]
We got, of course, everybody in America has heard all of his booksharing of the language.

[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:03.160]
And a man who has no idea who the foreign leaders are, who admit he don't know where a coast of always on a map, he is dumb.

[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:04.220]
Dumber than saw dust.

[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:09.820]
As a matter of fact, since you want to push me, Mr. Willier, facts, here's eight million more facts for you.

[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:15.040]
Howard Kurtz, Washington Post-Frider writes, today,

[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:20.000]
faced with a very real possibility that George W. Bush could win the White House in 12 days.

[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:26.260]
Some left-leaning journalists are flat-out calling him dumb and blaming the press for not persuading this country of his utter unsuitability.

[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:32.840]
The question of Bush's IQ has been a campaign subject ever since he flunked the Boston TD reporter's quiz on foreign leaders.

[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.520]
But now with the election on the line, some of Bush's critics have come out of the closet to advertise their disdain.

[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:45.080]
State, a slight editor at Michael Kinzley writes that journalists reluctance to call someone who well-made being our next commander-in-chief of Moron is understandable.

[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:50.640]
But if George W. Bush isn't a Moron, he's a man of impressive intellectual dishonesty and or confusion, he says.

[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:58.320]
Author Todd Gittland says in Salon that Bush gives ample evidence that he doesn't hate reason, Bush has gotten the past on most of his bookshotted ways,

[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.500]
while journalists are embarrassed to point fingers at a non-entity who's within two weeks of the presidency.

[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:17.240]
In the international-herald tribute, former assistant editor Hope Keller declares, most American political commentators today are so timid, so mealy-mouthed, so committed to a distorted ethic of fairness that they're unable to state the obvious about George W. Bush that he's unfit to be president.

[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.780]
Rich Lowry, editor of the Conservative National Review, sees a little bit of desperation in such accusations.

[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:31.320]
A lot of liberal journalists don't want to admit that there have been issues that have worked for Bush, he says, citing education, health care, and tax cuts, you get a sense of why his world is blowing it.

[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:43.440]
Not everyone believes Bush is lack of policy, with wonkyness is a liability. Robert Bartley, the Wall Street Journal, said a trail page writer, writes that Bush has no intellectual pretension, he's not even afraid to say that he can sell to his advisors or to tell us that he's done.

[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:51.920]
But Bush's critics are almost apoptuctic. Gittland, the New York University professor, recalls Bush in airhead, sees a collective abdication by the press.

[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:58.600]
There's a bending over backwards phenomenon because a lot of reporters, leading democratic, he says, they're in a state of recoil against the charge of liberal media.

[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.840]
It's obvious that this is a lightweight who's been given a pass his whole life.

[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:15.240]
There you go, that sentence right there says it all. There's a lightweight who's been given a pass his whole life, who's really failed at all his own efforts to do anything he's done, whether it was the oil business, whether it was trading sanny, social from the next-us-rangers, whatever the hell it's been, a total failure.

[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:21.280]
We always get somebody to come along and pop them up with their goddamn big money because that's what he's all about. And those are the puppet-pone his strings.

[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.720]
Let me first do that.

[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.040]
Right.

[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.560]
Here's Fort Myers, hello.

[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:28.640]
Fort Myers.

[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.280]
Okay, we'll go back and kill a bitch and then call us back.

[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:36.280]
Here's the plantation, hello.

[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.200]
Hey, me, I ate the one.

[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:37.480]
Okay.

[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:40.560]
Talk about fueling cold and things of that nature.

[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.360]
That's a typical trick.

[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.660]
I mean, if you ever watch like God would graph when he comes back.

[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.560]
If there's two billion people in the world, he says 2.4 billion are evangelicals.

[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:51.360]
Right.

[01:20:51.780 --> 01:21:01.180]
If you ever see a frick today or the day before when Wimball is going to say, well, it goes up in the poll, he would say, oh, don't worry, don't worry, that's not true.

[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:04.420]
The none of this is true. It's not a bit true. You'll see, you'll see.

[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.280]
The other thing you have to understand.

[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.400]
And then as soon as Bush is at the polls, they start screaming with a plane to trumpet in the background.

[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.040]
Look at this forehead.

[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:18.000]
To give you an example, now on my poll today about the center race, McCollum's got 122 Nelson, 82 in the Royal Billy Logan 90.

[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:19.660]
Totally bogus, totally distorted.

[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.460]
And there's no credibility there. So who the hell are they kidding?

[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:26.780]
Well, they were trumpeting the WAN study in July being just the Bible.

[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:30.420]
And now they're saying those same WAN people are not credible.

[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:30.840]
Right.

[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.920]
And then the RAN study that came out today, as it was a later one, it was 21996.

[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:49.920]
So one selfish issue that people should know, and if this is one of the main things about the court system, is that in the first 30 days of Bush's Texas governorship, he passed seven civil justice reforms,

[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:54.060]
closing the access to the court for little people.

[01:21:54.060 --> 01:22:00.140]
For instance, he increased the bond a little person has to pay if it's after screwed up on them.

[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:05.560]
He also increased the burden of truth in Texas courts.

[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:12.580]
I know it's a technical issue, but it raised the bar for little people to actually see redress in the court.

[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:20.580]
Among other things, he passed like seven civil justice reform bills in the first 30 days that he was in office.

[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:23.420]
The guy is not for little people. That's a short.

[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:24.480]
Amen. Thank you.

[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:25.260]
Okay. Everything.

[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:31.940]
It's a grace from the New York Times on Sunday, the intro cartoon, the Bush Dream Supreme Court.

[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.380]
And it's got pictures and they all look very similar.

[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:41.360]
And it's left to right standing Thomas Scalia Thomas seated Thomas Scalia Scalia Thomas.

[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:49.060]
Oh, you know, that's almost enough to inspire me to play again.

[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:52.680]
Am I light what I'm sorry? What do you got this with art?

[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:53.980]
That's an amombra.

[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.680]
There we go.

[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.780]
Hey, y'all, my name is Grant.

[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.580]
A few Jean Thomas, friends of Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court.

[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.480]
And you know, there's not some people that are dead.

[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.980]
They think just of, I spoke a little marijuana when I was in college.

[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.360]
And it wasn't everybody.

[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:14.520]
They enjoy, maybe it's a guy's adjoke. I know a little bit of a young boy.

[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.740]
Did they don't think I'm fit to be on the Supreme Court?

[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.300]
Yeah, I got the money.

[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.520]
Let's do this quick and get out of here. I want to pitch out straight.

[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.460]
When I stop reviewing the law, I don't just review the law.

[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:27.800]
There we go.

[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.500]
I'll be talking.

[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.120]
And I'll talk it to the...

[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:32.580]
All right.

[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.220]
I'll talk it to the winner.

[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:38.020]
And I'll talk it when I look up Saturday, O'Connor's best.

[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.480]
I'll be talking.

[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:43.320]
That's the very one, y'all.

[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.600]
It's the court's still good. It's 1153 at 560 WQM.

[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.240]
Here it is, the 26th of October.

[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.660]
The 26th of October.

[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.640]
12 days away.

[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.000]
And to think that they're actually...

[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.600]
And again, you look at this selfishness.

[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.100]
I don't want to sing a lot of my friend Ron,

[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.740]
they're my former friends from the O'Honkey games.

[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.580]
Like I said, in other respects is a good guy.

[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.520]
But his politics are all based on selfishness.

[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.640]
And he's willing to look the other way.

[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.840]
Because he's not one of those fetus-hugger kind of people.

[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.360]
He couldn't care less about those things.

[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.640]
Jews for Bush, like I said before,

[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:15.660]
it's like in the same thing with Gays for Bush.

[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.240]
But Gays for Jerry Falwell and Jews for Hitler.

[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:20.980]
Same thing.

[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.020]
Self-hating.

[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.440]
Don't confuse me with the facts.

[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.080]
I haven't asked to grind.

[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:31.500]
He's going to save me some big bucks.

[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.140]
Here's Poppano Beach.

[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:34.440]
Shall I?

[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:37.360]
Poppano Beach.

[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.020]
Hello.

[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:38.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:42.060]
Yes, I work as a whole person.

[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:47.240]
And it's the American faculty about voting ridiculous.

[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:53.380]
Two months ago, we had 105 people that are polling twice.

[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.940]
Three quarters of more foreign-borns.

[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.140]
What's wrong with America?

[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:01.680]
Parents are teaching.

[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.120]
They give what means to vote.

[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.760]
We had a Haitian gentleman command.

[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:13.900]
The last runoff when we only had one person running.

[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:14.200]
Right.

[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.440]
With his son about 530 in the afternoon.

[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.180]
We ran a lot in the city.

[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.120]
And the kid asked him,

[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:23.980]
Dad, why did we come today?

[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.620]
We only voted for one thing.

[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:28.740]
He said, because in my country, you can vote.

[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.080]
And if things grew up here,

[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:33.400]
if you don't vote, don't judge.

[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:33.980]
Yeah.

[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:34.640]
Okay.

[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:35.280]
Okay.

[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.080]
That's all I've got to say.

[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:36.640]
Good luck, my friend.

[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:36.880]
Thanks.

[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:37.800]
Okay.

[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.580]
I'm voting 60 times to make up for some of the other

[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:39.800]
appetite.

[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.080]
I'm a lot better informed than most of them anyway.

[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:43.800]
I'll be educated.

[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:44.860]
560.

[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:45.740]
560.

[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:46.440]
Poppano Beach.

[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:48.120]
On the 18th, the rise of Marlott's line.

[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.160]
Let's get rid of this poll,

[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:51.240]
because it's already been screwed up by the right wingers.

[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.560]
We just can't take one of those polls on anything political,

[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.800]
because they just got to get in there and get their little circles

[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.140]
you're going and before you know.

[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.760]
And it always starts like after it's been on there 35-40 minutes.

[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.220]
And the word goes round and round like Perry Cumball would say.

[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.120]
We'll come up with a better question.

[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:07.920]
560.

[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:09.600]
Poppano Beach.

[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.040]
On the 18th, the rise of Marlott's line.

[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:13.220]
Here's Miami.

[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:13.540]
Hello.

[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:14.780]
Neil.

[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:15.320]
Yes, sir.

[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.540]
Do you have a position on the state of Torres Strait in Bay County?

[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:19.000]
No.

[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:19.620]
You follow it, sir.

[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:20.180]
No, I have not.

[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.780]
Have you read about the new times, though?

[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:22.320]
No, I have not.

[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:24.500]
Well, you're always talking about police brutality.

[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.680]
Do you really want somebody who's a bad closely aligned with the police?

[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.660]
But never on the association.

[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.860]
Running the state attorney candidate.

[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.300]
What are you asking me?

[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:34.100]
I don't even know what you're talking about.

[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:34.560]
It's my shabby.

[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.820]
You're just talking to this, Neil.

[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.520]
You're always talking about police brutality.

[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.540]
We have a guy now who's running for state attorney daycare.

[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:40.840]
Yeah.

[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.120]
He's being heavily supported by the police.

[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.180]
And we're so mad at the con-croz giver,

[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:48.160]
because she has prosecuted many police officers.

[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:49.340]
You're always talking about that.

[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.860]
And if you're going to get involved in that issue,

[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.200]
you talk about it a little bit.

[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:52.500]
OK.

[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.200]
New times article.

[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.380]
We got a right-down series.

[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:54.860]
I'll get it.

[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:55.240]
OK.

[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:55.600]
OK.

[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:55.980]
Bye-bye.

[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.900]
We got a new times right-downs in the lobby.

[01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:58.800]
Right?

[01:26:59.340 --> 01:26:59.420]
Right.

[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:00.820]
And shitty length, too.

[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.020]
566705, I mean, he asked me if I read it,

[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:05.100]
and then he asked why he's in big-knit,

[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.140]
because I haven't gotten involved in that.

[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:06.440]
I don't know.

[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:07.540]
First, I don't live in a big county.

[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.020]
So it's hard to keep up with those depressing issues.

[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:11.640]
But I will take a peek at it.

[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.800]
56670560, 0560 on the AT&T,

[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.340]
and Verizon Marvellous lines.

[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.980]
420560, WD2AF by Andy Fort Lauderdale,

[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.460]
a measly broadcast group station,

[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:26.320]
at WD2AM.com, or the world.

[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:26.900]
Hey, baby.

[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:29.060]
I'm going to use you as a sex toy.

[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:38.960]
That's right, Madonna.

[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.380]
Hit her on my key.

[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.420]
Look for a spot for wall from where she puts her seat.

[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.960]
She's got bad hygiene.

[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.160]
Doesn't fly too well.

[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.400]
My suspension now my engine really smells.

[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.060]
Big pop star she really needs a shower.

[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:02.020]
Let's all her bacteria off my cow.

[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.820]
She don't come close to smelling like a virgin.

[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:11.100]
Spray ball the straw.

[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.920]
Sex with Madonna.

[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.280]
Now my hair has fly.

[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.780]
It's an Apple leaf.

[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:20.320]
I didn't witness my tanky saw.

[01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.480]
5657070, another one of my favorite bushes and cits.

[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.260]
It's I am hard against quotas.

[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.720]
Quotas they basically do it in the 8 based upon whatever.

[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:37.940]
Huh?

[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.720]
The cases have full analization and been looked at a lot.

[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:48.300]
I think anybody who doesn't think I'm smart enough to handle the job is underestimating.

[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:52.440]
In other words dumb times 10.

[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.880]
So anyway 1970 is the year.

[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:58.300]
Little more stuff is leaking out about this alleged tanky, tanky, adored to W.

[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:00.280]
This alleged abortion that he paid for.

[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.540]
This alleged woman who's waiting in the wings of May of 4 soaring after David's alleged.

[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:08.860]
And it looks like it may become an any day so the spake and maybe squirt, squirt, leakin' out of here.

[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:11.080]
She's evidently holding up a little more cash.

[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:15.920]
But the fact that they have sworn affidavits could bury him.

[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.160]
Wouldn't you think it's gonna bury him?

[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.520]
Well it shouldn't be making issues out of the youthful indiscretion.

[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:21.800]
That's right youthful indiscretion.

[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:25.380]
That's right just like Henry Hyde and his youthful indiscretion when he was in his 40s.

[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.640]
So in his wild oats he was just a late starter.

[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.420]
Late bloomer has been blooming idiot.

[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:32.900]
Here's a lady in Weston.

[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:33.120]
Hello.

[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:35.200]
Yes.

[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:35.500]
Yes man.

[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.420]
Hi.

[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.920]
I'm a long-term working-up with 10-hour.

[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:39.260]
Great.

[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.020]
And my husband and I are driving the Santa Fe bus.

[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:46.060]
And when you're hoping that on a lighter than a lighter consider playing the Star Trek set.

[01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:47.480]
What?

[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.560]
The Star Trek set with Captain Scott.

[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:53.660]
Which one?

[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:55.060]
There's about eight million of them.

[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:56.660]
What's one of them?

[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.500]
I guess anyone will do.

[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:00.980]
Okay.

[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.580]
How it takes you up?

[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:02.820]
Okay.

[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:03.200]
Bye-bye.

[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:04.080]
Bye-bye-bye.

[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.620]
Where's John McLaughlin with you?

[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:06.360]
Bye-bye.

[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:07.940]
Still haven't watched that.

[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.880]
I think tonight's the night or tomorrow night's the night.

[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.060]
We're going to the company on PBS.

[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:21.080]
And also it shows up on depending if you're channel surfing on a cable that they're like elsewhere on there like 16 or 17 on my cable.

[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.620]
I don't know what that is.

[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.740]
Oh yeah 17 I think that's whatever that is.

[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:30.000]
56670560, pound 560 out of 18 T and Verizon Wireless.

[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:30.300]
Find out.

[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:36.560]
Forget the best of the CDs and cassettes are waiting for you at all spec stores all over South Florida and also when Naples and Fort Myers they brought in Palm Beach.

[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:41.000]
You can go to NeilRangers.com or wqm.com to order yours and also the keychain.

[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.360]
Which are only available that way.

[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.460]
All proceeds benefit planned parent or the South Palm Beach in Broward County all shipping and handling being donated by Pac-Mail Centers of America.

[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.780]
95 North Not-Hail Road and Plantations.

[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:57.420]
And no one I will not take your donation under any circumstances because I don't want you to subsidize those baby killers.

[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:00.800]
Here's Fort Myers hello.

[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:01.560]
Hey how you doing Neil?

[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:06.860]
Great. I got a little problem last night I tune in on the website there to listen to the Panthers pre-game show.

[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.120]
Yeah.

[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.140]
Did you listen to it?

[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.520]
No. I was there.

[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:13.500]
Okay well the first three calls were about dolphin calls.

[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:14.560]
Uh huh what do you expect?

[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.540]
Well and you know what?

[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:18.540]
And Gelly took the calls we were talking about the dolphin.

[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:19.420]
That's really sad.

[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:19.940]
That's pathetic.

[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.660]
Gelly you ought to be drawn in quarter for that.

[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:27.720]
You know I mean you know really I mean at least you know you support for the organization right?

[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.960]
The organization right?

[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:32.520]
Right and so you know at least you would want to support the organization just like saying you know okay.

[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.680]
Call like a phone call like in the world.

[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.140]
Well I mean for example I know those 80 million hours they have before the dolphin game on Monday night this week.

[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:43.120]
You wouldn't hear anybody call and ask it about the Panthers during the four hours of pre-game for the dolphin.

[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.240]
Oh heck no and they wouldn't be calling about the fusion either.

[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:46.080]
Right that's right.

[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:46.980]
That's the fusion.

[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:48.540]
I speak as big as I can.

[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:52.080]
Right you see that goes back again to the host having enough balls who's controlling the thing.

[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:54.760]
Having enough guts to control it and say hey listen double.

[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.780]
This is the hockey show.

[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.080]
We got the hockey game coming up.

[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.700]
Staying your dolphin stuff for the only two other 20 hours a day.

[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.960]
What do you think men if you say if you were doing a three three games show for the dolphins and somebody called up and asked about the heat?

[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:05.360]
Click.

[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.280]
Yeah exactly.

[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:06.660]
You bet.

[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.240]
Hey can we get a little bit of the Gelly song there?

[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:09.740]
Okay.

[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:10.820]
Alright see you there.

[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:11.380]
See you.

[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:12.760]
How do you like that?

[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.240]
The little twirpy Gelly without the balls three.

[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.860]
Yeah and I realize it's difficult.

[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.460]
I don't even know what their bother taking calls on air for anyway.

[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:21.380]
It's like those scat calls they used to have after the game.

[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.620]
Oh let's go to Debbie on a mobile and here's Lou.

[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:24.420]
Here's Lou.

[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:24.880]

[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.700]
You know the same two people every day who had absolutely nothing to say.

[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:31.400]
We know a hockey puck if they stuck 45 them up their record.

[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:33.540]
Oh that thing came up again on that server.

[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:34.680]
The server's getting upset.

[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:38.460]
Here's Margie.

[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:38.740]
Hello.

[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:39.940]
Yeah good afternoon Neil.

[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:40.380]
Yes sir.

[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:46.520]
You know I listen to all these stations talking about Gorra line and Bush line.

[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.700]
The quickest way for a politician to lose an election is to tell the truth.

[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:55.320]
They don't expect any of the truth from any of you.

[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.360]
Yeah.

[01:32:56.600 --> 01:33:00.560]
The only issue that really concerns me is the Supreme Court.

[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:07.940]
Because everything else you can't believe one word and any of these guys say they don't mean a damn thing.

[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:08.880]
Yeah.

[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:12.720]
I've discovered through my lifetime that the truth always loses.

[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:13.860]
People want it.

[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.140]
People can't handle the truth.

[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.160]
They don't want to hear it.

[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.760]
Give them all the lies that they make them feel good.

[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:21.420]
And the one who's the best liar wins all the time.

[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:23.220]
Yeah.

[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.460]
What are your feelings about?

[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.020]
I don't know.

[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.100]
That's a little bit too cynical even for me.

[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:27.940]
Oh well.

[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.500]
I just can't handle the truth either.

[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:31.120]
What is this?

[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:32.700]
I see you can't handle the truth.

[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:35.820]
No I don't think that everything Clinton told us in 96 when he was running was alive.

[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.540]
I don't believe that.

[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.020]
I mean most of it is lies.

[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.880]
But so I don't agree with you so I can't handle the truth either.

[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:42.440]
Is that it's a word to take a shot at me?

[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.580]
Maybe you asked what do I think and I told you what I think.

[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.220]
And therefore you can't handle the truth.

[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.860]
You sound like what's in there like Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise.

[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.520]
And a few dumb men.

[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.760]
That's what you sound like.

[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.180]
Yeah.

[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:55.000]
I'm a cynical.

[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.680]
It's almost anybody about politicians.

[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.480]
But I mean you make a blanket statement like that which is on the face of an idiotic.

[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.880]
Most of it is both crappy out.

[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.560]
And I do agree with the part about the courts.

[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.100]
That's correct.

[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:07.780]
But because I don't agree with you 100% therefore I can't handle the truth either.

[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.160]
I'm an emotional cripple sir.

[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:12.300]
I'm just not as strong and as bright as you are and I apologize.

[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.280]
I'm troubling my way along doing the best I can.

[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.480]
And I thought it was my show you were listening to not your show but I'm listening to it.

[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.020]
So I thought that's the way it worked last time I checked.

[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:22.660]
I could be wrong.

[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:25.660]
That damn Dow is in the plus column.

[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:26.760]
I'm not too happy about that.

[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:26.980]
Oh.

[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:29.080]
Sell, sell, sell baby.

[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:35.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, count 5, 60 on the AT&T and for rise in wireless line.

[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.540]
Let's, I can't come up with a good poll question.

[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.660]
They ever come up with a different one.

[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:40.740]
Every God damn day.

[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:43.360]
I thought this one would be interesting but they've already ruined it.

[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.240]
Even before noon they had this one of spoiled.

[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:48.740]
No, it can't be anything political.

[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:49.600]
Can't do it.

[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:55.880]
Which is a real shame but of course to show it the desperation and the length of which these people go.

[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:57.820]
Because they're trying to dilute themselves.

[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:00.820]
How they can dilute themselves in November the 8th when they wake up in that morning.

[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:04.560]
How they can dilute themselves when Bill Nelson beats this nut out of how they do it.

[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.360]
How's it going to do?

[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.800]
When Elaine Bloom cleans Clay Shaw's cloth.

[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:12.180]
And yeah, I read that article in a hero by the Fag that writes that Fag column in a hero every week.

[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:16.820]
About Elaine Bloom and her gay son and Yadda Yadda in about how she did this and said that.

[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.900]
I got news for you sweetheart.

[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:21.360]
Clay Shaw isn't your friend or my friend.

[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.280]
Neither is the Republican Party.

[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:24.860]
Idiot.

[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:25.840]
Self hating Fag.

[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.460]
What crap gets written man.

[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.260]
It's just the subject.

[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.840]
Maybe this guy already wrote with Alice Ren tell.

[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:34.700]
A minus pass known as 560 WQA.

[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:40.200]
The Neil Roger show sports radio 560 QA.

[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:41.460]
Get off the show.

[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.440]
Kelsey.

[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:48.840]
Kelsey.

[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:51.480]
Talking on a short show.

[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:54.140]
Trying to be my show.

[01:35:54.140 --> 01:36:00.280]
Your boy sounds just like a classic year of girls.

[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:00.580]
Yes.

[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.880]
A little foretold show.

[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.660]
What else are you saying?

[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.080]
Kelsey.

[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:08.580]
Kelsey.

[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.740]
Talking like a baby.

[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.640]
Who needs a little training.

[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.740]
Why can't you understand?

[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:19.780]
You don't know like a man.

[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:22.380]
You need both the rubber bands.

[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:23.900]
Black shows.

[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:26.620]
Your throat sounds Kelsey.

[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.340]
Kelsey.

[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:29.740]
Kelsey.

[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:31.400]
Uuuuh.

[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:32.540]
Kelsey.

[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:37.920]
Your lucky bandit says don't have a Kelsey.

[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:42.460]
You don't live long there on the air.

[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:44.200]
And Kelsey.

[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.020]
The sports can wait till your voice cracks.

[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:53.640]
Because anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:59.240]
And they should only take you back when told your baby's drop.

[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:00.120]
Kelsey.

[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.200]
Kelsey.

[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:02.660]

[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.540]
When you're gonna cry up.

[01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.460]
You make a corner, throw up.

[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.500]
You're still a sweet fool.

[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.380]
Go to broadcasting school.

[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:16.280]
Your pretty, you bastard boy.

[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.620]
Thank you.

[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.320]
Now die, die, die.

[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:25.900]
But you're the hot, oh, you're the hot.

[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:28.880]
Somebody else called you the hot, hot.

[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:32.260]
Explain for me that the glory on game night and the credit cases.

[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.660]
I mean, there's a really lame excuse.

[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.440]
But anyway, the first half hours like general sports talk on a Gellyon game night.

[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.520]
And from 6.0 to 7.

[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:40.580]
They go to hockey talk.

[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:41.080]
Pretty weak.

[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:43.740]
Pretty damn weak especially when it's called Gellyon game night.

[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:44.820]
Was it a football game night?

[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:45.160]
No.

[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.860]
Was it like a soccer game night or an NBA game night here?

[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:49.080]
No.

[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:49.740]
No.

[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.260]
It was a baseball game night.

[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.420]
But that was like after the game and it was like it wasn't here.

[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:53.700]
Was it?

[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:54.100]
No.

[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.020]
Well, it's serious that nobody's watching or paying much attention to.

[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.040]
Except New Yorkers.

[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.360]
It was the Panther night.

[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.000]
And God forbid that we should do too much to promote that.

[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.460]
Even though we have the games here.

[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.220]
That's the way you deal with the girls team.

[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.340]
You beat the crap out of them.

[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:27.820]
6.1.

[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:28.580]
Almost 6.1.

[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.200]
They really should.

[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.100]
I would have been a half to go.

[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:30.740]
That's okay.

[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:31.500]
Who goes to survive?

[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.320]
That's the way you deal with the girls team.

[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.620]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:35.420]
You score four goals.

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:35.440]

[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:39.520]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:43.040]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:43.040]

[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:43.040]

[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:43.040]

[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:43.040]

[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:43.060]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:43.060]

[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:43.340]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:43.340]

[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:43.340]

[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:43.340]

[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:43.340]

[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:44.180]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.240]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.240]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:48.620]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:49.860]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:50.920]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.720]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.180]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:00.440]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.720]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.420]
You beat the scoffer.

[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:06.220]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:17.200]
Number one, the thing about the that you're reading about right now in the new times, just to get everybody up to date, he was talking about the tanker police.

[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:21.220]
I mean, excuse me, I'm talking about Rovella, which is the PBA president.

[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:25.220]
And he has brought him a shill from Bolly County.

[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:30.420]
He had to be here six months before so he can run against Catherine Rondelle.

[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:33.980]
And this guy here likes to beat people up.

[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:38.620]
As a prosecutor, likes to beat people up in courtrooms, and he's losing.

[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.260]
That's what the PBA brought him.

[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.500]
That's number one.

[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:57.520]
Number two, if they want to feel like they're in a fascist state or a United States, Jeff Bush has already started it here in this state by letting the tanker stoppow do whatever they want to in people's yards, cutting down good and bad trees.

[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:00.800]
And also signing an executive order to that effect.

[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.160]
Okay, there's your fascist state.

[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:06.400]
There is something in this country called a Constitution and a Bill of Rights.

[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:08.180]
Let them read it they can.

[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.740]
The fourth and fifth amendment of the Constitution.

[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:17.320]
Okay, and that will tell them that there is due process if they understand that.

[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:17.740]
Okay.

[01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:18.780]
Okay, for-

[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.680]
Thank you.

[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.820]
Thank you, God bless America.

[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:25.760]
5.670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lines.

[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:28.820]
6700 open lines.

[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.740]
Now we got an hour and 42 minutes to go before Hank enters the scene here.

[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.200]
Here's a mobile and truckner read, shallow.

[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:40.880]
Neil, I generally just agree with you on every single issue, but I want to see if maybe we can agree on one thing today.

[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:44.040]
And the mining held on page 19a.

[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:48.880]
There's a story that's titled Foreign Aid Bill with Death Forgiveness, Clear's Congress.

[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:49.560]
Yeah.

[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:56.040]
And what bothers me about this is the 41 poorest countries in the world.

[01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:04.200]
The United States is going to knock 435 million off the debt that they owe us, which is roughly 10 million in the country.

[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:04.620]
Yeah.

[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.940]
And I just don't know what the big deal is there.

[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:12.760]
I mean 435 million, that's like less than half of what we pay for one airplane.

[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.240]
And then I don't know why they included this in the same article.

[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:22.160]
But they point out that we're given 840 million dollars to Israel in economic aid.

[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:22.400]
Yeah.

[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:28.260]
So what I'll get is Israel is certainly not one of the 41 poorest countries in the world.

[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.960]
We're given them 440 million.

[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:34.460]
Now the reason we're giving them that money is because they're the only buffer we have in that part of the world.

[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:37.380]
And if the Earth didn't have all that oil, we wouldn't have a flying crap a lot as well.

[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:40.120]
It has to do with the fact that there is democracy.

[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:41.920]
It has to do with the fact that they're a buffer.

[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:50.140]
Now, it says in the article, we're given Israel 1.9 billion in military aid and 840 in economic aid.

[01:41:50.640 --> 01:42:01.600]
So what I'm saying is that I don't understand why 435 million for the 41 poorest countries in the world and 840 million for Israel.

[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.060]
Because they don't have any nuclear weapons.

[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:05.280]
That's probably the answer.

[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:06.080]
All right, thanks.

[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:06.580]
Have a great day.

[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.140]
I couldn't have answered the first time being like that one.

[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.760]
560-560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920]
Oh, you shouldn't say that.

[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.980]
You got to be more Jewish and you're more supportive of Jew leave them in an individual.

[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:18.600]
Huh?

[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:19.100]
No.

[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:20.560]
No, I'm not.

[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.740]
560-560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:30.500]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:30.840]
Hello.

[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:32.680]
Hi, New York.

[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:33.560]
Is it me, Alan?

[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.000]
Sometimes exactly like you.

[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.920]
Okay, I got a thank you for all the entertainment you've given me over the last few days.

[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:46.260]
There's nothing more entertaining than listening to a pissed off 3,000 hands in liberal.

[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:47.060]
Thank you.

[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:47.380]
Bye.

[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.060]
Okay, bye.

[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.780]
Nothing more entertaining than hearing a hidden one, cowardly, lightweight asshole, which we just heard.

[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:55.240]
Bye.

[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:56.240]
Bye, bye, bye.

[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.940]
See, I hate to break the news, but I had an hour and 40 minutes to go, sir.

[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:06.920]
I have another hour and 40 minutes, which I'm not going to waste any more time, you know,

[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.020]
looking at the ads because I wouldn't dignify with it.

[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:10.920]
Little hidden one, took.

[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.120]
560-750-560 and let me say it again in South Florida, we're 61% bus 32.

[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:20.060]
So you're right in there with all those right wing Julio.

[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:24.220]
It's really fascinating to me because the other woman majority of cars we're getting in from the bush workers.

[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:24.980]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:25.860]
Which is fine with me.

[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.080]
We don't even need a little head drop there.

[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:30.580]
It doesn't make a lot of us a little more show we want, little, little, little, little.

[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.320]
Because that's boring.

[01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:37.080]
But it's amazing that these are a lot of the same people that were having a nervous crap in their pants over

[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:43.800]
Aion and all the stuff that was going on in this community for a month after, month after, month and all the people going out in the streets and doing that thing.

[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.820]
And the fact that this town was torn in the pieces, having a nervous breakdown.

[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:52.720]
And yet now, it's interesting that they're in bed politically with those very same people.

[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.220]
Because of its only 32%.

[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:02.000]
It doesn't leave too much room for more than the green two furrows down there.

[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.800]
They represent a substantial part of the population, especially in the eight counties.

[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.200]
Strange bedfellow.

[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:12.280]
So, we're going to the feather.

[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.080]
Lava take together.

[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.380]
As in...

[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:15.920]
Yeah!

[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:18.020]
Yeah, some of them saw the dust.

[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.340]
Here's Fort Waterdale. Hello?

[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:21.280]
Hello.

[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:27.100]
And you know, the question for you is, you big supporters of Al Gore.

[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.600]
What do you mean, I big support of Al Gore? What does that mean?

[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:30.660]
What does that mean?

[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:30.720]
What does that mean?

[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:33.160]
Your honesty is supportive of Al Gore's presidency.

[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.620]
I'm in support because I'm against a bush. I'm against fascism. That's right.

[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:46.360]
Okay. Well, how do you feel about having Gore in office and then having Kipper as the first lady who will pretty much take away a lot of the rights of the people?

[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:48.440]
So, for Kipper isn't going to take away any...

[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:51.160]
Sir, Kipper isn't going to take away anybody's rights.

[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.160]
First ladies don't take away rights.

[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.180]
Any more than presidents take away a right.

[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.980]
My naive idiotic friend, it's out of the me like the guy with the eyes.

[01:44:59.400 --> 01:44:59.560]
Yeah.

[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:02.140]
And boy, there is one.

[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.800]
There is one, which I'm sure he can't vote anyway.

[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:05.920]
Spend me that, Liz.

[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:06.740]
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:07.600]
Oh, well, listen.

[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:09.760]
I haven't tried a lot of greetings like him.

[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.760]
Pemorous and Jewish, right?

[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:13.400]
Oh, exactly.

[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:16.720]
But Kipper is going to come in there and take away everybody's rights.

[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:21.020]
You know, this is what cracks me up about the needle people like Donohue.

[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.800]
Gets on there and complicates.

[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:26.840]
You know, he's for the criminalization of parts and we're going to eliminate the U.S. military.

[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.120]
And we're going to do this in all these wild radical things.

[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:34.320]
And even if you agree with all those things, the president can't do all those things.

[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:37.120]
Is there one member of the Green Party in the U.S. Congress?

[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:39.120]
Oh, no. It's going to be after the selection.

[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:39.600]
Oh, no.

[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.980]
So what's Ralph made of going to get done in Congress?

[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.520]
Is he going to get any of those things passed?

[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.480]
Oh, of course not.

[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.200]
Of course not.

[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.980]
That's what really just astonishes me is, well, everything doesn't, not anymore.

[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.240]
Because I knew the show everyday.

[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:56.960]
First of all.

[01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:58.280]
And it's nothing new.

[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:01.120]
The American public has been done with and do it for decades.

[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:07.600]
I think ever since the end of the television, that's when people really start getting this

[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.960]
dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber.

[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:14.080]
And just listen to this show and you don't have to take my word for it.

[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:15.000]
Believe it.

[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:19.280]
Here's a mobile in my engine.

[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:19.500]
Hello.

[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:20.780]
Yeah, how you doing?

[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:24.800]
And I guess the other guy says, we're about to have credence bill at the first introduced.

[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:25.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:26.500]
How you doing?

[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:27.020]
Pretty good.

[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.940]
The fun of the first day is to keep me fandom the third world country down here.

[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:31.680]
I'm from Boston.

[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.040]
With the hockey game last night.

[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:34.780]
Oh, you were the one.

[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.640]
I would have sexing the do you have to yourself?

[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:42.860]
Actually, I want to show you the three comments I heard you'd only hear in Florida hockey game.

[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:43.160]
Okay.

[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:50.460]
The first one was the genius behind me that discovered about as much as Christopher Columbus when he thought of.

[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:52.540]
Very number 10.

[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.280]
It might turn into a pretty good player.

[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:57.440]
The second was either right of me.

[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:58.700]
Yeah, I want to argue long.

[01:46:58.900 --> 01:46:59.600]
Go captain.

[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.640]
What do you say, captain?

[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.640]
Do something captain.

[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:04.400]
I could think of the life of you who up what you're talking about.

[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.160]
Yeah, he talked about melondick.

[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:06.400]
Right.

[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:13.120]
And the third was people who are left to me that they noticed that Warl was going back in the ice box.

[01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:15.380]
I didn't know they started freezing the penalty box.

[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:17.920]
In the ice box, well, I think there's something symbolic about that.

[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:23.300]
And then the commercial two on your radio station that says that you know,

[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:27.440]
Burray, the leader in goals, Whitney, and Seth and codlaw of takeaways.

[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.240]
When did they start making that stat?

[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:30.760]
Take away.

[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:33.080]
No, they took him away after the game with his bad shoulder.

[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:33.740]
They took him away.

[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.320]
In fact, they should take T.M. away.

[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.300]
We'll make you a nice deal.

[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:37.280]
T.M. for Pat Burns.

[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:38.680]
We'll take him and put his salary.

[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:39.340]
Hey, you should.

[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.140]
I think T.M. will offer you guys.

[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.160]
He's history, man.

[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.400]
And I just want to say, even though Gorge is about as smooth as sandpaper,

[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:48.740]
there's no way I put someone in office.

[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.340]
This should be where you're going to paint your own foot with a chin strap real tight.

[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:53.400]
Okay.

[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:54.460]
Thank you.

[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:54.920]
Uh-huh.

[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:57.120]
Anybody have any idea what he's talking about?

[01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:57.500]
No.

[01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:57.840]
Oh, no.

[01:47:58.060 --> 01:47:58.340]
All him.

[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:03.240]
5.6705.60, 0.560 on the 18P.

[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.120]
And go back and call Jerry Williams.

[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:05.500]
Okay.

[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.840]
I think he's on the 90 plus show up here in Boston now.

[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:08.840]
I'm going to be locked here.

[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.860]
He's on from that 3 to 4 in the morning.

[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:12.700]
Well, all the inside, they actually up.

[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.980]
What is Jerry 110 this year?

[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:14.520]
Yeah.

[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.780]
I'm a little bit of Jerry Williams.

[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:17.380]
Good night.

[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:17.720]
Good luck.

[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:18.480]
Goodbye.

[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.400]
Bye-bye.

[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.480]
25 back in the year with 5.60.

[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.280]
I don't understand what any of these people are saying.

[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.080]
You know, something doesn't make a better difference to me.

[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.000]
I doesn't make a bit of difference to me.

[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:36.620]
Because it all sounds like, I can't really do this wrong enough.

[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:41.240]
I'm just, you don't have to worry about taking anything in with her.

[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:43.420]
We'll give it, you know, two on, so to speak.

[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:45.900]
And let me say it again.

[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:48.300]
I got my silly putty and my hand takes to feed her.

[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.880]
It's about going to put me in the for me.

[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:50.760]
Plus that's the getting sauce.

[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.360]
But I got my squeezing it right now in the putty too.

[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.620]
Well, be shaking my hand if those hockey games are anyplace else, okay?

[01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:57.700]
Don't be shaking it.

[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.760]
And if you're going to shake it, don't squeeze it so tight.

[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:01.160]
I'm sure it can relate to that.

[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:02.440]
God.

[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.500]
Look at such a earth.

[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:07.820]
Oh.

[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.200]
And my girlfriend got a bull.

[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.660]
I can't cut her.

[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:13.740]
Boy, she looks like a head.

[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:14.080]
Hey.

[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:14.960]
Oh right.

[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:17.700]
My girlfriend got a bull.

[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:19.100]
I can't cut her.

[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.620]
I didn't know that she was gay.

[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:25.620]
Good thing I'm not a homophobe.

[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.040]
She struck a driving bike.

[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:29.740]
She won't leave us alone.

[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.780]
Okay, long.

[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.100]
The phone is buzzing.

[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.040]
Look on her left knee.

[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:38.160]
Looking for some mouth pain.

[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:42.060]
My girlfriend got a bull.

[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:43.620]
I can't cut her.

[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:46.080]
So she'll get more food.

[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.600]
I got a bull.

[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.440]
I can't cut her.

[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:57.600]
Properly what is 560 WDQAM?

[01:49:58.260 --> 01:49:59.160]
I'll pull the ball through it.

[01:49:59.200 --> 01:49:59.860]
I'm going to leave it on.

[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:01.380]
Just to see how many thousand both.

[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:03.860]
Let's have a fishing contest between the Eronson,

[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:05.800]
between the first fake boats on the one side.

[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.480]
And Jonathan was actually that thing that they about how the

[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.660]
liberal people, the more progressive people are like catching up now.

[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:12.480]
Really is fake.

[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.540]
He's got a low-knit ball of both.

[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.620]
But here's that's the case.

[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:14.900]
You're not.

[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:15.940]
Neowonges.com.

[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.080]
If you like some of our other day,

[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:19.240]
who do you work for for US Senate?

[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.680]
Bill McCollum's got 155.

[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.600]
About which about 100 of those are bogus.

[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:24.660]
Bill Lofton got 116.

[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:26.160]
And they're going to be up 23,

[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.080]
which I'd say 20 of those are bogus.

[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:29.820]
Even though he is the chigger in the wood pile.

[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:33.620]
560, 705, 60, 0.5, 60.

[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.040]
And that guy from Boston, Colin,

[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:35.880]
and I have to laugh.

[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:38.080]
I mean, yeah, we don't have flies in.

[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.720]
And there's nobody down here who's hockey from crap.

[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:40.500]
But you know something?

[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.160]
There's one of the original six teams.

[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.040]
And they've got all those thousands of people

[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.460]
disguised as MPL or CINK every day in game.

[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.660]
They don't throw flies up there.

[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:52.240]
Since they moved to the Fleet Enema Center,

[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.660]
and they can't get arrested in that place.

[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:55.460]
And Pat Williams had to be dissapeared.

[01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:58.520]
Because Harry Strington's a cheap prick.

[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:00.820]
Here's a mobile and broker.

[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:01.080]
Hello?

[01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:02.180]
Hey, Neowon.

[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:02.540]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:03.200]
How are you doing?

[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:03.580]
Okay.

[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.500]
I got to say, last night I was asking some,

[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:07.360]
I'm a goal supporter of, by the way.

[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:09.920]
And last night I had, I was out,

[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:11.100]
and I was asking a couple of people,

[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:12.360]
I said, look, you don't have the answer.

[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.260]
But who you've voted for.

[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.600]
And they said, look, show all the way.

[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.600]
And I, the first person I asked,

[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:19.700]
I should like.

[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.460]
And their answer was,

[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.660]
because Google is such a liar.

[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:25.640]
That was the first answer.

[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:27.440]
The second answer was,

[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:30.240]
to another person, they said,

[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:32.700]
liquid Clinton has done to the White House.

[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:33.200]
Yeah.

[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.160]
What kind of answer is that?

[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.440]
That's what it does.

[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:40.400]
That's what the Bush supporters are saying.

[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.480]
They don't have any clue

[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.380]
that's why they're even voting for the Clinton.

[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:45.120]
So I just thought,

[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:45.960]
I think it's the best of those.

[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:46.840]
That's all.

[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:48.880]
They just, what about the lines they feed in,

[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:49.740]
that sound really good?

[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:51.340]
The smooth, rehearsed lines,

[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:52.840]
they just keep repeating over and over again.

[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:54.100]
And those people suck it up.

[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:57.260]
Well, I mean, you don't think that they're going to want a guy like Bush

[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:58.820]
and appeal to the intellectuals, do you?

[01:51:59.480 --> 01:51:59.720]
No.

[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.120]
They'll appeal to the masses who are more on,

[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.420]
and they're doing a pretty good job of it.

[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:05.780]
And it's scary, because there's a lot of them not there.

[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:06.480]
All of them are,

[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:09.300]
all the good people just make sure you get out and vote.

[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:10.000]
Four or five times.

[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:10.740]
Okay, thank you.

[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:11.920]
Yesterday, they're showing on CNN,

[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:14.500]
which continues to be tilted very hard toward Bush.

[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.480]
Even though, now they're saying he's 5.8 in the pool,

[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:18.560]
even though they are state players,

[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.120]
they were showing goals and the Albatore gone.

[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:23.800]
And then they said among independent, among suburban women,

[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:27.600]
Bush was five, and nine points there,

[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.040]
50 to 41 in the previous pool.

[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:31.420]
Now, Bush was 5.8 among suburban women.

[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:32.880]
So then they go somewhere in the Midwest,

[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:34.160]
with some more suburban town,

[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:35.980]
and they've got this group of half a dozen women,

[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:37.740]
five of them are Bush supporters,

[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:38.740]
and one of them was for Gore.

[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:43.620]
And usually, the network says you know if you watched any of the news,

[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:44.900]
they'd be good, better, go backward.

[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:46.220]
They'd go in the view of two people,

[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.220]
and one would be a Bush supporter, one for Gore,

[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:50.360]
and then maybe a third one would be the for NATO or on the side,

[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.000]
to try to give the appearance, at least,

[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:52.780]
to balancing it out.

[01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:53.420]
Not CNN.

[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:55.560]
In fact, I think CNN is an efficient context,

[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:56.620]
with a fast network,

[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.620]
to see if we can turn the most right wing.

[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:00.740]
I think Bob Novak's are taken over,

[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.400]
or it's called this crew.

[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.920]
5.6705, 605, and that Mary Magdalene bitch.

[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:09.200]
Tom 5.6705, 18T and Verizon Wireless Lines.

[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:11.160]
Here's a mobile and four-mire, is that all?

[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.820]
Yeah, I'll get that to me in the hall.

[01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:13.340]
Okay?

[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:15.040]
Listen, I'm a Gore supporter,

[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:17.000]
and I wanted to say to something to call it,

[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:18.740]
even when I knew that, at least you're fair,

[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:20.920]
you take calls from the publicans as well,

[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:22.920]
as Democrats, it's like the other day, that guy,

[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:24.500]
that was honest with you.

[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:25.720]
You know, let me tell you something,

[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:27.580]
to even get on the law of the limbo shelf.

[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:28.100]
Forget it.

[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:31.240]
You have to prove that you make a half a million dollars a year.

[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:33.720]
You have to, you have to affect the moccoppe of your,

[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:36.480]
or you are mercenacity party card before all of you come in.

[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:38.560]
Exactly, so you know, in 70s college,

[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.600]
and you're entitled to your opinion.

[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.720]
No, I really do hope you do go to national.

[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.420]
Thanks for taking the call, Gala.

[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.120]
Oh shit, after that.

[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:46.920]
I hope the breath will go to national.

[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:47.540]
Oh, no.

[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:50.040]
So that was actually talked to some living and breathing people.

[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.160]
Of course, it talked to some dumb people from all around the country,

[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:53.140]
but at least there would be a variety,

[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.120]
as opposed to the guy with the eyes.

[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.180]
The Oshan provocateur.

[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:58.260]
Oh yeah, typical.

[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:01.320]
Yeah, typical goes, gonna take away your goddamn party family records.

[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:02.300]
I'll pay that right now.

[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:06.080]
Because the guy in a adult like you,

[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:08.000]
or supposedly the adult who's in his 40s,

[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:09.460]
walking around smelling like a toilet,

[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:12.180]
shouldn't be listening to party-rich family records, okay?

[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.780]
Should be listening to something a little bit more timely,

[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:17.140]
like maybe 98 degrees.

[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:20.760]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:23.360]
I think they do a little bit more of your type,

[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.800]
especially that Creighton one, they're just an easier type.

[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:28.720]
5.6705.60,

[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.540]
Palm 5.60 on the AT&T,

[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:32.840]
and Verizon Wireless on Saturday, just in.

[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.000]
Here's a mobile and cooking and creak, hello?

[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:37.320]
Yeah, now.

[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:37.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.760]
A couple of serious questions.

[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:43.820]
One, the Chinese thing with gore.

[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:44.940]
The other thing that worries me,

[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:46.760]
if he did take the cash,

[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.360]
the Chinese, the police collected it,

[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:50.640]
might as well be doing it.

[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:51.560]
I don't think he did it,

[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.580]
but if he did it,

[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:54.000]
of course he did it.

[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:55.400]
So, if he did it,

[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:56.600]
so he did that with compromise,

[01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:57.640]
and if he was in the White House.

[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:59.180]
No, honestly, no.

[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:01.160]
But, well, how about the money that Bush has taken

[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:01.940]
from the World Cup,

[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:04.180]
how about the money Bush has taken from the back of the party?

[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.400]
How about the money taken from the pharmaceutical companies?

[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:08.780]
How about the money taken from the National Life Law Association?

[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:10.540]
A million dollars last month or less,

[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:12.300]
it all beholder the special interest.

[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:14.560]
I mean, did you just wake up and discover the politicians

[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:16.760]
that are paid off and bought by special interests?

[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.040]
No, no, no, no.

[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:19.200]
I know he's a flybag,

[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:20.060]
but that's what I'm saying.

[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:20.680]
One other thing,

[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.340]
I was in Wendy's and Volky yesterday.

[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:24.100]
The problem came in for lunch.

[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:25.100]
Oh my God.

[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.120]
Oh, that was for my lunch.

[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:28.660]
Now listen, out of 80 people,

[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.840]
I was the only one who wrecked me.

[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.160]
And he shook my head and said,

[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:33.640]
geez, I'm glad you had a moment.

[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:34.460]
I asked him,

[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:35.640]
I said, you can't pay him on a debt,

[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.360]
and all you have to eat.

[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:37.620]
What are you saying?

[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:38.360]
You said, you don't do good.

[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:40.040]
No, he just said every vote counts.

[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:40.800]
That was good, you know.

[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:40.980]
Yeah.

[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.060]
Call up this guy.

[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.020]
Did he ever put some boots on?

[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:43.980]
Did he just seek a highling?

[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:46.200]
No, he had some chicken to guys with him,

[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:47.080]
so, you know, he just,

[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:47.960]
he had a salad.

[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:49.400]
Oh, he had a salad.

[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:50.880]
He has probably opened a port these days.

[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.100]
Okay, thanks to the good news.

[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:53.320]
Okay, there.

[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:54.900]
Yeah, that's the problem.

[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:56.320]
So this is the whole thing.

[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:56.880]
It's starting to,

[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.060]
this was the game plan.

[01:55:58.400 --> 01:55:58.900]
We're concerned,

[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:00.500]
compassionate conservatives.

[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:02.600]
Just cliches of nonsense, you know.

[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:03.840]
And the same in the column

[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.720]
and his ads he's running.

[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.540]
Oh, I've been attacked by the far right,

[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:07.220]
and by the far left.

[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:09.620]
So, he'd try to portray himself as a moderate.

[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:11.620]
Now, only the dumbest of the dumb

[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:12.700]
would buy you to that.

[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.580]
Only people with deep-seated Alzheimer's

[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:16.920]
like Ronnie out there in California

[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:19.600]
would forget about his rapid world in penis skate.

[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:25.060]
Oh, but he's a moderate.

[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:25.640]
Right.

[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:26.560]
Uh-huh.

[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:30.620]
And the audience loves George too.

[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:32.840]
See which one of those you believe.

[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:34.560]
I'm going to shock at that pool.

[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:36.360]
You want, why?

[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:37.640]
I mean, you want it like,

[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.640]
you're going away.

[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:40.080]
Hand you down.

[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.440]
You know, in a one-away.

[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:42.160]
Yeah.

[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.420]
I think if you told him that you would

[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:44.820]
Jewish, I think you might do a little better.

[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:46.400]
George is Jewish.

[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:47.520]
Come on, say,

[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:48.160]
Coxalhoist.

[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.100]
Coxalhoist.

[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:49.580]
Oh, and I'm not going to talk about

[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:49.580]

[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:49.580]

[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:49.580]

[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:49.580]

[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:49.580]

[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:49.580]

[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:51.560]
the world.

[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:52.480]
Man, not bad.

[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.300]
I'm just going to check this.

[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:54.540]
Chris Man told us he's new band.

[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:56.980]
The Neil Rogers show.

[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:58.120]
You sports radio.

[01:56:58.300 --> 01:56:59.000]
Five, sixteen.

[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:00.080]
Two.

[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:00.620]

[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.080]
And I said, can you keep a pecker in his hand?

[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:04.840]
He ain't going to be in a state.

[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.240]
Inside of me, he denied.

[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:12.000]
He was bending his spine.

[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.940]
He ain't going to be in a state.

[01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:18.300]
He ain't going to be in a state.

[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:18.320]

[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:19.560]
He ain't going to be in a state.

[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:24.680]
Yeah, I think if you told him that you would

[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:25.360]
be in a state,

[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:28.560]
it was a state of a state.

[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.760]
I think if you told him that you would

[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:31.520]
be in a state.

[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.200]
He was the white house in the office.

[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:37.480]
I think that's much better.

[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:40.460]
So when he can't be big,

[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.160]
he should be like this.

[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:45.000]
Or like a person that's not a big,

[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.260]
but a guy.

[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.960]
I think the way that's wrong.

[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:50.620]
All the time, I know for the show.

[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:51.580]
He denied.

[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:52.540]
He did it.

[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:56.040]
Or it's because he was the black house in his day.

[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:59.220]
He was the white house in his day.

[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:00.780]
Now he's in his house.

[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:03.520]
So Doug and Westeren Facts is, he had a couple of poor ideas.

[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.360]
Who's the ugliest, true, and radio personality?

[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:07.900]
Who's the same fact as saying in a state,

[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:09.220]
he came to my yesterday's day on it.

[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:10.560]
Did we already do that?

[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:11.420]
Who was two days ago?

[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:14.060]
Although the other one he's got on here,

[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:16.040]
Westeren candidates wives would be more like that.

[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:18.320]
So I said, oh no, not at one stand please.

[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:20.360]
God, can you even begin with?

[01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:25.340]
I guess Doug had all those parmeneers run off on him

[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:26.080]
up there in Westeren.

[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:26.600]
Sorry Doug.

[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:29.960]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:30.300]
Hello.

[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:31.940]
Hey, hello, how are you doing here?

[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:32.460]
Okay, sir.

[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:36.720]
Hey, there's a lot of people here like me who are born for gold.

[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:37.380]
You'd be surprised.

[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:37.960]
Oh right!

[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:40.760]
There's a lot of people here and you know what?

[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.120]
We are promoting it and I think the little nonsense

[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.260]
is beginning to unravel.

[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:51.440]
I had the nausea opportunity while I was driving yesterday from work.

[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:56.380]
I could hardly stomach it, but I put on one of those

[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:58.740]
for a few more stations, radio, mom, beep.

[01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:01.340]
Yeah.

[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:03.260]
And who was there talking by this idiot,

[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:06.460]
Mario D. S. Polar, this type of percentage?

[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:08.020]
Lincoln, Lincoln, do you as well?

[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:08.680]
Oh, he's probably.

[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:09.320]
Oh, he's probably.

[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:10.540]
He was on the side.

[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:11.160]
And there's Jose.

[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:11.640]

[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:15.640]
Oh, and the life that's telling and it's going flammatory.

[01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:18.840]
And you know, the whole thing is a brilliant nonsense.

[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:23.640]
And he had the goal of saying that any human with dignity

[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:24.600]
will not go for gold.

[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:27.260]
Of course, I got on the phone finally, I spoke with him at the station.

[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:28.520]
I've been here for 14 years.

[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:31.840]
I consider myself to have the unit perhaps much more

[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:33.780]
than the people that you care to.

[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.120]
I'm a gold supporter.

[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.420]
And I think many humans are away here.

[01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:42.600]
And it's very insulting when you refer to other people

[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:44.200]
because they're not supporting who you want,

[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:45.180]
that they don't have dignity.

[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:47.220]
You then study formal nonsense.

[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:49.120]
But you should kneel.

[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:51.620]
If you were just to listen to the nonsense.

[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:52.700]
Well, I couldn't handle it.

[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:54.600]
I probably lose meals that I ate by music on.

[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:56.980]
I mean, I'm for practical things that are allowing this content.

[01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:58.740]
I know it's for some men in the right, so I'm getting wrong.

[01:59:58.880 --> 01:59:58.980]
Yeah.

[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:02.620]
But listen, like I said, I have my passport ready.

[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:03.900]
I have to go back to Amsterdam.

[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:06.580]
And don't forget those articles that came out in the hill

[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:09.600]
that was buried like way in page 85 here a couple of weeks ago.

[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:11.600]
And that they did this big investigative report.

[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:14.540]
All the commentators there on those stations were being paid off.

[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:14.880]
Okay.

[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:17.160]
With this poor candidate in station position.

[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.520]
And you think there'd be a big scandal about that?

[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.180]
Was there a scandal?

[02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:20.640]
Oh, no.

[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:22.940]
You'll hear about that scandal.

[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:25.560]
Or, same day, you hear more about the cops with that prostitution right?

[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:28.580]
Yeah, but I'm so glad that those things don't come out.

[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:29.720]
And then if they're one thing,

[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:32.600]
if a lot of the blacks will listen to what a lot of those things

[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.980]
are setting, there's no serious station.

[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:34.200]
Yeah.

[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.260]
And we'll have people war over here.

[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:36.800]
It is amazing.

[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:37.280]
Yeah.

[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:40.940]
But, you know, I guess you know, both of them, they're first and many are right.

[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:42.120]
I don't know.

[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:43.700]
But it's very, very distorted.

[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:46.660]
You've got forces, you know, a lot of the old people don't know better.

[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:47.500]
And they listen to that.

[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:48.420]
No, I don't know.

[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:50.500]
Okay, well, that's why you not got to vote three times.

[02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:50.960]
Okay.

[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:51.820]
Okay, I need your thanks.

[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:52.420]
Bye-bye.

[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:53.140]
How do you like that?

[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.220]
Children's for grower, they do.

[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:56.820]
Let's hear from a lot more of those people.

[02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:58.500]
I got the bars, not just the vote for grower,

[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:00.160]
but have their voice recognized in the radio.

[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:01.100]
And we wish them very well.

[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:02.080]
And we'll bring them flowers.

[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:06.680]
Because that intimidation factor, I don't care what anybody tries to pedal you.

[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:11.080]
The intimidation factor is still very, very, very much alive and well in date county.

[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:12.060]
Don't ever kid yourself.

[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:13.980]
Unless you got a very short manory.

[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:17.740]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.

[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:20.440]
And don't anybody let you be as a boon swarrier.

[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:24.060]
I'm not the stories that the day that they had that, that early on day.

[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:28.360]
The stories that were co-washed and other businesses in the closing on that day,

[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:30.560]
including many who started the day by being open.

[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:32.520]
And they were given an offer that they couldn't refuse.

[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:33.780]
Yeah.

[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:36.540]
Talk about banana republic.

[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:38.340]
Talk about living through intimidation.

[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:40.260]
Talk about a county that's where they can fear.

[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.580]
Talk about a banana republic of bulkwrap.

[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:44.600]
That's the county for it.

[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:48.080]
And I really, I feel desperately for the decent people of the day county,

[02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:50.820]
which I'm sure they started about 30, 40, at least 50 maybe.

[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:51.960]
That's right.

[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:54.320]
Here's an interesting thing.

[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.300]
Melvin Greenstein, DDS.

[02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:00.660]
Citizens against the destruction and eradication of trees.

[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:01.480]
Quebec.

[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:08.220]
Send me a fax about the illegal confiscation destruction and rape of our beloved citrus trees

[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:10.380]
in South Florida without scientific cooperation.

[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:15.000]
We have information from our eminent pathologist, PhDs, Dr. Jack White,

[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:19.960]
Siden, Dr. Hein Witzer, Cornell University, who contradict the need for eradication of the trees

[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:21.020]
to stop the cancer disease.

[02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:25.180]
And we're issuing an open invitation to both Bush and World to seize this window of opportunity

[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:30.000]
and address the issue of millions so far to destruct the, the store in South Florida citrus fruit trees

[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.500]
and across the world, $100 million of our taxpayers' money.

[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:36.700]
George W. Bush preach his accountability in small government and says,

[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:37.640]
I trust you, the people.

[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:42.620]
Now, we're the people of South Florida outraged by them lawful destructive our trees without following the law

[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:44.840]
and providing us with a new process under the US Constitution.

[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:46.740]
Maybe he should talk to his brother, Jeb.

[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:50.380]
Throughout the world, we preach that he's the environmental candidate.

[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:52.180]
Well, our environment is being ruined right now.

[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:55.700]
If you're going to talk to talk anymore, walk the walk, letting the book out in the environment

[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:57.780]
and just talking about it, won't hack it in South Florida.

[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:01.000]
We want you to hear both of these people to come down here immediately,

[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:04.720]
not after the election, and walk away with the citizens, walk away with the citizens of South Florida

[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:07.020]
through the killing fields of our property and do something.

[02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:09.860]
We don't just want, we want action now, it says.

[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:10.300]
Oh!

[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:12.560]
So, what about it?

[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:13.100]
What?

[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:14.040]
So, what about it?

[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:14.780]
What about it?

[02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:15.880]
God damn it!

[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:19.940]
You said they bowed in Palm Beach County, and determined who, not only will kill you,

[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:22.560]
this pivotal state, but determined will be the next president of the US.

[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:26.380]
Mr. Bush, don't you think you have the conservative over the Hispanics down here?

[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:28.220]
We're not through the wider community you may think.

[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:30.480]
When it comes to our God-given and constitutional-given rights,

[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:32.800]
we're not a diverse community-weight-enated community.

[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.760]
Mr. Gorge, get down here now.

[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.200]
This is your window of opportunity to become the next president by winning our pivotal state,

[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:43.220]
and then it says there'll be a rally at Tropical Park in Miami this Monday,

[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:47.980]
Friday, October 27, South like tomorrow at 3pm, to show the Florida Supless Outrage.

[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:49.600]
Very good, George.

[02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:52.860]
We invite all concerned citizens of South Florida,

[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:56.040]
show up for the significant rally where we'll discuss in March by we,

[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:59.280]
the people to get our servants' George W. Bush and Al Gore to help us in our fight

[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:01.360]
to save the ecology and beauty of South Florida,

[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:05.240]
which I say, go on now and spread the word we're also involved in for that,

[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:08.580]
citizens to get the destruction able in eradication of trees.

[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:11.740]
And they have a phone number here.

[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:14.780]
I guess if people would like to be involved with more information about what they'd be doing,

[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:21.420]
305, 661, 0740, 661, 0740.

[02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:26.120]
And that should put the Bush might to especially in a difficult position

[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:29.760]
because it's his brother who's the ringleader of all of this crap.

[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:34.920]
It's his fascist brother who's the ringmaster and has all these Nazis

[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:39.040]
in taking your property and destroying the property and bringing him to police.

[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:44.040]
Yeah, that thing is, then they had the bound shirts with him there yesterday in plantation.

[02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:44.740]
I was lovely.

[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:47.440]
I'm enjoying what they're really proud of that scene.

[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:50.480]
Here's Washington. Hello.

[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:51.400]
Is that a good afternoon?

[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:52.040]
Yes, sir.

[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.920]
Remember, you mentioned Ben Novak, who was I go?

[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:56.180]
I remember one Novak.

[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:56.780]
Not Bob Novak.

[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:57.500]
I was like Bob Novak.

[02:04:58.060 --> 02:04:59.580]
I was like, it's not any of that.

[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:00.680]
Bob Novak.

[02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:06.060]
I remember watching the Gotham group years ago in Bob Novak, Morton, Kondraki, Jack Turman,

[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:07.960]
John McLaughlin, beyond there.

[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:11.220]
And they would all be leaning so far back in their chairs as they were,

[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:13.780]
and it was always McLaughlin going, this shoe is wild.

[02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:14.200]
Yeah.

[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:17.680]
And I swear they must have been drinking heavy before they take the show.

[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:21.980]
And you really, really, really, McLaughlin would always say,

[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:23.600]
ah, what's the answer to this?

[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:25.060]
What do I want to hear in Bob's face?

[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:26.600]
And he goes, oh, Jack, what's the answer?

[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:28.940]
I want to hear, oh, you're not going to go right through the list.

[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:31.600]
If you just like a little bit of this, that's what you guys got.

[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:32.400]
The right person.

[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:34.640]
So, but you know that, no, that's not.

[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:35.480]
No, that's not.

[02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:36.340]
Yeah, he's big, Jermon.

[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:39.940]
Jermon, I thought Jermon was always, you know, when he'd wait for,

[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:41.460]
I thought that could be usually in that chair up here.

[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:42.440]
If he goes over, forget it.

[02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:44.400]
Oh, wait, I thought I'd wait about 500 pounds, yeah.

[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:48.940]
But now, no, that was just a little bit to the right of the hammer,

[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:53.160]
or would you say, to head back there about 10 yards to the right of Heinrich,

[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:55.060]
and more than 50 yards to the right of a tell of a hunt.

[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.220]
There he goes.

[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:56.460]

[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:59.540]
You know, when you talk about CNN and how they're projecting,

[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:02.980]
their projection, I think, as far as their positioning,

[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:06.200]
how right wing they become, they're having, we would, you would,

[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:10.240]
you were talking about how other idiots are thinking about voting for Nader.

[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:12.740]
They don't have any discussion with Deschanate.

[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:15.720]
Is a vote for Ralph Nader, a vote for Al Gore.

[02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:16.960]
Oh, that's brilliant.

[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.720]
It's trying to perhaps motivate people to recognize.

[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:23.860]
Now, if you don't go up there and vote for, for, for,

[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:27.080]
then that's why I sang as a vote for Al Gore, a vote for Pat, you can't.

[02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:27.740]
That's exactly.

[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:30.160]
Is a vote for Al Gore, but, and you mentioned it,

[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.040]
you were voting Michael Kim's, the article, yeah.

[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.680]
And I, what makes me wonder is, where's William F. Buckley,

[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:37.380]
Kim's used to do this moderation on fire line.

[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:38.340]
Where's William F. Buckley?

[02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:40.760]
You know, he's been very quiet about these with the Pope.

[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:43.140]
They're praying a lot these days, yeah.

[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:45.060]
And I have a couple questions.

[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:48.740]
One is, has anybody seen Dick Cheney and Mr. Burns

[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:50.320]
from The Simpsons in the same room?

[02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:54.380]
I mean, there's a, starting, I literally wanted to cartoon character,

[02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:56.100]
which is too dimensional and for our amusement,

[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:58.480]
but the other ones on TV on The Simpsons,

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:01.000]
and I say we write in the bridge tender.

[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:01.580]
Okay.

[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:01.660]
Okay.

[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:04.060]
Okay.

[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:05.580]
And how about...

[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:11.180]
Now, from Washington, the McLaughlin group,

[02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:14.420]
featuring Elinor Clif, Jack Jamon,

[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:17.040]
and sitting in for Pat Buchanan,

[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:19.180]
we are giant cheeky barber.

[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:22.300]
Now, here's John McLaughlin.

[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:26.360]
This you on, George W.

[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:29.900]
Rings of Wolk's Elinor Clif.

[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:31.860]
Well, John, I'd like to say...

[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:33.260]
Long! Jack Jamon!

[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:34.720]
Well, that's not an easy choice.

[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:36.680]
Tiki Barber!

[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:38.200]
I'm going to have to say the book,

[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:42.060]
actual answer, law exercise.

[02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:43.700]
That wasn't even a choice.

[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:45.680]
Next, initial, Al Gore,

[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:47.680]
favorite Broadway show,

[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.460]
bringing the noise, bringing the funs of cats.

[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:52.240]
And I think it's well enough.

[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:54.160]
Well, John, I'd like to say...

[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:56.060]
Long! Jackie, Jackie, Benjamin Jamon!

[02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:57.680]
Well, that's a very difficult choice.

[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:59.400]
Long! Tiki Barber!

[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:00.320]
I'm going to have to say...

[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:02.900]
Not a choice, re-e-tiki Barber!

[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:04.960]
You gave it as a lesson, I wasn't a choice.

[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:07.320]
Long! Correct with puns, cats,

[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:09.740]
heel-absum, next issue,

[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:12.300]
the cats of big brothers should be murdered.

[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:14.020]
How? Elinor!

[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:14.800]
Get rid of the shoe!

[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:15.880]
Long! Jack Jamon!

[02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:16.420]
Dynamite!

[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:17.720]
Long! Tiki Barber!

[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:19.260]
I don't think they should be cheap.

[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:22.120]
Long! Accolamster, poison pudding!

[02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:23.240]
Bye-bye!

[02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:24.400]
Bye-bye!

[02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:25.680]
All right, you're right.

[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:27.740]
That is the best. I'm all puns.

[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:31.440]
From 53 at 560 WQM as we continue rolling along,

[02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:32.700]
sing in our song here, boy.

[02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:35.140]
Sturring the pot and then smoking it too.

[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:37.820]
Now, when you know Ralph Nader, he said, yeah.

[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:40.840]
56070560,

[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:42.900]
you'll look at us, we got somebody to build us in people on here,

[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:44.200]
trying to skew this, but that's good.

[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.340]
Let's have a battle of the...

[02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:48.660]
the partisans here on our pole today.

[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:50.360]
It's really what we're going to get it evened out.

[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:53.400]
If the election were today, would you vote for U.S. Senator?

[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:56.400]
Bill McCollum's got 169, both lost in 150,

[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:58.420]
and Willie Logan, he'd be the...

[02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:00.240]
a chiggerweight in Woodpile, he'd be having 27.

[02:09:01.220 --> 02:09:03.800]
And I guarantee you there ain't no dark folks voting for Willie Logan.

[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:04.600]
You're gonna keep that.

[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:06.280]
Or anybody else.

[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:08.240]
Here's Orlando, hello.

[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:09.240]
Hey, Neil.

[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:11.800]
I used to try to figure out my math here.

[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:14.960]
If we take a trillion away from the seniors right now.

[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:15.280]
Yeah.

[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:16.560]
And clearly...

[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:17.380]
Give it to the young people, yeah.

[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:18.800]
And then they blow it in the market.

[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:19.200]
Right.

[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:21.740]
Have we lost two trillion or one trillion?

[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:24.320]
Yeah, but then we can have WSELA rate Texas Rangers

[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:25.480]
and we can replace it with that money.

[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:28.000]
Oh, well, they'd probably bring it about what?

[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:28.520]
A half million?

[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:30.380]
No, no. 95 million easy.

[02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:30.780]
Okay.

[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:31.980]
That was covered for a couple of days.

[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:36.140]
Well, when the barn's throwing reform campaign was here yesterday in Sanford.

[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.980]
There were some women afterwards in MSNBC interviewed.

[02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:41.820]
Because the W stands for Women.

[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:43.340]
The Women campaign.

[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:47.180]
And the one that asked you to say, well, if he stands for Women,

[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:48.740]
then how come he never talks about them?

[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:50.820]
And they said, I don't know.

[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:52.780]
Because he's trying to keep it a quiet issue.

[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:55.780]
And because in Florida, anyway, he's getting buried by 10 points in women

[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:57.240]
in the senior citizens, too.

[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:58.100]
You're buried.

[02:09:58.560 --> 02:09:58.760]
All right.

[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.200]
And if I'm not going to be more than that, thank you.

[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.440]
And you don't want to bring attention to the fact that he's anti-woman

[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:04.240]
and certainly anti-woman's right to choose.

[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:05.820]
And all I say about this here about...

[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:06.760]
Well, he believes in the people.

[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:08.560]
His opponent believes in Washington DC.

[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:09.900]
The bureaucrats, he give it out of my head,

[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:10.840]
and he believes in big government.

[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:12.260]
But he believes in the people, yeah.

[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:14.120]
And the wrong free choice is accepted.

[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:15.640]
Or accepted when it comes to anything.

[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:19.000]
About the only free choice he wants to give to you is carrying your peace

[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.280]
in the amusement park and the church.

[02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:22.980]
Maybe the other guy else wants to take it.

[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.200]
But other than that, forget it.

[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:25.700]
Effort.

[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:27.120]
Or you can't do that either.

[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:32.600]
So what if he really interesting when the one turns here in a couple days

[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:34.020]
like maybe the beginning of next week,

[02:10:34.260 --> 02:10:35.000]
I will...

[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:36.080]
Woo!

[02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:38.800]
Or talk about devastating.

[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:41.800]
And remember what happened with Bob Riddingson?

[02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:43.620]
Remember that?

[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:46.020]
Remember that very day that he got up there to make this speech

[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.780]
and all of a sudden they were all caught smith-faced?

[02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:50.680]
Because nobody had any idea what he was going to reveal

[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:52.540]
because they caught him with his pantaloonies down

[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:54.200]
and have an extramarital affair.

[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:58.220]
Mr. Goody Tushus, who is going to be the next speaker of the US.

[02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:01.020]
He's a representative's wrong, that's right.

[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:03.220]
The next squeaker.

[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:04.720]
He squeaked right on over there.

[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:07.620]
I believe he now.

[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:10.700]
Yeah, he'll leave him now all right when he has something between your legs.

[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:13.700]
Just the number one thing.

[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:15.820]
Even Republicans have a penis.

[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:18.840]
I think even then Chengen's got one.

[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:19.540]
I'm pretty sure.

[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:21.720]
That's what the Dixit.

[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.940]
256 at 560 WTQAM.

[02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:29.180]
480-560 WTQAM by having a fourth under now,

[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:33.200]
a measly broadcast group station at WTQAM.com

[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:34.220]
or a World of H.

[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.260]
But heads.

[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:36.740]
It's the one to do out.

[02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:40.140]
Do it.

[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:44.320]
It's playing a song about a happy couple.

[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:52.420]
We just got married, my wife's weight's double.

[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:53.300]
You're gay.

[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:56.860]
We just got married, my wife's weight's double.

[02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:56.860]

[02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:58.160]
We just got a squeaker.

[02:11:58.680 --> 02:11:59.700]
You got a sister.

[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:01.360]
Tell me so.

[02:12:01.620 --> 02:12:02.500]
Let me tell you.

[02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:03.280]
The sister.

[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:04.600]
It's for us.

[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:07.240]
It's my wife.

[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.400]
I don't need that girl.

[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:12.300]
She's a boss.

[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:14.140]
And that's China.

[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.380]
It's the sister.

[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:18.720]
I won't survive.

[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.400]
It's my wife.

[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:25.200]
What's sister's around her?

[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:26.200]
How sweet.

[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:29.820]
Well, it's the round of house.

[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:30.760]
Who's this?

[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:32.240]
There's the sister.

[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.480]
I won't survive.

[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:35.560]
You know.

[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:38.800]
It's my wife.

[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:40.480]
Okay, a minute after one.

[02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:43.040]
I have 562M.

[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:46.140]
So, Doug and Westerner is going to be our new pro question to come around for.

[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.580]
Because George, first of all, there's a fine show about crappy pearls.

[02:12:50.020 --> 02:12:52.200]
And secondly, I do fine pearls, but I'm a burnout.

[02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:55.220]
I can do political ones, but it's what's the point?

[02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:57.240]
Then they keep the scroll with them.

[02:12:57.340 --> 02:12:57.900]
Now, clear two.

[02:12:58.080 --> 02:12:59.320]
So, let's get this off of there, Eric.

[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:04.940]
Why did the moment it's Macala 173, go around 159, a really low-grade 27?

[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:06.100]
Does anybody believe that?

[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:07.520]
Oh, this audience, no, of course not.

[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:08.920]
Ridiculous.

[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:11.280]
In fact, I don't know what I'm going to say.

[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:12.360]
So get that thing off of there.

[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:12.820]
That's done.

[02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:13.520]
It killed that pearl.

[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:15.400]
Just like the moment we tried to take on a present, something.

[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:19.660]
So it works for a few minutes and then after they hop on the band back and they hop on it.

[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:21.240]
And they're still in it.

[02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:24.120]
So Doug comes up with another great question.

[02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:29.820]
If you had the choice, will you still live in Florida, move out of Florida and visit occasionally,

[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:31.780]
or move the F out and ever look back.

[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:32.960]
Of course, you don't just have to put F.

[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.380]
We can write the word out on there, Eric, because it's the Internet.

[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:40.800]
And I'm like, yeah, the FCC, the FCC can't screw us on a guy they're in the Internet.

[02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:43.000]
And that's another thing.

[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:44.540]
This business about freedom of speech.

[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:45.300]
Well, F them.

[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:46.640]
That's what I say to the FCC.

[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:47.500]
Screw them.

[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:48.680]
Fasted.

[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:50.180]
There's the pearl.

[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:51.880]
If you have the choice, here are three choices.

[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:58.100]
Will you still live in Florida, move on to Florida and visit occasionally, or move the F out and ever look back.

[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:00.560]
Move the F you out.

[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:03.160]
And never look back.

[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:04.060]
Let's come back and visit.

[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:05.820]
Just to make me a while left.

[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:06.920]
Yeah, how nice it is.

[02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:10.760]
Well, I think that kind of, you know, that one I'm sorry, the one I'm honking with, the one I'm not looking at, the one I'm not looking at.

[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:12.320]
Five, six, seven, seven, seven.

[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.640]
One thing I can't deal with.

[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:16.420]
I don't think over the years what philosophical you pose.

[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:20.620]
I'm not assuming that everybody I associate with has to have the same philosophy as either.

[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:24.600]
All I wrote, and that I'm very uncomfortable even being around right wing fanatics.

[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:26.160]
I can't stand them. They make me nauseous.

[02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:30.520]
But when I'm around people who I like have, when I realize that they have selfish reasons

[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:35.600]
for their political views, it makes me nauseous. It makes me want to vomit.

[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:40.440]
I don't want to mention any relatives who live in hell and they're anything like that with their 40 or 50 or 60 or 70 million dollars

[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:45.060]
who are constantly, we're holding for Republicans because it's good for their pocketbook as if they really needed.

[02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:45.980]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:52.900]
And just like my girlfriend Ron, who I know knows very well is hard because he's a good decent guy, but it just pains me Ron that it's sad.

[02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:54.020]
It's really sad.

[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:59.260]
Because I know you're not a fetus hugger and I know you're not one of those Bible thumpers, but that's really what you're in bed with.

[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:01.700]
And it's really kind of smelly. And they're getting smelly in there at all.

[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.320]
Yeah. Isn't it?

[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:09.060]
5, 6, 7, or 5, 60, count 5, 60 on the AT&T. Let's do the sning gym. Let's go to my head.

[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.000]
Here's a full-water nail. Hello.

[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:14.680]
Nail?

[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:15.220]
Yes sir.

[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:18.920]
You are absolutely correct. That's up to my parents last night.

[02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:21.240]
And it killed me.

[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:22.760]
Yeah.

[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:24.980]
They're voting for birth.

[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:25.900]
Oh no.

[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:31.680]
Oh no. Oh my god. This guy is a moron.

[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:32.000]
Yeah.

[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:35.680]
How do you, how do your parents, how are something?

[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:36.680]
Well I'm adopted.

[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:39.700]
Oh I see. Well that's a good cop out anyway.

[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:40.540]
Don't say new.

[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:42.860]
Well from the goal.

[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:44.760]
But you can't change them.

[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:49.420]
They're too old. They're like 65 and they're 70.

[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:55.220]
You can't change them. They're Republican. They're going to favor polling. They're going to vote for pollican period.

[02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:56.800]
Even if Mickey Mouse were running. Well.

[02:15:58.020 --> 02:15:58.840]
So that goes.

[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:00.040]
Yeah but it's Fox.

[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:02.180]
Anyway.

[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:07.060]
Oh sorry. I'm nervous.

[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:10.660]
I'm not paying attention to you anyway. So just don't be nervous.

[02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:12.180]
What do you do?

[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:13.340]
I'm squeezing my putty here.

[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:16.580]
Yeah. We got in my hand right now. I'm squeezing it very gently.

[02:16:16.740 --> 02:16:17.280]
My putty too.

[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:19.940]
I got to recover man. I'm going to do my rehab.

[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:22.200]
Did you hear that George Bush quote?

[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:28.680]
They wrote a fundraiser or I'm not sure. I'm not sure if it's a fundraiser or a roast.

[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:29.120]

[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:34.400]
Where he said that some people call you the elite.

[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:36.180]
I call you my base.

[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:37.700]
Did you hear that?

[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:38.100]
No.

[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:38.960]
No.

[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:40.180]
You didn't hear that?

[02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:40.760]
No.

[02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:42.280]
Yeah that's true.

[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:43.380]
You're gay.

[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:43.760]
No.

[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:45.620]
What time are you going to say?

[02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:46.300]
Wow.

[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:47.800]
No that's true.

[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:48.720]
I heard it.

[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:49.740]
It was on the move.

[02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:50.620]
I didn't hear it.

[02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:51.260]
We didn't hear it.

[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:51.660]
We didn't hear it.

[02:16:51.740 --> 02:16:53.060]
Oh listen. Have a great day and tell your parents.

[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:54.160]
Oh okay. I'll talk to you.

[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:55.300]
Walk them up on Luxembourg.

[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:56.300]
Walk them up on Guru.

[02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:56.880]
Okay.

[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:01.880]
Yeah. Give me over the tag until we tell them to stay on Luxembourg.

[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:03.120]
Okay. It's dangerous out there.

[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:06.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.

[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:08.020]
And of course the sad part of it is the old folks.

[02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:08.720]
They do vocals.

[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:10.800]
I mean it's a, it's something to do.

[02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:11.860]
It's a project.

[02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:15.500]
It's a project to be those Brian Murray calls coming again with BM.

[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:16.960]
When I started that again I went,

[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:19.140]
no I'm not going to blow the whole audience off that mistake.

[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:22.400]
I made, remember we had that group book when we first came on this station and then I got

[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.280]
sucked in that again.

[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:25.600]
That bad mistake would wear a hockey stuff.

[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:27.860]
It feels like a Chris Walls finger with it with a taxon.

[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:29.560]
Twice in my life I made that big mistake.

[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:32.820]
Plus those awful guy then hockey shows that somebody talked to me and do what I want to

[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:35.560]
mention his name even though he said Schmidt on the PA last night at the arena.

[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:37.280]
Never again.

[02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:39.300]
I got my Joe Bowen Highlight.

[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:41.880]
I got my 30 seconds of comments about whatever went on when you were in it.

[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:42.460]
And that's it.

[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.620]
And of course the comments about that woman had nothing to do with a hockey game.

[02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:46.580]
It had to do with her.

[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:48.100]
It had to do with her ambiance.

[02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:51.580]
And of course she calls them even admits that her mother hates her life presentations in

[02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:53.880]
asphalt, which I commend her for her honesty anyway.

[02:17:54.660 --> 02:17:55.420]
End of bad breath.

[02:17:56.420 --> 02:17:57.240]
Here's North Miami.

[02:17:57.240 --> 02:17:57.600]
Hello.

[02:17:57.800 --> 02:17:58.540]
Hey Neil how you doing?

[02:17:58.620 --> 02:17:58.940]
Pretty good.

[02:17:59.240 --> 02:17:59.720]
What's happening?

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.420]
Not much.

[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:03.820]
I used to do a great job and I agree with you with almost whatever thing.

[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:06.780]
I want to ask something on guarding the media.

[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:07.220]
Yes.

[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.440]
You don't think that the media did a good job regarding the candidate for them each one of them

[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:18.440]
exactly the way I mean like they may go look at the tough man in the same time route and

[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:19.200]
be productive.

[02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:19.600]
Oh yeah.

[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:24.740]
Some of these women in the suburban women yesterday always, you have to watch them in that

[02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:25.240]
third debate.

[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:26.420]
He scared me a death.

[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:28.800]
He was running a party here for eight years.

[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:30.360]
Because he was forceful.

[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:32.500]
I guess they liked the wimpy routine.

[02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:33.280]
Maybe they liked it.

[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:34.820]
I mean I'm the same thing about Bush.

[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:36.240]
He's allowed to do mistakes.

[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:41.320]
He's allowed to give like a form support about his about the fixer trucker and was thrown

[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:41.980]
on over there.

[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:48.240]
And just the same time, what I think is going to be happening right now, finally the media

[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:53.560]
has started to come to the issues, to the policies, to everything each one of them standing

[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:53.880]
for.

[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:00.860]
And I was like hearing CNN with Judy Woodrow yesterday interview in the third party, the Green

[02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:01.440]
Candidates.

[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:06.180]
And like she's putting them in, and you hear like she's even feeling more bad than anybody else

[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:08.220]
the way he's taking votes from Gore.

[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:10.280]
And I think that's what can happen in the end.

[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.660]
I disagree with it because every time you independent candidate, you're like when John Anderson

[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:18.540]
ran in the 80s, every time they run in the polls, they do a lot better.

[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:23.320]
And then people go in there and then they'll maybe get 2% of top's major.

[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:24.280]
Maybe it's best 2%.

[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:27.680]
Well, what that dummy will never get to the point?

[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:30.340]
I'll tell you how many votes you can and it's going to get.

[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:30.860]
Beirn.

[02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:31.340]
That's it.

[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:32.560]
Have a great day pal.

[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:33.520]
Thank you for hanging there.

[02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:34.140]
I'm going to vote.

[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:34.640]
Beirn.

[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:36.200]
Times myself in the morning and then afterwards.

[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:36.780]
Beirn.

[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:37.140]
More times.

[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:38.960]
And then right before 7 o'clock when the polls go.

[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:39.440]
Beirn.

[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:40.100]
Nine more times.

[02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:42.000]
Just to be on the safe side.

[02:19:45.220 --> 02:19:45.760]
It's not.

[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:47.120]
It's, uh, beirn.

[02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:47.800]
Minutes after one.

[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:48.600]
Well, it's sitting there.

[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:49.120]
I mean, what about him?

[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:49.880]
I'll not use it, baby.

[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:51.020]
If you don't use it, you lose it.

[02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:54.080]
Only in the Banana Republic, baby.

[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:55.180]
Only in Miami.

[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:58.900]
And he gets on round 3, third minute.

[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:01.700]
With his new soul up so tight.

[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:05.260]
So on all the day of pandering.

[02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:08.360]
To more realistic faces.

[02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:11.000]
And that's that thing round question.

[02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:13.660]
So that's all in the press.

[02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:16.760]
But he knows that's good.

[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:19.740]
And he knows that's fine.

[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:21.440]
Well, he knows more.

[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:26.000]
Well, he's showed a true love to the eyes.

[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:30.580]
He's the one connected power grab his nose.

[02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:33.800]
And I told President he'll tell us.

[02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:38.100]
And he likes the fancy jobs.

[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:41.140]
Because he's always had to bend.

[02:20:41.740 --> 02:20:47.240]
And it makes us find a vision to his demi-cat flash sets.

[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:53.180]
And he goes up the fence, which shows he's better than the rest.

[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:56.280]
But he knows he's so cool.

[02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:59.440]
And he knows the fans.

[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:02.320]
He was far off so well.

[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:05.500]
He's showed a true love to the eyes.

[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:10.080]
He's the well connected power grab his nose.

[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:13.520]
And I told President he'll tell us.

[02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:17.800]
And it's all for thick, thick candy.

[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:20.580]
Well, he knows his son's a thing.

[02:21:21.180 --> 02:21:24.240]
So at home he can't stand to lie.

[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:26.660]
And simply pull the strings.

[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:30.340]
And that does that he has for a son.

[02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:32.880]
And just sit behind the desk.

[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.660]
And he knows his son's good.

[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:38.920]
And he knows he's so fine.

[02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:41.540]
He was for a little while.

[02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:45.020]
Well, he's showed a true love to the eyes.

[02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:49.620]
He's the well connected power grab his nose.

[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:52.760]
And I told President he'll tell us.

[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:57.720]
Oh, 15 at 5.60 WQM.

[02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:01.460]
Here's the fact that it says I'm outweighed my three grandchildren go to school and Dallas.

[02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:05.300]
The public school has a rally to get the kids to tell their parents to vote for Bush.

[02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:05.940]
Oi!

[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:07.900]
I thought I'd make a difference.

[02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:09.320]
He's going to win places over home.

[02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:12.940]
But nevertheless, it says since when do I tank dollars supporting the school system

[02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:15.680]
have the right to get children involved in one political campaign?

[02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:18.980]
It's grandma in Pompidou who says we are a woman vote borer.

[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:19.600]
I agree, grandma.

[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:20.840]
This is a ladies' order for the borer.

[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:21.480]
You bet.

[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:25.820]
5.607.05.60.

[02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:26.580]
Pompidou.506.

[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:27.740]
You're on the AT&T and Verizon.

[02:22:27.740 --> 02:22:28.440]
Where was one?

[02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:29.240]
The new pool was up.

[02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:31.100]
Here's Miami.

[02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:31.420]
Hello.

[02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:32.460]
Hello.

[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:33.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:34.680]
You know, Irvin, how you doing?

[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:35.120]
Okay.

[02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:36.520]
And this is for you forever.

[02:22:37.200 --> 02:22:38.020]
But here's my thing.

[02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:38.460]
Two things.

[02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:39.020]
Where's your thing?

[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:42.800]
When will he declare himself a free agent?

[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:43.920]
Will he log in that is?

[02:22:44.140 --> 02:22:44.300]
Yeah.

[02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:49.960]
You know, there's no one in the Northwest community going to vote for this guy as free agent.

[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:51.960]
We're going for Bill Nelson.

[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:53.320]
There you go.

[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:55.280]
That other guy that's...

[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:55.860]
How do you do this?

[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:57.220]
The manager.

[02:22:57.660 --> 02:22:58.280]
I'm a manager.

[02:22:58.560 --> 02:22:58.700]
Yeah.

[02:22:58.740 --> 02:22:59.260]
I'm a manager.

[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:02.260]
You know, I knew it even let him on the Senate floor to present his case.

[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:03.420]
He's a manager to Cubs.

[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:06.640]
And not only that, 60 minutes about two weeks ago,

[02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:11.340]
did a story on Bush in the education system just a little nervous.

[02:23:11.740 --> 02:23:14.580]
He did a story on the education system.

[02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:16.080]
The interview to teachers,

[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:18.320]
and they showed that the students there

[02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:20.740]
cannot pass the entry exam.

[02:23:21.220 --> 02:23:25.280]
Because they are so geared to learning the tests.

[02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:25.760]
Right.

[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:27.680]
It's the test that teaches the tests.

[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:28.940]
But they're not really learning anything.

[02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:32.020]
They're not learning the three hours.

[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:35.360]
So last Sunday night on CNN at 10 o'clock,

[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:37.520]
they did a story on a...

[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:38.080]
a goal.

[02:23:38.700 --> 02:23:40.300]
So this Sunday night on CNN,

[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:41.760]
they got to the clock,

[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:43.720]
they're going to do the story on Bush.

[02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:46.960]
So I would like for all of you listeners

[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:48.820]
to watch this program

[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:51.740]
and see the history behind the guy.

[02:23:52.260 --> 02:23:52.900]
And come Monday,

[02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:56.500]
let us know if they still feel the same way about Bush.

[02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:56.980]
Okay.

[02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:58.360]
You got my vote.

[02:23:58.680 --> 02:23:59.300]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[02:23:59.300 --> 02:23:59.920]
All the way.

[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:00.460]
All right.

[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:01.000]
I'm right.

[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:02.780]
Just say it all to Willie.

[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:05.240]
The teacher in the wood pile, I really love him.

[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:07.420]
If you had the choice,

[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:08.840]
would you still let him throw the three?

[02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:10.740]
Move out of the floor and visit occasionally three,

[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:12.480]
and move the F out and never look back two.

[02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:14.400]
We have just a bunch of things just went on there.

[02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:16.360]
I wouldn't dare say how I voted.

[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:19.180]
As they move out and visit occasionally.

[02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:20.780]
Yeah.

[02:24:21.100 --> 02:24:22.580]
Like what it took a little bit of Amsterdam.

[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:23.120]
Yeah.

[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:23.700]
Visit mommy.

[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:27.320]
5.670.560,

[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:28.440]
Pompoy, you really are.

[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:30.340]
We're going to talk about the popcorn to kettle black.

[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:31.260]
He's sitting here talking about

[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:33.200]
he wishes there's another good jump off the Empire State Building.

[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:34.440]
And then he had visit mommy.

[02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:36.020]
I got to go to a studio in La La La,

[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:37.360]
okay, just to be nice to mommy.

[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:38.240]
At least mine.

[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:39.500]
No problem.

[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:40.040]
Yes.

[02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:41.400]
Here's some lies.

[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:41.640]
Hello.

[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:41.640]

[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:42.660]
Hello.

[02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:43.140]
Hello.

[02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:43.140]

[02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:43.480]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:46.920]
What is going on with the Larry Flint exposé?

[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:48.100]
Any day now, Kyle.

[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:50.820]
Why is it such a small story?

[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:51.880]
Why are they asking?

[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:53.680]
Why is anybody asking George Bush about this?

[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:55.040]
I mean, they asked about the day.

[02:24:55.180 --> 02:24:56.500]
They asked him about drugs.

[02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:57.720]
He wouldn't answer that question.

[02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:59.420]
He sure is not going to answer about this.

[02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:01.120]
But when it comes out in about three or four days,

[02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:03.360]
if they get to, if they can clear this bitch off enough,

[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:05.100]
they got four signed affidavits as well.

[02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:05.500]
We're hearing.

[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:07.740]
I mean, they asked for, you know, about this.

[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:09.140]
If it's penis with curbs, it's a certain way.

[02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:09.440]
Right.

[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:11.120]
They don't hesitate to ask him that.

[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:12.160]
But what about that one?

[02:25:12.460 --> 02:25:12.720]
What about that one?

[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:15.140]
How come they don't ask Bush if his penis is curved the other way?

[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:16.160]
Because it is an outward.

[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:18.260]
Because I think Clintons was curbed to the left

[02:25:18.260 --> 02:25:19.460]
and Bush is curbed to the right.

[02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:23.020]
Well, why don't we ask about a drug shop?

[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:24.980]
It's a macadet for flowers, cut for a plethora.

[02:25:24.980 --> 02:25:26.340]
I just got to your tenure.

[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:27.140]
It's three or four days.

[02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:27.740]
He's over here.

[02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:28.860]
All right.

[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:30.380]
Like a week before the action sounds,

[02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:31.260]
it's real juicy to me.

[02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:32.320]
Well, you know, if it was put in there,

[02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:33.660]
there were 60 million dollar investigations

[02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:34.760]
for all of them already by now.

[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:35.160]
Exactly.

[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:36.300]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:38.020]
What we could have taken that 50 or 60 million,

[02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:39.160]
given it as that broad,

[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:41.760]
and she'd be glad in all over the place right now.

[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:43.060]
Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, yeah.

[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:45.300]
And then you know what they're going to say?

[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:46.360]
Well, you know, she got paid,

[02:25:46.540 --> 02:25:48.200]
but they have the signed affidavits.

[02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:49.800]
The lawyers have got their nose in it.

[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.320]
Just like the Bob Livingston thing.

[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:52.320]
He didn't deny it.

[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:52.960]
He walked away.

[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:53.580]
He resigned.

[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:56.440]
How do you like that?

[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:57.700]
And of course, if Bush walks away,

[02:25:57.900 --> 02:25:58.780]
that leaves us with dick.

[02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:04.320]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T,

[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:05.920]
and Verizon, what else do I want?

[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:06.480]
When they're pretty sweet,

[02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:09.180]
Bush has to drop off because of the tremendous embarrassment and pressure,

[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:10.620]
and the Republicans are left with dick.

[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:13.400]
Here's Naples, hello.

[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:14.520]
Hello.

[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:15.220]
Yes, sir.

[02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:16.020]
I'm your lawyer.

[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:16.620]
Okay.

[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:19.280]
Listen, on the thing you think of previous fall,

[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:21.900]
we get a lot of money here too for Bush.

[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:24.900]
The big thing is that they go to the Socialist

[02:26:24.900 --> 02:26:28.340]
because he's offering programs to education and child health.

[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:28.560]
Right.

[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:30.900]
But that was why it caused me a lot of trouble.

[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:33.220]
Those here are still waiting for the visit from Dr. Mengele

[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:34.060]
over the one of us, closer.

[02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:34.920]
Yeah, it's true.

[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:38.840]
So, I just saw the end of Bush's speech in Pittsburgh.

[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:42.020]
He's talking about bipartisan citizenship again.

[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:42.320]
Yeah.

[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:43.660]
I don't get it.

[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:45.860]
Well, what's with these taxes Democrats?

[02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:47.720]
They're still called Blue Guard Democrats?

[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:50.040]
They're Republicans everywhere else in the country.

[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:51.640]
Well, I wouldn't get one with them.

[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:54.120]
And let's say, to get a good, the patient's Bill O'Rights

[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:58.180]
was passed over his veto in Texas by the Democratic Legislature,

[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:00.000]
and they have more than the votes over wide veto,

[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:00.720]
so we let it go.

[02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:02.560]
We let it go without their signing.

[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:02.980]
Sure.

[02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:05.540]
But why not even have bipartisan votes?

[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:06.820]
Yeah, right.

[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:10.080]
For what I understand, they're putting a fiscal conservative down the

[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.420]
area to put the best panels to either step on crime,

[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:15.020]
the suspicious of any environmental regulations,

[02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:17.100]
or pro-life, during the anti-government.

[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:18.420]
Of course, he's going to get one.

[02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:20.360]
There's a lot of backspap going on down there.

[02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:23.000]
The only thing that separates him is rivalry and distress.

[02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:27.380]
Despite that, though, the twist-by-fire, the article I read,

[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:30.660]
Bush actually tried to do one major thing on his own now,

[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:33.280]
and now it's to change the tax based down there,

[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:36.060]
from property taxes to other forms of taxes.

[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:40.400]
And despite all the backflap and camaraderie,

[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:41.400]
he couldn't get it done.

[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:42.440]
He couldn't get it consensus.

[02:27:42.940 --> 02:27:46.080]
So here he is, a national rally,

[02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:48.180]
and so forth, talking about bipartisanship.

[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:50.160]
Nobody's picking him up on this.

[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:51.900]
Okay, we're listening to a couple more times.

[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:52.720]
Well, there's no one you're done.

[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:54.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:57.180]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless One,

[02:27:57.540 --> 02:28:00.240]
out of town, 8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, 60,

[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:01.000]
345.

[02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:02.320]
Let your voice be heard.

[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:04.300]
I don't even know if any articles that may be

[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:05.540]
let your voice be heard.

[02:28:06.660 --> 02:28:07.800]
That's not pretty, isn't it?

[02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:10.460]
October 26th is the clock is ticking.

[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:11.420]
We're getting really close.

[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:15.760]
So, you know, how can we, you don't talk to a good friend

[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:16.380]
out of Goldstein?

[02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:19.240]
I shouldn't say his name, should I,

[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:21.160]
because he'll be on the guy that I'm bat-lying in a second.

[02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:24.220]
But you should talk to him, because he's good at buddies with Larry.

[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:26.060]
He's trying to start school magazine with Larry,

[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:28.240]
and he would have the inside track.

[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:31.980]
He probably knows Larry's wheelchair number.

[02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:32.920]
I mean, the cell phone number.

[02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:34.000]
Didn't you think?

[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:35.080]
Probably.

[02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:36.900]
Yeah, we ought to have him get in touch.

[02:28:36.900 --> 02:28:38.340]
We can get the scoop on the same thing.

[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:39.260]
For the internal development.

[02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:40.340]
And I will?

[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:40.640]
Yeah.

[02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:41.440]
How do you like that?

[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:46.740]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T

[02:28:46.740 --> 02:28:49.780]
and Verizon Wireless One is the plot tickens, baby.

[02:28:50.020 --> 02:28:50.960]
You can almost smell it.

[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:54.060]
Here's the mobile and call spring, hello?

[02:28:54.860 --> 02:28:55.120]
Hello.

[02:28:55.380 --> 02:28:55.700]
Yes, sir?

[02:28:55.940 --> 02:28:56.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:00.760]
I'd be voting for gold, but one thing scares that guy.

[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:01.760]
What is that, sir?

[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:04.480]
He's been pushing for the past seven years

[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:11.000]
for a federal tax on gasoline, up to $2,50 a gallon.

[02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:14.800]
This kind of, I'm already sent, sit on the road,

[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:18.960]
and I'm already seeing such arches on product

[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:21.340]
for the gasoline increases we've had.

[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:25.260]
And what it amounts to, every ten cents,

[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.780]
of so-charge on a product,

[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:33.000]
it's a twenty-five, it's a retail on the selling price.

[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:36.840]
And if it goes to four hours, I mean, you're looking at a point hour.

[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:38.320]
It's not going to go to four dollars.

[02:29:38.460 --> 02:29:40.160]
First of all, that's not part of his platformer.

[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:42.320]
That was the case, which I never heard that in my life.

[02:29:42.660 --> 02:29:44.840]
But if it was the case, then it's there, I think Congress.

[02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:45.720]
But I'm in a condition.

[02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:46.820]
But let me say it again.

[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:48.360]
He's been a vice president for eight years.

[02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:50.340]
There has been any such proposal while he's been here.

[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:51.840]
It's not part of his campaign now.

[02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:53.780]
In addition to which, it will never pass anyway.

[02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:54.680]
So what's the point?

[02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:56.080]
Well, hopefully it wouldn't.

[02:29:56.380 --> 02:29:57.180]
I'm sorry.

[02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:58.080]
We know I don't like that.

[02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:00.440]
Let me say again, we know that it wouldn't.

[02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:01.540]
Because I don't like Bush.

[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:02.020]
Yeah.

[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:05.680]
About the same token, I don't like seeing this down.

[02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:08.340]
Let me lay your fears and tell you it's not going to happen.

[02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:09.260]
Okay.

[02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:09.740]
Okay.

[02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:10.620]
I'll see you at Annaco.

[02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:11.480]
Okay, calm down.

[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:14.620]
So, a few weeks ago, Bill McCullough and Governor George Pataki

[02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:16.480]
and four others, Vinded, Restraught and Four Lauderdale,

[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:18.140]
they'll pick up the check and thank the server,

[02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:19.740]
her great-mail and the server is the best ever.

[02:30:20.220 --> 02:30:22.180]
When she opened the checkbook, they look at the tips.

[02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:25.480]
She was shocked to see that Bill had left her a 10% tip.

[02:30:26.480 --> 02:30:28.080]
So much for helping the working people.

[02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:30.040]
It goes to show that the Republicans, the rich,

[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:33.120]
keep their money and screwed little guy, 60 cents a day, no way.

[02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:35.200]
Bill Goroz says, T-H and Four Lauderdale.

[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:37.480]
It can take your 60 cents in.

[02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:38.800]
Yeah.

[02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:40.420]
That's what we're saying.

[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:43.860]
That big middle class tax cut, 60 cents a day.

[02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:46.180]
And then, of course, you'd have to be on the lowest end of the scale

[02:30:46.180 --> 02:30:46.640]
in your income.

[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:48.720]
You're going to get a big 11 cents a day.

[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:49.560]
Right.

[02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:54.140]
So, at the end of the week 77 cents, you can buy three quarters of a die coke.

[02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:56.260]
Only we kind of share.

[02:30:57.640 --> 02:31:01.060]
$5.670, $5.50, $5.50 on the AT&T and Verizon.

[02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:03.080]
While we're flying many, many, many open lines,

[02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:05.000]
look at 13 would still be in the floor.

[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:05.740]
That's what we like.

[02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:06.960]
A lot of really dumb.

[02:31:07.060 --> 02:31:08.620]
I mean, a lot of power during the fluidism.

[02:31:09.060 --> 02:31:10.660]
We've out and visit occasionally nine.

[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:12.420]
Move the F out and never look back eight.

[02:31:14.180 --> 02:31:15.480]
Well, we got a long way to go on this one.

[02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:18.020]
Here's the question.

[02:31:18.160 --> 02:31:18.320]
Hello.

[02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:20.540]
Hey, you know, I'm sure, okay?

[02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:25.520]
You know, I've written for a long time and I'm trying to figure out

[02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:27.200]
kind of really where you stand.

[02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:28.860]
Trying to figure out where I stand.

[02:31:29.060 --> 02:31:30.380]
Which words didn't you understand?

[02:31:30.580 --> 02:31:31.900]
Have you had a little meeting mouth about this?

[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:33.840]
No, not really, really, not.

[02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:36.560]
So, you're a big advocate of saying, you know,

[02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:38.780]
how does it really affect your life and stuff like that?

[02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:41.780]
And then I hear you calling people like speedy-suggers and stuff like that.

[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:44.960]
Now, I'm a lifelong Republican, but I'm not going to vote this year.

[02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:50.120]
The reason I'm not going to vote is I think full parties have kind of lost sight

[02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:51.600]
of everything that's going on.

[02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:54.240]
Have I heard you say before that you like Mario Cuomo?

[02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:55.400]
Now, I love Mario Cuomo.

[02:31:55.960 --> 02:31:59.120]
Okay, Mario Cuomo about four years ago said that, you know,

[02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:01.500]
back in that election, Dan Quail had it right.

[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:06.440]
And he said that, you know, what really counts is family values

[02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:08.160]
and personal responsibility.

[02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:08.820]
Yeah.

[02:32:09.660 --> 02:32:11.200]
And this country...

[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:13.720]
Let me ask you, is Mario Cuomo a fetish, sugar?

[02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:17.640]
No, but you're not...

[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:19.540]
You know, if I understand what you're saying, they know it.

[02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:20.280]
And I'm not saying that.

[02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:21.560]
I'm a lifelong Republican.

[02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:25.700]
I'm not a fetish, I just believe in the woman I could choose.

[02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:29.460]
The reason I'm a Republican is because I believe that, you know,

[02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:32.800]
big business runs this country better than the left.

[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:33.800]
Yes, sir.

[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:35.620]
I honestly do.

[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:38.180]
So, in some other words, it's like a Robin Hood and these birds

[02:32:38.180 --> 02:32:39.520]
take from the point of the rich.

[02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:40.320]
No, no.

[02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:41.100]
Yeah, I don't know.

[02:32:41.440 --> 02:32:41.800]
Yes, yes.

[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:43.880]
Well, okay, well, you're saying yes, yes.

[02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:46.060]
So, the Republican public, at least you admit that Republican party

[02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:46.960]
is a part of a good business.

[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.480]
Let's let that honest, that can be meant for that.

[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:52.660]
Okay, and as I said, if I believe that the best of Republicans

[02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:56.100]
think about what this George Bush, I am obviously not voting this year.

[02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:56.340]
Right.

[02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:59.780]
And you know, something, if they've worked for the Supreme Court appointments,

[02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:00.600]
I wouldn't vote either.

[02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:01.260]
I really said that.

[02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:02.540]
And I wasn't ever...

[02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:03.580]
Can I follow up on that point?

[02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:04.060]
Yes, sir.

[02:33:04.580 --> 02:33:07.000]
When you say that, what exactly do you mean?

[02:33:07.240 --> 02:33:08.420]
What do you honestly vote for?

[02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:11.100]
Well, how about over versus way to push if there's going to be...

[02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:14.440]
Okay, then again, then again, it was a right back to what you originally say.

[02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:16.100]
How does it affect more Rogers?

[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:19.080]
So, in other words, I'm only interested in fam.

[02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:20.480]
That's something that I don't know about.

[02:33:20.660 --> 02:33:22.460]
I think that I said, me, I can't say one thing.

[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:25.320]
Sir, and the next, the kind of society that I live in,

[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:27.620]
it affects our freedoms for all of us, okay?

[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:27.980]
Okay.

[02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:31.520]
I just think it away the rights from one group, then that's what happened in Germany.

[02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:34.580]
Once they say, I take it away the rights from one, then they take away from everybody.

[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:35.920]
I totally understand.

[02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:38.840]
I've heard you said this country is about death, and you don't...

[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:39.280]
And it is.

[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:40.460]
That is absolutely...

[02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:41.500]
I didn't say that.

[02:33:41.660 --> 02:33:43.240]
I didn't agree with the preparation of guns.

[02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:44.780]
That's what I think is barbaric.

[02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:45.580]
Okay, well, it's in Germany.

[02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:46.480]
Can I...

[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:47.200]
One point on the other?

[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:47.860]
I was in, yes.

[02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:48.080]
Can I?

[02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:48.780]
Okay.

[02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:55.240]
Do you believe that honestly, if the Republican is voted in,

[02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:58.260]
that the NRA is going to have it total way with this country?

[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:00.540]
They're going to have...

[02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:02.520]
They don't need it anymore.

[02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:03.260]
All right, back to it.

[02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:04.400]
Let me say it again.

[02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:08.020]
They don't need their million dollars last month to the Bush campaign, okay?

[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:10.580]
They're given with all four hands, they're given...

[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:11.540]
They try to get him in there.

[02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:15.060]
And when a guy said that they were going to have an office right there inside the right house,

[02:34:15.220 --> 02:34:17.660]
he may have been only figuratively speaking, but pretty damn close.

[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:19.240]
Like maybe a half-lock down the street.

[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:22.840]
The Neil Rogers Show, the fourth radio,

[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:25.680]
Five-sixties, few-hands.

[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:27.040]
And of course, some pops.

[02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:30.320]
So, you're the best.

[02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:35.360]
I want to make a good life.

[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:40.380]
I want to make a good life.

[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:43.800]
I want to make a good life.

[02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:48.020]
I want to make a good life.

[02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:51.560]
I want to make a good life.

[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:51.560]

[02:34:53.060 --> 02:34:57.020]
I want to make a good life.

[02:34:57.020 --> 02:35:06.360]
Because I went through the time during the time that the whole city could be cut out

[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:16.800]
From the endless terrain Alright?

[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:16.800]

[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:26.900]
Okay.

[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:34.960]
Oh, yeah.

[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:37.800]
132.560 W2M and of course, mature chest.

[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:41.060]
It ain't like stockbroker or extorting there who wouldn't know a good stock of the bit

[02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:41.200]
of money.

[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:45.500]
He says, all I think would reach bottom when I was discussing my new strategy that I designed

[02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:45.920]
myself.

[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.080]
I think it was a good idea and I said, no, we haven't.

[02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:49.260]
Wow.

[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:49.600]
Okay.

[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:50.120]
It's your call.

[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:51.980]
And of course, have we hit bottom yet?

[02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:52.620]
No.

[02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:52.800]
No.

[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:53.300]
5.9.

[02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:57.420]
There's 127 drop in like a lot and that was down 35 and drop in like a lot.

[02:35:58.100 --> 02:35:59.120]
You haven't seen nothing yet.

[02:35:59.520 --> 02:35:59.700]
Okay.

[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:03.100]
We've got 600 other lines between now and two which I have no idea what we're having a great

[02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:04.300]
intellectual discussion here today.

[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:05.800]
Can you teach you about our lives?

[02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:08.320]
So it really kills me about some of these people.

[02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:10.960]
They act like it's so hard to understand what I'm saying.

[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:15.480]
Well, I just don't get it about, yeah.

[02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:18.360]
I couldn't possibly be any more clear.

[02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:19.360]
Crystal clear.

[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:25.280]
5.670560, 0560 on the 183 and Verizon wireless line.

[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:26.960]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:27.220]
Hello.

[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:28.840]
Hello.

[02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:29.620]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:30.180]
Hi.

[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:30.680]
Hi.

[02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:33.640]
This is the first time I get a chance to call.

[02:36:33.860 --> 02:36:34.900]
It's a week I'm trying before.

[02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:39.640]
I'm getting a busy and I just, as work and I'm so happy I can get through this.

[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:40.560]
It's a lucky day.

[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:45.560]
You know, as a woman, I am a part of that.

[02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:51.160]
There are women out there that I have been in contact with regarding the vote between

[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:52.420]
Bush and Nalbor.

[02:36:53.180 --> 02:36:59.860]
And that they do not realize that this man can take away our rights to choose.

[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:03.800]
And I had a personal experience years ago when I was very young.

[02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:04.980]
I was maybe 17.

[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:10.900]
I was very fortunate that there was a state in this country that was up there in New York.

[02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:14.060]
The city was actually good going to have an abortion.

[02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:18.560]
And my life would have been totally different than what it actually turned out to be.

[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:20.200]
Had I not had that choice.

[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:29.000]
And although I'm not thinking of having any children at this point in my life, I feel a sense of responsibility to other women.

[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:30.980]
I'm younger women that...

[02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:35.100]
But I said the other day, how about all these married women who claim that they're for Bush.

[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:35.820]
How about their daughters?

[02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:38.420]
Don't they care about their daughters and about their rights to make their own choices?

[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:40.740]
Yes, I was just exactly one thing.

[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:41.380]
I was...

[02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:41.740]
And they have daughters.

[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.840]
They have nieces.

[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:58.440]
Even in where the other reasons, the men themselves don't realize the implications that if a woman gets pregnant, they're involved for the next 18 years of child support.

[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.340]
So it's not just a woman's issue.

[02:38:00.460 --> 02:38:04.240]
I mean, the woman's one that gets pregnant, but it takes two to make that happen.

[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:12.640]
So, you know, the men are concerned with financial issues and we're looking at that Bush wishes issues in the field.

[02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:14.320]
Don't forget they love their guns. Don't forget that.

[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:16.000]
Of course they love their guns.

[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:22.440]
But one of the things that they don't realize is that if a woman does not have a right to choose to have an abortion,

[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:26.620]
then they are actually going to also be affected with this decision.

[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.460]
So the next 18 to 20 years are their lives.

[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:29.620]
Right.

[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:39.240]
Simply because they're also responsible with all the tests nowadays, that there's DNA testing, there's a certain key as to who the father is, there's no question about it.

[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:41.200]
So it does affect the men.

[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:42.820]
It is another another one getting pregnant.

[02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:46.720]
And I'm surprised to see as many men that not support the decision.

[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:54.840]
I'm really surprised. The other thing is I'm embarrassed if Bush got the ability to become president.

[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:56.420]
Women is wise of guns.

[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:01.260]
She didn't even speak. I mean, they had an interview with Father Roberts. She's my true words.

[02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:05.300]
I have no idea what this woman does. I have no idea what this woman does.

[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:05.560]
I have no idea what this woman does.

[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:06.880]
Judge, I skipped it when the kitchen was open.

[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:11.900]
That's exactly right. So what kind of representation of we women going to have in the White House?

[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:24.100]
And some of the other women are Jacqueline Kennedy, who name another, who has brought issues and inhibitor, has been involved in so many different issues.

[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:26.900]
Not all good ones, but nevertheless Alicia here.

[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:27.980]
Got to bring bigger than a piece.

[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:29.520]
Well listen, vote early and often, sweetheart.

[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:30.560]
Yep, I so will.

[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:30.920]
Thanks.

[02:39:31.440 --> 02:39:35.560]
Here is an excellent fact, which I forgot about this in the midst of all this stock market stuff.

[02:39:36.660 --> 02:39:39.320]
Yes, yesterday, who they were pouring had record profits.

[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:45.600]
Remember, I was the one that told you weeks ago that we're talking about they wanted to maximize their profits by the end of the year, their balance shoots.

[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:50.240]
You see, I'm going to tell you George W. and all your friends at the oil companies.

[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:56.700]
Maybe your full of dummies are there, like they got it before, we're talking about the $2.5 tax on gas, which is a figment of his imagination.

[02:39:56.980 --> 02:39:57.600]
Isn't going to happen.

[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:06.420]
But all this business about the Arabs and about OPEC and about their cellpeck lines with direct on, by the way, Ted Debraquite used my material on CMBC.

[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:08.000]
He's down here in Volker, he knows.

[02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:09.440]
Tech Dreck.

[02:40:09.680 --> 02:40:10.220]
Nice going Ted.

[02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:11.020]
Good Jewish book.

[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:12.100]
Oh, a piece of his name.

[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:22.420]
But anyway, here's the fact that there's why he has no one picked up on the published fact that all oil companies have just had record profits as a result of increased oil prices.

[02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:28.040]
As per the Wall Street Journal and some similar deepened bushes pocket and what will happen in the next four years.

[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:33.680]
Not to mention, of course, the pollution that they're spewing all over Texas, especially Houston, where you can't even walk outside half the time.

[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:36.540]
How do you like their apples?

[02:40:37.100 --> 02:40:39.240]
Record profits, it's all its hits.

[02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:41.260]
It's all BS.

[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:44.160]
They're just draining the money out of your pockets through oil companies.

[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:47.860]
Because if it really was the cost of oil, they wouldn't be having record profits.

[02:40:47.860 --> 02:40:53.820]
They don't give a fine f about you people or about me or anybody else except their profits, the bottom freaking line.

[02:40:54.340 --> 02:41:00.020]
So if you've got very stock in Mexico and Shell and Royal Dutch and all these other ones, go right ahead.

[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:03.000]
Vote with both hands for George W.

[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:15.200]
But if you want those people, let's get in second, Ted, I pay almost two bucks for down the gas and get more than every minute and wondering how come, how come, you know, the price of the poor bill, but from 30 floors to almost 37 one day, then it was 35.

[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:16.440]
Then we'll find them with down to 32.

[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:18.420]
Did the price of gas go down?

[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:19.000]
No, no.

[02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:24.520]
And I'll say it again, these are one of the biggest contributors to George W.

[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:30.600]
Number one, the tobacco companies, number three, NRA, number four, the pharmaceuticals, and number five, the oil companies.

[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.260]
Oh, yeah, but we're afraid that it grows in the pocket of the room's Chinese.

[02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:44.140]
22, ever trowelons, I like the good chinks every now and then, especially remember coast.

[02:41:45.620 --> 02:41:48.340]
22, 4, 2, 5, 60, WQM, the drought.

[02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:51.840]
Come on, America.

[02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:56.080]
Time to grow up and step outside the global.

[02:41:56.080 --> 02:42:00.100]
Celebrate the Papua secret and bring out the data.

[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:02.220]
No, bring out the data.

[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:04.160]
No, bring out the data.

[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:08.300]
Celebrate the Papua secret and bring out the data.

[02:42:08.420 --> 02:42:11.380]
No, from the old age of human death.

[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:15.200]
Christians, preachers and all the religious writers, you're not born anymore.

[02:42:15.940 --> 02:42:17.560]
It's in the papers of the group, Ted.

[02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:20.080]
They why not catch up with the rest of the world?

[02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:23.280]
Inzoia disciples the truth to say, you're insane.

[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:26.340]
Next time you want to reach out for goodness.

[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:29.320]
Reach for a hand, more than that.

[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:32.880]
Celebrate the Papua secret and bring out the data.

[02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:34.980]
No, bring out the data.

[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:36.980]
Bring out the data.

[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:41.160]
Celebrate the Papua secret and bring out the data.

[02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:44.200]
Tell your disciples that you're dead.

[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:50.140]
On highball on soccer with Chris Matthews, in his industry, in his 31st in thousand W. says,

[02:42:50.140 --> 02:42:53.040]
Actually, I, this may sound a little less text to you, but I like it.

[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:56.540]
What I'm talking about, when I'm talking about myself and when he's talking about myself,

[02:42:56.740 --> 02:42:58.060]
All of us are talking about me.

[02:42:59.380 --> 02:43:02.360]
In the word of the word, you may say, it's clearly a budget.

[02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:04.020]
It's got a lot of numbers in it.

[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:07.320]
On his many words, John the came and the Dallas Morning News made 10th of this year.

[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:08.500]
He says, I think we agree.

[02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:09.560]
The past is over.

[02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:12.680]
And on the press April 15th of this year, he says,

[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:17.480]
I really don't realize how bright our children is sometime until we get an objective analysis.

[02:43:19.480 --> 02:43:21.380]
As in, is our children learning?

[02:43:21.700 --> 02:43:22.540]
Let me read that one again.

[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:27.860]
I really don't realize how bright our children is sometime until we get an objective analysis.

[02:43:28.660 --> 02:43:29.420]
How do you like that?

[02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:32.580]
The next leader of the free world.

[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:33.340]
I'm sorry.

[02:43:34.820 --> 02:43:38.360]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless.

[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:40.020]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:40.340]
Hello.

[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:41.140]
Hello, Neil.

[02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:41.880]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:42.540]
Hi, man.

[02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:43.220]
I am kids.

[02:43:44.660 --> 02:43:45.480]
I am really kids.

[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:46.140]
Are you kids?

[02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:47.040]
Yes, I am.

[02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:48.460]
First of all, I have a few kids.

[02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:54.460]
First of all, when you're Logan, get the hell out.

[02:43:54.740 --> 02:43:55.480]
Yeah, when you're down front.

[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:00.200]
A long time ago, when you were Republican, they were talking about when he stuck his head up

[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:01.580]
Jeff Bush's ass that we're in the head.

[02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:02.980]
Take your boots off.

[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:03.940]
Take your legs off.

[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:05.880]
And your head is just burnt out of here.

[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:15.020]
Secondly, our one has to do people, Democrats, Republicans, NATO, I, Jeff Ketter, back up.

[02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:16.900]
Our one has to do.

[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:23.400]
This liquidness economy and this country today, compared to when Papa Bush was enough.

[02:44:23.620 --> 02:44:23.780]
Right.

[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:25.440]
As I'm here to do, amen.

[02:44:25.700 --> 02:44:27.920]
We call this a little party of city needs, right?

[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:37.740]
Anthony, to the moonwalk, and a thick and a little rocket, and clothing, Haranakiza.

[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.080]
Oh, you mean coming to all of this is baby, home run.

[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:48.240]
560 out of 560, pound 560 on the AT&T, and Verizon wireless line.

[02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:51.080]
Here's the fair water deal.

[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:51.320]
Hello.

[02:44:51.620 --> 02:44:52.140]
How are you doing?

[02:44:53.180 --> 02:44:59.140]
I'm basically a Goro supporter, but this bush tax cut about 6 out of the day.

[02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:04.260]
It actually, I think average is about 100 years.

[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:09.600]
And I guess that I am a Goro supporter, but I don't think that's so that that plan should be passed,

[02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:12.300]
because anybody can use a hundred dollars a year, you know.

[02:45:13.940 --> 02:45:15.940]
I don't think that Goro's plan is anything like that.

[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:17.640]
Yeah.

[02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:20.860]
You know, so I don't know why he has to be passed, but I'll talk to you later.

[02:45:21.020 --> 02:45:21.560]
Okay, boy.

[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:27.900]
I just had to see where the hell that was going to end.

[02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:29.220]
Look somebody walked in on it.

[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:30.440]
Yeah.

[02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:31.480]
Put it away, pal.

[02:45:32.220 --> 02:45:33.240]
I reckon you see it anyway.

[02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:34.900]
I can relate.

[02:45:35.140 --> 02:45:39.780]
560, 7.05, 60, pound 560 on the AT&T, and Verizon wireless line.

[02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:40.860]
Out of town is open.

[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:44.360]
We'll wait until I know sooner and later on in those great intellectuals from like over there on the West Coast.

[02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:49.460]
877, 785, 6345.

[02:45:50.700 --> 02:45:55.020]
I like when you drive over on alligator alley, and there are signs about the Panther Habitat,

[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:58.260]
and then you get kind of closer to the West Coast like Fort Myers and Naples.

[02:45:58.660 --> 02:46:01.620]
There's a sign that says, the arrow says, Intelligent Life Habitat.

[02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:03.740]
You're in a very small area there.

[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:06.440]
Here's Fort Notre Dame, hello.

[02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:07.240]
Hi, Neil.

[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:07.760]
Yes sir.

[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:10.240]
Listen, I want you to explain something.

[02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:14.940]
You always ask why George Bush is so close to the polls, or he can't understand why he's...

[02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:15.780]
No, I don't understand.

[02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:16.940]
All right, let me...

[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:20.240]
For the wife of me, I know there's a lot of stupid people, but he's terrifying.

[02:46:20.340 --> 02:46:21.140]
Let me...

[02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:22.000]
61...

[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:26.640]
This may be a reason, but there were talks about this on CNN last weekend.

[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:30.240]
61 million Americans had their money in neutral funds.

[02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:30.660]
Yeah.

[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:39.140]
And when Al Gore talks about drug companies, insurance companies, oil companies, single-act companies, chemical companies, HMOs,

[02:46:39.140 --> 02:46:44.600]
many people, but they're about the technology sector, looking at mutual funds, and see they have a balance.

[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:45.140]
No, they don't.

[02:46:45.820 --> 02:46:46.440]
They don't.

[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:47.320]
No, they don't.

[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:48.280]
They're actually wrong.

[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:53.960]
There are one percent of people in this country, including yours truly, who know the stocks in their mutual funds.

[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:56.600]
Oh, every mutual fund has got 100,000 stocks.

[02:46:56.720 --> 02:46:58.460]
No, no, they send a pamphlet.

[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:00.780]
Every month, let's miss your program.

[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:02.720]
They send a big, sending it in the country.

[02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:05.380]
You know where it goes here, right in the old Chicago.

[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:06.260]
No, no, no.

[02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:06.560]
No, no, no.

[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:07.240]
You can't look at it.

[02:47:07.380 --> 02:47:08.420]
Let me say it again.

[02:47:08.620 --> 02:47:09.240]
Nobody pays.

[02:47:09.340 --> 02:47:10.060]
I will arrange it.

[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:13.060]
And there are hundreds of names on each one of those funds.

[02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:17.260]
The average person, first of all, if you have a good magnifying glass, you might be able to read it.

[02:47:17.380 --> 02:47:18.720]
I get those things every day.

[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:20.200]
I throw them right into the fire.

[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:22.640]
I try to explain.

[02:47:23.020 --> 02:47:26.120]
Well, you're trying to make up a reason, and it's not valid, because that's not a reason.

[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:26.880]
That's what they said.

[02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:28.600]
I don't tell what they said on CNN.

[02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:30.540]
They could tell me it was four o'clock in the morning right now.

[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:31.900]
I'd still tell you it's still going to happen.

[02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:35.060]
That's what they said on it.

[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:36.400]
You know you reminded me of my mother.

[02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:39.420]
Now, I read, read, and where?

[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:41.300]
Yes, she's always telling me she read somewhere.

[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:46.020]
When she tells you she read somewhere, it's either in readers' digest, durand, or landlanders.

[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:48.760]
Because that pretty much covers her eye tinnuary, okay?

[02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:51.040]
She read somewhere.

[02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:55.080]
My dogs had ear infections for six years, because all dogs down here, most of them,

[02:47:55.140 --> 02:47:57.740]
were big ears, have ear infections because of the climate, the allergies, and so on.

[02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:59.080]
And I talk about it a million times.

[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:00.920]
And usually, yeah, it's just a battle.

[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:02.080]
They're never ending battles.

[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:03.780]
And I think it's older.

[02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:04.480]
It's 12 years old.

[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:06.680]
My girlfriend is getting deafer and deafer and deafer.

[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:07.440]
And you know something?

[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:09.340]
Old dogs just like old people, they get deaf.

[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:11.180]
One has got nothing to do with the other.

[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:13.160]
Although it may have hurt it a long.

[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:17.520]
But she calls me a few days ago to tell me that she read somewhere that with dogs,

[02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:19.800]
their infections in their ears, they can go into their brain.

[02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:24.000]
And I better shut them to the vet again, because it might go into her and she's worried sick about it.

[02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:27.700]
That's what you remind me of, sir.

[02:48:28.140 --> 02:48:28.960]
You heard her on CNN.

[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:30.320]
Therefore, it must be true.

[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:32.280]
I once read in the weekly reader.

[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:35.560]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:48:36.100 --> 02:48:37.940]
I once read Mad Magazine, fill in the blank.

[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:39.320]
I like it.

[02:48:40.380 --> 02:48:40.660]
Oh.

[02:48:42.380 --> 02:48:44.960]
In fact, I could tell you I once read that,

[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.560]
the prospectus you're talking about, that breakdown on my mutual funds,

[02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:50.940]
with all the stocks in there, but I'd be lying because I never read it.

[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:55.480]
They all go straight into the circular file.

[02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:57.480]
I read one words.

[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:00.740]
In addition to which, if you would take a separate poll and ask them,

[02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:03.600]
if they do take polls on the issues, is that ever been an issue?

[02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:05.980]
Oh, only the ultra rich and the very rich.

[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:07.200]
Care about those things.

[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:09.720]
That's correct.

[02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:11.220]
Ooh, real Coca-Cola.

[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:12.280]
Yeah, right.

[02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:13.020]
All right, Coca-Cola.

[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:13.700]
Yeah, Coke.

[02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:15.100]
That's what they want in there.

[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:16.280]
You can relate to it.

[02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:20.040]
The Neil Roger Show Sports Radio.

[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:20.940]
560.

[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:22.400]
Q.A.

[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:23.020]
And...

[02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:25.120]
This man there, try to f**king them out!

[02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:28.100]
Oh!

[02:49:28.100 --> 02:49:28.100]

[02:49:28.100 --> 02:49:28.100]

[02:49:28.100 --> 02:49:28.100]

[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:28.200]

[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:28.200]

[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:28.200]

[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:30.640]
Oh!

[02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:32.080]
Oh!

[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:38.540]
They got rid of the candy and the adults.

[02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:39.980]
Stop it, you dumbass.

[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:41.560]
Try it.

[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:41.740]
Yeah.

[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:43.660]
So they thought they'd go a new way.

[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:44.940]
Hello, boomer.

[02:49:45.300 --> 02:49:45.940]
Well, no.

[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:46.840]
You saw.

[02:49:47.220 --> 02:49:48.780]
We had to tap and burst them off.

[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:50.900]
Let's just say it could tell that you've got.

[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:52.680]
Yeah.

[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:54.480]
They wanted a comedy.

[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:57.040]
The cutest we can't miss.

[02:49:57.620 --> 02:49:57.820]
Yes.

[02:49:58.240 --> 02:49:59.740]
I think there was no sun.

[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:00.780]
The...

[02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:01.600]
So stop it.

[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:04.780]
Now, it's male's moment.

[02:50:05.380 --> 02:50:05.700]
Munch.

[02:50:06.020 --> 02:50:06.140]
Yeah.

[02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:07.480]
Not for the fall.

[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:08.600]
Yeah, not.

[02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:09.980]
Yeah, not.

[02:50:10.940 --> 02:50:11.260]
Yeah.

[02:50:11.700 --> 02:50:12.260]
Unstoppable.

[02:50:13.060 --> 02:50:13.800]
Yeah, not.

[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:15.080]
Yeah, not.

[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:15.640]

[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:17.420]
On most of the book.

[02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:19.680]
Yeah, the waiting's you're down 7% from under that football.

[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:20.040]
Oh!

[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:21.320]
They're in the tank, baby.

[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:22.140]
They're stuck in wind.

[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:23.320]
Nobody's watching the world.

[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:24.640]
Here is the waiting's their way down.

[02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:26.420]
And then in the football's down some percent.

[02:50:26.520 --> 02:50:27.740]
Because they put that moar on on there.

[02:50:28.640 --> 02:50:29.960]
Michaels and Dan Budorff.

[02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:30.780]
That would have been the combination.

[02:50:30.900 --> 02:50:31.880]
It doesn't take three guys.

[02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:32.680]
People football game.

[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:33.680]
I hate to make a lose to you.

[02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:35.940]
It doesn't take three to handle or even to the opera.

[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:38.560]
But don't tell that to the experts at ABC.

[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:40.920]
As the waiting's continued dropping into oblivion.

[02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:42.740]
Here's Pablo B.

[02:50:42.860 --> 02:50:43.020]
Hello.

[02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:43.680]
Hi.

[02:50:44.060 --> 02:50:44.400]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:48.100]
A bottle of three questions on the spring court selection.

[02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:51.020]
Also, a light-wiring mad hero audience.

[02:50:51.340 --> 02:50:54.760]
Let the president also selects a trial court judges.

[02:50:55.460 --> 02:50:59.220]
And that would mean that in case Humpty Dumpty or you say,

[02:50:59.340 --> 02:51:03.320]
Howdy-Duty, of the Senate seat, it would be his recommendations

[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:06.220]
that the Republican president has.

[02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:06.480]
Oh!

[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:08.380]
Yes, also.

[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:14.820]
Not only just the role versus weight, but within my lifetime,

[02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:19.140]
I don't memory the thing, the one man or one person,

[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:22.100]
one vote, the concept could be reversed.

[02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:22.500]

[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:24.420]
And the player in public schools.

[02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:26.800]
And as religious fanatics will they're put back in the door

[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:28.040]
and they're in public places they can?

[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:28.600]
Yes.

[02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:34.160]
And the whole cycle gets the whole idea of the segregation of schools

[02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:36.820]
would be reinstituted too.

[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:37.820]
Absolutely correct.

[02:51:38.200 --> 02:51:43.020]
Well, just thought I'd remind people that maybe have accepted these things

[02:51:43.020 --> 02:51:47.000]
and even only crazy people, no matter what one was right to choose,

[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:50.640]
have not accepted that as part of life.

[02:51:51.220 --> 02:51:53.020]
These other things could also be...

[02:51:53.820 --> 02:51:54.940]
Well, sir, thanks a lot, pal.

[02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:55.300]
Thank you.

[02:51:55.740 --> 02:51:56.280]
Okay, thank you.

[02:51:56.700 --> 02:51:57.840]
It says you're absolutely correct.

[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.980]
Maybe the top 10-20 holdings won't change or a mutual fund position

[02:52:00.980 --> 02:52:01.860]
changed by the minute.

[02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:04.300]
Only once a quarter when they change their holdings

[02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:06.800]
will you know their position, which might be hold only momentarily.

[02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:10.100]
And that publish report usually shows holdings that reflect their objectives for investing.

[02:52:10.100 --> 02:52:11.900]
Yeah, they're changing like every second.

[02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:13.220]
They're in, they're out, they're out, they're down.

[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:15.200]
So it's meaningless.

[02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:17.060]
Absolutely meaningless.

[02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:20.980]
And the idea that Jo and Sally Smith, somewhere in middle America,

[02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:24.560]
are sitting there looking at this prospectus for the mutual fund

[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:25.540]
that's showing the breakdown.

[02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:29.380]
They've got so many such percentage I've felt more than forget about it.

[02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:32.080]
They may have somebody there to read it to them.

[02:52:33.560 --> 02:52:34.440]
Here's Key to the Scane.

[02:52:34.580 --> 02:52:34.740]
Hello?

[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:35.820]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:35.940 --> 02:52:36.760]
I want to make this quick.

[02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:41.540]
I just sort of started subscribing to this economist magazine called the Red Hearing.

[02:52:41.940 --> 02:52:41.940]

[02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:44.200]
And it seems to be a pleasure.

[02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:45.460]
Is it kosher?

[02:52:45.460 --> 02:52:45.560]
Is it kosher?

[02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:47.020]
I think it is.

[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:48.440]
But it's used right for it.

[02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:48.780]
All right.

[02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:50.940]
Anyway, this one article is very interesting.

[02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:55.020]
It took the average annual percentage increase to the Dow Jones and Justrial.
