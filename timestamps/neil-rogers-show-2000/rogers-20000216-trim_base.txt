[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]
We reflect those of the QAM easily read acquisitions or the recent broadcast group.

[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.940]
Now, Neil Rogers, a sports radio 560 QAM.

[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:10.980]
We need some help.

[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.700]
We need some help.

[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.540]
Here's our business.

[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.420]
Oh, that's fine.

[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.840]
I know that.

[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.440]
That I did rather do it to this.

[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.040]
Now, if the guys are said to be picked up for way to prove a food I can.

[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.680]
Now, if they picked up the Johnny and the Trisky,

[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.740]
they're not allowed to do something I see.

[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.940]
I got a 10-a-litre chair as your.

[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.020]
Oh, baby.

[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.080]
Oh, right.

[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.800]
Open it for not a spending chair as a sheet of grease and grease.

[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.600]
Oh, baby.

[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.640]
Johnny's in a spending in the desert for a sheet.

[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.260]
Hey, baby.

[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.080]
Check it out for not to talk about Tuesday afternoon.

[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.080]
I bet that it's so free I can't tell you from it.

[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.680]
Hello.

[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.000]
I'm sorry, but I'm so too far from there.

[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.820]
The window's too straight.

[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.840]
The jet-lagged box keeps holding the key.

[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.980]
I might care if I'm actually.

[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.860]
This earth is dancing out.

[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.740]
So I'm not going to throw it.

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.320]
The Christmas day is super cowardly.

[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.880]
A little positive stop to keep his foot down,

[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.820]
giving him around the tricks of praise.

[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.080]
The 1970s, I don't know,

[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.260]
Carol D. Durr,

[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.980]
she told me to find out if my baby Carol liked it.

[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.540]
Oh, baby.

[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.040]
It's a lovely theory of intensity.

[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.900]
You can prove it.

[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.260]
Oh, baby.

[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.120]
Open the credit of being a gerund machine.

[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.700]
Don't want to put your smile on the back this morning.

[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.300]
Why not?

[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.420]
Who's better?

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.000]
Beach boys or the guest who?

[00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.980]
The guest said, oh, thank God.

[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.240]
Thank God we got off to a good start this morning.

[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.720]
We're in agreement on that.

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.540]
Bad news, by the way.

[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.720]
I hate to start with a sour note.

[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.340]
Some dead people.

[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.000]
Going around to bitch.

[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.700]
God works in the serious ways.

[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.960]
Every now and then he reaches out with that ugly finger.

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.520]
And I wish he trimmed those nails by the way.

[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.580]
People are starting to talk.

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.020]
Reach is now what I imagine.

[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.700]
I'm tap people on the shoulder.

[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.400]
It says it's your time, baby.

[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.200]
Peter trip.

[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.460]
Does anybody in this audience remember Peter trip?

[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.700]
No.

[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.980]
Any of you New Yorkers out there?

[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.220]
No.

[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.740]
Come on.

[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.540]
Peter trip the curly headed kid in the third row and WMGM.

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.860]
No.

[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.800]
He's dead.

[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.520]
Peter trip DJ Guildian Peola scandal.

[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.680]
Peter trip a popular distockey in New York in late 1950s.

[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.500]
He's a career peak when he stayed awake for more than eight days as a stunt.

[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.480]
But later plunged when he was convicted of accepting thousands of dollars in Peola has died in North Ridge, California.

[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480]
He was 73.

[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.820]
Trip's career was indelibly tarnished by the 1960 Peola scandal, which the better known Alan freed.

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.300]
And several other distockeys and radio station employees were indicted on charges of accepting money for record companies in exchange for playing their records.

[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.060]
He back in those days they'd give money instead of like coke.

[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.520]
Yeah.

[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.580]
Trip attracted just as much national attention though for his sleepless promotion gimmick for WMGM in 1959.

[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.400]
He spent 201 hours in ten minutes awake much of it sitting in a glass booth in time square, spinning records and battering it with microphone three hours a day.

[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.460]
When trip began to fall asleep nurses shook him doctors joke with him played games with them and gave him tests to take.

[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:41.860]
After a few days he began to hallucinate seeing cobwebs, mice, kittens looking through drawers for money that wasn't there and sitting there to take mission to drop the hot electrode into his shoe.

[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.220]
It felt like an electrode he said.

[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.900]
Trip was indicted a few weeks after he was done on a charge that he accepted $36,000 in Peola, which back in those days by the way was a nice piece of change.

[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.940]
He was found guilty of commercial bribe, refined $500, given a six month suspended a sentence.

[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.400]
Suspended a sentence.

[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.220]
Trip left WMGM all but penniless as a lawyer said and bounced around the radio business.

[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.300]
Sounds like Johnny dark to me you know what?

[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.260]
Another one of those radio bounce around kind of did beat guys.

[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.680]
Trip left WMGM all but penniless as lawyer said and bounced around the radio business as a journeyman disc jockey taking spots at KYA in San Francisco.

[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.600]
KGFJ in Los Angeles and WOHO in Toledo, Ohio.

[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.560]
WOHO in Toledo.

[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.240]
Trip who spent his last years in West Hills, California was married and divorced four times.

[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.920]
He has survived by two sons and two daughters.

[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.800]
He's dead.

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.280]
Is there anybody in this audience who remembers?

[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.720]
No.

[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.140]
No.

[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.880]
Killed a couple of minutes with that though.

[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.040]
And even worse.

[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.620]
And it's interesting he gets a bigger orbit here.

[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.820]
I guess because they figure there's more than New Yorkers here.

[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.800]
That must be the reason.

[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.660]
He gets a bigger orbit in the paper than the pop singer Oliver.

[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.000]
Oh my god.

[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.340]
Boy!

[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.160]
Only 54 had two hits in the 60s and guess what boys and girls he's dead.

[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.660]
God damn it.

[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.280]
Of course a lot of people when they heard those songs they thought he deserved to be dead even back then.

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.240]
Treeport Louisiana, William Oliver Swolford.

[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.260]
SWOFFORD.

[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.300]
A singer who under the stage name Oliver had 1960s hits with a song.

[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.500]
That much of this more people in this audience remember Oliver than Peter Trip.

[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.620]
Yeah.

[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.300]
No question.

[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.200]
Even you remember Oliver.

[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.620]
Sure.

[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.360]
Peter Trip?

[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.700]
No.

[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.320]
Anyway, head to 1966.

[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.600]
This song's Good Morning Star Shine and Jean Jean Amorbit song.

[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.980]
Yeah.

[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.780]
Good Morning Star Shine with like you know upbeat, like real bubble gummy but it was okay.

[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.380]
Like one of those bright flower power.

[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.860]
One of those really baked.

[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.480]
One of those things you'll see on TV all the time in these little infomercial things were to song the hits of the 60s and the 70s.

[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.640]
Flower power music.

[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.220]
It'll be on there.

[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.340]
We don't have it here unfortunately.

[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.720]
Good Morning Star Shine.

[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.200]
That was okay.

[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.140]
But Jean was kind of like Maudelyn.

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.180]
Jean Jean.

[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.880]
Anyway, he's died of cancer.

[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.840]
It was only 54.

[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.620]
In 1969, Swolford's recording of Star Shine from the Broadway musical Here climbs number three on a pop charts.

[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.900]
And the ballad Jean reached number two.

[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.580]
He turned throughout the 1970s.

[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.560]
Then left the music business in the 1980s and worked in the home construction and pharmaceutical industries.

[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.740]
Home construction.

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.420]
He was a carpenter.

[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.160]
If I were a carpenter, you'd be dead like heron in the Oliver.

[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.940]
Swolford's wife Becky said the last time she...

[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.380]
I mean, these stories there are there are no happy endings with people in show business like Peter trip.

[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.480]
He would left WMGM all but penniless.

[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.100]
And here's pop singer Oliver who wanted to be like a carpenter's helper or something like that.

[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.740]
And pharmaceutical industry means he was a drug peddler.

[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.100]
A pill pusher.

[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:52.820]
Swolford's wife Becky said the last time she heard him sing it was at a church fundraising event in 1999 during which he was asked to perform his two hits.

[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.200]
Hey Oliver, can you sing a melody of your two hits for us please?

[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.840]
He's dead.

[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.940]
Good night.

[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.720]
He died.

[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.420]
And there's another obituary that they don't have completed on here.

[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.480]
It says keep watching this spot for the official obituary of 940 stupid talk.

[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.960]
Coming very soon.

[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:23.120]
I mean these ratings the most amazing story is not who did well but who like either didn't show it all or right next to it.

[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.720]
It's unbelievable.

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.560]
It's mind boggling to us.

[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.300]
First of all, very jackass.

[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.720]
How come you're not writing any articles very jackass about as usual being way off base again, sweetheart?

[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.360]
Promoting on the front page is the mining here once again shows their tremendous power the clout of the herald.

[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.560]
Yeah.

[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.400]
You can't complain about their cloud because they don't have any mold.

[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:58.200]
Put it on the front page tried to bury us with this wafn piece of crap with his turd burger at 1950 on the radio dial or whatever it is which nobody can pick up.

[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.360]
They've been on the year they started in August.

[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.200]
They were going to blow this place right off the mat.

[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.340]
Another all sports station in the town that doesn't know sports from their ass.

[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:18.880]
August September October November December five solid once actually did a little promotion during that time more than we did which anything would be more than we did.

[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.800]
Couple of billboards crappy billboards little TV stuff.

[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.880]
I mean you know a little attempt here and there.

[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.300]
Have they shown one?

[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.300]
Anything one Iota in any demographic in any trend in any any of those five months.

[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.840]
One diary no no.

[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:46.140]
The only people who listen to wafn are the people the sports thirds we've told you this before that's the truth work on the station.

[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:55.400]
Running around saying oh yeah those two Jews they got midday those guys are very very funny and entertaining and that that the sports are from channel for Jim very he's really funny.

[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.100]
There is nobody listening about radio station.

[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.420]
I think they'd be an excellent replacement for you once you retire right.

[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.320]
But the thing that's really staggering in this rating book I mean it's just unbelievable.

[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:17.520]
That 940 thing just keeps amazing me I checked out persons 25 to 54 which is men and women 25 54 that's the target demo of a station like that.

[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.320]
In the morning our good close personal friends suds and what was the other one's name on Rick.

[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:33.560]
A point two that's 6 to 10 am which even includes the first hour feels take are you sure yeah damn it yeah.

[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:45.940]
It's 0.2 50,000 what when I'm doing this break stop and figure out with your calculator with your advocates out there what how much per watt is the 0.2.

[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:53.240]
How many watches they have to pump up to reach one person it's unbelievable it's tear jerking or jerking it.

[00:09:53.940 --> 00:10:02.020]

[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.940]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:18.660]
The Bible if you like the book you'll love the board game introducing go to hell from Milton Bradley the board game that tests your face in God while challenging your knowledge of biblical course.

[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:47.360]
Okay on the seventh day God did what a golf you went to one of those all you can eat lunch places on the front of the round wrong all of you go to hell.

[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:59.160]
It was a good book but now it's a great game go to hell the biblical board game from Milton Bradley and speaking of that I wonder how God attacked the brunch at one of those all you can eat brunch places.

[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:14.940]

[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:34.900]
I got a couple issues I want to discuss with you. Yes first off I don't know about your opinion but mine I'm sick of dare.

[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:41.620]
These people the newspapers in the media going going crazy over there I mean the guy died their time as he died.

[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:48.840]
Yeah I mean the big mouth to be a saint I don't know if you know this guy has seven kids in three different state right he's no saint.

[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:55.420]
No in fact there's a who was it was it any the Pope or something the one of the jackass sports writers wrote this morning a whole emotional article.

[00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:07.000]
Greg coach I was Greg coach actually had that figures about how well he wasn't perfect but I beat by the band and you can understand why they had this big ceremony it was like I don't don't understand he was a football player you know.

[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.820]
Yeah he was a football player I mean he was he was less of a scumbag than a lot of others and more of a scumbag than many others but he was a scumbag.

[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.820]
Stole cars when he lived down here when he was a scumbag no matter how you look at it the guy.

[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.060]
Yeah but he's no he's no he's a van der Holymoly field though he couldn't match him.

[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.700]
Oh he only has seven kids only got seven kids he's got like how many 19 and 28 different states.

[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:33.680]
Just five different women and 26 more by his but his wife and then he was speeding driving like a maniac.

[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:44.340]
Right that that part of it is to also I mean come on this guy call a moment saying I feel bad but he caught I mean he's you know we're seepals don't drive like an idiot you're not you're going to be very depressed when you find out that

[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:50.420]
Josie Lambeats making excuses for Cecil Collins it is column in a sunset in the morning I don't want to read it because I throw up all over it.

[00:12:50.480 --> 00:13:00.800]
His defense team is turning up info to back up its claim that the diesel and his neighbor accusing him of burglarizing replace may have been romantically involved before he was net then a neighbor accuses says Collins and Tina Nolthi

[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.180]
were that he was in the apartment several times before as arrest alleging that he she didn't know who he was before but she saw him on TV and he was in there doing

[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.680]
Hanky Panky and of course lures is it's not true in the audio.

[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:18.580]
Another course they forget Josie Lambeats everybody else forget that Cecil already confessed he be confession and that if he was in there having sexual

[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:24.800]
Hanky Panky with her it's a little bit unusual of five in the morning that you remove the screen window and try to bust in through the window but nevertheless don't

[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.680]
use them with a fact he was just looking around.

[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.700]
Yeah another thing this is totally unrelated but I'm just curious I keep seeing when I get off the exit from 9.95

[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:40.960]
Yeah these they're bombs basically on bomb their homeless people they say Harold homeless for the hell or hell for the homeless.

[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.740]
What is the Harold guy to do with the homeless?

[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:51.100]
That's what I'm asking you they're wearing these orange shirts that say Miami Herald for the homeless and they got some rinky pink newspaper not the regular

[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.280]
Harold but some other thing I don't even know what that.

[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.440]
Oh the homeless here oh yeah.

[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.560]
You know they have the L Harold for the Julio's they got the Jewish Harold for the Jews and now we have the homeless here for the homeless.

[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.580]
Is that what it is?

[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:10.160]
Yeah I don't understand why the Harold would be like yeah I mean it's just two pages it just shows all the locations you know all the street corners the intersections of I 95

[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.960]
Where to go which ones are available and how much it costs.

[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.740]
Yeah but why do I mind the Harold key shirt?

[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.820]
I don't know we'll find out what that's all about because I know we have a lot of closet listeners at the Harold.

[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.520]
Okay, I'm worried they're just a lot of guys that used to work at the Harold until they found out they were Jews now they put them out on the street.

[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.180]
No these were just old bombs.

[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.000]
Not that I'm saying the Harold's anti-Semitic you understand but of course they are.

[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.820]
Let me ask you do you know who Peter trip was?

[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.360]
No I'm not old enough.

[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.720]
No but it's certainly Oliver.

[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.520]
I don't know I wasn't born in the 50s I don't know how.

[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.120]
You believe me did miss a thing have a great day sir.

[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.480]
Later.

[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:47.720]
God bless you there you go he wasn't born say this is the thing that makes me feel so good about life is that there's some living and breathing people out there not old parts like me.

[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.720]
Like George says the old man and of course he's an old man compared to most of our listening audience.

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.120]
Well that's true I was thinking at this morning I was in the show I don't know what made me think this.

[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.660]
I'm old enough to be the grandfather of a lot of people listen to this radio show.

[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.000]
It's one thing to be the Godfather.

[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.220]
It's nothing to be the father and it's nothing to be the grandfather.

[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.060]
Yeah or your monkey's uncle or your mama.

[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.080]
I have a feeling WTMI is going to dump that classical music crap you know what?

[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.560]
And crap is the operative word I mean I've gone through periods of my life when I you know I listen to classical music I really can't tell you why.

[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:32.760]
I have a much wider a much broader musical taste than some people I don't want to mention any names this morning George but I have a much broader musical taste and much better musical taste than a lot of people who think they know something about music which they don't.

[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:43.760]
But at any rate and I've had like I said those periods when I listen to some of that Mozart and Beethoven and Chopin I do like Chopin but I don't know it's like a phase that you go through.

[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:57.540]
And now the of course the the groupies they're all up in arms because Cox broadcasting has bought up WTMI allegedly for 125 million that's what bluff was saying this morning in between weapon and tears out of his eyes.

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:12.460]
And the rumor in the building before I get back to TMI and Bob Green and all this other good stuff the rumor in this building since I'm going to start rumors about TMI is that bluff lent is going to be the PD at the kiss of country kiss our country kissing shot kicking station Schmidt kicking.

[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:19.440]
Because Bob what's his name? Okay took his bad win went up to other country station in Philadelphia with the losing the rants.

[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.720]
I don't think he's got the hair piece for it myself.

[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:39.500]
Bluff Lindsay and in a pickup truck with with a doberman and country music I just can't picture that scene you know I see some pretty strange things in my time but I just can't envision that scene but that's the rumor and you'll never guess I don't want to say it was Donnie be in gildy and a hallway speculating on this stuff this morning.

[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.900]
But guess who they're saying is going to be the PD of QAM once bluff goes over the kiss.

[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.380]
Oh and of course that'll be the day I take early retirement.

[00:16:50.900 --> 00:17:00.900]
I mean can you even envision that it's depressing enough to see in this one with the tears in his eyes every morning okay that's depressing enough to start your day but walking in in the morning and taking a look at that.

[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:07.640]
Oh Jesus God with that prune face far still the mind of his I mean this guy's an imbecile.

[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:27.700]
What what are you gonna look like that he's he's not he's a no talent no personality imbecile he wouldn't know already off your stuck a big circle and a radio to God and this day they would make him the program director well you know I mean what are the choices how many sports maven to you got in this town.

[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:40.020]
I say if that happens if bluff goes over the kiss we change the format I mean Danny's leaving Danny and Jimmy that's all over you heard them struggling and desperately groping on a sports show they got nothing to talk about.

[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:47.540]
They're talking about Dave Dombrowski and the Marlon pictures this morning is anybody interested in that nobody gives a flying crap about that.

[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.880]
There are there are three people in the world that care about the goddamn Marlon's including John Henry.

[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.420]
He just wants to stay there but he don't give a crap about the Marlins.

[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.140]
So there's that would be a perfect time to change the format.

[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:18.720]
No seriously that would that would be a good way to like as a buffer to prevent the other rumor that I'm going to start about PMI from taking place because Cox broadcasting the rumor that I'm starting today is is going to make FM talk out of PMI.

[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.240]
Yeah Bob and Tom in the morning I'm going to be on a midday.

[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:30.860]
Rick and Suds will go back in the afternoon where they belong right and then we'll put oh maybe watch her in.

[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.020]
Yeah put her back on her and I she and Bob always got along well.

[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.320]
Rekindled the old WI.

[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:45.520]
Yeah because certainly if Joseph Gackie comes in here I mean that paved the way for my exit immediately and I'll say okay I want to be on FM a signal that they can actually hear as opposed to.

[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.920]
Like AM which I've told you for years that AM blows and it does speaking to that.

[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.420]
Now that we have these ratings that let me see if there's any other AM stations.

[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.380]
That really show here like anywhere up in the top because here's the men 25 54.

[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.180]
Which thank God even in spite of that awful October when for some strange reason Arbatron couldn't find our audience.

[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.840]
But nevertheless in spite of that meant 25 54 midday.

[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.500]
We're number one.

[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.220]
On an AM station with a signal like like that.

[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:25.880]
Zeta hot XDJ would at salsa crap I don't believe that we're sure that those are wired diaries by the way.

[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.620]
You're not fooling anybody whoever owns that piece of crap.

[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.940]
Look what 94 who was like I said oh he makes me violently ill.

[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:55.860]
I may have to re-kill the story about the day that he enjoyed Reynolds took me to dinner at that formally Italian restaurant there on Broward Boulevard remember those days were you around that day I was in talent but trying trying to under the gun to the pony guys a total lie by the way Russ Oasis that they were starting a goddamn talk network to try to because I wouldn't I wouldn't go to them under the original.

[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:08.140]
They try to get me to go to dinner and what they wanted me to do was to sabotage Rick and Sud so that Joey could get on the guy then afternoon show at that time which in those days they were on the afternoon that was the whole purpose of that dinner which I walked out of about two thirds of the way through.

[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:19.600]
Yeah they wanted me to go to Bob Green and get Rick and Suds fired so Joey could get his skinny little talentless ass on in the afternoon and play with his four little groupies on the radio.

[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.700]
That's Russ Oasis for it anyway getting back to this big.

[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.600]
Smegma Smegma was dropping by leaps and by another six months Smegma will be history.

[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.440]
They can stick that disco music in there.

[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.740]
Correcto. Kiss.

[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:45.640]
You know Salazar Rock with that four-year now they didn't have any summer book at a five point but there must have been some Schmidt kickers in from out of town for the summertime or something because it's generally about a four pretty consistent.

[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.200]
In fact if I was Bob Green I'd probably think of putting some like urban country on there on at the TMI.

[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.400]
Yeah so I like some good country music.

[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.460]
Blow kisses ass right out of the water.

[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.100]
I'm sorry.

[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.860]
Try and forget about the good country music.

[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:05.980]
Well I'm talking relatively speaking I mean I don't like country music anymore than you do all I do like Marty Robbins, a white sport coat in a pink carnation I don't catch.

[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.700]
Like I said you're a taste.

[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:18.200]
But then again after grandma checked the unzipping his pants when it was a little kid you know it kind of went to his brains.

[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.640]
Only one South Florida radio station has a hammer.

[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.700]
Weak day afternoons at two sports radio 560 Q.A.F.

[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.260]
That's the honey tune yes.

[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.980]
Hello. I'm Lowry and May.

[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.720]
And I'm Bill Kennard Jim in a lefty.

[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:41.340]
We're here to thank all of you for not paying attention to anything we do.

[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.360]
And I'd like to thank you Mr. May for all the women.

[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.500]
I've had my share of horse but you outdid yourself by sending Mariah Carey.

[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.460]
My pleasure Bill.

[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.280]
Oh and that's the bottle of wine.

[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:52.600]
Yes.

[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.720]
Left of my car sheet.

[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.880]
Don't mention it Bill.

[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:01.940]
Why without your help clear channel corporation couldn't have assimilated every radio station in the country.

[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.420]
Now why not tell everyone the exciting news about the new FCC.

[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.720]
It's kind of hard to find you can take your tongue out now.

[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.060]
Well from this point on the Communications Act of 1936 is no longer valid.

[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.600]
And the Federal Communications Commission will now be known as Friends of Clear Channel.

[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.300]
But you still can't say do do all the air right Bill?

[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.640]
You say Mr. May.

[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.620]
Say how about another one or them satellites?

[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.460]
Certainly.

[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.920]
Oh say hi to Willie.

[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.100]
Walk your mouth boy.

[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.040]
1031 at 560 WQM.

[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.000]
Here's the fact that this is your absolutely right.

[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.580]
Jessica does suck the element.

[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.360]
Wait a minute. What was that?

[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.640]
Jessica Jackie does suck but anything that keeps him off the years a good thing.

[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.940]
A little quick on the trigger finger there.

[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.360]
Yeah.

[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:43.900]
Joseph Jackie.

[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.880]
Here's a man with no personality, no talent, no knowledge on the air.

[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.240]
He says dull is here in the goddamn test pattern.

[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.480]
How would you like to have the test pattern on a radio?

[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:53.860]
Yeah.

[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.540]
It's just like a like a tone like that like a 60 cycle tone like the old Sandy painting radio show.

[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.440]
So anyway, here's a they're already writing letters to the editor in the hero.

[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.920]
They're already whining the little groupies out there all of them.

[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.940]
And this is what happens.

[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:08.480]
I said it.

[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.040]
You're just morning.

[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:09.620]
This is the truth.

[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.540]
If you like to hear harmonica music.

[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.900]
You're entitled to go out.

[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.580]
I'm sure that if you find some of those old records,

[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.680]
like blue note records, they got Johnny Palayo and the harmonica cats.

[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.540]
Some of those old Columbia from the 50s harmonica.

[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.580]
See I was going to say CD records.

[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.520]
Those plastic things that they used to call records,

[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.400]
pornographs.

[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.280]
I'm sure that you could find those and take a moment, listen to them.

[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.600]
But don't expect to be put it on a radio because first of all,

[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.600]
radio as you know is a whole business and number two,

[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.800]
you're supposed to be able to make money doing it.

[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.480]
And number three, there ought to be an audience large enough out there to subsidize whatever craft you put in on a air.

[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]
You have to find a niche.

[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.820]
You have to find a target audience kind of like a stupid talk is found.

[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.840]
A point.

[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.560]
What's the point?

[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.880]
So the idea of a classical music station,

[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.240]
especially in a market as sophisticated as this one.

[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.380]
I mean, it just is just absolutely unbelievable.

[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.060]
And of course, why do I say that?

[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.620]
Because you're sophisticated, does that mean necessarily you like classical music?

[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:05.860]
No.

[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.620]
And you have your nose up on the ear and you listen to the National Public Radio, WLRN.

[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.460]
See that's a real pseudo intellectual.

[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.460]
As somebody who listens to public radio and WTMI and believe me,

[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.200]
all ten of them, they're in the same, they're the same fish and a barrel.

[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.640]
You'll find them in the same pseudo intellectual barrel.

[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.180]
But their nose way up in the ear, they're all much more intelligent than all the rest of us.

[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.040]
And much more heavier than that and much better off, considering so on.

[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.180]
And they're entitled, like I said, narrow casting.

[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.540]
In fact, the Schmuck, this real punch from TMI,

[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.180]
Ask God's word, so tell you what a Schmuck this guy is.

[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.620]
Woody Tanger, president of Marlin Broadcasting.

[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.000]
I told you, does anybody care about anything named Marlin?

[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:46.240]
No.

[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.960]
Even a fish they don't like so much anymore.

[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.960]
The baseball team, the radio guy?

[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:50.180]
No.

[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:50.440]
No.

[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.460]
He says, I'm not a betting man.

[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.420]
I've been surprised many times.

[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.960]
But if I had a big collection of Beethoven CDs, which I do,

[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.260]
I wouldn't be betting on what station will do, what a station will do.

[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.320]
I have no idea whatsoever what Cox will do with TMI.

[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.080]
I sure might as well try to figure that out.

[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.480]
Are they still trying to figure it out?

[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:07.880]
Yes.

[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.120]
In any case, Tanger said he has a back, here's the best part.

[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.260]
A backup plan to keep classic music alive, albeit not necessarily on the radio.

[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.160]
We're going to continue live classical music on Marlin Broadcasting's website,

[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.340]
www.vatovin.com.

[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:22.940]
All right.

[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.360]
We believe the future of classical music is on the internet.

[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.340]
We've made a conscious decision to be the world's classical music radio station on the internet.

[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.080]
What's wrong with that?

[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:31.600]
That's fine.

[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.020]
If you want to be the world's harmonica station on the internet, be my guest.

[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:40.520]
If you want to play Zimfer and plays the hits on his, what is it?

[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.120]
The skin flu?

[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.840]
If you want to play it, be my guest on your internet site.

[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.100]
Not on some radio frequency that you're taking up.

[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.060]
That could be taken up by something that might be entertaining.

[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.300]
What is it that you're finding in there?

[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.100]
You didn't find that Oliver thing, did you?

[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:55.960]
No, I wish.

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.400]
What is it?

[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:57.840]
Mozart.

[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.000]
We're going to play classical music?

[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:00.360]
No.

[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.700]
The last day we beat Bob Green and our old friends and I would eat the punch.

[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.180]
That's right.

[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.780]
We're starting to play classical music today here on QA.

[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.980]
We just had Bluffland, who came in and gave me the memo.

[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:17.100]
It says, as effective 1030 this morning, February 16, 2000, WQM announces a format change.

[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.940]
All classical all day!

[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.760]
Feature hard out what he's hanging.

[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.140]
You piece of the record, by the way, it's got four still, wants his money.

[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.840]
Will you give it to him?

[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.180]
Come on, he wants the money now.

[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:26.400]
No.

[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.580]
Yeah, listen to that.

[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.560]
I mean, what kind of a person he listens to that?

[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.860]
Like he said, it was a failure.

[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.220]
Yeah, my collection's really nice, but you know, watch his name in Clockwork Gorns,

[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:38.980]
what's up with his name?

[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:39.600]
Alex.

[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.860]
Alex, he listened to the song.

[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.880]
I liked the music video.

[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.480]
The one band, yeah.

[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.540]
Lovely, lovely.

[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.020]
Yeah.

[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.140]
And he listened to that.

[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.140]
And of course, he listened to it a little bit too loud there for a while when he was kind of tied up upstairs.

[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.900]
And his eyes were rolling around his head.

[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.760]
He sure did have big eyes, didn't he?

[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.500]
Malcolm McDonnell.

[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.700]
And then of course, that also wasn't the only thing he had that was pretty big as we saw in that scene.

[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.620]
What was that thing that was hanging down there in that, huh?

[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.360]
And that privilege of snake basil.

[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.960]
Yeah, that was basil.

[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.320]
Wow, he's got to have someplace to hide him.

[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.380]
Ludwig Vee.

[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.740]
And of course, he was a little bit strange.

[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.380]
So I guess we could say that people in the classical music, I mean, you were entitled like whatever you want.

[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.420]
And all you TMI, all the people are going to be crying, all tenia.

[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.280]
Here are these letters to the editor.

[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.440]
No more WTMI.

[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680]
Please say it's not so.

[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.580]
And Tom Jicke.

[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.620]
Thanks for mentioning my name again, Tom, by the way.

[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.120]
Even though you are bald and sometimes stupid and behind the time is you're okay in my book, Tom.

[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.420]
Talks about the future.

[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.920]
It says despite WTMI sale, music's future is secure.

[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.620]
That's the headline.

[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.380]
And then you read Tom's column and that's not what it says at all unless you're talking about on the internet.

[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.380]
I don't know what that means.

[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.800]
See, this is the amazing thing about newspapers, which usually get it wrong.

[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.220]
And that is that the person writes a column or an article, whatever it is.

[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.680]
And then some other person writes a headline.

[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.180]
And does the headline always match the article?

[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:01.420]
No.

[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.520]
And in some cases like this one, it doesn't make any sense at all.

[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.680]
Because Tom Jicke goes on to say about Cox broadcasting by NWTMI.

[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.960]
He says broadcasters have to speak carefully during the period between the announcement of a sale and the approval from the FCC, which generally takes about three months.

[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.240]
However, Bob Green, remember a little Bob Green?

[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.280]
Hi, remember Bob Green?

[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.680]
General manager of the South Florida Cox property did nothing to assuage concerns.

[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.380]
I love that word.

[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.260]
Am I pronouncing that correctly, by the way?

[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:29.520]
Yes.

[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.980]
I know how it's pronounced, but it's one of those words that when you say it doesn't come out the way that it looks.

[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:34.820]
You know what I mean?

[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:47.780]
To dismiss concerns, to sue with concerns, to minimize concerns of classical fans, when he issued a statement saying, we will be exploring all in italics, all his emphasis, format options, including classical,

[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:55.540]
determine the course of action that can provide us with optimum ratings, revenues and sheerhold of return on our investment with a minimum of risk.

[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:04.040]
I did, those are my emphasis as I added there, minimum of risk, you cowardly bastard, you are Cox broadcasting, especially Bob Neal up there in Atlanta, you little twerp.

[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.740]
I've stepped on better crap than you, Bob Neal, okay?

[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.800]
And I'm not calling you up to wish you happy birthday anymore, because Cox ain't buying this radio station.

[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.940]
Did I ever tell you about that?

[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.740]
About how Bob and Cheryl got me on a phone that time, about a year and a half ago, whenever the hell it was.

[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:27.780]
Be sure and call up in Atlanta, beginning his inside line, to call a little Bob Neal up there at Cox broadcasting, and wish him a happy birthday, because it's gotta be like closer to two years ago.

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.480]
Certainly after we started.

[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:38.180]
Remember all the rumors that were flying around every day about somebody was buying us, and it was usually Cox broadcasting was buying power and kiss, and this company was going to force them to buy this radio station.

[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.760]
But at any rate, so I called up Bob Neal and pretended that I wish them happy birthday, but I beat Pataboo Pataboo, and did anything ever happen?

[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.460]
No, so I'm not going to do it again, okay Bob Green, although I'll tell you what, I'll talk on FM.

[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.300]
That's the future of talk radio in America.

[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.280]
We'll call on this on happy birthday again, it's, if what?

[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.140]
If they make that place all right.

[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.400]
Yeah, for about a million and a half a year, I'll be more than delighted.

[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:09.440]
We got about three million in building right off the bat, we can bring them no questions asked, just move it right over there, as soon as this station was all classical.

[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.120]
Whatever the new format is going to be, yeah, I love that.

[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.040]
I'll keep that going.

[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.060]
Beat that Oliver crap any day of the week.

[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:21.320]
Beat the garbage that you met there playing on power 96 down the hall, that boom, boom, boom, that garbage there playing on her.

[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.560]
Oh God, they play crap.

[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.260]
They play the worst frickin' music.

[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:25.740]
Man.

[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.020]
They don't play just music for punks, they play music for retarded punks on power 96.

[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.540]
There's anybody in this audience who listens to power 96, let's see it on the phone, okay?

[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.580]
You got five seconds to dial it up, five six seven, oh five sixty, times up.

[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.680]
See anybody on the phone?

[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.120]
No, nobody listens to power 96.

[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.500]
Anybody who listens to TMI, you got five seconds, five six seven, oh five sixty.

[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.380]
Times up.

[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.200]
Anybody who listens to that salsa crap on WXDJ, three seconds, finds up.

[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.820]
Wait a minute.

[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.240]
WQ I am.

[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.080]
Hello.

[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:04.900]
Hello.

[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.620]
Yes sir.

[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.680]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.940]
What station are you listening to sir?

[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.100]
Power 96.

[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.360]
Oh my God, I'm so sorry, we'll send you two in the call us in the morning.

[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:14.880]
We'll send you a pair.

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.560]
Look at that, we had a few people listening to power 96.

[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.260]
Rhymes with, of course, they're not listening right now.

[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.000]
No, he's not.

[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.440]
Well, of course they're not listening to power 96 right now.

[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.740]
But anybody who's not listening to power 96 right now, would anybody in a rhyme line listen to that crap when...

[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.540]
Damn, come on!

[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.160]
He's on the air.

[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.380]
No.

[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.060]
No way Jose.

[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.280]
Oh, that was Jose.

[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.000]
Twenty-four minutes.

[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.620]
We're going to live it at 5.60 WQ I am.

[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.420]
I'm losing it today.

[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.240]
I'm just loaded.

[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.100]
I'm just full of it.

[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]
Speaking of being full of it, kill the music place.

[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.380]
We don't want to play that over Pompano Park spot or maybe we do.

[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:40.700]
I don't know.

[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.500]
I might add a little flair, a little something.

[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.840]
You can listen to some music.

[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.300]
You can take your heads out there.

[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.060]
They take, get you a nice table at the dining room on the sixth floor.

[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.040]
Take along your little Sony Walkman.

[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.740]
In place of my, I'm moat, the Mozart and my tart and the retard and Beethoven.

[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.660]
Yeah, and Bach and Brahms.

[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.600]
In fact, get some of those rocks, their candies are pretty good too, those droplets.

[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.220]
And just keep Pompano in your post and enjoy the classical music while you're losing your ass.

[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.200]
But where are your fudge back in?

[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.340]
Rick Riley stole my re-cake.

[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.840]
Oh, I like the march in his face.

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.720]
That's Marmy Dink, what gives him the right?

[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.160]
Oh, I think his wife bought a fight at off time night.

[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.300]
Rick Riley stole my re-cake.

[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.460]
What, what, this trace to the human rage?

[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.280]
Oh, Rick, you're a smuck.

[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.360]
Hey, Goldberg sucks.

[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.520]
That wheel of meat should also include Rick Riley's butt.

[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.680]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Rick Riley stole my re-cake.

[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.560]
I like the march in his face.

[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.200]
Damn.

[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.600]
Rick Riley, you're an asshole.

[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.360]
Yeah.

[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:52.360]
I love this show.

[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.160]
It's 10.45 at 5.60 WDQM.

[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.300]
Whatever happened to them, huh?

[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.460]
Doesn't make you feel sick.

[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.140]
Very sad.

[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.200]
As you watch all of these people, it's kind of like that Peter Trip story, you know?

[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.660]
Here he was on top of the world.

[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.020]
50,000 Watts, 10, 50,000 Dile WMGM in New York.

[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.780]
Even as a kid in Canada, in New York, I had my white Emerson radio.

[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.420]
And I used to listen to the top, whatever it was.

[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.100]
Top 30, top whatever they used to call it.

[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:17.900]
Top 40, I guess.

[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.580]
Countdown on WMGM.

[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.560]
Used to come in pretty good.

[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.920]
And listen to Peter Trip.

[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.560]
How do you like that?

[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.120]
I'm probably the only person alive in this town who actually to listen to Peter Trip,

[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:29.880]
who didn't live in New York.

[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.780]
I mean, if you live in New York, that's no big deal.

[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.660]
And then all of a sudden, the big scandal.

[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.520]
Suspended a sentence.

[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:45.800]
Bounces around from one town to another at all these Vomfort radio stations.

[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.920]
Topeka, Albee, and Michigan.

[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.700]
The Taven of New York, Geneva.

[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.860]
All these other marginal, and then the Dyes broken penniless.

[00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:00.740]
And you just say, what a horrible thought that Rick and Suds are going to wind up the same way.

[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.580]
I need help with a 0.2.

[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.200]
And why do they have a 0.2?

[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.680]
Because Peter Bulger.

[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.480]
How many times have I told you that?

[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.320]
The assassin, the man who destroys everything in his wake.

[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.280]
The man who's got more naked pictures of everybody that he's ever worked for.

[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.420]
This guy must have not a drawer full.

[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:26.100]
He must have a file cabinet full of naked pictures of the paxons of the queer channel people of David Ross.

[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.960]
He's got pictures of David Ross with a Billy goat, you know what I'm saying?

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.020]
God.

[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.020]
And still keeps that job.

[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.120]
Destroying every life that comes into destroying every career.

[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.960]
Even poor Phil Henry.

[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:40.560]
Are you sure?

[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.500]
I mean, take a look at that.

[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.160]
Part of that one hour, one four, 25% of that point too.

[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.960]
You take away 25% of that.

[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.180]
That's what does that leave?

[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.480]
25% it leaves like a, uh-huh.

[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.640]
A point one, a point 15.

[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.780]
And that's like that.

[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.580]
Jesus Christ.

[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.040]
They don't have 25% to give away.

[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.040]
And I can just envision the day that I'm going to read a horrible start.

[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:08.860]
Get up in the morning and read the thing about how Rick and Suds got on a flat car.

[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.000]
And they're like a panhandling across America.

[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:18.220]
Maybe they're going to be in those orange jumpsuits wearing a horrible homelessness thing out on the street corner.

[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.120]
Keep your eyes out for them in Broward County.

[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.120]
For Rick and Suds out there in the morning, instead of being on the air with that point to share.

[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.760]
I guarantee you now I know that we got people listen to power 96.

[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.540]
That was just a joke.

[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.100]
Even though I mean, what choice you got.

[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.840]
Is there any good news of station in this town?

[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.580]
No, of course not.

[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.320]
The only choice you got your CDs.

[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.140]
But I think it would be a tremendous test.

[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.200]
If we can find anybody who still listens to Rick and Suds.

[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.580]
You think it's possible?

[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.960]
I mean, we actually have had people who admitted listening to that page.

[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.720]
And I'll be honest with you, that would never admit that.

[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.860]
Subging members of what's your such as the trip guy?

[00:35:59.060 --> 00:35:59.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.040]
You didn't have a conversation with him, did you?

[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:02.400]
Yeah.

[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.060]
Oh.

[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.060]
Do you remember screaming Jay Hawkins?

[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:07.660]
Yeah.

[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:08.420]
Dead.

[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.420]
No.

[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.220]
Yes?

[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.000]
I put a spell on you.

[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.140]
Died in Paris yesterday.

[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.140]
Oh, no!

[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.960]
It's like a guy named Epidemic.

[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.760]
He also didn't call to say that.

[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:19.580]
Oh.

[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.020]
I'm sure Suds didn't call that.

[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.940]
Well, that makes us feel like duties.

[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:24.540]
What is it?

[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.560]
The point to where the fact I mentioned that he may have called on here or on the off-ear.

[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.020]
Hey, listen, when you got a point to is he going to be worried about that job?

[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:31.280]
No.

[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:31.560]
No.

[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.120]
I feel bad for him.

[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:33.760]
And for Rick.

[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.420]
Rick is misunderstood, you know?

[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.640]
I mean, sometimes he's a prick, but nevertheless he's misunderstood.

[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.180]
He's okay.

[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:39.940]
We like him.

[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.200]
Those were the good days.

[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.460]
Those were the good times.

[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.420]
I have to spend 90% of my time screaming yelling because the guy didn't phone didn't work.

[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.980]
We had pretty good times in those days.

[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.320]
And then they stuck them on here in the morning.

[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.120]
I mean, I could just battle on for four hours here today.

[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.160]
I could just take a trip to battle on and do it.

[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:09.200]
About all the mysterious stuff, the the ins and the outs, the rumors, the stories and Reneerie getting tan and getting paid off for like almost a year.

[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.900]
They had just resigned, Reneerie, like two months before.

[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.360]
They sure were a brilliant businessman.

[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.620]
They are a Cox broadcast.

[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:20.120]
And if you ever read their newspapers in Atlanta, by the way, you'd find out what a bunch of idiots they are, but you're redneck Yahoo's.

[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.900]
Although I guess they know their market up there.

[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.100]
Plus not to mention listening to WSB in Atlanta, another Cox station, which oh, God almighty.

[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.560]
Yeah, that's about where it belongs.

[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:39.060]
But there were all these stories, you know, back and forth about the well, Chuck Meyer, they brought in Chuck Meyer to do that morning show.

[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.680]
Should we do news? Should we do entertainment?

[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.980]
So we run in Chuck Meyer, who was a great news guy.

[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.380]
A great news guy with a great voice with great credibility.

[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.580]
And by the way, thanks to our close friends at Atlantic City Sub's again, not only for our subsidy, but also some soda.

[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.540]
Since we don't have any water for my good friend, what's his name?

[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.200]
South balcony. It's only water.

[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.920]
She even forgot for a second how soon they forget when you don't supply the guy to him, so they water.

[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.260]
So you could drink some of that olive oil, but in any rate.

[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.420]
Oh, that olive oil.

[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:08.800]
Yeah.

[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.480]
So they put the Chuck Meyer thing on it.

[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.460]
And of course, I had to take the blame for that because I ripped him on here because it was a, it was a crapshow.

[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.960]
He used to always stupid phoneers, those awful phone interviews.

[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.240]
Anybody remember that? Oh my God.

[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.920]
Yeah, a lot of work went into that show.

[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.840]
Yeah. Well, you sure as hell couldn't tell.

[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.760]
And then to prove that Chuck Meyer was no entertainer that he was a news guy and should have stuck to news.

[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.040]
See that breaks my heart.

[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.580]
When you do something well, do it. Don't try to be something else like Donald Trump.

[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.240]
There's a classic example. He's a BS artist that makes a lot of money.

[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.440]
Just go do it. And he finally said, I guess I don't want to run for president because I'm a schmuck.

[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.580]
I'm a dummy. And nobody would vote for me. Anybody nobody's that dumb anyway.

[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.520]
How's that before party coming by the way?

[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.580]
You do know that just even to a quick the party.

[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.120]
Yeah, of course. Yeah. Last Friday.

[00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.300]
Nice go on there, Jesse got out just in time before they had that embarrassing brawl there.

[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.940]
What a joke. Yeah. Yeah. They're like, uh,

[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.360]
minting each other. They're a little slap by they're missing each other.

[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.720]
Like the vangu boys in that video, which you'll never see in this country, but at any rate.

[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:19.300]
And then of course, we had I mean, just all the little stuff that went on behind the scenes that it was always Steve nickel.

[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.580]
I wonder what was in that drawer of his, you know, I wonder what was in there.

[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.680]
Pen. Pencil. Yeah.

[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.280]
Paper. Yeah, something else that begins with Pete like Susan.

[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.600]
What was her name? I had pitch powder. Yeah.

[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.440]
Yeah. He's okay. Oh, Steve nickel. He's my man.

[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.780]
Remember the day he called us from a wonder if that station is on here in Jacksonville.

[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.720]
I'd be big in Jacksonville. When I know.

[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:55.020]
Well, I'm y'all who's up there in the room where I'm hearing is that their football team beat our football team 60 to the seven in the playoff game.

[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.460]
Just not that long ago. That's a room where I just heard.

[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.440]
We be gigantic up there in Jacksonville.

[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.980]
They don't have just like a bunch of sports nerds up there.

[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:08.340]
They have people I can discuss all kinds of intellectual stuff like classical music like WTMI.

[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:16.000]
Can't ask my smart joke, by the way, Kevin Spacey, Sissy, Spacek, or Yaros Batek.

[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.260]
Now he's he's supposed to be the greatest actor in the world now, Kevin Spacey.

[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.300]
Would you buy that? No. No. That's that's all right.

[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.040]
You're supposed to say that. Sorry.

[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.280]
An American beauty. Did you see that? No. It's got heard it was great.

[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:35.300]
Seven thousand nominations because that's the big thing everybody's supposed to be talking about which I got here, but I can't talk about it because did I see any of these movies?

[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.620]
No. No. So how can I talk about it?

[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.640]
Oh, I do think I am going to see that Matt Damon movie.

[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.380]
Mr. what was the name of the movie?

[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.260]
Looking for Mr. Goodman.

[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.740]
No, yeah. That's what we're just thinking. That's not what it is.

[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.360]
No, the amazing the sinister Mr. Well, what else in the minute? Goddamn movie.

[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.320]
Wait a minute. We'll find it here.

[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.960]
To tell that Mr. Ripley believe it or not. That was the name of that movie.

[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.600]
I'm thinking I might just go see that because I do like Matt Damon. He's okay.

[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.180]
I mean I scale it 10. I give him about a seven.

[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.140]
But the previews make it look kind of interesting. Plus it's a fag thing, you know.

[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.020]
And I'm always interested in seeing those fag things.

[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:12.620]
Uh-huh.

[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.740]
Speaking of that, here's a call from Milton Manners. Hello.

[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.200]
Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great.

[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:27.200]
I'm just trying to ask you about the pin your pin on the championship with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.120]
You think the championship with the Toronto Maple Leafs?

[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.140]
Yeah, do you think they'll win the cup?

[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:33.600]
No.

[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.340]
No?

[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.320]
Do you think they'll win another game? I think there's a much better question.

[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.300]
Not to why I think we'll they win the cup.

[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.200]
So how's your public doing?

[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.340]
My public is doing great. You're going to have a wonderful day.

[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.920]
Oh, was that guy of any material?

[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.360]
No. I mean, I'm telling you.

[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.880]
The championship with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Does anybody know anybody that's left on the team?

[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:51.160]
No.

[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.600]
Mess with success.

[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.100]
That must have had my maybe Mike Disney, maybe some of the people from a cast broadcast.

[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.060]
They maybe Bob Neil was involved in that deal with the Maple Leafs.

[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.700]
All these horrible deals just broke my heart watching that.

[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.040]
I thought it was pretty good game last night. Tampa Bay and the Rangers.

[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.980]
Over time, two two tie very exciting game.

[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.480]
Certainly the overtime was unbelievable.

[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.880]
Rates my heart to watch Frederick Modine and Todd Warner and especially the great Mike Johnson.

[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.100]
They're playing for Tampa Bay for a girls team.

[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.940]
When the Leafs can't win a fixed game these days, but then does anybody care about that?

[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.360]
Oh, he's going to be at that Ranger Panther game tonight.

[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.260]
Oh, I'll be there.

[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.600]
I'll be there with Belzona.

[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.320]
My friend Ron, the big flyers fan.

[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.260]
I hope he's less than today.

[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.400]
I hope he had a chance last night.

[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.240]
Oh, he might have to he might have to call and sick and not attend tonight's game after seeing Martin Broderg.

[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.440]
I think it's a good credit for a goal that the flyers knocked into their own net while it was a delayed penalty.

[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.700]
That's really got to make it and that was the that was the clinch of goal in the game.

[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.780]
That was the decisive one.

[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.660]
That was the straw that broke the camel's hump.

[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.040]
They got a delayed penalty called against New Jersey.

[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.880]
They got a chance to get back in the game.

[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:59.980]
And they're passing the puck around and all of a sudden, oops, somebody gets bumped and it goes off his stick right back to his own empty net.

[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.980]
Because the goal they came out for the extra attacker and they scored their own net.

[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:08.500]
And the last man for New Jersey who touched the puck was Goli Martin Broderg and he gets credit for the goal.

[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.120]
Anybody out there ever see a goalie score goal?

[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:10.340]
No.

[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.160]
Oh, a wicked way to lose.

[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.060]
They grow test-quave.

[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.240]
But nevertheless, well deserved by the obnoxious fill it off your flyers.

[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.840]
They make me sick. They make me nauseous. They make me want a barf.

[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:22.940]
But do we want to talk hockey?

[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.140]
No.

[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.600]
Now, let's talk about Peter Tripp, the curlyhead of Kid in the third row.

[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.220]
And about WTMI, what they ought to do with that format.

[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.060]
And about Bluff Lindsay going over to KISS.

[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:32.760]
And about poor Rick and Suds.

[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.320]
Do we have anybody called by the way who listens to Rick and Suds?

[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.240]
Besides Suds, yes.

[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:36.880]
Yeah.

[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.500]
Come on three.

[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.380]
And what do they say?

[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.480]
They say we listen to Rick and Suds.

[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.260]
Oh, thank God for that.

[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:42.520]
Good.

[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.240]
Well, I listen.

[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.180]
You do?

[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.380]
Yeah, every once in a while.

[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.380]
Two or three times a week.

[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.640]
You know the worst team on this radio station?

[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.460]
These are the why?

[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.760]
1056 at 560 WQM hits.

[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.240]
Jim Manditz talks sports.

[00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:58.740]
Oh, right.

[00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.680]
Right here.

[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.940]
On sports radio 560 QKL.

[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.160]
OK.

[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.340]
What are those on your feet, shoes?

[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:11.880]
What else?

[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.940]
S-O-C-K-F.

[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.320]
You just said kiss my f***ing cantony.

[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.140]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:17.900]
Don't be sorry.

[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.100]
Hey, what's that around your waist?

[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.140]
About spellet.

[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:20.820]
B-E-L-T.

[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.640]
You just told someone to f*** off in Zulu.

[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.220]
Oh, my.

[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.280]
And that's just one of the many techniques you'll learn

[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.500]
with the National Profanix Language Couset Program.

[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.420]
National Profanix can have you cursing in Spanish, French, Italian, German,

[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.940]
and a host of other languages in just a few weeks.

[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.320]
So call 1-800- f*** you today.

[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.320]
Because the most important thing you'll need to know about other cultures

[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.920]
is how to tell somebody off.

[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.460]
Hey, buddy.

[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.100]
S-O-C-K-F.

[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:45.800]
Nobody home.

[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.960]
They've all left for the day.

[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.320]
OK, 11-1 at 560 WQM.

[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.000]
Mom, just the one here is voice again.

[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.280]
OK, I just miss him a lot.

[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.160]
Start licking.

[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:53.700]
No, thanks.

[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.640]
Not that much.

[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.500]
Yeah, we had some good times over there at Google, WI-G-D,

[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.620]
but those days are gone.

[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.560]
You can't live in a past.

[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.160]
You can't mullinger in the past.

[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.920]
It's all gone down the drain.

[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.840]
And we can thank Bob Neal for that and all those other goy-em up there in Atlanta

[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.040]
for selling us out.

[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:10.640]
That's what they did.

[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.500]
They sold us out.

[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.500]
How many million?

[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.820]
How many billion dollars do these big goddamn companies have to make?

[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.120]
Before they have enough.

[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.480]
Bill Gates, Wayne Hypinga, John Henry.

[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.840]
All these other grave robbers.

[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.200]
How much do they have to have?

[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.240]
How much do they have to squeeze out of your ass before they have enough?

[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.540]
In addition to which, don't most corporations need a good tax right off?

[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:33.760]
No.

[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:34.140]
Huh?

[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.240]
Don't they need a good moment of money-losing, money-laundering things?

[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.040]
Sounds good to me.

[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.160]
They just don't know how to do business over there.

[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.840]
That's their problem.

[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.580]
Although I shouldn't be saying that because we're just dying to go on WTMI.

[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.520]
Where is WTMI in the dial?

[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:47.920]
Do we know?

[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.060]
Are they 100,000 watts?

[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:49.780]
Do they have a great signal?

[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.360]
I think they do.

[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.460]
Do they have to have a class CFM?

[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:51.780]
I don't know.

[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.240]
Huh?

[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.580]
Well, somebody out there will tell us, I bet you we got at least one person in this audience

[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.280]
who listens to WTMI, somebody with some taste, with some class.

[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.760]
That's just a bunch of crude scumbags who fart a lot and pick their nose all day long.

[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.900]
Yeah, that's the stereotype of my audience.

[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:13.440]
A bunch of crude truck driving scumbags that belt and fart all day.

[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.520]
Which I mean they may have a point.

[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:19.160]
Well, what's wrong with having a bunch of scumbag truck driving?

[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.020]
And here's a pig report on a alley speaking of that.

[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:21.260]
Hello?

[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.780]
Hey, I'm a truck driver.

[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:23.520]
There you go.

[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.200]
Hey, there.

[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.120]
Bradley County's finest there.

[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.900]
There was some public conditioning.

[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.940]
Who is your pay-it-all, validator alley?

[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:30.420]
Yeah.

[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.200]
The phone, y'all.

[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:31.820]
Really?

[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:32.760]
Oh, yeah, right there.

[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.440]
I put it in the car.

[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.480]
Thanks for the good news, pal.

[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.100]
Love you, Nell.

[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:36.700]
Slow down.

[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.640]
Okay, see there.

[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.040]
You asked for it and you get it.

[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.140]
Sometimes, not usually, but once in a while.

[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.700]
Anybody out there see the talented Mr. Ripley?

[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:45.920]
No.

[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.320]
Should I bother go see him or shall we wait for him to come on TV?

[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.140]
Is it really that good?

[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.020]
Well, it's just the fact things are probably most of you

[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.760]
wouldn't have seen that except maybe the guy who wrote the manners.

[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.640]
Who had nothing to say?

[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.140]
I feel bad about that because that guy, I mean, he waited for quite a while to it.

[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:58.600]
What is him?

[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.760]
You asked for the power, right?

[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:02.820]
A TMI?

[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:03.360]
Yeah.

[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.060]
And a frequency.

[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.940]
Oh, 93.1 is a frequency.

[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.040]
I thought we all knew that.

[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.200]
No, I did not know that.

[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.320]
How would I know that?

[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:11.980]
I've never listened to that on that.

[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.900]
Isn't it preset number one on your car state?

[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.140]
Yeah.

[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.340]
Number one, two and three, just to make sure, have you ever done that with stations?

[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.160]
You have more than one preset just to make sure you don't miss a bank one and bank two.

[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:21.460]
Right.

[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:22.920]
Okay.

[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.940]
But people are calling up with the frequency frequency frequency.

[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.080]
And yeah, we got that.

[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.860]
93.1, but they're not either power.

[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.400]
They wouldn't know that because that's an inside thing.

[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.760]
I mean, listeners would know the frequency.

[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:33.960]
They wouldn't know the power.

[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:38.760]
They might know power 96, which is right down the hallway playing at pump, pump, pump, pump on that crap.

[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:40.640]
That's pumping crap.

[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:42.380]
And by the way, I hate to break the news to you out there.

[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.020]
All you bigots.

[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.120]
But there's a hell of a lot more white kids listening to rap music and sparsers.

[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:46.960]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.640]
No contest.

[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.920]
Yeah, it's the white kids that are listening to all that illiterate rap music.

[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.900]
That's what we're worried about.

[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.400]
The black kids, I mean, what do you have?

[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.800]
What's the, what can that hurt?

[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.400]
You know, they're going to do any harm.

[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.040]
No, no.

[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.900]
Because so many of them unfortunately are brought up in families where they be speaking like that in the first place.

[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.140]
What they're trying to do is pollute the minds of the white kids in the suburbs, like in crawl springs in western.

[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.400]
In western.

[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.340]
Where they're selling crack on every street corner.

[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.000]
Crack.

[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:13.420]
Go.

[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.000]
Go.

[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.440]
100,000 watts someone called to say that's what I just said.

[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.080]
Class C F M. That's what that means.

[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.020]
Classic.

[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:20.860]
Yeah.

[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:21.800]
Classical.

[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:23.680]
So there you go.

[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.080]
W T M I 93.1.

[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.940]
A perfect spot for my F N talk radio station.

[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:29.680]
What do you say Bob?

[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:29.980]
Come on.

[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.100]
Let's get Bob green on the phone.

[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.180]
We'll get Phil on the phone doing Bob's voice.

[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.200]
Are you sure positive?

[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:34.600]
Come on.

[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.180]
You can do it.

[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.300]
They don't have the balls to do it.

[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.680]
What would this sense be in the first place to do it at the already got rid of us once.

[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:50.760]
Because they couldn't make money on AM and of course the philosophy of F M especially with that company being the cheap tricks that they are almost the cheapest clear channel but not quite.

[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.960]
The philosophy on F M is that it's got to be a ju-box your station.

[00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.580]
Low overhead don't pay any talent and just pump the hits just find some musical format.

[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.840]
What if we talk in play classical music in the background?

[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:11.340]
Urban downtown hip hop dance Ukrainian.

[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:16.480]
You know they got all these different pre it's all crap.

[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.980]
And that's what you get no no originality no personalities.

[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:27.520]
Certainly nobody that wants to make more than five bucks an hour and that's their philosophy what F M is all about it's a cash cow.

[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.040]
It's a ju-box.

[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:37.480]
Here's a mobile in adventura hello mobile in adventura.

[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.960]
Hey Neil how you doing great.

[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.020]
TMI in the morning's got a show called Buck and Roll which isn't too bad.

[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:44.320]

[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.940]
And LRN's got a Sunday morning show called the Prairie Home Companion which is kind of hokey.

[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.260]
But when you're not over and there's really not too much choice.

[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.020]
Yeah it's true.

[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.280]
That's it.

[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:54.620]
Okay.

[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:55.500]
Have a good one.

[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.200]
Thanks so much.

[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:56.680]
Bye bye.

[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:02.980]
There's a guy who listens to TMI and LRN and admits it and admits it how do you like that.

[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.800]
Have we had anybody who admits to listen to a Rick and Sud?

[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:07.180]
No.

[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.380]
A couple off the air and nobody on here why not.

[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.840]
Whatever happened to those days see they broke up that old gang man never be the same again.

[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:20.100]
And I'm sitting here wondering to myself after I after you had that call off the air from somebody impersonating Sud.

[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.420]
How do you get up I mean it's one thing you know I get up seven o'clock in the morning that's really enough for me.

[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.360]
Crawling here about eight thirty eight forty five.

[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:35.120]
But how do you get yourself out of bed at four or four thirty in the morning to go in into a morning show.

[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:43.300]
And the ratings come out and they keep every month they retrend to keep going down and down and down and you don't have that much to start with.

[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:50.660]
And you finally get down to a point two and you still have to my I guess it's survival is what it's called.

[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.120]
Yeah it's that instinctive thing that we have to need to survive need to get a paycheck.

[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:03.180]
It's got to be that because what other motivation could you have when it's so unrewarding that there's no tangible evidence that anybody's listening out there.

[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.880]
A point two.

[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:10.940]
I got to be very honest with you I think that if we had a point to on a show.

[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.800]
I don't think I could motivate myself to come in.

[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:21.400]
I was just calling you know say a few words on the phone every day and then let's you play Ukrainian with classical music play that Mozart again.

[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:27.680]
Let's talk and still probably do more than a point to don't have any Frederick Chopin I do like show.

[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:27.900]
Yeah.

[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.260]
Polynesia number two hundred and forty eight.

[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.200]
In fact don't let's play that back to back.

[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.240]
No more number five and the holidays number of six.

[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.100]
560.560.560 on the AT&T line.

[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.580]
Pretty upset about the Rick and Suds book.

[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.700]
What the hell was that?

[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.040]
Yeah I know it was a wicked number.

[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:50.940]
A point.

[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:51.580]
Oh!

[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.960]
Six, six, six, six.

[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:55.800]
F*** her in front of Jesus.

[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.280]
Oh yeah,

[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.160]
I'm not gonna be standing up together.

[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.140]
Ellie is holding their ass TV.

[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.100]
Don't get better.

[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.300]
The chef is just like in late tonight.

[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.800]
She's the first to found.

[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.880]
You're gonna see stands full of the guts.

[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:30.620]
If Wendy's around.

[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.340]
They're standing,

[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.680]
part and tile, and they're talking dirt.

[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.400]
And at least once a week is here.

[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.080]
Thank you, Wendy.

[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.900]
You're back, Ellie.

[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.240]
Oh, it's so weird,

[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.280]
but the wonderful,

[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.080]
and can't be faced with jealousy.

[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.900]
He can't hit in the head.

[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.760]
And then he said,

[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.420]
the rats know it him,

[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.620]
and then they eat it.

[00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:59.100]
They eat it.

[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.400]
Thank you, Wendy.

[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.200]
You're back, Ellie.

[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:06.580]
Okay.

[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.260]
You want to know what I think?

[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:08.700]
What?

[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.460]
He's doing something today.

[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:13.980]
He's got the hiccups.

[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.140]
Everybody's doing something today.

[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.540]
It's 11.4 C.

[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.760]
At 5.50 WQM,

[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.200]
we got Hank in the studio again today.

[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.900]
By the way, thanks Hank for stopping.

[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.280]
And he left me the New York Post yesterday.

[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.540]
With the picture of the priest.

[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.000]
Remember the story ahead about the priest yesterday?

[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.340]
Father Dennis Brennan,

[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.860]
who became Denise Brennan.

[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:32.520]
Remember that story?

[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.980]
And the New York Post on pages eight and nine

[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.940]
in the yesterday's edition.

[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.960]
It says, why this priest wants to be a woman?

[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.660]
And it's got not only the original priest,

[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.540]
which boy, oh, is she a lady or what?

[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:46.820]
I'm talking about the picture as a guy.

[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:48.540]
Woo!

[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.000]
Talk about Denise.

[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.740]
He makes Denise pot-bam lookbook.

[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.360]
She's a fact in the church.

[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.380]
And then on the other page on page nine,

[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.620]
here is a picture of Father Brennan

[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.900]
shopping in the supermarket with his little cart.

[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:03.860]
Here's Denise.

[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.080]
With the wig, women's clothing,

[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.020]
and looks lovely.

[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.380]
Looks like a nice old lady, huh?

[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.180]
And the reason they're upset about this,

[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.680]
it's got nothing to do with gender crossing,

[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.420]
with sex change,

[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.740]
and has to do with the idea that if they left him

[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:15.620]
in the priesthood now,

[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.760]
they have to have a woman priest.

[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.440]
Can they do that?

[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:17.720]
No.

[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:19.400]
They're pissed off about that and fired up.

[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.100]
I mean, just one more fag in the church

[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.620]
that doesn't bother them at all,

[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.680]
because generally speaking, they're the overwhelming majority.

[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:27.940]
They're like almost unanimous.

[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.640]
They have one or two token straight guys in there.

[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.300]
One or two people that don't need a good shrink.

[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:35.060]
Oh, and God, oh, and wait till you hear the name of the person

[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.520]
who wrote this column.

[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.040]
You better put that sandwich down.

[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.560]
I'm not making this up.

[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.220]
This is in yesterday's New York Post.

[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.780]
Reveal sex change plan and letter to flock.

[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.740]
And basically, it's the same story I read yesterday

[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:51.440]
that somebody faxed to me from the Reuters.

[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.800]
But the name of the columnist that wrote this,

[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.600]
and there's his picture.

[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.940]
In fact, he looks just like a father Brennan.

[00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.860]
He looks like a real prevert.

[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.520]
His name is Frederick Udicker.

[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:04.940]
Yeah.

[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:07.500]
Yeah.

[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.420]
Hey, Frederick, why don't you, uh,

[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.440]
cheeseburger for me, yeah.

[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.420]
His name is Frederick Udicker.

[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.980]
There's no fact in the church.

[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:21.340]
Right.

[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.340]
But anyway, there it is.

[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.740]
And Denise looks lovely.

[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.340]
I'm telling you, she looks like a wonderful lady.

[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.640]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.260]
We got 600 open lines here today.

[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.500]
We got a lot of heavy duty important stuff going on.

[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.000]
We're looking for the Rick and Sons audience,

[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000]
but can't seem to find it.

[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:38.820]
Oh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.180]
Liz Wilde's spy reports.

[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.360]
Any of those hanging around?

[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.620]
Yeah, lots about the fact that Pete Volger has to keep going

[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:45.860]
in there and dragging around with the studio.

[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.940]
And they can't clean all your old stuff.

[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.460]
Clean all my old stuff.

[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.460]
You know, the stuff that's locked over in the DCF.

[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.000]
Oh, that's good.

[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.180]
Nice going there, Liz.

[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.120]
We're just wild about your choice, sweetheart.

[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.220]
You get back down to the negatives again.

[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:02.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.420]
Look at this enthusiastic response again here today.

[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.780]
But unlike yesterday, which is my first day back from vacation,

[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:07.700]
do I care today?

[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.000]
No.

[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.460]
No, because the phone is working fine.

[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.480]
And life is great.

[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.420]
We got a nice free meal here from our close friends

[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.860]
at Atlantic City Sub's in Hollywood,

[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:14.800]
which they are the best.

[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:15.540]
They're great.

[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.940]
We love them profusely.

[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.500]
And even said over a big bottle,

[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.800]
they stopped and picked it up.

[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.540]
A big two liter bottle of caffeine-free diet coke

[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:25.040]
because a lot of water and soda in here,

[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:29.300]
because South balcony is laying down on the job.

[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:29.960]
Come on, Sally.

[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.340]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:32.580]
Hello.

[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.120]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:35.620]
Yeah.

[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.880]
Bad chance of you're asking none here again, Schmuck.

[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:43.740]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.580]
Boy, and he was under a long time too.

[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.640]
Who better than Gun of Year?

[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.260]
Is it too bad?

[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:47.520]
Oh.

[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:48.720]
You're an asshole, man.

[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:49.420]
You're an idiot.

[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.660]
You're a Mooron.

[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:51.340]
No material.

[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.420]
You're about as funny as a broken leg.

[00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:55.900]
Here's Jacksonville.

[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.160]
Hello.

[00:56:59.420 --> 00:56:59.780]
Jacksonville.

[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:00.540]
Neil.

[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:01.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:01.660]
How you doing?

[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.180]
OK.

[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.380]
I was just calling to extend you the offer if you ever want to get out of that.

[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.220]
One horse down.

[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:07.800]
No.

[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:08.180]
No.

[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.420]
No, not coming up there.

[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.800]
Come up to Jacksonville.

[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.160]
No, not even to visit.

[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.200]
No, these people got nothing to say either.

[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.820]
If it ain't about the Jaguars, they got nothing.

[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.020]
I hear a rumor they beat the dolphins in a playoff game 62 to 7

[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:21.960]
as the rumor that I heard.

[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:29.840]
I heard a bunch of people talking about it was Mark and Tommy and Mark and Tommy and Danny and Jimmy.

[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:30.400]
Uh-huh.

[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.580]
And Danny and Jimmy are both gone now.

[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.580]
So what are we going to do now?

[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.360]
I don't know.

[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.380]
I guess punt.

[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.440]
I still.

[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:39.020]
OK.

[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:39.600]
Have a great day.

[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.120]
He said the people in Jacksonville got nothing to say.

[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:45.720]
I guess he was not the producer good guy.

[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.420]
He just didn't have too much material.

[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.480]
I call a rest of you.

[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the 18T line.

[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.280]
Am I eating any york in today?

[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:54.620]
Uh-huh.

[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.940]
And this has got too much fat in it by the way, but I'm eating it anyhow.

[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:04.900]
I feel great on my low fat high fiber diet, but he's cold cuts in the cheese too much fat.

[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.440]
I'm just making an exception because I wanted to get the soda.

[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:08.520]
And it worked.

[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.220]
You notice how it worked?

[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:11.440]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:11.780]
Hello.

[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.720]
Mobile in Hollywood.

[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:16.440]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:16.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.860]
I was calling about Rick and Sets.

[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:23.120]
I've listened to him a couple of times lately and it's just got really ponderous.

[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:24.960]
It's not funny anymore.

[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:25.780]
Doesn't seem like.

[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:28.900]
I don't think their format works in the morning.

[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.520]
I think they're much better afternoon drive.

[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:31.280]
Absolutely.

[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.000]
Format.

[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:36.720]
You know, it's like half the time now.

[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:39.620]
They got Gilbert doing something and I find that really.

[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:40.860]
Oh, I'm funny.

[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.620]
You know, an act of desperation.

[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:43.860]
You know, and.

[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:49.320]
They used to do like the payphone challenge and all those kind of things that were fun in the afternoon.

[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:49.920]
You know, and.

[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.060]
Can't do that kind of stuff in the morning because people were going to work.

[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.000]
I think what's Adam bailed out on him.

[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:55.880]
I think that was the end.

[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.420]
Yeah, well, they got to have somebody who's willing to go out and get arrested.

[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:00.340]
That's right.

[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:04.060]
Be the field guy, you know, because they don't have that.

[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:04.320]
And.

[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:05.920]
And I don't know.

[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.280]
They're humor just as kind of gotten stale on me.

[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:09.740]
I.

[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.540]
I tune him in.

[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:15.460]
I mean, sometimes you don't think I've noticed when I tune over there, it's always on commercial.

[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:16.060]
Yeah.

[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.820]
I mean, you know, how can it be?

[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.500]
I don't understand.

[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:23.900]
It must be some of the lot of cheap spot square channel because how do they sell these shows that I got like point twos and point five.

[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.160]
Yeah, but what's the point?

[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.400]
You know, let's see a.

[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:32.480]
I listen to some of the competition, you know, when they go to commercial law, they'll out over there to see what's up.

[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.220]
And every time I do that, they're on commercial too.

[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:35.100]
Now what my.

[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.180]
And I'll wait.

[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.840]
I'll wait for a minute or two and see when their commercials will get over.

[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:39.240]
Yeah.

[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.720]
And their commercials don't get over.

[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:46.660]
And I tune back to the other station and their commercials are already over, you know, you know, okay, listen, hang on.

[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.600]
I used to enjoy them a lot.

[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:48.800]
Yeah.

[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:49.880]
Have a good day.

[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:50.500]
Okay.

[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:50.860]
Goodbye.

[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.460]
I'm here and he's clicking and popping noises and I saw something really grow test cap in there.

[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.780]
I want to punch up line four here.

[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:57.920]
Hello.

[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.100]
Now did you see that?

[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.900]
I just punched up line four and it went out.

[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.000]
There's no dial tone.

[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.660]
There is nobody on here and it just went out by itself.

[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.480]
Now here we are.

[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.020]
I'm I'm feeling.

[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.740]
I just get you sing only moments ago that I'm feeling great.

[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.720]
I don't give a right to ask.

[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.940]
And here we are the second day.

[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:21.960]
There's line four.

[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.280]
There's line four.

[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.060]
There's line four.

[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.860]
There's line four.

[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.060]
There's line four.

[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.160]
There's line four.

[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:36.800]
There's line four.

[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:37.200]

[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:37.360]

[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:37.360]

[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.720]
There's line four.

[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:38.760]
There's line four.

[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:39.060]

[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.140]
There's line four.

[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.900]
There's line four.

[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:44.360]
Yeah.

[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.260]
Alright.

[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.880]
When I was at it just blonde

[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.440]
Yeah.

[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.020]
It's justla Rozipio, I said that

[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.020]
I was just about to do.

[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.260]
I have분ting one here.

[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.420]
That's back.

[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.080]
I was able...

[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.960]
You know, I don't have a right now on here.

[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.140]
You don't hear what I got at all cranked up this one.

[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.280]
6.5.

[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.660]
I got a down turn to the second gear.

[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.920]
5.670560.560 on the AT&T line.

[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.780]
Let's see if they're going to work today or not, huh?

[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.100]
Great mystery of life.

[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.680]
They're really expecting a lot of energy on this to get to the bottom of that.

[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.760]
And they're going to spend all that money on that big fancy, fancy,

[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.100]
phone system and guess what?

[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:50.640]
Is it going to work?

[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:50.840]
No.

[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:54.000]
No, because they still can't get to the bottom of it because they don't have the rest of my elbow.

[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.460]
Here's our last call, mobile and navel.

[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:57.780]
Hello?

[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.940]
Are you aware that Al Rantel is doing info marshals on the radio?

[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:02.580]
No.

[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.380]
Yes.

[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.200]
You're helping you.

[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.100]
And they played like it's beat it up.

[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.280]
Alus Rantel?

[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.720]
And it sounds like a chipmunks video.

[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:13.260]
Yeah.

[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.400]
And the first one I heard was on a colon cleanse.

[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.220]
And now he's going on for Alabama.

[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.080]
Welcome.

[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:20.540]
Yeah.

[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.900]
I just thought you'd be interested.

[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:23.780]
Thanks for the good news.

[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.680]
And not interested, but thanks for killing about 20 seconds.

[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.620]
Okay, that's it.

[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:28.960]
We're out of business here today, I guess.

[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.380]
Boy, talk about a fast turnaround.

[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:32.860]
We were going along there pretty good.

[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.200]
And then all of a sudden we started having some phone problems.

[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.820]
Some mysterious phone action here on his phone.

[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:41.760]
See what's going on here.

[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.000]
Seven won't even stay on.

[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.420]
I punch it on and it won't even stay on.

[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.520]
Look at that.

[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:58.980]
It goes out.

[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:04.240]
Come here.

[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.000]
We don't have that.

[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.320]
We show for about 10 seconds.

[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.060]
Your line seven doesn't seem to be either.

[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.580]
Five six seven oh five sixty.

[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.040]
We're going to be playing music today pretty quick.

[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.060]
I can see that to give you a chance to eat some more sandwiches.

[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:19.860]
Out of town line is eight seven seven eight five sixty three forty five.

[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:20.380]
Any hear that?

[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.360]
There's no difference.

[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.600]
There's nothing that's changed here.

[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.420]
It's making popping and puking sound just like it wasn't we before.

[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.240]
I left for a vacation.

[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.540]
Putting this new different instrument here didn't change a goddamn thing.

[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.180]
We got to your one phone.

[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.920]
I'm resetting the phone in the other room that popping.

[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.240]
Yeah, well, what does that mean?

[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:41.360]
They're resetting the phone trying to see if that this is a radio station that cannot put a phone system on the.

[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.560]
The air to do talk shows that work.

[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.040]
This is on be it's on a heard of in the history of the human effing race.

[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:49.520]
This is on a heard of.

[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:58.780]
This is like a there would be like Ford motor company and general motors and Chrysler unable to build an automobile engine.

[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.700]
And expecting you to buy their product.

[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.180]
We can't make a phone system work in here.

[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.180]
Here's a mobile and pop it'll be chill out.

[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:11.560]
Yeah, yes sir.

[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.560]
Why do you guys always make fun of the Haitian people there?

[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:15.980]
Here's a mobile and Hollywood.

[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:16.360]
Hello.

[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.100]
Mobile and Hollywood.

[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.520]
Hey, all it's up.

[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.340]
Okay.

[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.420]
I call to see if you think the bar is going to kick the panthers butt tonight or what?

[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.780]
If I think he's going to play them all by himself.

[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.420]
Oh, they're going to give them about 25 minutes today.

[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:37.020]
No, I think the Rangers are going to get their ass whips and I think they're going to like life and death.

[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.600]
Oh, I think they're going to have life and death for a higher pamphletine cut against the girls team last night.

[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.300]
They got a tie.

[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.140]
Oh, that's because it's like Kevin Kirk.

[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.380]
Yeah, Captain Kirk.

[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.660]
If it wasn't for Captain Kirk, they would have got their ass whipped.

[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:52.780]
Okay, so call me back when you know something about the game which you don't just like everybody else in this town.

[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:53.960]
I saw the game.

[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:54.500]
Okay, sir.

[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.080]
What?

[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.620]
It seems to be working.

[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.460]
It's pretty exciting.

[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.860]
Yeah, mobile and Miami on four is actually working.

[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.180]
Hello.

[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.760]
Hey, Neil, what's up?

[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.500]
You're on a magic line, sir.

[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.820]
How about a magic line?

[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.180]
The only one that works here.

[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.000]
Hey, aren't you wishing you would be back in Amsterdam or what?

[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:11.300]
Yeah.

[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.080]
These people down here are really dating a lot.

[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.200]
Okay, thanks for your material, sir.

[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.040]
56670560, Pompah.

[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.980]
They have no material.

[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.260]
Not even 1130 in their own material.

[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:29.840]
Rick and Suds and Suds and Rick and Jimmy and Danny and Suds and Danny and Rick and Jimmy and Davie.

[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.760]
Kim Volkapper talks sports.

[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.260]
We can't right here.

[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:38.420]
On sports radio 5668AM.

[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.840]
She roams an ancient mythical land wearing body armor, taking names and kicking butt.

[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.960]
That's not even a killer!

[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:50.440]
But in the quiet moments, a loaded camp she was plagued by anxiety.

[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:51.520]
She is?

[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.000]
What if that guy had friends and they come after me?

[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.700]
Oh, what if I got out of provisions out here?

[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.280]
Oh, what if I'm tight cat to the left, man?

[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.320]
Sina, where are your princess?

[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.520]
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.

[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:08.960]
She knew how to handle a fuddle attack had gone by a bunch of heathens in fake fur with Australian accents.

[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.600]
Gabrielle, what's this like?

[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.400]
Just to take the high down!

[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.740]
But Sina, where are your princess?

[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.940]
Couldn't handle a panic attack had met night by a bunch of nagging doubts.

[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:22.140]
Oh, my outfit, the little skit rice, and the baby.

[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.780]
I think I'm starting to walk like a girl.

[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.160]
Oh no!

[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.780]
Now even I think I'm a lesbian!

[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.760]
Sina, where are your princess?

[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.160]
Wait, after some other show whose time you can never remember.

[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.340]
Oh god, I hope we don't get canceled.

[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.060]
It's 1131 at 560 WQA, and I think we already did.

[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.020]
I think we've been canceled here on this station.

[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.520]
567O, I asked yesterday about the WSDJ,

[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.680]
I had to go for an hour and 20 minutes before I get one person to tell me what that was.

[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.160]
I asked about the talented Mr. Ripley, if anybody has seen it, is it worth going to see?

[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.420]
Have we had one call about that?

[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:54.580]
No!

[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:54.880]
No.

[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.000]
This is a town where the public...

[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.660]
It's not just hockey, it's any topic you pick, I've told you this before, and it's the truth.

[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:03.740]
You pick the subject, can they talk about it?

[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:03.900]
No!

[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.700]
They know what you're talking about, can they have an opinion?

[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:05.900]
No!

[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:06.200]
No!

[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:06.200]

[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.220]
And I'm supposed to be doing a talk show here in this town.

[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.300]
With a bunch of people who's basic, uh, general comedies...

[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:14.760]
EEEE!

[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.180]
That's what they got.

[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.900]
That old guy, the Red Wing fan, that got dumped, they will never get on the year again.

[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.680]
These things, like I said yesterday, the people that call are the ones that you never want to talk to again.

[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.460]
That bitch that calls yesterday, she went and bet on Hank's horse over the weekend allegedly,

[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:35.940]
and therefore somehow she's in her convoluted mind, she's got a notion that I owe her hockey tickets for tonight's game.

[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.520]
Do I have any hockey tickets to give away?

[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:38.760]
No!

[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.940]
Did I say anything yesterday about giving away hockey tickets?

[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:41.140]
No!

[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.680]
She's not even listening to God damn show!

[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:47.300]
But she takes time out of her busy day of work to call me to suck around for hockey tickets,

[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.000]
which I don't have in her first place, and if I did she wouldn't get them anyway.

[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.260]
That's the nature of the population in this town.

[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.920]
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.820]
What are you giving away today?

[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:57.660]
What do you got?

[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.560]
Because I ain't got nothing.

[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.260]
Here's a mobile and West Palm. Hello.

[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:04.640]
Uh, Neil.

[01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:05.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:06.500]
Hey, how you doing today?

[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:06.880]
Okay.

[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:07.960]
How are we doing?

[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:11.420]
We're doing good for about, uh, an hour and a half, and all of a sudden we ran a brick wall here.

[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.260]
Hey, I'm not looking for any free ticket turning thing.

[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.740]
I get tickets to the Daytona 500.

[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.320]
I'm heading north on the turnpike right now.

[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:18.560]
Yeah.

[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.060]
You didn't know, uh, what's your pick was for the Daytona 500 on Sunday?

[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:22.620]
My nose.

[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.740]
It's for nose pickers.

[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.460]
Yeah, you don't have a favorite?

[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.980]
What do you mean by that?

[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.140]
Who's going to win the race?

[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:30.520]
I have no idea.

[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:31.760]
Do you think I'm into auto racing?

[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.260]
You think I hear about that craft?

[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.540]
You don't follow it?

[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.000]
No, not in the least.

[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:36.860]
Come on.

[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:37.900]
No way Jose.

[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.600]
America's favorite?

[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:40.300]
Four.

[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.420]
Yeah, and vanilla ice cream is the most popular flavor.

[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.180]
Have a good time, pal.

[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:43.760]
Get out of here.

[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.460]
America's favorite sport.

[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.720]
Next to golf, how about that tiger hot?

[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.740]
Who's my pick?

[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.580]
I'd rather talk to the guy that called yesterday.

[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.340]
Want to know how I arranged my plate?

[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:55.940]
Wasn't that it?

[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.940]
Oh, how I attacked him a faith.

[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.320]
I'd rather talk to Don Deloise about how I arranged my plate.

[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.440]
Remember that?

[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.680]
That was, that was a great line.

[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.580]
It was chastising junior for how he run, how he runs his plate.

[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.220]
And I agree.

[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:14.940]
You saved the best up for last.

[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:16.560]
Not me.

[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.660]
Well, you'd see again, you're out of step with reality.

[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.020]
It's just not the way that intelligent people operate.

[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.820]
You saved the real good stuff for last.

[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:25.280]
Say, if something is the saver, like the potatoes are rotten.

[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.080]
You save those like right till the very end.

[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.380]
Like the green beans, the wax beans, eat those first, or the peas.

[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.380]
Okay, whatever you save, pal.

[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.800]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.000]
Here's the mobile in four-letter, huh?

[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:44.800]
Hello.

[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:46.460]
Neil.

[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.460]
Yes, I am.

[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.500]
Oh, I didn't think I had to there.

[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.160]
Here I am.

[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.680]
Listen, I got a delivery company, right?

[01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:53.280]
Yes.

[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.580]
Work one day.

[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.420]
And there's a delivery ticket there from the Archdiocese down in Miami.

[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.540]
I know that you're a favorite people.

[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.460]
Oh, yeah.

[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.020]
Right, so I'm looking at the delivery ticket.

[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.500]
And it says, a big expense of bedroom set.

[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:10.260]
$25,000 they spend on this bedroom set.

[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:17.500]
To take some million dollar house in Coral Springs to keep their little priests there happy and living in luxury.

[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:23.400]
And so after I see this ticket, I need to go to church all the time, right?

[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:24.700]
I say that.

[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.180]
I'm contributing my money every month or every week for this church.

[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:32.400]
So they can go out and spend $25,000 on a bedroom set.

[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.380]
Then I can't even afford a $2500 bedroom set.

[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.000]
And someday they might need some of your money for a sex change operation for your priest to buy them.

[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:39.520]
Yeah, right?

[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.380]
So then I quit in the church.

[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:44.780]
I quit going to the church, right?

[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.660]
But my wife still goes.

[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.200]
Why is that?

[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.220]
So last Sunday she goes to church and what happens?

[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.260]
The Archdiocese in Miami has a special announcement.

[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.760]
They need more money because they want to do another project.

[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.160]
Uh-huh.

[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:58.620]
I told my wife, you have one more thing of my money over there.

[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.940]
And I don't have the money.

[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:01.640]
You're ass, right?

[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:02.420]
Yeah, right.

[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.120]
Sorry, let me tell you.

[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:11.000]
I can't even, I haven't been to have the things that I want to do in my life and I got to give money to a church.

[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:15.520]
Well, at least while you're still breathing, wake up and sniff the daffodils, man, before it's too late.

[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:16.340]
I'm telling you.

[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.820]
When they asked you for money, just say, no.

[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.960]
This telling my Nancy Reagan told me, just saying, man.

[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.940]
That's how they give away stuff to the poverty for people.

[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.160]
Okay, God bless you, sir.

[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.060]
Yeah, right.

[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:26.680]
God bless you.

[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.920]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:40.120]
It's called my stock guy yesterday afternoon had a lengthy conversation with him having a meeting with him again this afternoon and I said,

[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:40.780]
lonely $50.

[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.220]
And you know what he said?

[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:49.320]
Yeah, 5, 6, 7, 05, 60 pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:53.440]
I don't think he knows his ass from IEL, but I'll fight out this afternoon.

[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.180]
I'm a little bit skeptical of this guy.

[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.360]
A little bit skeptical.

[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.880]
When somebody is handling your money, leads you down the garden path one time.

[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.200]
I don't think you want to give an opportunity to do a second time.

[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:02.320]
No.

[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:07.800]
If you're smart, in other words, when he kind of leads you astray with maybe some misinformation, but I'll find out.

[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.280]
Give him the benefit of the doubt for about five minutes.

[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.800]
Anybody see the amazing Mr.

[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:12.080]
No.

[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:12.440]
No.

[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:13.400]
Mr. Doubtfire?

[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.200]
Here's Miami.

[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.060]
Hello.

[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.280]
Neil, how you doing?

[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:17.620]
Great.

[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.280]
Yeah, I'm calling about that movie.

[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.800]
I went to see it with my girlfriend, another couple.

[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.440]
And I thought it was exceeding the average, if not boring.

[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:27.500]
Exceeding the average?

[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:27.940]
Yes.

[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:32.420]
I mean, there's some faggy overtones that you might get into, but nothing like a...

[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:33.400]
I'm not into overtones.

[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.340]
I like blatant, you know?

[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.860]
Well, you're not going to find it there.

[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.620]
I just thought the movie was too long, you know what I mean?

[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.760]
But it didn't suck, but I just didn't think it was that good.

[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.900]
They didn't suck, then I don't want to do it.

[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.160]
I guess the guy Jude Law is pretty good looking, I don't know.

[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:47.600]
Who?

[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:51.280]
The actor in that movie, Jude Law, I think, his name?

[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.460]
The guy that played the husband?

[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:53.360]
Yeah.

[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.460]
The guy opposite Matt Damon.

[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:56.480]
I never saw him.

[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.460]
Well, what's wrong with Matt Damon?

[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.100]
He's okay.

[01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.040]
I don't know.

[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:00.840]
He's about a five and a half on a scale of 30.

[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.160]
He's a little strange, you're right.

[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.120]
Plus, he hangs out with that Ben Affleck too much.

[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:05.780]
Right, right.

[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:09.120]
Hey, what's my first basketball game last night?

[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.680]
Not that you really give a crap, but I thought the arena was pretty nice today.

[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.460]
Have you been down there yet?

[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:12.720]
No.

[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:13.780]
Why would I go down there?

[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.780]
What do they have that I want to see?

[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.000]
Oh, that's true.

[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.280]
They have a lot of people disguised as yellow NPCs, I hear.

[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:18.980]
But other than that.

[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.360]
It was pretty empty last night.

[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.340]
Glad you got a chance to see him beat up on a girl's team.

[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:22.680]
That's good.

[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.160]
We're going to do the same thing in the other arena tonight.

[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.100]
Okay, that's one I haven't been to yet.

[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.760]
I haven't seen an arcade game before, but anyway, I'll be watching on TV though.

[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.200]
All right.

[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:31.860]
All right, that's it.

[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.660]
Now we're going to kick that Ranger ass tonight, boy.

[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.180]
What a joke.

[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.240]
That gigantic payroll, that overstuffed payroll, especially that Theo Fairy.

[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:39.660]
Oh, last night.

[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.680]
Talk about a little actor, Theo Fairy.

[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.400]
I'm sure he was doing something in the backseat of the car.

[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.000]
He wasn't asleep.

[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:48.940]
Actually, like somebody smacked him in the head.

[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.240]
Like this in the meantime.

[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.500]
There, you know, Tampa Bay is like all the way to center rice.

[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.480]
There, there, he's like behind his own net.

[01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:04.320]
Or the other, he's somewhere lost Theo Fairy, a big, big, little tiny piece of crap.

[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.900]
Does that make sense to you a big tiny?

[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:07.800]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.960]
He's small in size, but big and crap ratio.

[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.340]
Of course, we know a lot of little people like that.

[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.120]
I wasn't talking about you.

[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:18.980]
Now, don't take it personal.

[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:19.440]
No, no.

[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.040]
Like what's his name, Martin Short.

[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:22.920]
Okay.

[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.000]
What kind of a name is that?

[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.160]
For God, that's short.

[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:27.700]
Approximately.

[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.940]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:35.340]
What's the guy's name that writes, what was the Randy Newman?

[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.220]
The short people thing.

[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.180]
Right, he's short.

[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:39.060]
Exactly.

[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:41.060]
And he's also got a complex.

[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.900]
You got a complex, Randy, you're short.

[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.280]
Ha, ha, ha, you're short.

[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.300]
Oh, by the way, when's the Tom Green thing coming on with, with what's your name?

[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:48.660]
Monica.

[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.740]
There we had it.

[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.020]
They already did it.

[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:52.400]
Yeah.

[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:53.800]
While I was gone.

[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:54.280]
Yeah.

[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.220]
No, no.

[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.140]
It was lame.

[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.880]
It was a bunch of cell purses.

[01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.960]
A Monica line of handbags.

[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.020]
And he participated in this.

[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:03.460]
Yeah.

[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.340]
It's incredibly, uh, so impressive.

[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.180]
I'm so sorry, Tom.

[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.640]
You're really good once upon a time.

[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.000]
You were kind of like Rick Riley.

[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:13.920]
You were really okay.

[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.200]
That was bad.

[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.120]
I should actually say Tom Green was like Rick Riley.

[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.400]
Get the, get the light saw, please.

[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.260]
They both have beers.

[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.560]
Twenty before, uh, noon, noon.

[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:24.400]
It's only noon.

[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:25.840]
Jesus Christ.

[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.240]
Wow.

[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.460]
For the whole 20 minutes ago, I would have thought this was a 10 minutes show today.

[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.340]
We're going to zip through this thing like grease lightning.

[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.760]
And then I hit that first fruit up phone and that was the beginning of the game.

[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.380]
Not that I want to start with that phone crap again.

[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:40.660]
Oh, yeah, we got a news.

[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.160]
Look at that.

[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:41.480]
Look at that.

[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.040]
It looks like the same other one to me.

[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.000]
Same piece of crap.

[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.020]
In fact, for all we know, it is the same piece of crap.

[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:47.680]
And I watched him.

[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.480]
Oh, you watch him actually physically do it.

[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.600]
And it's still a piece of crap.

[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:51.740]
Still sucks.

[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.480]
So the math thing and movie really blows.

[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.000]
So I'm sure you're glad I'm not missing something good.

[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.800]
Twenty before noon at 5.60.QM, I think I already said that.

[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:00.120]
Didn't I?

[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:00.500]
Uh-huh.

[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.980]
Maybe you know my job.

[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:03.680]
He shorts.

[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.840]
There was a no farmer who lived on a ride.

[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.640]
He's adding the meadow just chasing his pit.

[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:15.640]
That some boys who were down by the creek.

[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.880]
There be in the waters, there ends on their marbles and play things

[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.420]
and at that pass-four.

[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.420]
There came a young lady.

[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.420]
She looked like a pretty young creature.

[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.200]
She sat on the grass.

[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:34.220]
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rumbles and latens

[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.920]
and white fluffy duck.

[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:41.040]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children.

[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.800]
So they would not sit.

[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.620]
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling wrapped

[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.720]
you send later thrown yesterday's hunt.

[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.140]
While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her.

[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.400]
I let the fellow down by the dot.

[01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:01.540]
He looked like a man with a pile of old home in the country

[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.220]
with a big fence out front.

[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:08.220]
If he asked her for a mic, she'd show him her little pet dog

[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.160]
who was subject to fence.

[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.500]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender

[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.900]
and with the movement so quick.

[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.960]
And then she'd bend over and suck down his candy.

[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:23.700]
So tasty made a butter sky.

[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:27.780]
And then he spread whipped cream all over her cookies

[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:30.540]
that she had left out on her shelf.

[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.440]
If you think this is dirty, you can go f*** yourself.

[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.160]
14 still knowing at 5.60 WK, how about his little girl

[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.720]
14 year old Nova student.

[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.000]
Do you see her father on the news this morning?

[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:43.960]
No.

[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:45.700]
And his pick up truck or whatever he was driving.

[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.900]
Oh, well, she's okay.

[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.520]
This should be her worst problem.

[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.620]
She never saw a freight train or some stuff like that.

[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.740]
Now, she's harmless.

[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:53.420]
She's a good girl.

[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.080]
She made a mistake.

[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.040]
She didn't realize the severity of what she did.

[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:57.000]
What she did.

[01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.860]
She threatened when email.

[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:01.220]
Oh, that's a good girl.

[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.400]
Her name was Vincent Pytoway to last name.

[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.040]
It's just in the newspapers.

[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.860]
And of course the newspapers never get a right.

[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.540]
They were withholding her identity.

[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:11.320]
They had her picture in the name and everything on the news this morning.

[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.480]
What's wrong with you people?

[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.180]
Is it those papers?

[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.280]
Can you get anything right?

[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:14.620]
No.

[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.340]
No, Jesus.

[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:15.800]
God.

[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:16.960]
At least you're consistent.

[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.080]
And the threatening letter, a February 7 email sent by a 14 year old girl

[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.660]
to Nova Middle School was full of errors.

[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.840]
And maybe that's why she's pissed off.

[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:26.960]
Did I give it a good education?

[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.340]
You know what I say?

[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.840]
I say fry her ass.

[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.640]
Not that I'm in favor capital punishment so much, but in this case I'll make an exception.

[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.960]
She wrote the letter on a form taken from an educational website.

[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.160]
Just remember what I told you.

[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:46.980]
The internet is good and the internet is evil.

[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:50.160]
But on the scales of justice, the thing.

[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:54.860]
The evil far outweighs the good at this point.

[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:00.280]
Every nerd, every misfit, every lunatic, every dangerous person.

[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.680]
In fact, our bald-headed Mike from sales down there that I saw outside yesterday,

[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:06.820]
changed book and he said, he told me, you're right.

[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:08.820]
He said, I'm the one that's going to snap.

[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.520]
That's what he said.

[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.080]
He said, I don't know what it's going to snap.

[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.060]
And you better not be in the building when I something like that.

[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.080]
And so I think I forgot something at home.

[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.780]
This is the letter that she wrote.

[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:23.760]
This 14 year old young thing.

[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.100]
I'm going to blow the school up on February 23.

[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.200]
If not then sooner or when you least expected, don't even bother trying to find me

[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.080]
because I assure you won't then don't bother shutting down the school.

[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.800]
Because if you do, I'll and there's no apostrophes or area.

[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.260]
I'll come earlier or later and blow up novo middle school slash high school.

[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:44.620]
I think it would be in your best interest to move out of the FN country.

[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.600]
If you think of shutting down the school with one tee.

[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.480]
And even if you do, I'll still find you.

[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.620]
So granted, just watch me.

[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.240]
This school is going down with Dr. Adkins in it.

[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.460]
And that's not Dr. Dr. Bob Adkins.

[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.860]
No, maybe she didn't lose any weight on the adkins diet.

[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:58.920]
Oh, it's a different Dr. Adkins.

[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.400]
Going down with the Dr. Adkins in it.

[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.440]
And if he's not in the school when I blow it up, I'll just go to his FN house

[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.660]
and have my own FN ways.

[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.920]
If I'll give you a hint who I'm I am.

[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:11.740]
We were worst mother ever enemy and see you later at your graveyard.

[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.620]
This school is going down with everyone in it.

[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.020]
Well, nice talking to you deadbeats.

[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.780]
And the father says she's a good girl.

[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:21.820]
She made a mistake.

[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.740]
She's harmless.

[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.880]
She didn't realize the severity of what she did.

[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.740]
And if you take a look at this, this is a, I don't know what pay.

[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.320]
It's in the B section of the heraldous morning local section.

[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.880]
Student held an email threat.

[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:38.900]
If you look at the letter.

[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:40.540]
This is on the inside page.

[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.380]
And see the literacy.

[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:46.080]
I mean, the grammar and the spelling and a punctuation and lack thereof.

[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.620]
And she's 14 year old girl in middle school.

[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:01.800]
There's something really, really wrong in this country.

[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.080]
Something really stinks.

[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.640]
You can smell the stench of Kalmanur hanging over this performance by this thing.

[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:13.200]
And the father says,

[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:13.960]
why is she a bad girl?

[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:13.960]

[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.540]
That's my suggestion that she won't do it again.

[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.280]
And the best part of the whole deal is that after they let her out of this whatever

[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.560]
where she's being suspended and held in whatever they're doing,

[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.720]
the audio is automatic.

[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.640]
She gets her ass kicked out of school which I says is a good idea.

[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:25.860]
Then let her back in the building.

[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:29.480]
And the father's attitude, just like always.

[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.040]
Well, you know, she didn't mean nothing bad and she's a good girl.

[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.600]
And this should be the worst thing she ever does.

[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.140]
in the yada yada yada I mean I saw him there this morning 15 to 20 times at

[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:43.220]
least doing his best to minimize life there like uh... ain't no big deal

[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.820]
here's Hollywood hello

[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.440]
yeah sir maybe she's eligible for a voucher under Bush's school plan now

[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:52.820]
uh...

[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.580]
uh... speaking of Bush did you know why

[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:57.840]
you see any of the debate last night no i did not

[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.940]
i've watched a lot of hockey games last night i had no interest in watching

[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:01.600]
uh... crap

[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:05.840]
i know you don't want to keep it but i'm registered republican so i got

[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.560]
a vote for one three characters come up come up

[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.420]
yesterday don't want any of those three

[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:14.200]
well those three bible something right wing uh... in total assholes no

[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.260]
i'm gonna pick the game over the other three because

[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:21.740]
bush is paranoid he still must be uh... lingering from the effects of coke

[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:23.840]
you ask anything about his past yeah

[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.080]
and he's like his eyes that will run around like a pinball machine

[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.760]
yet i saw some of the excerpts this morning they showed him uh... they showed

[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.300]
them screaming at each other and pointing and

[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:34.480]
and you know they're not talking about any issues at all all they're doing is

[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:37.360]
talking about who's doing the dirtiest campaign calling each other names it's

[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.880]
like a bunch of little children and what the spars is doing in the middle

[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.640]
who's got about one ten to one percent of the vote what else he do it in

[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:42.840]
their

[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:46.340]
he said he's an ambassador what country he ambassador to

[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:47.440]
your a miss

[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.500]
but yet at least McCain we got a track record on him

[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.760]
uh... so it comes every to the game and broadly a mechanic or at least you

[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.540]
know what you're getting yeah bush

[01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.720]
you just don't trust them

[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.280]
so it's like

[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.680]
i agree with that if i had a choose which i would hate to have to make a choice

[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.540]
but if i had to choose between the king and bush will be no contest

[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.320]
well i wouldn't vote for bush if they are the gun to my head

[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.680]
and plus two he's not

[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.560]
he's kicking in his own money he's uh...

[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.720]
mccain's getting matching government funds and

[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.000]
wishes just getting money

[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.480]
all of a sudden you notice yesterday at the last moment because he's in a panic

[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.920]
that he's going to wind up losing South Carolina which would be the beginning of

[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.920]
the end for him all north to our line was really the beginning but that'll be

[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.160]
like the last day of his coffin

[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:31.600]
so now the sudden what's what's talking about campaign finance reform

[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.780]
and he's getting from all forces uh... i'd rather have a dad back in office

[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:37.940]
than him

[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:40.360]
yeah at least at least is dead and lied too much

[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.840]
yeah except for the taxes will have a great day you take care

[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.840]
and at least he got that sad about it didn't get him out no

[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:52.000]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight t and t wireless

[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.280]

that's right

[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:06.260]

[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.200]
the amount of what i paid

[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.340]
they are the best

[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.040]
or the the big the in men's home

[01:24:59.040 --> 01:24:59.360]
yeah

[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.360]
all brother

[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.100]
well he i'm a part of the thing i like something big talk about big i just

[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:07.540]
have never seen anything that vivid and that massive yeah i would agree

[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:11.000]
uh... i'm not playing a lot of rickinson drop-ins on here is a subliminal so

[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.760]
maybe we can get him back up to a point three i feel bad for that i feel sorry for

[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:17.400]
them i listen to them almost every day i've read i had a diary of a waste

[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:17.780]
back

[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.440]
and i didn't have a real ways back yet

[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.240]
i have the art of tron i feel the men

[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.580]
you know and it's a shame because i love for a concert it's sad listening to

[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.000]
them in here in twenty minutes

[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.340]
without a call

[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:33.180]
and then having them banter back in port between the news guy in the web and the

[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:33.840]
traffic lady

[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.640]
and it's that i remember what it was like

[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.300]
when we see you and then uh...

[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:39.880]
and mike

[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.200]
and rick and in randy at night are hanket night

[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.580]
and i think exactly

[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.260]
and uh... they were so fun that

[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:48.700]
uh... but listening to rick

[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:49.640]
uh... you know

[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:53.720]
and i think it's that also one of your same does he found the press in

[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.140]
psychotic because they're not getting a response and they know they have no

[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.440]
audience and they're just waiting for the hammer to fall is that it

[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.620]
and i think that's it

[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:00.980]
i don't mean that

[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:02.640]
about being in the morning

[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.120]
the one good thing about being in the morning we don't have to hear

[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.460]
uh... rick's uh... stock market reports

[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.300]
so i think that was the beginning of the end

[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:11.760]
but i don't want to tell rick wants to talk about

[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.360]
the real beginning was the computer talk and then the real nail in the

[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:15.660]
coffin

[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:19.140]
was well uh... fair value is down to and a half and is a

[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:23.440]
uh... i mean i'm sorry but the idea of rick rally is a stock market expert to

[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:23.620]
me

[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:25.680]
is uh... i just can't deal with it

[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.760]
exactly but you know that i love it

[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.060]
and i think that i was in too long

[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.080]
i was kids to live i hope because i know he's been doing everything try to get

[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.740]
them killed you know what i was

[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:37.220]
i think that still alive i don't know how much longer rick can be alive with

[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:40.160]
everything go with the ratings and everything before he goes before he does

[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.780]
i want you to see did he talk about this at all they mentioned on the

[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:46.020]
year the fact that they can't find an audience or they just uh...

[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:46.960]
sometimes

[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.280]
just that they will sit there and you will hear

[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.140]
you know that talking back and forth or out of sometimes outbound calls but

[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:54.740]
it's it's a fact that i remember

[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.640]
you know i it's not rick and such fault you a lot of it is not you got to

[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.560]
blame the station for lack of promotion

[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.240]
dammit

[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:05.340]
uh... and you know they're they're just and then the station is not behind them

[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:08.980]
and that company is not behind them and they've destroyed rick and so it's

[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:14.240]
dammit dammit and uh... and also i like that i'm at school so it's an

[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.360]
also they get the i think i think that when adam left i think that was

[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.200]
dammit yeah

[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:22.520]
and i think that's like jumping off the Titanic it was a no-brainer you know

[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:25.100]
don't think i'm gonna talk about the new way

[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.600]

[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:51.080]
just on my show alone they were getting like a hundred dollars more spot and amazingly all of

[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:54.260]
a sudden they made all this money on it yeah well it's just good to show you that they were bad

[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:58.160]
business people is what cocks is problem and they were two of us that's with a stupid dolphin crap

[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:05.680]
money and the stuff that's making them money they don't pay any attention to you are absolutely

[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:12.060]
correct yes i and it's a real shame yeah let me show the old man George is a great guy left talking to

[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:24.020]
tape however uh George is uh he's i know he's probably got a smile on his face but he is really

[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:28.000]
i actually he's doing something turning around the other way so i'm looking at him i said

[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:49.300]
bad about those amendments you know they're cute little dogs but to don't get one that's my

[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.560]
best advice it's just like that stock i don't want to mention which one don't buy it and don't

[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:58.080]

don't buy it don't get sucked into it don't be an idiot don't be a fool in fact i talk to

[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:07.300]
somebody yesterday who's in that business and they agree with me he said oh oh boy i can't tell you

[01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:13.100]
which one it is though nine minutes past noon at five sixty all i'll tell you is that George and

[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:46.880]
okay

[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.480]
take them to the list take him to the right

[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:56.380]
let's take a look at it

[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:01.860]
SAL movie

[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:03.740]
The giant green ocean.

[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.960]
The giant green ocean.

[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:08.760]
The giant green ocean.

[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:14.220]
Prophetic at 5.50 WQM, I want to apologize profusely to everybody including myself.

[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.680]
You know, that guy was talking about the dogs, the Westminster dog show, which is very enjoyable, only because you laugh at the people.

[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.340]
Nobody pays any attention to the dogs.

[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.160]
It's the people acting like assholes and prancid around with a little, oh, God, it's unbelievable.

[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:27.740]
What did they look at the dogs and but?

[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:32.880]
Maybe they're into it.

[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:34.340]
Welcome.

[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:35.320]
But anyway.

[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:43.260]
No, no, listen, coming from a culture where they like take six year old boys penis out of their genes and to check and see if it's growing in the line up.

[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.040]
That's your people.

[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:45.880]
No, no, no.

[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:48.300]
What do you do if not your culture and your people work funny hats?

[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:49.740]
Some, the chacitam.

[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:50.960]
Some, that's not my people.

[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:51.740]
No, they're barbarians.

[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:52.900]
Those are lords.

[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:54.140]
That's what they were talking about.

[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:54.620]
That's what they were saying.

[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:57.800]
Yeah.

[01:38:58.680 --> 01:38:59.000]
Yeah.

[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.360]
So anyway, what was it just apologizing for?

[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:02.480]
Oh, yeah, I was thinking about those that show.

[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.840]
How did I get sucked into that?

[01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:06.500]
See, I'm really in spite of this image of being a prick.

[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:07.500]
I'm too nice to the guy.

[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:08.160]
I'm too easy.

[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.700]
Otherwise, I could have a 40-year.

[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:15.100]
I could do a really good show every day instead of getting sucked into the ruling the show someday because of a bunch of selfish idiots out there.

[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.860]
Case in point, what I'm apologizing for when I got that doggy book.

[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:20.920]
That was list.

[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:24.640]
That was probably the even worse than the days when I was doing those awful guests.

[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.400]
Hello, doctor.

[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:26.620]
Even worse than that.

[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.820]
Where's the German Shepherd on the list?

[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:31.620]
Where's the schnauzer?

[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.160]
Now, I got a schnauzer on your account.

[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.420]
That's where the schnauzer is.

[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:35.720]
Okay.

[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.900]
Jack asked, how did I get sucked into that?

[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.300]
And of course, flooded with calls.

[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:44.380]
That's the kind of thing they can talk about.

[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:47.660]
You know, I'm getting a feeling about this line seven now.

[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:49.480]
I don't want to start something.

[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.800]
No, maybe it's okay.

[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:52.960]
What? You're not in your head.

[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:53.420]
It's okay.

[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:54.760]
You sure it's okay?

[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.380]
I don't know.

[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.600]
Sometimes I wonder if that's feedback that's starting up.

[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.320]
You sure?

[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:02.660]
Are you positive?

[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:03.480]
Or is working?

[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:04.940]
Okay.

[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:09.100]
Just check it on that because that's the only one that seems to be at the moment having a little bit of indecisive nature.

[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:11.680]
Here's a mobile and key lardo.

[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:12.000]
Hello?

[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:13.000]
Hello, Neil.

[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:13.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:14.280]
Yeah.

[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.760]
I just want to call you today.

[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:16.940]
They have these. They have my life.

[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:17.300]
Yes.

[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:19.100]
I got to be ready for it.

[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:19.840]
What's up?

[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:20.960]
You're at direct TV, huh?

[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:21.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:22.760]
I got my satellite dish.

[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:24.020]
I got it in Starl last night.

[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.300]
And better yet, I'm going to get to go tell my cable company where they can stick it.

[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:28.980]
All right.

[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:31.860]
I got my cable bill Valentine's Day.

[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.980]
That's some kind of Valentine's Day present, isn't it?

[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:35.440]
Yeah. Well, you're going to set up a better one.

[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.640]
Yes, I am.

[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:40.560]
Well, I just wanted to tell you a thing.

[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:41.840]
I'm going to Las Vegas.

[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.160]
Come March 1st.

[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.160]
Do we see the day I'll be out of here?

[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:45.740]
All right.

[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:46.620]
All right.

[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:47.480]
Have a great time, pal.

[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.680]
Okay. Thank you, Neil.

[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:49.140]
See you.

[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:49.460]
Bye-bye.

[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:50.920]
This guy got direct TV.

[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:51.620]
He got his dick.

[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:52.920]
There's a guy with a brain.

[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.780]
He went and got a dish.

[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.880]
He's just telling the cable company F off.

[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:59.520]
By the way, speaking of Vegas, Hank yesterday, he's poked his head in for a couple of minutes.

[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.020]
I asked him about the National Airlines thing.

[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.260]
And he did come back when he was out there in Vegas a couple of weeks ago.

[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.320]
He didn't come back on National and he said it was great.

[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:09.960]
He said we love Las Vegas National Airlines.

[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.440]
We love them profusely.

[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:15.000]
In fact, that's from all of us here at QA, especially me and Hank.

[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.020]
Not that we're sucking them on for free trips or anything.

[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:18.300]
Are we?

[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:18.980]
We are.

[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:19.620]
I'm sure why not.

[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.440]
And we even love our good buddy, Dick.

[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:26.400]
I think I probably love dick a little more than Hank does, but nevertheless.

[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:28.040]
What's your guys name?

[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:29.880]
I got it here.

[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:30.920]
I've got to believe me.

[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.940]
I got several messages from that guy right here in my dick.

[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.560]
Oh, they must have dollars named after him.

[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.340]
His name is Shmitzu.

[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:39.940]
Don't they have a Shmitzu dog?

[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.880]
He's the big shot that had a hunch here with Las Vegas National Airlines.

[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.000]
It's flying nonstop directly.

[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.720]
I got the whole scheduler, but anyway, Hank said it was very enjoyable.

[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.100]
And first class was sensational.

[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.440]
And there was big and roomy and spacious and great.

[01:41:53.760 --> 01:42:00.060]
And sure as hell beat America worth, by the way, I continue here in nothing but bad things about America worth their lives.

[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.520]
I mean, more people that bump into me in the airports intentionally.

[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.880]
And then after they picked me up, they say, by the way, you were right, America worst blows.

[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.140]
We had a real bad experience.

[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:14.700]
Even though they've gone to the Airbus now, which is a better plan than what they were using before, nonetheless, they got all kinds of problems.

[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:19.160]
And while I was on vacation, one of the flights I guess coming back, I was reading in USA today.

[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:23.820]
One of those nice colorful list that they've got about the customer complaints and who's the back and who's the worst.

[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:25.560]
And who was the worst in each category?

[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:26.600]
You guessed it.

[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.540]
Living up to their name, American Worst.

[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.700]
So I'll pass on America Worst.

[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:35.160]
Thank you. And I'll stick with the National because thanks to this is pretty good.

[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.040]
And the price was right, I'm sure.

[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:39.340]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.340]
All right. Here we go.

[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:45.520]
Here we go. Boys and girls of America.

[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:48.660]
Here's what those lives that really is doing at big time.

[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.540]
I like it when we get one like this. You can really make...

[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:56.640]
Thank you.

[01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:59.160]
Make K-Wheel a sunshine.

[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.920]
So see, they can continue replacing instruments in here from now until the end of time.

[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.240]
The fact is that there's something screwed up with this phone system.

[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:13.220]
And the fact is that they're paying somebody's money, harder and money, which they're not too happy about paying it because they don't like paying their building this company.

[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.720]
But they're paying a harder money to Bell South.

[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:18.780]
And they still won't demand a God damn service.

[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:21.640]
Now that shows you what a bunch of crap operators these people are here.

[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:24.160]
It's like a F-P-N-O.

[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:27.340]
Would you pay your monthly electric bill if they had the electric off 90% of the time?

[01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:27.520]
No.

[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.380]
I don't think so. You'd probably go out and buy a bunch of candles and flashlights and then sue their ass.

[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:34.680]
And the same thing with this phone company.

[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:42.800]
If it was me, I'd have a lawsuit by the end of the day against God damn Bell South for the kind of crap service that we got on these lines here.

[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:46.940]
And then Bluffs says, oh, the supervisor was just here last week and he said it was okay.

[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:48.140]
Is it okay? No.

[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:49.180]
No. No, it is not okay.

[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:51.560]
Let me say it again. Is it okay?

[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:52.440]
No, it is not.

[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:54.900]
The piece of Smith.

[01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:58.660]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:02.360]
Let's see if that's still on there like that because it was the no-see it's okay now.

[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:03.760]
I don't know if that.

[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:07.260]
I'm not sure if the being hung job by there.

[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:08.580]
Oh, it's buzzing.

[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.160]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:12.440]
Hello.

[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:14.920]
Neil.

[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:15.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:16.940]
How are you? Great.

[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:20.060]
Good. I can't put my air off when you connected this. Sorry.

[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:20.600]

[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.720]
I want to talk about the panthers.

[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:26.960]
I want to be the only hockey fan down here that's desperate for hockey.

[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:30.140]
Yeah, we had a flyer fan calling before to hear that bozo.

[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.020]
No, it is.

[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:34.120]
Not only did he not know that they stuck a puck in their own net last night,

[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.780]
but they didn't know that they were playing New Jersey in one of the big games of the year,

[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:38.320]
which they got beat four to two by the way.

[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.680]
But that's the kind of hockey fans we got down here.

[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:42.900]
He didn't even know who his thing was playing last night.

[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:45.220]
Yeah, but jurors scored the winning goal.

[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.280]
He got credit for it, right?

[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.640]
Yeah, well, yeah, just because he blocked it.

[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:48.960]
Right.

[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:51.800]
But anyway, I wanted to ask you,

[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.300]
how can the panthers are all hot and bothered about this guy from the midi at Malacov

[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:57.700]
or whatever the guy's name is?

[01:44:57.820 --> 01:44:58.000]
Yeah.

[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.800]
Why are the panthers involved?

[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:01.540]
Well, it was in Malacov, it was Ulenov that they were.

[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.080]
Oh, I have no idea.

[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.240]
I mean, Peter were well.

[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.660]
I'm so sick and tired of this crap with him and all the fights and all the other garbage.

[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:10.460]
He can't, he can't, he can't play.

[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.940]
And in the meantime, they got their ass kicked four to one.

[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.720]
It's just like the last time that they got their ass kicked by the flyers

[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:19.520]
and they come back whining and whimpering about Lindrosso's dirty and this and that.

[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:20.120]
You know something?

[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:22.320]
If you're going to play with a big boys like book campers,

[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:25.500]
then you better tighten up your jocks, draping go out there and kick some ass.

[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:29.680]
Why did they play the Canadian a week ago and they kicked their ass and then,

[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:30.480]
you know, they're not big.

[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.720]
They didn't kick their ass.

[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:32.900]
It was a pretty marginal game.

[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.240]
I mean, it was three to one.

[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.940]
It's hardly an ass kickin' and if it weren't for the fact that Vernon played

[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.320]
great, the winner won that game either.

[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.380]
Well, by Panther standards, it's an ass kick.

[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.420]
They don't score more than three or four goals anyway.

[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:42.760]
Yeah.

[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:47.300]
Even with Paul, but I couldn't believe the game the other night.

[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:52.340]
Did you see who, what's his face put on the line with, with Burrite, Melendee?

[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:52.920]
Yeah.

[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.600]
Oh, see the anchor.

[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.080]
Melendee's played with La with him this year.

[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.060]
I don't mind with Melendee's out there, but what do he's got,

[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:01.920]
War El out there and La with Burrite, start screaming at the set.

[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:03.320]
Listen, we'll be alright, pal.

[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:05.080]
We'll kick some ass tonight.

[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:06.500]
Well, what about the playoffs?

[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:07.900]
What do you think our chances are on the playoffs?

[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.480]
Whoever gets hot, it's way too far to tell.

[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:13.580]
Whoever gets hot at the right time, that's a team to be that dangerous in the playoffs.

[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.220]
Or, you know, keep up the good hockey.

[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.100]
And have a hockey.

[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:16.960]
They have a great day.

[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:18.260]
Yeah, a lot of hockey talk, right?

[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:18.500]
No.

[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:19.360]
No hockey talk.

[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.000]
They don't know from it.

[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:20.720]
Okay, they don't care.

[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:21.520]
Don't you understand it?

[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:23.040]
We're not having no hockey talk.

[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:23.300]
No.

[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:23.740]
No.

[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.700]
The best was that so-called flyer span before.

[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:27.860]
Oh, well, I didn't see.

[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.300]
I didn't get a home and who'd they play last night?

[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:31.900]
They pay for it.

[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:32.840]
They pay the top team in the league.

[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:36.580]
The New Jersey devil's there in the middle and they got their asses kicked for the tooster.

[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:37.920]
And they stuck one in their own net.

[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:38.560]
Nice going.

[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:44.720]
No matter how many goons they put on that team, no matter how many geno ojics they find, no matter

[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:47.880]
how many Craig Barubis they find, they're still going to wind up getting their ass kicked

[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:49.060]
when they have push comes to shove.

[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.140]
Let me start shoving it.

[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:52.700]
And by the way, you notice you don't see the geezer no more.

[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.580]
Don't see him doing it.

[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:54.080]
Oh, no.

[01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:00.300]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:02.000]
Here's West Palm Beach.

[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:02.240]
Hello.

[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:05.020]
Good afternoon, Elf.

[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:05.880]
Good afternoon, sir.

[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:06.320]
How you doing?

[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:07.580]
Both all the ships at sea.

[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:10.100]
Did you say all the shmits at sea?

[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.080]
All the shmits at sea.

[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:14.860]
I've got three little letters for American pie.

[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:16.400]
The movie?

[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:16.860]
Yeah.

[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:17.920]
American pie.

[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:18.900]
Or American.

[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:19.560]
American beauty.

[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:20.800]
Yeah, American beauty.

[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:21.440]
Yeah.

[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:22.500]
HBO.

[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:23.560]
Okay.

[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:24.780]
It was terrible.

[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:25.240]
Really?

[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.340]
Oh, God.

[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:30.260]
At the end of the movie, my wife and I look at each other,

[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:34.120]
scratched our poopic and said, what the hell was that all about?

[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:38.260]
You know, I mean, it's like you're just waiting and waiting and waiting.

[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:38.580]
Yeah.

[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.000]
The end of the movie is like nothing.

[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:45.080]
But it says here knockout performances by Kevin Spacey and an Ed Benning

[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.620]
as battling spouses were among the eight nominations for best film contender American beauty.

[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:52.200]
In other words, the people out there in Hollywood, these plastic jackasses,

[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:53.560]
one I think are on the take.

[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:56.320]
They've already made up their mind that this is the one that fits the most.

[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.620]
And they're just like what they like to keep all the awards to,

[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.260]
so you can be sure they're going to get all the awards.

[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:00.980]
It's terrible.

[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.920]
And in closing, the Flyers fan, you're a freaking idiot.

[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:06.180]
Okay.

[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:08.820]
We could play last night.

[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:09.340]
Did they play?

[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:10.920]
Yeah, part of the game, I guess.

[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:12.840]
They got their ass kicked.

[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:13.260]
Okay.

[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.420]
That was a big chance.

[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:15.480]
There was a big showed on.

[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.780]
There was the moment to shine.

[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:18.080]
And they stuck the joy out.

[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:19.760]
They got it.

[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:20.360]
Schmidt on.

[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.720]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.060]
And of course, on the West Coast, are we on the year and four Meyers?

[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:29.420]
Uh-huh.

[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.960]
Boy, they're pretty silent.

[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.860]
Maybe they're pissed off because we got to delay on.

[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.200]
They don't hear all those nice words anymore.

[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:40.460]
877-785-6345.

[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.640]
Yeah, that probably would piss me off too if I turned into a short V-day.

[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:48.600]
So I could hear, and then all of a sudden I stopped hearing that.

[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.760]
I'd say, what happened to that show?

[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.080]
It's just not like what you used to be anymore.

[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:55.560]
That's the only reason we ever had anybody listen in Fort Meyers in the first place so they could hear those words.

[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:59.100]
Because generally speaking in Lee County, they're not allowed to say those words anyway.

[01:48:59.260 --> 01:48:59.400]
Are they?

[01:48:59.580 --> 01:48:59.800]
Are they?

[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:00.140]
No.

[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:00.420]
No.

[01:49:02.140 --> 01:49:04.660]
They're not allowed to talk back, even to their sheep.

[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.000]
And look at that.

[01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:07.220]
Right.

[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.900]
As soon as you ask, here's a call in Fort Meyers.

[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:09.160]
Hello?

[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:12.280]
Fort Meyers.

[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:12.920]
Hi, Neil.

[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:13.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:17.480]
I just wanted to tell you, I'm a big hockey fan from a long ways back.

[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.940]
I just got direct TV.

[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.300]
I got the hockey package.

[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:21.740]
All right.

[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:23.160]
And now you're talking about it.

[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.880]
It's fantastic, but I got to say one thing.

[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:25.140]
Yes.

[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.400]
I have found that I could be watching an exciting game.

[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.260]
And it doesn't matter who it is.

[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:33.260]
But the commentator can put me to sleep.

[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:33.500]
Right.

[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:37.980]
The one thing that I have noticed, and I'm not a Buffalo Saber's fan, but that Rick Generette.

[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:38.440]
He's great.

[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.000]
He is God to be the best.

[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:41.360]
No.

[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:42.880]
Who is?

[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.340]
That is my question to you.

[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:45.660]
Who can you recommend?

[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:47.620]
Joe Bowen at the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:48.100]
OK.

[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.900]
The greatest hockey announcer in history, and Rick Generette is number two.

[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:51.500]
OK.

[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:52.320]
Is there anybody else?

[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:54.440]
Well, I mean, right after that, what more do you need?

[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:55.840]
My client.

[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:57.920]
I don't want to leave my cup because he's going to be here Saturday.

[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:58.580]
He'd be upset.

[01:49:59.040 --> 01:49:59.220]
Yeah.

[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:04.120]
I'm telling you, man, that that Generette, and I also found out that I guess he does the radio

[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:04.980]
as well as the color.

[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:05.300]
Yeah, they style the cast.

[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:06.840]
They say that he's already on TV.

[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:08.340]
Him and what's his name?

[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:11.640]
And then he could be boring as a game, but he still makes it exciting.

[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:12.780]
What's the color, guys?

[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:13.360]
He's in the middle of the lens.

[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:13.760]
I'm sorry.

[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:14.640]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:15.760]
That did.

[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:18.940]
It's just that the announcer's really what makes it exciting.

[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:18.940]

[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:19.480]
Exactly.

[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.980]
I'm telling you, the great announcer makes the game exciting, and you could have the most

[01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:24.680]
exciting game in the world if the answer is boring.

[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:26.440]
People don't even realize how exciting it is.

[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:28.300]
I'm almost sleep when I watch a Boston Bruins game.

[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:28.800]
There you go.

[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.060]
It's the best.

[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:30.060]

[01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:33.240]
And then I hit it because the one thing I can bring back Fred Kusik, he's only a hundred

[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.440]
years old, bring him back alive.

[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:35.660]
He's probably better than the rest.

[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:36.140]
OK.

[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:36.640]
Thank you.

[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:37.360]
And have a great day.

[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:42.820]

[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:08.600]
I'm Rosalind and I like them and I'm here to say they only are my Hispanic sounding game.

[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.820]
I've been in office for life and owe it all to you.

[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.940]
The bullet can fit you inside.

[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:15.060]
Thunder too.

[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:17.420]

[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:19.520]
Rush home

Feed the dogs take a leak and then race over to the Mac arena to get there in time for opening face off. Is there a chance?

I'm gonna make it. No, no

[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.320]
That means I may have to leave a little early on Monday

[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:34.780]
Well, of course, we'll be carrying the game and what's what the hang's not coming in for a half hours

[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:39.220]
I guess we'll have guilty on game day maybe geltican start a spree game like a quarter to two or something

[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.380]

Here's a lady mobile and Delray Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. How are you great? What are you doing today?

You said you wanted to give away tickets

[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:28.060]

Anybody was a lady mobile. It didn't happen but as soon as I looked on the screen and saw that my next call

We're not given crap away lady. What is it about the women in this frickin town?

[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:24.720]
Who have never anything to say to me good, bad or indifferent most of them hate me like poison by the way and that's okay

[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:28.460]
Because they got no sense of humor and they're uptight and a bunch of humorless bitches about

Any oh yes, sir, hey, I just wanted to call and talk about the Oscars man American beauty is a wonderful movie

[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:02.320]
Yeah, and if it was too complicated for those people maybe they should have stayed home there or gone on another car race or something

[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:03.720]
Mm-hmm, you know what I'm saying? Yeah

[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:10.160]
It deserves every award it got and I think maybe you should run on see they re-released it and that's super Bruce Willis movie

[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:15.540]
But you should definitely run out and try and catch American beauty should be re-released this week Bruce Willis

[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:18.120]
Yeah, that's the one with the kid who sees the dead people

They got nominated also for best movie. Oh, yeah, yeah, they're I'll pass on that

[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:27.100]
They're re-releasing all the movies you should you should go catch them out

[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:33.020]
What is it called? It's called the six things all the six the six cents. Yeah, okay

[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:35.780]
All right, man, I'll run right out right now as a matter of fact. I do have thanks

[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.660]
See he says it's great. He says American beauty sensationally other guy was like that it goes to show a difference

[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:47.820]
Everyone I said it was great everybody said so there was a guy before that of course that was Gary the call can send that

[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.040]
Gary the sign man

[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:50.920]
Why does he call this show?

[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:56.920]
Why does he call this show? I mean we like him a lot, but he's just not a caller. I've tried to explain it to him

[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:02.060]
We like him. We appreciate nice things. He's done for us. It's not personal. It's business and he's bad for business

[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:04.540]
His calls are terrible awful

[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:09.700]
Grotesque Gary you're a great guy. You just not cut out to be a caller on this on this show

[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:15.840]
Maybe Rick and Doug okay, but not on this show. You know what I'm saying Gary? No, right that now you can start to catch on say it after me

[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:18.420]
No, no, no, no more calls no

[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.620]
Stop Gary. Well, I noticed that you were I won I brought one up to the middle of your forehead when I was on it

[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:28.120]
And I recognized the voices being chronic, but I didn't realize that it was Gary the sign man

[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:31.680]
Because if I would have known that it was Gary the sign man, I probably would have said

[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:37.020]
It must be a great movie. I'm gonna rush out like the last guy just said and go see him or a computer must be sensational

[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:41.700]
I mean you're Gary the sign man's a good guy, but a little bit slow

[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:46.520]
You don't understand you followed my a little slow so like this last guy may have had him paying pretty well

[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:49.720]
Probably a little bit too complicated for Gary the sign man

[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:55.220]
Just stick to USA today in those nice color pictures. They got near and those charts and graphs Gary

[02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:57.820]
You'll be okay and have somebody read it to you'll be just fine

[02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:03.200]
Not sure if he's the only sign man that I know that after he finishes the sign his assistant has to read them what's on the sign

[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:08.460]
And that he must be it's either he's lucky or he's very good, but he always gets it spell right, you know

[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:14.000]
You're okay Gary, but just say it again. No, that's it. No, come on. It's there. No, no no no more call

[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.880]
No, that a boy Gary now you're catching on just stay the hell away

[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.280]
5 6 7 0 5 60 what about that little girl nobody has any comments about that 14-year-old girl

[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:28.000]
This is a young bitch that threatens to blow up the school and that he says he's a good girl

[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.760]
I mean what what his comments are unacceptable. It's one thing to support your kids

[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:38.280]
But this was a grotesque horrendous unacceptable act and any literate piece of turd that is unacceptable

[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:42.920]
And he's like trying to minimize in the sweep it away like oh don't worry about her. She'll be alright

[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:49.140]
Yeah, that's remember he raised her. That's what Ted Bundy's parents probably said too, you know before they threw him in a trash can

[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:56.960]
Yeah, we really you know bugs me always my no worries you know on death row these poor dark people like Ted Bundy

[02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:57.440]
I'm sorry

[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:02.980]
Every time something goes on in America it's always because of racism right and there is a lot of racism

[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:04.400]
I know from personal experience

[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:10.080]
Here's a mobile and dear field beach. Hello. Yes, me over there speaking

[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:15.320]
Yeah, my name's big out first time call one time fan and the

[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:21.280]
Call and funny stole a little bit of my thunder. I also want your name is big Al big Al

[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:24.000]
What what does that mean like out well?

[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:28.340]
Well, yeah, I'm big and around the waistline absolutely

[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:33.500]
And that's about the only place unfortunately. Yeah, well, we don't do names on a show. So that's but that's okay

[02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:43.020]
All right. Well, just so you know, we didn't hear that. Okay. I'm also defending American beauty. Yeah, I think it's an excellent movie

[02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:45.100]
It was perfectly cast

[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:49.160]
The the roles were very well acted

[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:55.200]
There's so many things and angles to it. I too recommend you go out and see it

[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:58.840]
There's probably an angle you would find interesting. There's a homophobic

[02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:00.340]
Portrait in the

[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:06.380]
It's interesting the way that people describe my attitudes about the movies so in other words if there's some fag angle

[02:07:06.380 --> 02:07:10.740]
And whether it's the mad Damon movie or this one then I would enjoy it as edit that in other words gay people

[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:13.640]
Owing as your movies where there's a gay angle to it is edit well

[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:15.480]
Oh, no, I but you might find it interesting

[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.500]
It is of the same as you might find interesting

[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:25.600]
Oh, that one you might find particularly I see it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Miguel. Thank you. Thanks

[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:29.760]
Star getting very defensive there, didn't they? Yeah, I just don't understand it

[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:34.980]
I think the problem being that most straight people for example when they go to a movie does there have to be a straight angle

[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:40.460]
In the plot. Oh, yeah, every time. Yeah, everybody that said that they like the movie was straight as a board

[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:45.000]
That said that they liked American beauty. What about you're the assignment. Oh, oh

[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:51.560]
560 at 0560 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line out of town line four Myers is open

[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:56.420]
Did they got any opinions on a movie? Oh, I don't think they shouldn't have shown gone with the wind over there yet and four Myers heavy no

[02:07:57.300 --> 02:08:00.720]
Hey, don't get around to it. Dr. Jika and Mr. Hyde is gonna be big over there

[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:05.840]
And let's pick it the Sunsettle Dr. Jika and and they've hired

[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:08.920]
Here's Miami Springs hello

[02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:13.800]
You know, yes, sir. This is Mike the the small unemployed roofer. Okay

[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:20.280]
I need a welcome back from your casinos in Toronto

[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:25.500]
Anyway, I haven't heard you talk anything about Derek Thomas

[02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:29.820]
You haven't heard me talk anything about it. What does that mean? He's dead exactly?

[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:32.800]
What would you like me to say somebody called before we had a conversation about it

[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:36.560]
And I agreed with him and my comment was that he's dead and he's that's that's it

[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:40.300]
Why are we having a big get to us about it? I missed it. I missed it my apologies

[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:47.080]
But it wasn't he the one or his mom said something or she said the magical words as he was tumbling down the

[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:52.240]
That interstate when he had the accident that he was alive because he said

[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:54.680]
Save me Jesus or something like that was in

[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:56.800]
Wasn't it him? No

[02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:03.320]
I'm trying to remember who the hell that was no that was that was something that played in the Super Bowl who the hell was it?

[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:03.500]
The

[02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:07.420]
Wasn't somebody from who the hell was it? Oh?

[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:13.660]
Well, was it somebody from Tennessee that said that no was somebody from the ram somebody from St. Louis that said that I can't think of who was somebody

[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:17.440]
Will call and tell us some sports there but it was not Derek Thomas you see if he would have just said the right word

[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:20.920]
He'd have been okay exactly would have just said Jesus Jesus well anyway

[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:26.520]
Did you see that the Air Force had a flyby at the overhead the over-eurobat stadium?

[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:32.660]
Isn't that great government money was spent to honor a dead football player exactly Isaac Bruce Isaac Bruce

[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:37.340]
There you go that was the guy Isaac Bruce Bruce a local Lushguards and by the way he's the one that said the yeah

[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:44.800]
Well, I say Jesus wouldn't stop the bullet and so on. I've not just comments incredible. Okay. I have a great taste all right, and the this tool pass

[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:51.200]
Just like a bad kidney stone this two shall pass five six seven oh five sixty we got fourteen every open lines

[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:54.320]
You're an hour and five minutes to go can they do it no can they make it today no?

[02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:59.440]
The verdict is American beauty is a great movie because Gary the Simon didn't like it

[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:03.380]
Not but not no no not for any other reason necessarily but because he didn't like it

[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:06.780]
We assume it to tremendous movie and if he would have just told me that when he was on there

[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:10.480]
Would have saved us a lot of grief and then the other guy wouldn't have had to call back and feel so bad about it

[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.300]
Just consider the source okay pal. It was Gary the Simon

[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:21.600]
To meet him is to know him trust me good guy, but a little strange

[02:10:23.220 --> 02:10:30.720]
1256 at 550 WQ a.m. Hey listen everybody even the nice people like Joe Rosoli our guy from Roth office apply

[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:33.120]
He's a good guy, but you know every time it comes in here

[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:38.120]
He's peddling a song of dance about that lazy guy, but I don't want no slicing in my eyeball, please

[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:42.280]
I'm an old fart. I'm happy being a half bald with the glasses. It doesn't bother me at least

[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:47.260]
But I can see what I'm looking for real good. Okay, believe me and I'm not cock-eyed

[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:54.160]
For minutes till one a Q. I.M. wake up with the first

[02:10:54.160 --> 02:11:01.980]
He's Joe Rose Jeff the forest and he goes he no we'd be more into six only on sports radio 560 Q. A.M.

[02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:06.260]
I don't want to see you in here

[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:09.100]
I have to watch our day

[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:11.900]
Don't get water to fill our work

[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:20.060]
Just one never want to cigarette can cause memory loss and paranoia just one joint will drive you to madness

[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:24.740]
It will make you pluck out your eyeballs just to see what's under the dresser

[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:27.740]
The world as you know it will cease to exist

[02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:34.040]
You'll let your alternate realities like being trouble to death by fat and curious Jamaican winning

[02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:42.740]
In fact some of the good studies I've shown that now I want to cause his polio and will make your balls dribble up into tiny little BBs

[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:45.520]
Smoking their alive will make you die

[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:49.740]
Really? We gotta believe this. We have to say things like that

[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.700]
Oh and I'm sexy fat too

[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.400]
This message paid for by the partners against what in America

[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:13.680]
All right, they down in Jamaica in the car of being they got the best work that you ever had

[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:16.120]
Ask anybody in that table

[02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:20.360]
They tell you this country where the country is

[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:21.360]
Are you?

[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:24.240]
Ask a man ask some he want to sell

[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:29.000]
And from a mile away you can detect the smell of smoke

[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.920]
Oh, smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:36.680]
Oh, he light up this blip and choke

[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:40.140]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, air

Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:47.960]
The gun should be good

[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:54.460]
You'll be carried lots of earth in the gunny sack

[02:12:54.460 --> 02:12:58.360]
Smoke it everyday until your lungs run like

[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:02.340]
With all the money that we have made

[02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:06.100]
Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid

[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:10.100]
America's foolish home here and say

[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:12.900]
Got nothing like this in the US

[02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:18.280]
They say they smoke, smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:21.960]
They light up this blip and choke

[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:25.660]
They begin to puff and choke

[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:29.740]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:33.900]
The gun should be good

[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:39.960]
I'm the teller son you are a rough, dumb man

[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:43.700]
You like to smoke to drive a slip whenever you turn

[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:47.540]
Many people coming here for miles around

[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:51.820]
To bite the earth for you by the ounce of nicknames

[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:55.140]
Ask a man say to her, mama you're right

[02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:59.680]
They gun to be good tonight and then they smoke

[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:03.800]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke

[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:07.360]
They light up this blip and choke

[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:14.740]
Smoke, gun, just smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke

[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:19.280]
They gun to be good

[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:23.500]
All right, come on

[02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:26.720]
104-560 WQ, by the way you ever see Wilson Pickett

[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:30.820]
5-6705-60, maybe he was working at the frontier out there in Vegas

[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:32.540]
Where they usually are picketing out in front of the building

[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:35.280]
That's a big Wilson picket, not any more you want

[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:38.400]
I saw him picket at the New York State House

[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.620]
Anybody remember the New York State House?

[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:40.860]
Oh, those were the days

[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:43.220]
The owner of New York State House, what that was his name? Susman

[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.160]
Yeah, that was his name, Susman he's dead

[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:49.580]
Big Wilson he's dead, two big fat guys, huge

[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:53.560]
That was a great place, New York State House originally was on Biscay

[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:56.160]
No, it was originally on a beach, wasn't it?

[02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:59.560]
Trying to think which was first the chicken or the egg

[02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:01.960]
It was either first over on a beach and then they moved to Biscayne

[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:03.640]
In like North-Aid

[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:08.020]
Well, we used to have so many great places, so many many great places

[02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:10.140]
Even Rocky Graziani used to be pretty good

[02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:12.520]
Which is now like some seafood joint

[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:15.560]
135th in Biscayne somewhere around there

[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:18.200]
Of course, you know North-Aid, it just ain't what it used to be

[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:19.880]
You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I think you do

[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:22.800]
Kind of the complexion of that neighborhood has changed

[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:27.020]
5-6705-60, pound 5-60 on a AT&T line

[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.320]
Here's Miami, hello

[02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:32.960]
Miami, yes sir

[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:35.180]
You were talking about the Westminster dog show

[02:15:35.180 --> 02:15:36.700]
Yes, and the mint in

[02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:37.100]
Uh-huh

[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:40.040]
The mint in Detroit, not a carrier

[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:42.320]
He's in the toy group

[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:42.880]
He's a toy?

[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:45.720]
He said you know what you do with toys when they're going out and throwing a garbage

[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:46.540]
Oh that's true

[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:47.060]
Uh-huh

[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:49.120]
That's true, but yeah, he's in the toy

[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:50.180]
He's in the toy group

[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:51.480]
He's a carrier

[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:53.660]
No, he's a toy group, he's in the toy group

[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:55.520]
He's a miniature fincher

[02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:57.100]
Because of his size

[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:01.780]
He's a miniature pincher

[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:04.040]
He's actually brought down over the years

[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:06.420]
You know, it's been that nothing to do with the doberman pincher

[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:07.840]
Oh yeah, he told me he does not

[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:09.280]
Oh, I'm sorry

[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:12.760]
He told me just recently when I came back from vacation he told me

[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:14.440]
He said I got nothing to do with a pincher

[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:16.260]
Oh, you know not have anything to do with him

[02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:16.560]
Yeah

[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:18.080]
But putting up alongside a one

[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:19.080]
I said pinch this

[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:21.160]
He ran like a son of a bitch

[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:21.860]
I don't blame him

[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:22.520]
Yeah, me either

[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:23.260]
I don't blame him

[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:25.060]
No, uh, so he's a toy

[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:26.640]
He's a toy, he's in the toy group

[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:30.840]
Maybe I'm gonna understand maybe are you saying he's a goi?

[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:32.020]
Yeah

[02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:32.560]
Oh yeah

[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.020]
Oh goi, okay, thank you

[02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:35.760]
There we go, let's have some more doggie talk

[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:36.620]
Oh no

[02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:40.460]
Where was the laboratory tree around the list?

[02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:41.920]
And is it as big as a bread box?

[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:43.180]
How about a shitsoo?

[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.720]
Oh, that's a guy from National Airlines isn't it?

[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:47.240]
Dixitoo?

[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:51.300]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line

[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:54.000]
I'd take great exception of what this guy just said

[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.460]
I know my dogs, baby

[02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:59.460]
And a miniature print you have a print of whatever you have, a prancer

[02:16:59.460 --> 02:17:01.060]
Is a goddamn terrier

[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:04.260]
But that's how they break it up in the show

[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:07.640]
Working dogs, sporting dogs, toys

[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:10.280]
Pain in the S-I-Cotic dogs, that's the mint pen

[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:13.220]
How many years have I been warning you people out there

[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:16.500]
And also you people who live out in the acres quit letting your dogs run loose

[02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:17.860]
But is that for us my ass?

[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:18.740]
Because I love dogs

[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:21.180]
And I despise people

[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:22.840]
I mean I realize once upon a time

[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:26.040]
Because I've lived in plantation acres now like at least 10 years

[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:28.780]
Yeah, but 9 or 10 years

[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:32.840]
And once upon a time when I first moved there was those sagwara's mills mall

[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:33.760]
There was no nothing

[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.640]
And we just opened it and lived it in the country

[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:37.020]
Is it living in the country anymore?

[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:37.240]
No

[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:40.960]
And I don't mind those painting the S-P-Cox that some of my neighbors have

[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:41.940]
You know, and all the other

[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:45.000]
Because some of these people still believe they're living out in the country

[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.960]
But when you let your dogs run loose

[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:48.820]
First of all it's against the law, that's number one

[02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:51.800]
And number two, if you care about your dogs, you have to be crazy

[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:58.020]
Because even on the side streets out there people like me use those streets to strawberry short cuts

[02:17:58.020 --> 02:18:00.120]
And we're zooming 90 miles an hour up and down there

[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:02.440]
And if you don't like it, get there out, you know, too bad

[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:04.780]
No, seriously, I don't speed on those side streets

[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.560]
But what are dogs running around the street?

[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:09.640]
Now cats, that's more than we're liking

[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:13.500]
You want to let your little pussy out there loose in the street

[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:17.100]
And I go right ahead, boy, because I got a heavy, lead foot when I see pussy in the street

[02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:18.720]
Man, I'm telling you

[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:22.720]
I just step on it, and the gas pedal too

[02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:28.740]
Makes for a hell of a stench though when you splatter one of them in the street

[02:18:30.900 --> 02:18:32.500]
560, 7.0560

[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:38.020]
I'm 560 on the, ain't listen, the excuse today is I'm in coherent, I don't know what I'm saying

[02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:40.520]
Must have been some bad drugs in Amsterdam, you know what I'm talking about?

[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:41.660]
Yeah, bad mushrooms

[02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:43.320]
I do love mushrooms though

[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:45.680]
Portini mushrooms, Portobello mushrooms

[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:47.220]
Now we're talking good Italian, right?

[02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:49.940]
So bad, what's so good, so bad from a Spurco

[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:54.060]
Well, hey Lord, how's this, Lord?

[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:56.120]
We're blowing and blowing!

[02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:59.220]
Let's do some picking for it

[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:01.420]
Not your nose, Lord

[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:05.220]
That's what I'm doing, I'm still worried about it, good old boy

[02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:07.700]
We come from Alabama, and we come from Illinois

[02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:10.640]
We come from Carolina, and from Mississippi too

[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:12.400]
We love to do tobacco in shops

[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:13.440]
Yeah, dude

[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:15.600]
We're red necked, Saddie

[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:18.160]
Pick up trucks, bearded

[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:22.660]
Oh, man, Mr. Tony George had a good idea

[02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:25.760]
You've been stocked, George, we'll bring him on up here

[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:28.340]
We'll throw a big part in, we'll fill up the plate

[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:30.980]
It's time to add in, you have a NASCAR race

[02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:33.040]
That's the brickyard that he is

[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:36.380]
And Speedway Indiana, US of A

[02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:38.960]
What's that space?

[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:42.140]
Now a NASCAR space is our whole new bridge

[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:44.720]
We love Rusty Wallace, and we love Lake Speed

[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:47.580]
You can see on my NASCAR fans on the back

[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:50.800]
His pants are so low, and you can see his butt cracked

[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:54.000]
See, Lord, I can see it half noon

[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.720]
And it's broad daylight, take yourself a belt

[02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:58.120]
Can I put my name on the buckle?

[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:01.260]
Some NASCAR girls don't wear no shoes

[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:03.900]
On their big fluffy hooters, they got big tattoos

[02:20:03.900 --> 02:20:06.700]
And Mr. Hick, you need a certain fella from the south

[02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:09.840]
He's terribly cute, he does, you got a pretty coy-o

[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:16.680]
Floyd, give me big hooters with big tattoos any day

[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:19.640]
Hey, Lloyd, look at them jiggles, Gwen

[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:23.480]
She's got a daily hard tattoo right there, twin her boobies

[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:26.020]
Harry, get the cleaner away

[02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:29.380]
Hey, Lloyd, let him see your big three

[02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:33.980]
Lloyd, I'm in your dick, triple tattoos

[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:38.720]
We sure have fun, and in the end we'll be coming back

[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:42.320]
I got myself a checkered flag, it's mailed in my gun right

[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:46.220]
I break your kit the best time the total boy has ever had

[02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:49.860]
Next year I'll bring my parents, mom and uncle Dan

[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:52.540]
Show them your new teeth, Lloyd

[02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:54.920]
God, I bought them all the way away

[02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:58.520]
I got me a picture of Richard Petty and Heldon

[02:20:58.520 --> 02:20:59.540]
Found him

[02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:01.600]
No, I'm just Jason Hanks

[02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:05.700]
115 is 560 WK now

[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:08.460]
This is a Bob and Tom 1994 best of that's from

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:10.680]
That's six years ago, and here it is 2,000

[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:12.040]
Can we say dick on a year now?

[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:12.200]
No

[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:13.820]
I mean, we're not making any progress, are we?

[02:21:14.900 --> 02:21:15.920]
Why can't we say dick?

[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:18.360]
You know, I think slowly but surely, maybe rapidly

[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:19.900]
We got to start breaking down these barriers

[02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:23.540]
These ridiculous artificial barriers set up by these old cretins in Washington

[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.920]
It's unacceptable, and the public sits back

[02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:28.560]
Okay, whatever you tell us, and you're right

[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:31.120]
That's a good point because if people say dick on a year

[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:34.440]
Then all of a sudden more of these little kids are going to start sending bomb threats to school

[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:36.100]
As if one thing has got to do with the other

[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:44.160]
Maybe the fact that that father is so like willing to cover up and accept and condone and minimize all of this

[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:47.680]
Maybe that has something to do with the way that this kid has been brought up and the behavior in that way

[02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:48.680]
You think that might, uh-huh

[02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:49.760]
Possibility, I think so

[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:53.600]
567, what happened to all the ladies?

[02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:56.680]
We had like 50 ladies on there all at the same time, and then we went on the break

[02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:58.980]
And of course not only will they not call us or give them something away

[02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:01.000]
They also won't wait because they're busy

[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:03.360]
Here's the lady in four Myers though, hello

[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:04.860]
Yes, ma'am

[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:06.200]
Yes, I am

[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:08.880]
Hi, Neil, I'm in four Myers, the lady from four Myers

[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:10.880]
I'm not calling to get anything for free

[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:11.160]
Good

[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:15.240]
I'm calling about the dogs, I've, uh, I have my own men, Penn

[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:16.960]
Um, so sorry about that, tell me

[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:18.280]
Oh no, he's just lovely

[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:21.240]
He's a very happy little dog, kid's love him

[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:21.940]
He's hysterical

[02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:24.600]
Well, yeah, he has crazy hysterical, but that's part of the story

[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:25.340]
Wow, yapping

[02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:27.160]
No, no, actually, mine's not

[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:27.440]
Really?

[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:29.600]
No, yeah, he's a really pretty good little guy

[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:32.320]
We've got a cat that keeps him busy, so that helps him

[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:33.400]
I hope the cat's got claws

[02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:34.420]
Yeah, it does

[02:22:34.420 --> 02:22:35.980]
Good, very good idea

[02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:37.440]
Well, the cat runs the house

[02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:40.560]
But we don't let her out, I agree with you about letting cats out

[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.580]
That's not a really good idea

[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:46.060]
But in any case, we're talking about classifying how the dog is classified

[02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:49.240]
The different kennel clubs classify them different

[02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:53.360]
If the guy they called before had listened to and he was talking about the men, Penn

[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:56.360]
It is not a bred-downed overman

[02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:59.000]
No, of course not, it's not related in any way to a doverman

[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.300]
Absolutely not, if anything the doverman was bred off of the dog

[02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:04.680]
But that's even questionable as it is

[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:06.720]
But you're right, the dog is a terrier

[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:07.140]
Right

[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:08.620]
They put him in the toy club

[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:11.720]
I like it all far like that that calls up and is giving me instructions

[02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:13.760]
He's giving me an education about my dog

[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:15.040]
Oh, I know aren't they idiots?

[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:17.500]
Unbelievable

[02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:21.120]
I know, I can't believe the mentality of some of the people out there in the world

[02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:22.620]
But thank God for a smart one, right?

[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:23.280]
Right for us

[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.540]
But I just wanted to declare it, let you guys know that

[02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:29.200]
It depends on how the kennel club is going to classify the dog

[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.000]
Now do you have a microwave in your home?

[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:31.760]
Yes, they do

[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:33.440]
Good, I hope it's like a full size

[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:35.360]
Oh God, yes, it's a big one, my one

[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:36.240]
Just keep it in mind, just keep it in mind

[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:39.580]
And they, surely you don't want to start it up because that can be very dangerous with him inside

[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:42.000]
But just if you put him in there and close the door and then tell him that

[02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:45.020]
If he's not nice that you're going to have to start it up next time

[02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:47.360]
It works every time like a charm

[02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:48.640]
I imagine it would

[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:50.580]
And then there's also the regular oven too

[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:51.220]
Have a great day

[02:23:51.220 --> 02:23:51.720]
You too

[02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:52.080]
Okay

[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:54.760]
See, there you go as usual

[02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:56.420]
Oh God

[02:23:56.420 --> 02:23:58.000]
Head is thumb on it as usual

[02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:01.160]
This old guy, no, it's a toy and it's related, yeah, sir

[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:03.240]
I think you need a toy is what you need

[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:04.820]
Maybe some of those are gummy bears

[02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:08.400]
A little honey bear is gummy bears, whatever she was sticking in her rectum

[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:11.520]
Fine, there was a nice job over there by the way, Bob

[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:14.140]
Yeah, why don't you know what to craft shoot? It's a craft shoot

[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:16.300]
You know about craft, Bob, let me tell you that right now

[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:18.820]
Yeah, I guess we're not going to get on the TMI

[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:23.120]
So, my is well ripped out of those cost people and tell them how we really feel about how they screwed us over a big time

[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:26.980]
Had that meeting that day and tried to demean and be human eyes all of us

[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:29.540]
Well, I got better things to do than come down here and you know

[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:33.860]
We've tried everything we know to make the station profitable and then maybe somebody also had better luck

[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:38.240]
Yeah, maybe somebody also had better luck like buddy Bud Paxton

[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:42.820]
Some schmuck like him that wouldn't know a radio from a pop-up poster

[02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:46.300]
And still want to sell a son of God damn station to make it a big profit off in no doubt

[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:47.700]
And then make a big profit off of them

[02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:49.800]
You bet you're sweet as they did big time

[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:55.680]
And then of course he got that tax that bull crap going at phony baloney hypocritical pseudo religious bull crap

[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:58.640]
And got NBC and under the and made millions and millions more that

[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:03.480]
But I guess what the best part of the deal is his stock is still in the crap about 11 bucks a share

[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:08.480]
Don't buy the passion stock and don't whatever you do buy the

[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:13.980]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:18.100]
Here's a pig reporting pepper pine, so hello

[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:19.560]
Yeah, don't forget don't ever buy the

[02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:21.540]
Right, yeah

[02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:23.820]
Got to get the only report real quick

[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.860]
Going westbound on tap street just before you get to Pumingo road

[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:29.600]
Oh right by the old radar trap

[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:32.960]
Yeah, that's it right by the mobile station there just before you get to safety's miss park

[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:34.580]
There's a pig just they're doing it

[02:25:34.580 --> 02:25:38.180]
They lived there they must they must set up shop there and just to camp out

[02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:40.460]
Well, they have a couple of favorite spots along tap street

[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:41.680]
That's one

[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:43.220]
Captain hiatus is another one

[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:46.460]
Exactly, I was going to say that as you're going as you're going west

[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:49.560]
Also, you go a little bit further down towards tapton palm

[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:51.620]
They love that neighborhood as well

[02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:54.320]
Yeah, and then just before you get to the next bull shopping center

[02:25:55.180 --> 02:25:58.180]
Which is tasked and I think it's Douglas

[02:25:58.180 --> 02:25:59.860]
Right they usually park down there

[02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:01.720]
The data doing tapton something else

[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:03.920]
So thanks a lot, Pembroke Pine for keeping us up there

[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:07.060]
All they do especially in Pembroke lakes more so than Pembroke Pine

[02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:11.280]
Pembroke lakes that's all that they do is sit out there and shoot the crap in the street

[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:12.340]
They're doing it now

[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:13.460]
Thanks for the good news

[02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:15.460]
Well, thank you sir and have a good time at the hockey game tomorrow

[02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:16.980]
All right, yeah or tonight

[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:18.740]
Is the game tomorrow?

[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:19.920]
No, tonight

[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:23.940]
5 6 7 0 5 60, 0 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:25.220]
You'll have a good time if for a pilot

[02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:26.580]
And by the way, how about that Ray Whitney?

[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:30.880]
I forgot to mention that the other day gets added there because that the frog Pierre Turgent was injured

[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.140]
And gets added late there for the North American team for the All Star game

[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:35.340]
Has a goal and an assist

[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:38.340]
Albury of course most valuable with the hat trick

[02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:40.720]
And Victor Coslov with three assists

[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:44.520]
Nice representation there from your panthers during the All Star game

[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:47.700]
And I don't care, somebody faxed me yesterday and tried to give me a song and a dance about

[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:52.260]
The crowd for the San Jose game last Wednesday when I was on vacation wasn't as bad as what I said

[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:54.340]
I hate to break the news to you, okay?

[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:57.460]
But I rechecked from some of the experts people to pay attention to these things

[02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:01.340]
Including my friend the rimman and they said the crowd was pathetic

[02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:05.340]
In fact, all season long to be honest with you

[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:10.320]
The overwhelming majority of the time the size of the crowd has been disappointing at best

[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:14.020]
Now 3500 unsolved tickets for the Ranger game tonight really bizarre

[02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:18.460]
And I sure hope that the panther people go out there and get the panther back in the final unsolved tickets

[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:21.180]
So we don't have to have a lot of pain in the ass ranger fans there

[02:27:21.180 --> 02:27:25.480]
Hacking and trying to come up Ed Jackamon and Gump Orsley and all that B-Fo crap

[02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:27.780]
How's this restaurant that he's doing by the way?

[02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:33.100]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:34.840]
Here's a mobile in Aventura, hello

[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:36.520]
Hello

[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:37.200]
Yes sir

[02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:38.860]
Hello

[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:40.460]
Let me say it again, hello

[02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:42.020]
Yeah, Neil

[02:27:42.020 --> 02:27:43.880]
Yes, huge big rapport

[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:50.400]
163rd string orchid, 8th Avenue, 2530 cops, no radar, pull on you over for the seat belt

[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:51.340]
Seat belts?

[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:53.460]
Yes, seat belt USA baby

[02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:54.880]
Okay, thanks, thanks for the good news

[02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:58.660]
The seat belt police are right at the radar police are at it

[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:02.580]
Your law enforcement dollars at work keeping you safe, are they keeping you safe?

[02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:03.880]
No, they're hassling your ass

[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:06.620]
See, that's another thing I was thinking about them over there in Amsterdam

[02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:08.700]
And they're just walking along mine and their own business

[02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:13.480]
You know, on both sides of the main police station and the red light district on the warmer strut

[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:15.520]
The ruder vacillation is most people call it

[02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:18.460]
On both sides of the police station, they're coffee shops

[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.300]
One on each side, that's for convenience

[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.980]
No, I'm serious, they're coffee shops and they're inside smoking

[02:28:25.980 --> 02:28:28.880]
They got their little menus in with their weed and their hash and whatever they're doing inside

[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:30.540]
And they're not paying any attention to it

[02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:34.420]
And about a half a block down like I said is the stable master bar for all the leather freaks

[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:37.860]
Just like America, right?

[02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:38.060]
No

[02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:38.380]
No

[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:44.340]
No, see, in a lot of places they pay the cops to protect you to keep it safe

[02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:46.800]
Here, they pay the cops so they can hassle us

[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:48.560]
That's what they pay the salaries for

[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:49.880]
So they can sit there

[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:54.200]
This morning coming down hiatus to Broward, povardor, by a little strawberry short cut to work every morning

[02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:57.300]
I'm going down hiatus and there's two plantation porkers sitting over there

[02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:59.200]
And the middle of the median there

[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:03.060]
On the road, we're at a speed limit of 35 and should be minimum 45

[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:08.860]
One of their favorite speed traps like shooting fish in a barrel

[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:12.980]
On hiatus road between sunrise and Broward, povardor, shame on you

[02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:16.320]
And of course, you know, I say this in a plantation chief, hates me like poison anyway

[02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:19.160]
But that's okay because he'll die someday

[02:29:20.220 --> 02:29:24.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:25.640]
Here's a mobile in sunrise, hello

[02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:27.740]
Hi Neil, how are you?

[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:28.320]
Okay sir

[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:30.040]
Good, it's a nice and awesome

[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:34.340]
I have another chapter of the East on sunrise, Broward, and I go into that pet smart there all the time

[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:42.940]
And what do you know as soon as you turn into pet smart, there's this guy in a light, you know, looking in a light, I guess it's a fury

[02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:47.560]
I'm not too sure exactly what it is, but he has a radar out looking for people heading I guess west

[02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:51.180]
Heading west on sunrise, Broward, so you got there also

[02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:58.020]
And also I went over to where I like that I was going over to the pet smart there

[02:29:58.020 --> 02:30:01.720]
I'm not too sure if you shop there or not, but I've never been in there

[02:30:01.720 --> 02:30:07.800]
That is the most rude-ish clicks that you can ever shop that and I'm going to go to pets.com for that

[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:12.660]
Yeah, I mean just do it or rather stuff on the internet because I'm standing side

[02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:13.320]
They're rude?

[02:30:14.140 --> 02:30:18.840]
I'm extremely rude, they have one, they have one cash year with 30 people in there

[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:26.120]
And I talked to them there during I said listen, how come you have 30 people waiting here and you only have one cash year

[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:30.280]
And they go well, the other cash year, the other cash year is stocking shelf

[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:35.260]
Well I guess I made a good choice, I've never been anywhere close to that place

[02:30:35.260 --> 02:30:39.740]
I could walk from my house to there and I've never been even thought about going in there

[02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:45.860]
Yeah, I'm also very happy to be able to bring a Spaniard one that great shook because we have one of those dogs

[02:30:45.860 --> 02:30:48.380]
And they're fantastic dog breeds

[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:49.880]
Okay, have a great thing

[02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:50.520]
Thank you

[02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:53.920]
No more dog breeds, okay, I'm sorry you brought it up, no more doggy breeds

[02:30:57.360 --> 02:30:59.340]
I don't want to do the dog thing again, okay?

[02:31:00.140 --> 02:31:04.140]
Because then we get caused like that old fossil before giving me a lecture or song and a dance and brick

[02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:08.400]
Always very insistent, the people I love the best are the ones who are insistent and you know that they're wrong

[02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:10.700]
Everybody in the world knows they're wrong but they're insistent

[02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:13.840]
Oh no, I'm sorry but the earth absolutely are the sun travels around the earth

[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:20.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, count 5, 60 on a AT&T wireless line

[02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:22.540]
Let's do some more doggy talk, what do you say?

[02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:25.440]
Come on, where's that on the list? Is it number one? Is it number five hundred?

[02:31:25.780 --> 02:31:32.300]
And there's only one big event left, and that's best in show at Kominah

[02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:35.980]
Get those silly people, those silly prancing, missing people with those leashes

[02:31:35.980 --> 02:31:37.720]
Those people should be on a goddamn leash

[02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:40.780]
126 at 560 WQM

[02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:44.640]
Only one South Florida radio station has

[02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:50.940]
You're listening to it, at Goldberg, weekday afternoons at 2, sports radio 560

[02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:52.520]
QA&T

[02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:53.640]
Ray Whitney has a pair

[02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:58.980]
1, 2, 3, I made it through college and average at C

[02:31:58.980 --> 02:32:04.460]
I have a lot of money but not much of a frame like most of you voters who were just as lame

[02:32:04.460 --> 02:32:12.840]
But I can say one thing that you can, my daddy is an ex-president saying I got money, power, it's up to lose

[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:20.640]
I can do everything I use, only a little bit of cash is all I need is satisfy my ego and my greed

[02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:26.240]
Manipulated marketing is all I use, a gardener votes for more rocks, just like you

[02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:29.880]
That's a fact, excluding the fun of the last

[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.980]
I don't think I laughed that bad

[02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:40.160]
Remember to vote for George Bush and those of you who don't, you can kiss my touch

[02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:42.840]
You see what matters to me about the presidency?

[02:32:43.400 --> 02:32:45.680]
Is that it makes a nice conversation please?

[02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:49.100]
I'm the king of denial too

[02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:51.960]
I have no problems, lies with you

[02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:59.640]
So why is it so important for you to know whether or not I did blow a little bit of cocaine up my nose

[02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:02.420]
A little bit of tooth, a little blow

[02:33:02.420 --> 02:33:05.180]
When I'm elected out, put it in all that

[02:33:05.180 --> 02:33:08.100]
When I put it up the concentration camp

[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:16.200]
Yeah, thank you

[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:19.660]
Okay, 131 at 560 WQAM, how about a little...

[02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:24.940]
Yo, listen up, here's the story of that

[02:33:24.940 --> 02:33:28.300]
First radio show in America to play that song, months and months and months ago

[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:30.920]
And there are people who questioned my taste in popular music

[02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:34.400]
560, 705, 60, pound, 560

[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:38.080]
First person on this part of the neck of the woods to play the Bloodhound Gang

[02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:41.420]
I gave you credit for that, and the bad touch

[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:44.540]
And touch this, here's Lakeport, hello

[02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:45.960]
Fast on our shoulders, I think

[02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:47.140]
Hello

[02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:49.620]
Yes sir, Blue, I mean out, new

[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:50.800]
Yeah, this is blue

[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:52.860]
I apologize, that's okay

[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:54.840]
A long time listener, love this program

[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:56.300]
Yeah, I'm not working

[02:33:57.780 --> 02:33:58.740]
Yeah, little blue

[02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:01.480]
You got a bear with me, I'm not working, I'm trying to sneak this phone call in

[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:03.100]
I just had a call, you know, I'm telling you that

[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:05.660]
I'm kind of partial to doggy stomachs though

[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:07.320]
And...

[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:08.020]
Okay, great

[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:10.560]
And he's over on the West Coast, that figure, he's in a doggy stomach

[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:10.960]
Correct him

[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:11.160]
Yeah

[02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:12.920]
On a receiving end

[02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:17.480]
560, 705, 60, pound, 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:20.240]
Out of town line, if we got any more mouth-readers, a breeders like him

[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:23.360]
877, 785, 63, 45

[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:25.940]
Hey, let's know, have to be sheepish about it, over there on the West Coast

[02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:28.600]
We understand that a lot of you guys like are getting down on all fours

[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:32.800]
It's okay as long as you have your rearview mirror on, I guess

[02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:37.080]
Here's the mobile and rear-field V, chill out

[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:37.640]
Nail

[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:38.160]
Yes sir

[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:39.100]
How you doing?

[02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:39.540]
Great

[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:43.560]
I'll just, one thing with the new meeting, if you want to tell us

[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:49.440]
560, 705, 60, pound, 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:52.200]
Like I said, I think we've got to probably play the whole thing with this, pretty weird

[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:57.080]
Pretty weak, and you wonder why we resort to music on these shows every now and end

[02:34:57.080 --> 02:35:00.140]
Because you can't do a four hour show in this town anymore, they have no material

[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:01.140]
They have nothing to say

[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:03.660]
And it was women that were on there before they're gone

[02:35:03.660 --> 02:35:06.300]
Oh, here's a lady in Hylia, maybe she's got something to say

[02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:06.540]
Hello

[02:35:06.980 --> 02:35:07.780]
Nail, how you doing?

[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:08.480]
Great

[02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:12.300]
Nail, I just wanted to say, I'll make it quick and simple here

[02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:16.180]
I just wanted to tell those ranger fans today in the game

[02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:19.040]
Because I'm going to be there, they're going to get their ass to hand it to them

[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:21.800]
I think so, I think about the 5 to 2 sounds good, pants to 5 to 2

[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:24.640]
Yeah, that sounds good to me Nail, it sounds good to me, are you going to the game?

[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:25.260]
I'll be there

[02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:27.820]
All right, Nail, what section are you, and I'd like to say hi to you

[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:28.180]
101

[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:29.760]
All right, I'll be there, Nail

[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.740]
Be there with bells on

[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:32.200]
All right, it sure will take care

[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:33.120]
All right

[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:36.620]
It's a Pobbel in the Ray, Whitney in Burray, Burray in Whitney

[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:42.680]
And then he's like I said yesterday, a Greg Cotex, and uh, or was it the Dandla Bastard, I guess

[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:45.420]
He's one of the all-time worst in Dave Hyde

[02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:48.420]
But Dave every once in a great while, about 20 or he writes something that makes sense

[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:50.160]
And the rest of the time he regresses

[02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:54.200]
And the only time he writes anything that makes any sense when he steals it right out of the show

[02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:58.340]
Of course I was on vacation, so what is he right about Dan Marino, the greatest athlete?

[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:02.420]
They both wrote this crap, the greatest athlete ever put a uniform on in this town

[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:06.900]
So ludicrous, so ridiculous, as much as I loved Danny Boyn, as great as he was

[02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:09.200]
He was a statue

[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:15.900]
A statue with a great arm, a great pastor, a great competitor, a guy with a lot of ability, lots of desire to win

[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:22.180]
But to call him the greatest athlete, to put him in the same class with Pobbel Burray, is like, uh, you know, it's a joke

[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:27.140]
It's like putting Greg out in a class with the Rick and Suds, you know

[02:36:29.420 --> 02:36:33.400]
Shame on you guys, but it's a one-dimensional horse in Buggie Town, so what do you expect?

[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:37.220]
You expect him to broaden their horizons and learn something a little bit beyond the same old crap?

[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:38.320]
No, same old pig skin

[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:38.860]
No

[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:44.280]
One thing about that Dandla Bastard, he wouldn't know a pig skin from a foreskin

[02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:46.640]
Here's Hollywood, hello

[02:36:48.100 --> 02:36:48.460]
Hollywood

[02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:50.220]
You're right, just like friend, how are you?

[02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:50.940]
Yes sir, okay

[02:36:50.940 --> 02:36:57.580]
Nice to have you back in this dump, and I want to just give a quick, pick a report and also let you ask a quick question

[02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:04.760]
Pick a report first of all, that's on Pine's Boulevard going eastbound by BCC, they're sitting out there like, with goddamn cameras holding them out there like the trash

[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:06.060]
How long have you done the way to Godfathers?

[02:37:07.380 --> 02:37:12.120]
Second thing was, I just wanted to know your official anniversary date in the market

[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:12.800]
March 1

[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:13.500]
March 1?

[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:18.120]
And if anybody has a heart, get out there and send cards, can you give an address to that or?

[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:19.040]
Give me an arrow heart

[02:37:19.460 --> 02:37:20.940]
They don't give a crap, will they?

[02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:22.280]
No, they don't give a shmit, that's right

[02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:28.300]
But I mean, I live in Hollywood, we just had an election with the mayor and out of, I don't know

[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:31.880]
So many people in the city, maybe like 6,000 showed up

[02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:33.520]
That's the world today

[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:34.020]
Yeah

[02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:35.460]
And when they wonder why you can't live with it

[02:37:35.460 --> 02:37:38.520]
There's only 6,000 people that are able to get out of the house to understand

[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:41.280]
The median agent, Hollywood is death plus ten

[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:41.980]
That's a good point

[02:37:41.980 --> 02:37:42.960]
Well have a great day pal

[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:43.400]
Take care buddy

[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:43.900]
Hang in there

[02:37:44.660 --> 02:37:49.020]
There's a young man in Hollywood, I feel for him believe me, I feel sorry because like I said, the median agent is dead

[02:37:49.020 --> 02:37:51.280]
And Hollywood is 100 days mithusel plus ten

[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:55.000]
Very old, old, crusty place, Hollywood

[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000]
And poor Joe Costello, Joe's a good guy

[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:01.260]
But he was trying to give me a song and a dance again about that place where they got the thin pizza on 441

[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:01.780]
What's the name of that?

[02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:02.980]
Villa Rose

[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:09.180]
Don't you remember years ago people were, and I was talking about the great thin pizza that they make in Italy and the wood burning ovens

[02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:13.500]
In fact, I heard beefo do a spot this morning for a place

[02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:17.020]
I can't think of what the name was, it was one of his famous restaurant taste

[02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.720]
Where he's going to be doing an appearance this Saturday

[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.000]
And their big deal is that they do the pizza in the Italian wood burning ovens

[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:23.980]
The real thin Italian I'm assuming they make, I hope

[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.980]
So what anyway, he was trying to give me a song and a dance about Villa Rose

[02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:30.720]
Villa Rose is okay if you like sauce on a cracker

[02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:33.100]
That's what their pizzas are like

[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:36.300]
And in the clientele in there, you talk about Hillbilly heaven

[02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:39.860]
And maybe that's why Joe likes it, maybe gets a lot of his truckers in there

[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:43.380]
They can talk about auto racing and the Darlington of this and Darling that

[02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:49.000]
That's what's in Gordon John Cox is a lot and also the other Gordon

[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:54.420]
Yeah, he says something about Darling

[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:03.380]
You don't know Gordon John Cox from Hastings Michigan, you don't know your auto racing man

[02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:04.120]
No, I don't

[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:05.020]
You're so limited

[02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:06.560]
You know the patties

[02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:10.980]
They're always on the bread when you go to North Carolina, all the loaves of bread have racers on them

[02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:13.340]
Yeah, and trading credit is in Darling, yeah

[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:15.760]
Here's a mobile in Miami, hello

[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:19.800]
You can be sure all those auto racing guys meet at those truck stops a lot

[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:20.120]
Hello

[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:23.180]
Mobile in Miami going once

[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:23.940]
Neil

[02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:24.740]
Yes sir

[02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:25.620]
How you doing boss?

[02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:28.580]
Okay, I just got back from a real man's town

[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:29.320]
What's that?

[02:39:29.620 --> 02:39:30.060]
Vegas

[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:31.080]
All right

[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:35.860]
I went for the first time in my entire life and let me tell you I stayed at the MGM grant

[02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:36.140]
Right?

[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:36.860]
$8600

[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:39.220]
You made $8600?

[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.420]
$8600 bucks coming back from Vegas, I went it would like $2,500 and my girlfriend lost most of it

[02:39:45.420 --> 02:39:47.560]
But I came back and I made bank $8600

[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:49.300]
You made $8600 profit

[02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:51.020]
$8600 profit

[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:51.980]
There you go

[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:57.760]
I'm moving back, I got to get out of this town, this place is a big dump, I just got to get out of here, I'm going back to Vegas

[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:00.300]
Okay, I'll see you there, next time you're on man do it

[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:00.860]
Okay

[02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:04.740]
So Vegas is still there and it's still pretty good, that's good, that's reassuring to know

[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:06.200]
5,6,7

[02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:10.700]
And this town is still here and it's still sucks, huh?

[02:40:11.100 --> 02:40:14.620]
Okay, not so reassuring to know but I kind of felt it, you know what I came back when I got it

[02:40:14.620 --> 02:40:20.720]
In fact, as we walked through the jetway on that plane from Atlanta coming back to last leg of my journey back from Amsterdam on Monday

[02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:27.000]
And you could hear people say I'm always almost always the first one off the plane in one of the first four or five the other way around

[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:31.460]
And the people behind me are going, oh my god, feel like humidity

[02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:37.300]
Just hit them in the put, these are almost all people from other parts of the country

[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:44.580]
From Atlanta, oh and by the way talk about a cracker town, anybody ever calls this show and tries to tell me that Atlanta is like a civilized place

[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:50.080]
Between your newspaper, papers and the bumpkins up there and the people you hear on the radio, that is the most Yahoo

[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:54.960]
I remember the time they were talking about the Simalcatch that he's showing WSB in Atlanta when we were at IOD

[02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:59.980]
And then they had second thoughts about it because they said that if you think Tampa is Yahoo and Parochial

[02:40:59.980 --> 02:41:03.540]
Tampa is like metropolitan compared to Atlanta and they're right

[02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:10.040]
Atlanta is the, so if you think John Rocker is out of place being in Atlanta, you're dreaming, that's a perfect spot for him

[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:10.440]
Yow

[02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:13.280]
That's their middle name in Atlanta

[02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:16.940]
And so it's kind of surprising to me they let all those sparsers in there

[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.520]
21 before 2 at 560 WQM

[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:22.980]
Totally, how Aaron's coming

[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:34.820]
Oh well I think the town is right top, only to touch my body

[02:41:34.820 --> 02:41:39.140]
I want to be out there on the body, it's just giving me a clue

[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:44.920]
So I got to look twice at and find myself a highway

[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:49.620]
And I know one could hide away and the twelfth afternoon

[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:56.040]
Oh I find my plate boys and creepy lotion

[02:41:56.620 --> 02:41:59.840]
But the town won't lie down on the floor

[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:06.340]
Oh I put my wrist action in that lotion

[02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:11.180]
And I pray to no one accidentally opens up the door

[02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:12.920]
Cause I got a masturbator

[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:13.320]
Word's word

[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:15.660]
I got a masturbator

[02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:17.980]
Yeah I got a masturbator

[02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:19.980]
I got a masturbator

[02:42:20.660 --> 02:42:21.100]
I got a masturbator

[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:21.580]
I got a masturbator

[02:42:21.580 --> 02:42:23.340]
I moved out of the day

[02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:26.140]
I moved out of the day

[02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:27.140]
I moved out of the day

[02:42:27.140 --> 02:42:28.060]
I moved out of the day

[02:42:28.060 --> 02:42:30.520]
I moved out of the day

[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:32.800]
I think I'm just going to play that four hours every day from now on

[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:35.080]
I mean just you know from next however long I'm here

[02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:36.980]
145 at 560 WQM

[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:38.140]
We're rolling along

[02:42:38.140 --> 02:42:38.980]
Here's singing a song

[02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:41.760]
Got a lot of Panther Ranger tickets to the way between now and two o'clock

[02:42:42.860 --> 02:42:44.060]
Here's a mobile in Miami

[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:44.440]
Hello

[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:46.240]
New Rogers

[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:46.940]
Yes sir

[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:49.260]
Cardiologist here in Miami

[02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:51.200]
I heard that you were giving away tickets

[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:53.260]
And I stopped my server just to call in

[02:42:55.300 --> 02:42:56.400]
It was a joke

[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:59.600]
I was listening to people who just kind of call out of the blue

[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:00.360]
Like some women

[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:02.320]
Hey I hear you giving away a free ticket

[02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:03.360]
Did you see how the blue?

[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:04.620]
Yeah, out of the blue

[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:06.200]
Yeah, okay

[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:08.100]
Must have been a sub-logal mess

[02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:09.580]
I probably see I plant all these eggs

[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:11.220]
It's part of my evil thing that I do

[02:43:11.220 --> 02:43:11.840]
This agenda

[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:13.520]
That's a lovely show

[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:14.500]
Just wanted to call in

[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:16.240]
And kind of break up a little attention there

[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:17.560]
Excellent God bless you sir

[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:18.320]
Thank you sir

[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:19.360]
And I'll pray for us

[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:20.280]
Thank you

[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:22.020]
There you go

[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:23.120]
He pulled off his heavy duty

[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:24.480]
There's probably people dying over there

[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:25.900]
And he called into it through that thing

[02:43:25.900 --> 02:43:26.460]
I just go on there

[02:43:28.980 --> 02:43:29.780]
I'm gonna say it again

[02:43:29.780 --> 02:43:31.240]
They're from Italy I post 155

[02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:35.460]
I would play a little bit of movie or body too

[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:37.220]
But somebody I would only like that CD so much

[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:37.960]
That that one disappeared

[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:39.400]
But nevertheless I'll make another one

[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:39.880]
I'll burn one

[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:41.260]
I'm gonna go home and burn one tonight

[02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:42.280]
And a CD too

[02:43:44.020 --> 02:43:44.380]
What?

[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:45.840]
That wasn't great doing that

[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:46.580]
That was a good investment

[02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:47.300]
Do you remember that day?

[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:47.600]
Yeah

[02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:48.740]
Well that was quite a project

[02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:50.680]
Now who was it was both Porto Volca Brian

[02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:53.920]
What was the name of that place that the Sam Goodies

[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:55.520]
No, that wasn't the name of it

[02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:56.020]
Oh yeah

[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:56.960]
Ash

[02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:59.460]
Wait, Sam Goodies is a record story

[02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:02.080]
Sam and you are goody from your ash

[02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:02.420]
Hole

[02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:04.060]
I know some are Sam

[02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:05.200]
Sam, son of Sam

[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:06.560]
Sam and now I'm confused

[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:07.400]
Sam Ash

[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:08.880]
Boy did that place suck

[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:11.100]
Yeah they wanted

[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:12.800]
I don't know what to do

[02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:13.980]
It was they wouldn't take his check

[02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:15.680]
And then they wouldn't take my credit card number

[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:17.140]
And then they wanted to pass it up

[02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:17.720]
Properly

[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:19.120]
Oh my god

[02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:21.680]
Then where did I finally get it?

[02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:22.460]
Did we get it from them?

[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:22.920]
Yes

[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:25.400]
And after a lot of all kinds of grief

[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:26.560]
But from a different store

[02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:27.580]
Right

[02:44:27.580 --> 02:44:28.380]
A different location

[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:30.040]
Yeah, whatever that one location was

[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:30.780]
Maybe somebody remembers

[02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:31.820]
We got a rip of an ash again

[02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:32.500]
Like every six months

[02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:33.300]
Put it on the calendar

[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:35.080]
By the way, do we have a thing coming

[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:37.180]
A thing?

[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:38.600]
Yeah

[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:39.660]
I don't want to say where

[02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:41.060]
Because John Penis isn't here anymore

[02:44:41.060 --> 02:44:42.180]
No, it was Brian's account

[02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:44.300]
I thought we are on a Saturday

[02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:46.380]
But he never got back to his

[02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:48.420]
Is that because I don't want one of these things to pop up

[02:44:48.420 --> 02:44:50.120]
And then I have to say how come he had ever showed up

[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:51.140]
I know nothing about it

[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:52.100]
Seminole Indian

[02:44:52.100 --> 02:44:52.680]
Remember that?

[02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:53.580]
Oh yes

[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:54.680]
Well, one is there

[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:55.040]
I don't know

[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:55.580]
Okay

[02:44:57.500 --> 02:44:57.820]
56070560

[02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:00.020]
Palm 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:01.580]
See, it's one thing about our sales people

[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:02.780]
And a lot of other people around here

[02:45:02.780 --> 02:45:04.260]
They don't bother speaking to me

[02:45:04.260 --> 02:45:05.160]
It's little as possible

[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:05.900]
Because they're terrified

[02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:07.600]
Which is what a bunch of pussy they are

[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:09.000]
So they go in there

[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:09.620]
And they talk to George

[02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:12.560]
Just like that book that Gary Sarner left over here

[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:14.760]
Did you ever get a hold of it?

[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:15.160]
Did you read it yet?

[02:45:15.260 --> 02:45:15.360]
No

[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:17.660]
Yeah, I read it in between the breaks on the show

[02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:19.860]
Okay, whatever you want Gary, we'll petal anything here

[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:22.920]
Here's a mobile and deer field, hello

[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:23.820]
Yeah, I know

[02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:24.600]
Yes sir

[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:26.120]
Happy early anniversary

[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:26.880]
Thank you

[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:28.960]
Calling from the home of cemetery village

[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:29.820]
Who waits from today?

[02:45:29.980 --> 02:45:30.580]
How do you like that?

[02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:33.160]
Who waits from the day will be March the 1st, 24 years

[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:35.620]
On the year in this God for second place

[02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:38.260]
You know, I'm going to Amsterdam first time with my wife

[02:45:38.260 --> 02:45:39.000]
I'm going to Amsterdam first for an anniversary

[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.440]
Where do you suggest that stay?

[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:42.760]
I would suggest you leave your wife home first of all

[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:43.880]
All right

[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:45.640]
And secondly, stay at a nice hotel

[02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:46.800]
All right

[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:48.860]
Like the hotel crown plans would be nice

[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:51.920]
And is there plenty of entertainment there?

[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:53.320]
There is lots of entertainment

[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:55.580]
There is a lot of stuff you'll be very entertained

[02:45:55.580 --> 02:45:56.320]
Okay, good

[02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:56.960]
You're right

[02:45:56.960 --> 02:45:57.740]
Leave your wife home

[02:45:58.260 --> 02:45:59.060]
And Neil, you're good

[02:45:59.060 --> 02:46:00.100]
Okay, I have a great time

[02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:01.660]
What?

[02:46:02.180 --> 02:46:03.500]
So how's the 26 for you?

[02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:08.240]
You see, that goes to show you what I'm telling you

[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:09.020]
I'm talking about this place

[02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:09.940]
Apparently it's all arranged

[02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:11.620]
And I don't know what it is

[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:11.940]
But it's not in the town

[02:46:11.940 --> 02:46:12.720]
It's the first time I heard of it

[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:13.360]
Yeah

[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:15.520]
Well, that's because he doesn't speak to us

[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:17.320]
Okay, we have this relationship with the show

[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:19.180]
And all I'm speaking of the sale of the department

[02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:20.740]
So when is Peter Leonard going to the coast?

[02:46:21.340 --> 02:46:23.280]
Or is that just a rumor that I started on the year?

[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:25.040]
Yeah, it isn't a bad timing, Peter

[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:28.740]
See, this is why Peter Leonard schmoozes with Bobby Green

[02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:29.900]
And all the people in the business

[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:32.240]
And Paul, you over there on Zeta and this one and that one

[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:33.760]
Because he, he hip-hop

[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:34.540]
He hops around

[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:37.580]
He's like a guy that's butterfly and he's

[02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:41.060]
Speaking of butterflies, you know what they call it, huh?

[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:44.500]
Well, what is a butterfly before it becomes a butterfly?

[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:45.440]
It's a caterpillar, right?

[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:48.240]
Right, and if it's a black caterpillar, what do they call it?

[02:46:48.340 --> 02:46:49.260]
A cocoon

[02:46:53.020 --> 02:46:55.000]
Actually, it was a black caterpillar with a speech defect

[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:55.920]
But that would have been bad

[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:58.080]
We don't want to make fun of people with speech defects

[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:00.200]
Here's a deer field, hello

[02:47:02.060 --> 02:47:02.700]
Deer field

[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:03.660]
That's me

[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:04.520]
That sounds like you

[02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:05.960]
Hey, I don't have a pig report, Rick

[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:08.100]
I tell you how many pig reports did I have?

[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:10.480]
Not that I don't appreciate them, but boy, it's a bug

[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:12.120]
I got a good BSO story for you

[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:12.840]
A BSO story, okay?

[02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:13.480]
A BSO story, okay?

[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:18.680]
Sunday night, pulled over, converged on by three BSO, pulled over, pulled out of my car, and

[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:20.120]
then pulled out of my car, and then pulled out of my car, and then pulled out of my car, and then cupped

[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:20.500]
Really?

[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:22.080]
Growing in the back of a cob car, why?

[02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:26.740]
Because they're looking for a guy in the same car that I have, a Honda Civic

[02:47:26.740 --> 02:47:28.560]
How many Honda Civic are on the road?

[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:31.060]
About 45,000 every highway

[02:47:31.060 --> 02:47:35.280]
And so I get pulled out, and almost shot in the face

[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:40.120]
I have a New York Islander's license plate in front of my car, I thought, geez, that's no reason to get shot in the face

[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:42.760]
No, they should have pulled you over, give you a sympathy card

[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:44.460]
They should have, really, I'm hurting

[02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:48.640]
So I'm a lifelong I understand, so I'd love to see the Ranger get the crappied out of them

[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:48.940]
Yeah

[02:47:49.580 --> 02:47:52.700]
Well, I understand there's plenty of free tickets, so I hope you'll see it at the box office

[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:55.340]
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5

[02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:59.820]
Now listen, the fact that we got all nine lines for the first time today, I hope that they're not taking seriously

[02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:04.240]
That crap about giving away hockey tickets, because this guy laughed when I said it, I'm sure he realized it didn't he?

[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:04.460]
Uh-huh

[02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:04.700]
Good

[02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:07.820]
I mean being an Islander fan, he's got to have a great sense of humor

[02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:10.780]
How about those islanders, huh?

[02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:15.500]
That's okay, the flyers will be upset, that'll learn their lesson with that, you know, OJCraft

[02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:17.740]
You know, just too many goons on one team

[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:20.480]
Goon rhymes with cocoon

[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:26.740]
10 before 2 at 5, 60 W to QL, we got the Rangers, that in fact I haven't given you the schedule for today

[02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:30.240]
Shame on me, that's probably sitting in there getting all rubbing his hind legs together

[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:31.460]
Like an insect

[02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:35.680]
We got Hank in the studio, we got Geltie on game night at 6 o'clock night

[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:39.660]
Geltie's gonna have some great rumors by the way about Bluff going over there to kiss their fan to be the PD

[02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:41.360]
And about what's his name coming over here?

[02:48:41.620 --> 02:48:42.220]
Jeric Ackie

[02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:43.260]
Yeah, which better not happen

[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:47.700]
And then 7 o'clock we got the pre-game to Rangers in Panther 730 and then on Waxie

[02:48:47.700 --> 02:48:53.940]
We got the Herakun Vasket Ball, Providence College Friars and Herakun on 790 Waxie at 7 o'clock tonight

[02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:56.280]
And then Ed Kaplan after all of that chazarai

[02:48:58.180 --> 02:49:01.700]
And George was just telling me about what a great guy Mark Vandermeers, which I already knew that

[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:04.580]
Not always the good guy, but he's also talented, he does a really good job

[02:49:04.580 --> 02:49:07.820]
Nice going, Air Mark, and of course the obvious question is what is he doing here?

[02:49:09.180 --> 02:49:10.180]
We just don't know

[02:49:11.660 --> 02:49:13.520]
151 at 5, 60 W to QL

[02:49:14.140 --> 02:49:20.540]
Gym mandates, toss sports, weekends, right needs, on sports radio 5, 60 QAL

[02:49:20.540 --> 02:49:22.360]
It's just kids getting bigger

[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:24.420]
You've heard him squeak, you've heard him sing

[02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:29.560]
Now the Ferret Talks dirty on a crystal clear digital recording that can now be yours

[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:33.180]
Listen to the dirty talk

[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:37.040]
Picture what he's doing to you

[02:49:40.220 --> 02:49:42.740]
Let his words work their magic

[02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:47.260]
It's the Ferret Talks dirty

[02:49:47.260 --> 02:49:51.700]
He's a Ferret Talks dirty on a crystal clear digital recording that can now be yours

[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:58.460]
156 at 5, 60 QM saw Hank giving a little piece of advice he said you know that stock

[02:49:58.460 --> 02:50:00.460]
No, yeah he said just keep that word in mind

[02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:02.700]
No, I can't say which one but just kept saying no

[02:50:03.700 --> 02:50:08.460]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 why in the world could I possibly be given the number with 4 minutes to a little to a clock

[02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:10.940]
How can I be doing that? I must be losing it, am I losing it?

[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.140]
Uh-huh, poor Rick and Suds

[02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:14.640]
Here's a mobile in Davy, hello

[02:50:16.100 --> 02:50:17.500]
Mobile in Davy, yes sir

[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:18.640]
Davy, how are you doing?

[02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:22.840]
Great, good I just want to say that tonight I'm going to my very first 10th or so

[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:23.880]
All right, great

[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:31.460]
And I think that in this town, Pavel Buright is the most underrated, underappreciated player we've gotten in this town

[02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:32.860]
Absolutely correct

[02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:40.480]
And I think that more people I mean forget to heat me a read I understand there's empty seats but there should not be an empty seat in that area tonight

[02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:46.660]
I want to be everybody, there's so many fans here if I don't care if you're an islander fan or a raider fan if you're a fan of hockey

[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:49.260]
Do you want to see the best thing in this town?

[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:50.080]
Go see the panther in the world

[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:52.660]
What do you mean in the town? He's the best player in the world, that's just in the town

[02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:56.040]
I was in the panthers in general, the panthers the best thing we've gotten in this town

[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:00.800]
Right, the only thing we've gotten in this town that's all we have is the panthers and godfathers and that's about it

[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:05.320]
Exactly and there are so exciting the ones, I've watched on TV, I've been following them in the paper

[02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:12.520]
And I think that the newspaper guys in this town don't know where the talk to them when it comes to the panthers

[02:51:12.520 --> 02:51:14.680]
Well they've got a lot of company, I'll see their night pal

[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:15.520]
Alright, see you then

[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:15.920]
Alright

[02:51:17.180 --> 02:51:21.480]
We love you panther, so yes we do, come on let's get out there tonight, what do you say?

[02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:22.120]
No, come on

[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:23.920]
No, how about if we give you a hundred bucks?

[02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:25.460]
No, how about if we give you a free parking lot?

[02:51:25.460 --> 02:51:27.120]
No, how about if you get laid there in the arena?

[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:27.860]
Uh-huh, okay

[02:51:29.100 --> 02:51:32.220]
I'll tell you one thing you can come out and take a look around all over the pentam which game it is

[02:51:32.220 --> 02:51:35.000]
You know some games you look around, there's a lot of real interesting looking people

[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:38.220]
Other games you come and you look around and you go like, eeeeh

[02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:40.240]
Like tonight that those rednecks were there, wow

[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:44.400]
Hey put them in the board, put them in the board, where will come on you, I swear to you

[02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:49.780]
Look I was kind of impressed that there was a, I knew he was a listener because you know when a redneck is out there speaking Yiddish

[02:51:50.840 --> 02:51:52.680]
Here's the lady in Poppato B, cello

[02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:53.180]
Hello

[02:51:53.180 --> 02:51:53.960]
Yes ma'am

[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:54.320]
Hi Neil

[02:51:54.320 --> 02:51:54.900]
How you doing?

[02:51:55.240 --> 02:51:58.180]
Pretty good, I'm excited about going to the hockey game tonight

[02:51:58.180 --> 02:51:58.620]
Great

[02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:01.920]
I'm a great hockey fan, I grew up on hockey in Rochester, New York

[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:04.260]
Rochester Amherst, go Amherst, go over there

[02:52:04.260 --> 02:52:08.300]
Yeah, right, my day was from Toronto and he used to take us over to Toronto to see the Maple Leafs

[02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:10.040]
And we used to go to Amherst games all the time

[02:52:10.040 --> 02:52:10.280]
Right

[02:52:10.280 --> 02:52:15.740]
Of course when we were kids, a ticket for my dad to take us was like $3 for a kid, something like that

[02:52:15.740 --> 02:52:23.040]
The thing about the Panthers is the big money guys like Wayne Heising, I have definitely placed out the average working person

[02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:26.480]
Like I'm dating a single father, he has two teenage sons

[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:31.040]
We're going to the games tonight, we got the least expensive tickets, $25 a piece, that's $100

[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:31.900]
Jesus

[02:52:31.900 --> 02:52:35.040]
And we're going Saturday night because I got to see Yogurt

[02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:35.380]
Right

[02:52:35.380 --> 02:52:40.480]
And the 25 tickets were sold out, we have $38 tickets, that's $162

[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:41.820]
Oh my god, that's for kids

[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:43.800]
Jesus Christ, have you got a big fan?

[02:52:43.800 --> 02:52:50.260]
You know, in our home hockey, it's the last great sport, but the big money guys and the big salaries are just ruining it for the average guy

[02:52:50.260 --> 02:52:51.280]
You're right, they're killing it

[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:55.020]
But we watch it every night on TV that they're on, go Panthers

[02:52:55.020 --> 02:52:55.800]
Alright, see you tonight

[02:52:55.800 --> 02:52:56.360]
Okay

[02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:57.020]
Bye-bye

[02:52:57.500 --> 02:53:00.360]
Final score tonight by the way Panthers 5, the New York Rangers 2

[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:05.060]
I just say that as one of those people that has tremendous psychic powers, you can feel it, you can smell it

[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:08.980]
And every time number 14 comes out there on the ice, he does the good number 14

[02:53:08.980 --> 02:53:10.680]
Which is our way wouldn't he, of course, which is God

[02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:14.240]
And then it is the evil obnoxious little 14, which is Theo Ferry
