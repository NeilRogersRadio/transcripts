matlock oh 10.02.5 60 wqm happy Tuesday it's a monumental day a monumental moment on his show

[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.220]
today is the 20.09th February 2000 last time we check happy birthday by the way to all you um

[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.820]
leap your people leap on this but at any rate today is the end of February which means tomorrow is

[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.740]
March 1st which means today is the end of 24 years of this show on the radio on this market

[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.320]
let's hear it for me huh yeah how sad but at any rate before we get into all the big stuff today

[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.080]
what big stuff here's the result from yesterday's poll on our website neo-rangers.com and i don't

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.760]
understand how some people say that they're clicking on our neo-rangers.com and they don't see the

[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.920]
pool how is that possible how can anybody click on the same website and not get the same thing

[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.900]
is that possible huh no so maybe whoever told me that my friend Ron from Philadelphia the flyer

[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.140]
spend maybe too much beasor is what the problem is maybe it's getting to your mind Ron too much

[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.780]
of that beasor but anyway yesterday we asked you agree with the not guilty bird of the new york city

[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.500]
cops and uh this is the way it came out we had 317 votes and you notice a little bit less than

[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.080]
usual because it was monday never realized that before no that's the first time we took a poll on

[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.200]
monday like everything else they don't have time on monday do you understand they don't have time

[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.520]
maybe they're just not as passionate about this particular issue or maybe they stuck that might

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.740]
have been it like the monks they stuck and the panthers they stuck and the size of that crowd they

[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.560]
stuck well what would you rather see an exciting hockey game although it was exciting if you were

[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.140]
Buffalo fan or would you rather go see a bunch of seven-foot freaky schwarzes elbowing each other

[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.520]
up and down a court no content no contest let's go see those clothes maybe yeah let's go watch

[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.260]
the schwarzes because it's the nixon a heat in the heat in the mix and the jets and the dolphins

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.900]
the same old tire crap oh this town is as predictable as the weather with the goddamn south pool

[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.380]
anyway we had 317 votes and winning of course was the no 211 said no they don't agree with the

[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.160]
verdict of the jury that's two turds and of course the other turd you turd 106 said yes they do agree

[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.600]
33.4 percent so almost exactly two thirds to one third to the one saying they don't agree now that's

[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.440]
kind of interesting because in our local newspapers today look at this the herald and one the

[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.260]
last time I agreed with the herald what year was that what century was that once in a great while

[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.360]
which goes to show you that if they throw enough crap up on the year sooner or later they'll get

[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.220]
that in the late disgusting grotesque and unacceptable editorial today just verdict but questions

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.740]
remain it sounds like that fascist Nazi pig Rudy Giuliani they've written this the Sun sentinel keep

[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.100]
in mind the Sun sentinel is owned by the Chicago Tribune rather ultra right wing not as right wing

[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.340]
is the what's it the Sun isn't that the Chicago Sun the right wing tablet but almost very

[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.100]
stodgy conservative the heraldos is the yellow verdict just is not yet served

[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.720]
says whether it's verdict the jury has spoken for how much the law can bend to protect the right

[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.840]
of defendants now it's up to attorney general janitor we know injustice to protect victims and

[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.580]
ordinary people not going to read the whole thing because quite frankly we'll be boring terminal

[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.120]
like most of everything you find in our local newspapers but the Sun sentinel says

[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.060]
is it possible for something very bad to happen without any but anyone's being to blame unfortunately

[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.060]
the answer is yes the emerald de allot tragedy may be a case in points is the hero the Sun sentinel

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.560]
is it possible to render a just verdict and not a chief injustice unfortunately yes the emerald

[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.300]
de allot tragedy may just be a case in point I'm always too timid the whole thing just the first

[00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.180]
couple of paragraphs now that a jury has found that four new york city police officers charged

[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.540]
with killing the yellow were not killed either crimes with which they've recharged it's up to the

[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.020]
city of new york its police department the federal government civil courts and finally the court

[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.480]
of public opinion to decide whether the former guilty of anything else or whether anyone else was

[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.040]
to do so they'll have to traverse a minefield of political pressures and warring agendas

[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.840]
there's that agenda again unlike the jury in the oj simpson case this one did not seek to put

[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.100]
the system on trial jurors carefully followed joseph justice joseph w two reasons instructions

[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.600]
and rendered a true and just verdict as to the charges against the four officers a true and just

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.980]
verdict as your son sentinel they've listened when the judge told him a police officer should

[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.400]
they not be considered the aggressor just because he gives chase of pulls is gun they did not fall

[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.380]
for the pilaver which your judge never heard that word before i'm not sure i pronounce the crap

[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.380]
that that's pilaver that's a big high fallout in the word for make no mistake about it crap yeah

[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.860]
they didn't fall for the crap about the number of shots fired who's counting it such time

[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.260]
nor expect the officers to be mind readers they understood the cops sometimes must make split

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.760]
second decisions about whether and when to use force and that such split second decision

[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.520]
with lives in line are never easy and then there's a whole bunch of other crap

[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.540]
can you like that they didn't fall for the crap about how many shots were fired so what the

[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:21.900]
son sentel is trying to tell you is that if they fired 41 shots or 150 shots or 350,000 shots

[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.560]
it didn't make any difference does anybody with a brain believe that no what a stupid talk about

[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.260]
pilaver whatever that i mean talk about a bunch of crap god they must be doing drugs over there at

[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.220]
the sunset you know what these are the same people who give us a song and a dance about baseball

[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.280]
and how this town can't survive without baseball and how much it adds to the community and both

[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.640]
newspapers with a crap about gambling and how gambling is evil than yada yada yada and if you want

[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:52.980]
to point bread turn to the sports section inconsistent irrational hysterical idiotic bunch of

[00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:00.620]
stupid stupid idiotic exactly couldn't say better myself they didn't fall for the crap about

[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.640]
the number of shots fired how about the fact that most of the shots were fired after he was already

[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.860]
in a horizontal position falling and then a whole bunch of shots after he was already down

[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.700]
through the bottoms of his feet now like i said yesterday maybe they had maybe they had feet

[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.300]
seeking bullets that might have been it yeah maybe that's what it was maybe he was really standing

[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.760]
when he got hit with O shot it's just that they used feet seeking not heat seeking feet seeking

[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.220]
and they went like right under his feet and then moved straight up like we said yesterday

[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.580]
that magic bullet that Arlen Spector invented back in 1963

[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.860]
just absolutely unbelievable the lengths to which and you talk about crap yesterday i'm watching

[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.040]
the news and i noticed that none of the stories that i saw in the news last night are in the paper

[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:51.540]
today including the what about the higher lea cops that were selling ecstasy to miners to kids

[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.500]
selling ecstasy to kids and while some of you people out there may think that ecstasy is in and

[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.200]
chic and yada yada yada and maybe you're raven about those the fact is that their kids Odin and

[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.880]
dying on it oh yeah what uh yeah that's right i'm sure they were only selling the good stuff though

[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.500]
yeah that's right the good pure stuff not a pure cops don't sell in pure crap pure cops sell pure

[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:22.540]
drugs let's hear it out of the pure cops and then i'm driving home yesterday and here they got

[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.760]
in plantation i'll hide this road guess what they got they got the the little uh get gangle

[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.560]
again there the radar porkers out there once again so you can give me all the rationalizations you

[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.900]
want and all the bull crap but this was grotesque i'm gonna go up there in the say hi to al Sharpen

[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.820]
from a long distance away by the i'll wait to him and give him one of these nine minutes after

[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.380]
10 at five sixty wq a no portion of this broad guess may be reproduced without the express written

[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:55.920]
permission of wq a m b briefly read acquisition court i didn't say sh** hey i'm even going to

[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.620]
the reason why i am calling this press conference is so we can talk about the media

[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.960]
circle instead of going on for a stupid matter now i know that i am only six but i read at a

[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.560]
thirty eight year old level so i'd like to issue this speech that i worked on along with my team

[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:18.840]
of advisors very often when one day i'll into the infant structure of these

[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.120]
vaternacetistic and uptime sequence drug synistic sublimates propaganda is one feels they did

[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.500]
sense of sorrow and it would be in the best interest of all parties and service we simply allow a

[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:36.940]
young man of my years to rebel in the innocence of youth rather than be a political pawn for those

[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:45.780]
of all period motifs thank you excuse me i'm late for my gq photo shoot okay it's 10 14 at five

[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:52.000]
sixty wq have a nice day alien today on what the hell is that all about we have uh

[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.840]
continuous to play on here now because somebody was in with that huh wasn't me this time somebody

[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.760]
was in here did link with our equipment yesterday maybe we want to hear that do we want to hear

[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.080]
that maybe a little later on like i said so here it is the last day of twenty four years on my

[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.940]
on the year in Miami i got one call on the board and i have one idiotic incoherent facts by somebody

[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.000]
who's obviously dropping asset as he wrote this i wish you could see this i mean just absolutely

[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.300]
the most idiot i wouldn't even waste my and it's signed jefferson davis

[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.000]
is that incredible or what is it on uh yes yeah kind of epitomizes everything although i'll say

[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.900]
it again my appearance at the ecebral indian casino on saturday that summed up all of my 24 years in

[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.120]
his town that was that light right in a nutshell and a capsule that was it right in front of my face

[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.540]
sitting in a sea of oh death it was just i can't get over i can't stop thinking about it

[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.120]
i have never seen and believe me there were some nice people there we all hope to what we'd like

[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.480]
to live to be a hundred and a hundred and ten hundred and fifty whatever the best we can do

[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.380]
with some reasonable sense of coherence and understanding of what's going on around us and the

[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.280]
ability to breathe the fresh air even a little bit of stale air wouldn't be bad

[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:06.920]
but i have never in my life seen anything quite like that if somebody would have sneezed

[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.260]
uh would be like oh i just woke up a hundred and fifty people over there on the uh blessed end

[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:20.180]
incredible here's our first call on our last day of this year does that make any sense

[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:28.180]
well i mean well it does to me in my own twisted way here's Carl spring hello

[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.980]
yeah i don't want to start off the day by being an agent provocateur but um don't you think this

[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.900]
is kind of setting a date dangerous precedent every time there's a decision that's maybe not

[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.580]
politically correct they seem to find more ways to continue trying the you know the people that

[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.580]
they felt what do you mean not politically correct what does that mean well i'm just saying i mean

[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.600]
it would seem that everybody disagrees with this uh shooting of this guy up in New York which i

[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.460]
don't know that much about anything's incredulous that they have the shoot the guy 41 times yeah well

[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.320]
if you if you don't know that much about it then why wouldn't you have an opinion on it well i don't

[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.940]
i'm not i'm not using this cap i'm just using i mean Rodney i'm many years ago was the Rodney

[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.980]
King thing and they had a uh a civil trial and they had a uh a judge the justice department came in

[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:11.180]
and a federal trial this isn't some this isn't something brand new well no but i'm saying it

[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.940]
seems that every time something doesn't seem to jive with what the public perception of what

[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.400]
should have occurred it seems that the government steps in it says well we're going to try these

[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.960]
guys on civil rights violation i don't remember the governor every time well not every time

[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:29.080]
how many of these how many of those cases can you name me how many of we had in our lifetime

[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:35.760]
well let's see we had uh probably the Rodney King yeah and then this one apparently

[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.780]
that's two and there is and there isn't any uh there's nothing going on with this one yet it's

[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:46.100]
all speculation so that's one okay well how many more uh i guess that would be the only two i'm

[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.220]
aware well then so why would why would you make that statement then but every every time something is

[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.440]
politically incorrect this isn't got anything to do with politically incorrect this has to do with

[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.700]
police uh overreaction and with uh an unacceptable verdict well don't you believe everybody has

[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.500]
a day in court yes and if you're filing it and if you're going to ask me do i believe that the

[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.480]
jury system works i would tell you absolutely not absolutely not so i would because this is one more

[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.100]
proof that it doesn't work yeah so then what are you talking about well i'm just saying if you

[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.580]
God forbid you should be accused of a crime and then you go to court you get found innocent or not

[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:26.200]
guilty whichever way that way yeah well how about oj Simpson well that's okay he was found he was

[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.540]
found not guilty in the criminal trial and the civil trial he was found responsible for the murder

[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.420]
right well don't you find that those two things are kind of opposite of one another in one court

[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.240]
you found not yeah i i found that they were opposite in one court they had a circus and a game

[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.560]
that was played based on race and in the other trial they had the the facts came out well do you

[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.580]
really think this and he was forced to testimony and fumble and bubble and bubble like that kind of

[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.300]
like a George w bush with a darker complexion well i would agree there but i just i mean i don't

[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.040]
like i said i don't know the specifics of the day well let's read in his paper in a magazine in

[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:03.300]
the comic back when you find out see there's nothing worse i mean if you're going to make an argument

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.700]
i would send them starting out by saying well i don't know much about it then why are you talking

[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.760]
about it i mean i realized talk is cheap and it's a talk show and it kills us in good time

[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.360]
thanks for killing some time sir and thanks for being the first call on the last day of whatever

[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:22.660]
this is the rest of our lives five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.120]
look at this tremendous reaction here after last night's great panther uh lost

[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.720]
i'm surprised fat boy wasn't modeling around here this morning

[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.040]
well how about those sabers oh peli uh uh uh surprise we didn't see him not disappointed

[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:44.140]
surprised here's a mobile in Miami hello male yes sir happy anniversary thanks

[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:51.500]
hey dead man tell no tale yeah that's why they shot him so many times yeah that's right they have to

[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.320]
hear inside that's absolutely correct we're not gonna hear you side of the story they shot him in

[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.360]
the feet that's the first time i heard that yeah because they shot him after he was already down on

[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.060]
the ground they kept shooting i heard the lady yesterday talking about uh they had a like expert

[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:12.200]
witnesses on saying that all the officers had automatic weapons uh-huh and it's very easy for them

[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:18.660]
because they've spired so rapidly to empty their guns yeah and uh in a matter of a few seconds

[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:24.680]
mm-hmm so but i guess all of them semi automatic weapons right i guess all of them had uh

[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.020]
if you're triggering well how come how come two of the cops fired sixteen times and uh one of them

[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:34.980]
fired five and they had a one of four i don't understand it i don't i can't i can't even explain

[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.800]
it overkill if you put an expression overkill and then they had all the if you wanted to disable

[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.500]
somebody so we no longer was a threat assuming that they thought he really had a gun if you

[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:49.160]
wanted to disable him fine but you don't have to hit him 19 times to disable him right i mean i

[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.300]
i can't understand maybe shooting them a few times i mean it's like a Rodney King thing how many

[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.220]
times have we seen that videotape and no matter how here he surrounded by a whole bunch of these cops

[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.480]
and they got him down around the ground and they've got him like uh subdued already and every time

[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.220]
he took a breath every time he tried to move they're kicking him and they're the battery him and the

[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:12.060]
uh it's just uh nice right brutality it's probably uh you know the adrenaline was flowing as soon

[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:17.860]
as one guy was flowing right right as soon as as soon as one guy shot they all just started squeezing it

[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:22.900]
they were they were squeezing already you know i'm sure yes oh one more thing yes um i've

[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.340]
recently had to drive up the Miami i've moved that in Miami a couple years ago up to power yes

[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:34.020]
unbelievable i can't believe i actually ever lived in Miami the traffic on the Palm Edo

[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.980]
yeah and dixie highway yeah is the worst yeah still to me but we got the metro

[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:50.840]
40 took me 45 minutes to get from 836 to the sawgrass yeah 45 freaking minutes

[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.480]
unbelievable stay anyway stop the anniversary okay thanks stay out of date that's my advice to

[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.320]
everybody stay in hell out of date we just barely crossed the county line here we don't want to

[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.860]
go into too far stay the hell out of date county if you know what's good for you you know what i mean

[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:14.740]
that's right brutal cops corrupt cops overkill cops are pouring out little girls cops selling

[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.500]
the ecstasy and other drugs to underage kids or to anybody else for that matter it's interesting

[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.080]
you know it would be one thing if they're really selling drugs to like you know adults but they

[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.980]
have this thing with selling guns to get and then of course you got the case of that kid down to

[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:32.300]
in Kendall which uh the trial is on now the cop took him in and then he shot and killed him and

[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.540]
they said he tried to sexually molest him and the other party they say well no it's the the

[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.420]
defense says no that's not true at all that uh they just had a temper etc and so on

[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.460]
see a good cop is great like a good doctor is great now you find a few for us

[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.180]
yeah that's right a good cop a hard cop is good to find and that what they always say something like

[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.200]
that uh huh five six seven how's line four doing today by the way just want to check because it

[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:04.000]
would be really bad it sounds okay to me and it or does it sound like yeah huh uh we'll see

[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.800]
we'll see how that goes five six seven oh five sixty here's a call in Jamesville hello

[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:15.340]
hey now yes sir I you know I mean this is a pattern of police police problems all across

[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.780]
this country I mean there's a general problem overall and as soon as people start realizing that

[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.880]
there may be something we'll get done about it but like what I don't know what they can do better

[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.580]
screening for their group for you know cops you know more you know promoting you know

[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:36.560]
collocation-cated cops anybody walking in who wants to right things it's cool to walk around

[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.980]
with a gun in a bag I mean come on I mean something has to be done I mean we they have a lot of

[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.440]
you know they have a lot of pulling have a lot of discretion and things and they have a lot of

[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.380]
pull right they were pulling a lot in this case um I don't know if you've heard of this not

[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:56.280]
you heard about this incident in caxonville with the woman at the hearties yeah you've heard

[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.720]
about that you've got splattered whether she got pissed off she was in the drive through and she

[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:15.560]
her burn push and face to and and then she attacked it with a broom yeah I mean I would

[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.840]
she might have been emulating those cops in New York with a broom handle maybe she thought she

[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.100]
was going to do a little number honor or something like that back home with that broom I was

[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.880]

[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:36.320]
besides the price of weed went up and a price of gas and um I mean that that was just unbelievable

[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.660]

five six seven oh five sixty pound five see that's personal that's in the family I can understand that

[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:09.260]
here's a mobile in bokeh hello hello Neil yes sir I've been listening to you for 20 years

[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:15.080]
are you 24 oh right I go back a long ways I really just want to say I really appreciate your

[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.040]
being here in south larida I know you're going to some tough times right now with given calls but

[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.740]
um we're out here listening well I'm used to it I mean on and off it's uh that's been one of the

[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.480]
great things all all through the years is trying to get a response out of these bastards like trying

[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.840]
to squeeze blood out of a turnip it's hard to do yeah so well guys like me I'm out here working

[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.660]
in the service industry you know pretty busy right on my headphones all the time but um I also I

[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.180]
I called you back a long time ago I used to be Ron from the music store in popinale um calls you

[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.180]
many many times you'd call every week things I had a lazy ass job and I could you know you know

[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.900]
on the phone and uh I could try to quit you but the um what I wanted to say about the the

[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:55.240]
killing for the the killing of that guy there these cops I think they're actually trained from what

[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.960]
I read to empty the chamber in that situation like that because of the you said yesterday I think

[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.600]
you touched on the fact that the caliber of those bullets like they're not allowed to use hollow

[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.460]
point bullets that will stop a guy like that's what's not a caller sir yeah yeah I mean that sounds

[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.840]
to me like a vast case it means like I you know under those circumstances in a panic situation

[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.720]
you kind of you know I think there should have been like a charge to those people but maybe not

[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.820]
you know the murder and they should be fired for sure you know I mean just because of the fact that

[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.600]
that's a bad situation maybe given the part of their pension and fired not just get away with it

[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.340]
completely you know like a medium type of thing but also the thing with the you know you said shoot maybe

[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:38.480]
like lightly killed yeah yeah well but you know you said shooting in the hand now that is

[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.620]
ridiculous kneel now I have a hand in the feet well you mean the bad part shooting the

[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.420]
yeah why why is that ridiculous well because you know first of all they're not trained to do that

[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.280]
they're trained to shoot for the largest portion of the body why why why is that so that's just how

[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.840]
you're true because under a situation like that you don't have a chance or the time to react to

[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.760]
hit a small area like that you just can't do it if you've ever shot a gun at a shooting range you

[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.200]
know that's just almost impossible work time TV every time well that's the thing that's

[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.840]
cobweiss shows every time well that's the thing you're looking they need to get with Marshall Dillon

[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.720]

[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.820]
not going to do that thing about the broward I'll look him up with a pull question for today that

[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.740]
thing of the broward is strong mayor it's boring and when you high pingo I can't imagine why he

[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.940]

through to do on his response was unfortunately sometimes these things happen

[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:01.600]
and crap happens yeah and and that uh... the illustrate you know what he stands

[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.260]
for is life is cheap in the york i guess when you're

[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.220]

[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.380]

[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.320]
if they get out and if they get back out there in the street

[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.900]

i mean that the joseph's magic carpet whatever that thing was the donny osman was

[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.780]

and i love donny osman he's a really good guy had him on a show years ago

[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.240]
and after i had my stroke he actually called me at home

[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.400]
remember that i did i did i no you never did call me to see how i was because you

[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.660]

[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.240]
in the alley at that time which you don't live there anymore and i don't have

[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.820]
the number anyway but he was very nice guy and i like him and he's not one of

[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.040]
those real goody two shoes warm in types you know he's got a good sense of

[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.000]
humor but but like i was telling George before as soon as he told me to turn

[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.280]
on ton green and we're really you know time we love you but get off the moniker

[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.160]
crap already okay please get off of that fat bitch

[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.860]
but i'm i'm just a little bit tired of hearing about donny and marie psychosies

[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.020]
and uh... his problems with stage fright it was interesting the first time

[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.720]
you know it was okay but after the set after the seven hundred interview it

[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.340]
gets a little bit old and now what's he going around talking about what's

[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.540]
her problem she got some neurosis so yeah she's got some neurosis like she

[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.680]
can't cut the money fast enough something like that

[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.340]
god like you said we should all have such problems i'll trade him right now

[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.280]
yeah right exactly just like that stupid article by dan la bastard yesterday

[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.600]
oh it's shocking that more athletes so that some athletes aren't like this

[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.360]
see i hate to break the news to you dan la bastard but most athletes the

[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.600]
preponderance of athletes in all sports aren't a bunch of scumbags aren't going to jail aren't

[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.660]
them being suspended so what's really astonishing is that a scumbag low life like

[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.020]
you would write a disgusting column like that and with even scarier that maybe

[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.580]
some kids out there would read that thing what a stupid idiotic bunch of swillatis to write

[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.820]
the excuse maker like i've told him before scumbags suck up to other scumbags just like

[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:30.100]
dan la bastard making excuses and by the way dare all won't have him to kick around this year let's

[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.640]
hear it out and they'll be protesting about that too because steve howe was white

[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.940]
remember steve howe remember him uh-huh he got nine chances like he ever ready to catch

[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.520]
and Darrell's only had like five or six so i think that some dark folks are going to be running

[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.560]
around the streets and he deserves at least other three four chances to get even with steve howe right

[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.360]
okay five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line what a crowd we had at the

[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.900]
macarena last night did we have a crowd oh maybe at ten eleven thousand while they packed them

[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.260]

[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.060]
nineteen thousand plus screaming white people in there to see a bunch of seven-foot

[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.740]
fartsers bang into the round and we had ten or eleven thousand people our last man at the

[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.360]
macarena to see another very very depressing performance by the panthers but hey you know everything

[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.140]

[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:29.300]

[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:39.240]
bell oh man everybody i asked to i said what do you think of these months they stuck that's the

[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:46.000]
response from everybody in the uh-in the macarena but it's up to you guys okay strictly up to you

[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.660]
diet how much am i going to get for that don't be sure to die i doubt it yeah stop eating just

[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:21.540]
eat very little in fact the one way this is the truth because i read it somewhere my mother's

[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:26.980]
always saying that i read somewhere yeah that that means it must be true ma but uh no seriously if

[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.700]
you want to extend your life the only known way because they have all these life extension things

[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.840]
you know and all these like the one guy up there in hollywood i used to have on here who's like

[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:40.580]
35 it looks like 90 because he's extending his life but the only the way known so far is to eat

[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:48.880]
fewer calories how do you like that fewer calories which flies in the face of atkins for example

[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.020]
because atkins is a guy in the middle of calis and beef is got a although i did also read that

[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.940]
yesterday that beef and like chicken no difference in calories on the same portion same exact

[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:05.580]
see that's another myth oh i read me it's gonna kill you there's another myth remember the

[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:11.520]
myth america pageant there's another myth for you cutting down on calories is the only way we

[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.440]
know to extend your life span cutting way down looking what it did for Karen Carpenter

[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:21.720]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight teeth once you may have overdid it

[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:27.340]
overdone it just a little bit just a little tiny bit but you had a lovely figure here's

[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:32.060]
the mobile and west pond beach hello yeah you know those uh cops up there in New York yeah maybe they

[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.180]
can resign and go to LA and get a job out there with their framing all those people right i mean

[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.840]
it's not like we've got all this room in the prison for the real viral ones let's just go out and

[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:46.140]
create some more and then when uh governor door bush gets to like it as president he can

[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:51.480]
import some more fastest like uncle promise and you know how about uncle remus oh yeah and but

[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.720]
our supreme force has been i bet you're sure somebody uncle remus get along real good

[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.100]
well you know that the supreme court keeps giving the police more and more powers yeah search you

[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.980]
that can start right that's right just on a whim just whenever the hell they feel like it so

[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.840]
they know before it gets better it's gonna get a hell of a lot work right and they used to have a

[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:17.640]
known saying off the pig maybe that'll come back okay whatever you say is he talking about

[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:24.300]

charitable organization sure it is yeah free birth control free abortion how about I got a better

[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.520]

again okay that really is a problem well and the other thing I should mention today is that we

[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:23.980]
were promised even the attorneys got in on this one tomorrow is the first of March okay it's an

[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.940]
early eyes of March for beastly broad casting because we've been promised that really was only

[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.900]
a coincidence had nothing to do with my 24th anniversary on a year in Miami it was just a coincidence

[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.980]
first of all they have our brand new high tech the best in the universe phone system or

[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.200]
yeah would none of these phone problems that we've suffered through for over two years here in

[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:47.220]
his god damn a schlock place it is god forsaken toilet of a radio station where they're pretending to

[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:52.440]
be something that they're not like a bunch of broadcasters tomorrow is the day right tomorrow is

[00:39:52.440 --> 00:40:00.540]
d day now is the stuff arrived in the building yet no because i'm sure that once it does get here

[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:06.240]
from san josea rubber it's coming from it's going to take time to install this fancy shmancy the

[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.260]
best in the world phone system so that'll give another opportunity to keep pushing the date back

[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:14.840]
pushing it back not that George Corso whatever misled as you understand or Bob de muth

[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:22.840]
here's a call in bokeh hello yes sir thank you for the point is to you yes to your poll question

[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:27.700]
well we're not doing the poll question on here and yes that was uh saying in the case of your

[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:34.000]
review i'd like to make some comments about that honorable diallo case up in the u up yes

[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:41.620]
first of all i'm going to retire please just to let you know uh-huh and i think the big problem is

[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:50.200]
that since they low with the standards to become a policeman it's not a lot it's a lot of

[00:40:51.280 --> 00:41:00.180]
i don't know what the word would be unqualified people and police officers are trying to shoot the

[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:06.540]
well that's great that's just that's just the fact of life is you know you don't want somebody

[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.920]
you shoot to kill shoot to kill shoot them in the lake yeah after you after you shot them the other

[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.640]
first 40 times shoot them in the lake well that's that's the i i i'm not going to trust that because

[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:22.540]
i was an air for them i don't know what happened but uh the adrenaline does get running and

[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.860]
once you pull that trigger one time you just keep pulling until you run out of bullets great

[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:34.020]
unfortunately that's all i have okay have a great day thank you thanks so the best idea stay

[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:38.200]
away from the hospital case they did far away before if they're playing close cops you ain't got a

[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.920]
trineman chance in hell again a lot of trineman and hell based on what i'm hearing today five six seven

[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.620]
oh five sixty and not doing too well either pound five sixty on the eight ten t line

[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:51.320]
out of timeline is open eight seven seven eight five sixty three forty five

[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.960]
our usual tepid response here in the beginning of the show and then of course in the middle

[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.620]
of the show it gets really kind of like lukewarm and then the last hour we like almost every day on

[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.940]
the show say can we possibly make it till two o'clock and somehow we do not generally very easily

[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:10.340]
but somehow we do because this town refuses to give back now the thing even about the charity

[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.440]
when you think the phone lines would be sizzling already with people saying hey here's a suggestion

[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.180]
for you but of course most people are ready to give a crap about where the money goes just like

[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.780]
that golf tournament that was a very sad commentary not only in the lack of responsibility and ethics

[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.840]
of this place which we already knew but in the fact that nobody out there cares including most

[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.040]
of the people participated in that event who were just there to rub shoulders with famous people

[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:38.360]
or in this case pseudo famous people and then once oj arrived really infamous people i mean i'm

[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.440]
i'm not talking about being a goody too shoes but doesn't anybody in this country have any

[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.220]
principles at all i mean stand for anything no no just give me show show me the money that's what

[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.240]
it's all about that's why uh you know who wants to win a million who wants to marry a millionaire

[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.880]
who wants to steal ten million that's what it's all about now it's reduced to just that how's the

[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:06.160]
market doing by the way notice my Netherlands fund is in the scrapper oh brother wow i mean really bad

[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.920]
four minutes before 11 o'clock at five sixty wql

[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.460]
is here it's directly across from region this chair

[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.820]
the principles no one knows how it goes it's not your direstation of growth is

[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:35.480]
minute to miss everybody says he wants his fastest finger and you're on your way

[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:42.760]
she must feel great to make ABC pay just because the chair you want to fix a bad you're not big

[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:49.000]
old man if you're big to play and you go all the way use the lifeline for a friend there

[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.420]
ask the audience use your 50 50 my man you're not a good one million people to be watching you

[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:04.360]
what to do i would just arrive oh wow here's a ten-man case you win on one two

[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:10.940]
we look in fly where a time bring him somewhere now keep your thinking straight and clear

[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.740]
and remember there's nothing to bear you could be a brand new million

[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:21.140]
it's 11 o'clock at five sixty wql look at this response here this morning pretty weak right as

[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.280]
usual don't disappoint on the last day of February five six seven oh and what is it in the

[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:30.320]
vents it can you smell it in there it smells like rubbing alcohol oh what is that how appropriate

[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.320]
they're wall tapering the control room right now as we speak so if you think that's bad

[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:40.760]
imagine it so in other words we have to see all these of these noxious fumes this is not

[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:45.160]
i understand that but in the meantime more captive audience and the noxious fumes from the wall

[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:49.680]
paper and whatever that is i it sounds like a good lawsuit to make uh huh two days without the

[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:56.200]
AC and here with devalc doors coming through the vents it's noxious and anxious

[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:06.480]
and puke inducing exactly five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.700]
so their wall papering that's good news because that construction project that you've been talking

[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.620]
about for the last 60 years has it done yet no they still working on it well not exactly they're

[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:19.120]
doing the wall papering in there but they're the painting and the ceiling tiles and the other stuff

[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.300]
that's hanging out of the walls and the schmurches that all still there uh huh good makes us feel at home

[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.900]
here's Miami hello hey do you know how are you okay yeah i'm a law enforcement officer in Miami

[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:35.520]
Florida and i just wanted to comment on the uh the verdict in New York yes sir i think it was a

[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:42.260]
very fair verdict um the reason i say that is because i don't think the uh the prosecution gave the uh

[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:49.040]
the jurors they an alternate charge to decide on a lesser charge so i think it's uh

[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.520]
well isn't that up to the judge the judges supposed to explain that not the prosecution

[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:58.920]
well the the prosecution works the prosecution offers it to the judge and they didn't even do that

[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:04.820]
so you know i can't blame the jurors for for returning my guilty verdicts on these guys

[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.140]
in fact the the judge did instruct them that they could come back with a lesser verdict in the

[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:16.420]
second degree murder so if if if they didn't convict them what's what's the big view with everyone

[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:22.260]
you know why is everyone crying and if you can't under i have to explain that to you because they

[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:26.720]
sure because first of all he was an innocent man secondly he hardly spoke any language any English

[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.740]
thirdly they were playing clothes fourthly they shot him uh 41 times of which 19 were hits

[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.860]
and most of them after he was already down and you're wondering what's the big human cry about

[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:40.640]
don't you understand people are upset because innocent people are supposed to get blown away

[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:46.120]
well and that's why we have we have a uh a court system yeah obviously in date they thought

[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.420]
well how about oj was that they're in the criminal trial was that the correct verdict

[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:54.300]
no what's not oh so so so how can we have a court system and have a great day

[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.160]
isn't it surprising that most of the cops seem to agree with the verdict and that's

[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.300]
around that's surprising yeah just shocks the hell out of me

[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:07.260]
i say we call osher right now George let's get a hold of money or let's call osher the occupational

[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.740]
safety and hazard administration or health or whatever that is health and hazard

[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.540]
get him in here man the anxious noxious fumes are coming through the god damn vent in here

[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:21.780]
i'm gonna puke in a second what was that all about oh i thought maybe it was about the

[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:27.080]
anxious noxious fumes and by the way line four don't work it sounds like it works but it works

[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.680]
about there's nothing screwed up but that you mark my words cost me what i turned up can you hear it

[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:37.640]
yeah it's this food up again oh now that now that stuff is coming heavy duty now it's like pouring

[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:42.540]
through the vents so if either psychosomatic now that you told me what it was or really in reality

[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.860]
it's just pouring through there because they're really getting it up to a ladder in the other room

[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:53.420]
before they start slapping it on in the wall paper too oh that is gruesome rotesque

[00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:00.620]
here's a mobile and this is a nice way to say goodbye to Neil after 24 years mobile in bokeh hello

[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:07.200]

[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.200]
question does that mean is rumored giving me any insight what insight is he going to give me

[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.560]
i don't know he might notice he might notice an inside room where he you know he's a rumor bell

[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:47.100]
yeah no i i don't even hear any rumors no okay uh two more things um could you play uh

[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:10.100]
to do with that five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t line

[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:16.880]
oh now now it's unacceptable okay it is it's just it's like sitting in the middle of a like if

so they very easily what is it i guess that's why they're doing it they could do both studios

[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:45.620]
what i'm trying to point out is they could do it between two and six

[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:50.060]
when there's nobody broadcasting on the air anywhere in here

[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.200]
all week long they could be doing it between two and three you follow what i'm saying

[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.200]
because there's nobody broadcasting in the building between two and six

[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:08.920]

among many other things, many, many other things, is that they

[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:14.560]
do.

[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.440]
It's like MTV.

[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.980]
Originally MTV was did to play music videos.

[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.520]
Now do they play any music video?

[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:19.760]
No.

[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.320]
Rarely.

[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.240]
Rarely.

[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.420]
They got too many goddamn programs on.

[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:24.880]
Bad ones at that.

[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.960]
And the same thing with CNN.

[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:28.280]
Originally it was like all news.

[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.140]
Do they do all news?

[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:29.380]
No.

[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.860]
No, they got the Elsa clinch.

[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.740]
I clinch my fist when that crap comes on.

[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.180]
With that style program for a bunch of faggots out there.

[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.740]
And showbiz shows and golf shows and NBA shows.

[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.320]
And now they got another financial show.

[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.660]
If I want to ask financial I turn over to CNBC.

[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.340]
Because George tells me that some of the 60-year-old student in

[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.540]
Flint, Michigan just shot and killed or just shot.

[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.500]
Six-year-old was killed.

[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.360]
Or was killed.

[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:53.980]
My fellow.

[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.420]
My fellow should be in Flint, Michigan.

[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:55.620]

[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.020]
Shot dead.

[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.540]
On you gun huggers out there.

[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.640]
Runs those people.

[00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.320]
Kill people.

[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.220]
Just 60-year-old kids with guns killed people.

[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.420]
We think he's dead.

[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.520]
We think he's dead.

[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.820]
And of course if they never got off this in the money show here on

[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.420]
CNN, we might find out.

[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.180]
So if anybody's got any news on that off the internet that they could

[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.160]
fax it to me because we're sure not going to get off CNN.

[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:13.540]
Are we?

[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.840]
Oh God forbid they should interrupt their financial show here.

[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.180]
Which we can see the exact same numbers that asked to

[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.040]
act up 100 and the bell is up 54 points.

[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.440]
We can already see that.

[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.340]
Couldn't we on CNBC?

[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:22.780]
Uh-huh.

[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.020]
Yeah.

[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.760]
But CNN because they noticed that CNBC's numbers have been climbing

[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.820]
and climbing and climbing because all the gate traders and day traders out there

[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:32.300]
got their money.

[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.660]
They invested up to their armpits.

[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.160]
And they're watching this stuff around the clock.

[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.240]
So this is their attempt to goose up there or otherwise weak audience when

[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.080]
what's his name made on?

[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:40.880]
Don't need 50 dollars.

[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:44.340]
5, 6, 7, 0.

[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.260]
By the way, here's the grades.

[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:47.560]
They're going to make you feel a little bit better while you're American men out there.

[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:48.600]
And Cuban men.

[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.360]
And anybody who's not German.

[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:52.960]
This is the image.

[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:53.840]
I'm not making this up.

[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.580]
This is from Reuters.

[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:56.100]
Berlin.

[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.600]
Standard condoms too big for Germans.

[00:54:58.820 --> 00:54:59.180]
Oi!

[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:00.340]
That's right.

[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.960]
Now you understand when I had that complex.

[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.880]
You know, that's that small penis complex again.

[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.260]
And all this time we thought it was the Japanese.

[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:08.940]
It is.

[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:16.120]
Anyway, it says the study has found that the standard European Union size of condom is often too big for German men.

[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.800]
A magazine reported on Sunday.

[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.380]
Focus magazine.

[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.620]
That's focus, focus, focus.

[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.660]
Focus magazine.

[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:28.120]
Instead of study by a leading German condom manufacturer condomi, you found standard size condoms falling off half-demand studied.

[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:28.580]
Oi!

[00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:29.840]
You're falling right off.

[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:30.240]
Half.

[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.000]
Yeah.

[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:33.460]
50%.

[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.880]
If you just tie a knot at the end, it doesn't do that.

[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.180]
The average German penis is about three and a half to four millimeters to narrow.

[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:50.000]
That's 0.13 to 0.15 inches to narrow for the standard EN and 600 condom magazine road.

[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.320]
How do you like that?

[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.720]
You call that a penis?

[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:59.560]
The EU set the EN 600 guidelines for ever condoms in 1996 to establish a uniform standard across Europe.

[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.300]
So if only the Germans would put those uniforms back on.

[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:09.360]
And speaking of that, I see that this Nazi, your heighter in Austria, he quit his post.

[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.460]
Quit his party job.

[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:16.500]
But they say that that's only a poor because he wants to eventually become the chancellor and Deutschland Uberalus.

[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.600]
And he didn't know no Nazi or no Godfather.

[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:21.900]
So how do you like that?

[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.100]
All you German people out there, you got a little teeny tiny penis, all you German guys.

[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.020]
They have 10.

[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.040]
Pricks.

[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.760]
It just felt like a prick.

[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.620]
And now look at this.

[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.840]
Now we got little black bugs.

[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.520]
Look at that.

[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.420]
We got chin spugs in here.

[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.440]
Or are these chiggers?

[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.460]
Oh, don't let no chiggers in this room.

[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:42.560]
I thought once.

[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.240]
Roy left the building.

[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.200]
That would be the end of that.

[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.200]
See, I don't count where I strat for this a chigger.

[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.420]
He's like, he just like a light.

[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.480]
What would you call it?

[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.200]
Like light chocolate?

[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:52.600]
Mocha?

[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:53.500]
He's a good guy.

[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.260]
I mean stupid, but a very good guy.

[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.480]
So you German guys out there.

[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.580]
Here we are like George's as we thought it was the...

[00:56:59.580 --> 00:56:59.920]
Look at that.

[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.680]
We got bugs flying everywhere in here now.

[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.060]
Do we have an exterminator that takes care of this place?

[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:06.360]
No.

[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:06.620]
No.

[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.700]
That's what we need speaking of German.

[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.540]
A good exterminator in this place.

[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.260]
And I can tell you right where it starts.

[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:14.000]
Back to him.

[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:18.220]
56670560, pound 560 on a AT&T wireless line.

[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.940]
Several lines open and waiting for your perusal here this morning.

[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.500]
Here's a mobile in Naples.

[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:23.820]
Hello.

[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:28.280]
Yeah, in the dialogue case, as you mentioned in it,

[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.500]
that he didn't speak English.

[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.220]
In their several congressmen, we're trying to get a bill

[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:36.200]
that will make English the official language of America what...

[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.560]
Well, what does that have to do with these?

[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.200]
He's only been here for like five minutes.

[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.320]
Which brings...

[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.980]
That's another problem with immigration.

[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:43.960]
Yeah, okay, pull out.

[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.180]
I'm gonna have to ask you more on here.

[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.340]
That's not like Enes de Pena.

[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:47.600]
Enes de Pena.

[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.660]
Enes de Pena is the small penis, Sherri must be German.

[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:51.920]
Go away, okay.

[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.080]
Go away, I would say, come back another day, but in your case, don't.

[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.300]
24 years of being haunted on here by assholes like him.

[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.280]
One dimensional, that's all he knows from.

[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.360]
He didn't speak English.

[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.300]
He just got here 10 minutes ago, asshole.

[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.200]
You moron.

[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:08.660]
Oh, so we should have got shot as well.

[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.900]
That's the new deal by people like this guy.

[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.900]
If you don't speak English, you're gonna blow your brain to your feet.

[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.180]
There's nothing else you got, too.

[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.920]
Yeah, we got bugs lying around in here now.

[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.720]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.020]
Here's a mobile and Davy.

[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:25.260]
Hello.

[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.560]
Hey, handsome, how you doing?

[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:27.940]
Okay.

[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:34.300]
Listen, I just want to give you my comments on that last guy who claims himself to be a law enforcement officer.

[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:34.620]
Yeah.

[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:35.680]
You got to enter with him.

[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.640]
The one in Miami, Florida?

[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:37.740]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.140]
I'm glad to go call for Miami Ohio.

[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.440]
We don't want to be smurched their reputation.

[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:42.380]
Exactly.

[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:47.780]
First of all, you got to realize you're probably trying to read with a guy who English was the second language.

[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.460]
You're also dealing with a guy who's a law enforcement officer.

[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.160]
In other words, because he's a Julio, that makes him a bad guy.

[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:58.880]
Making bad guy, but he's a law enforcement officer who's trying to interpret the law to you.

[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.700]
And they're not paid from interpretable law.

[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.120]
Most of you know what the guy at a high school education.

[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.260]
How do you know that?

[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.260]
How do you know that?

[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:05.740]
You know that?

[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.280]
It's amazing to me.

[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:10.020]
They could be a guy for like a minute and a half on a radio talk show.

[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.500]
And then, protecting you're gonna be telling me how big this penis was.

[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.420]
Get out of here, okay?

[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.160]
Get out of my face.

[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.100]
You a lop with enus the penis, okay?

[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.600]
The two of you get out and get on a bus together and get out of my face.

[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.200]
Because you don't agree with somebody right away.

[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.340]
He's giving me the whole guy's whole life story.

[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.220]
Next, he's gonna be telling me his parents names, his grandparents.

[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.100]
If they did steal a caboose.

[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:33.440]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.020]
See, he did the wrong thing.

[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:35.540]
Luster.

[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.560]
By turning the air down and making a warmer in here.

[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.160]
Now, if we do the air back up, he just closed the intakes in there.

[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:40.860]
Yeah.

[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.560]
Crank our air.

[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.540]
It's getting nauseating in here.

[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:45.800]
Nauseating.

[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:47.380]
Maybe it's not because of the air.

[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.340]
Maybe it's just because of the fact that that stuff stinks so bad.

[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.840]
Well, that's the only time that room isn't being used.

[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.720]
Well, then, why didn't you tell us ahead of time and we could have played a tape.

[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.580]
Just like the day the George was ready to do the show.

[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.760]
We couldn't do it because the goddamn AC was out.

[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.160]
And the stuff was sticking the joint out and everybody was swooning in the hallway.

[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.600]
This is worst than when they were doing those goddamn, uh, those, uh, crack test in the mail.

[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:08.600]
Channel 4.

[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.120]
Yeah.

[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.200]
Those colon, those colorectal test.

[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.400]
They were sending to the mail and the postal employees were swooning because they were leaking.

[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.580]
There was a leakage problem.

[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:18.380]
Yeah.

[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.020]
Same crap.

[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.940]
5670560, 0.560 on the AT&T line.

[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:27.780]
Here's Delray Beach.

[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.020]
Hello.

[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.320]
Hey, Neil.

[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:29.760]
How you doing?

[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.280]
Okay, sir.

[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:31.380]
Yeah.

[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.180]
In regards to this case up in New York and you brought up the OJ trial.

[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:41.020]
I wonder how come every time the blacks don't get their way, they have to go jumping up and down the streets.

[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.960]
And having a riot.

[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.120]
That's probably how they have an a riot.

[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:44.980]
Where they have an a riot.

[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.140]
Well, they were jumping up and down the streets in New York.

[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.180]
And I know when Rodney King got beat up, they were jumping up and down there.

[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.240]
And they're jumping up and down.

[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.460]
They're doing a lot of jumping up and down.

[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.360]
Aren't they, sir, those blacks, those niggers, they're doing a lot of jumping up and down.

[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.060]
My bigoted racist friend, you.

[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.380]
That's three in a row.

[01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.120]
Let's go for four.

[01:00:59.220 --> 01:00:59.660]
What do you say?

[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:02.880]
Well, the next cause.

[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.340]
Let's palm.

[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:04.240]
Oh, there you go.

[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:04.900]
Even odds.

[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:05.480]
Yahoo.

[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.920]
5670560, 0.560 on the AT&T line.

[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.340]
Here's West Palm Beach, like somebody just said.

[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:12.580]
Hello.

[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.200]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:14.580]
Okay.

[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.420]
Yeah, I want to talk about the Miami Cup.

[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.400]
I'm sorry you have to deal with all those idiots that are calling you.

[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.720]
What else is new?

[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.120]
Twenty-three years of it.

[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.780]
It kind of goes with my point.

[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:31.520]
Why don't we, why don't cops have to go through like a college, you know, like an education for four years?

[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.480]
Why don't we, you know, have them go through college, maybe get cultureized a little bit.

[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.360]
They can deal with other people from other walks of life.

[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.440]
Because it's kind of scary, you know, we have this Miami Cup calling.

[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:48.360]
And he has, you know, he finds nothing wrong with the fact that I was shot forty-one time.

[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.660]
Yeah, he wants to know what everybody's all been on shape about.

[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.840]
Maybe if these guys had some education, went to college for four years, you know,

[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.100]
we're well rounded, you know, had some of blacks from Spanish in their dorm rooms.

[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.640]
Maybe they, you know, they wouldn't go and shoot them forty-one times.

[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.000]
Yeah.

[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.900]
And I have another point, you know, about-

[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:08.140]
I'm going to college to graduate, it's one to, you know, to go and get that kind of a job that pays that kind of money.

[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.840]
Teachers, teachers and cops, we don't pay them anything in this country.

[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:13.880]
So what do you expect again?

[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.820]
Yeah, it's absolutely right.

[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.380]
Teachers should get paid more too.

[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.260]
But I have a, you know, a little Miami story, Miami Cop story.

[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:26.400]
I had gotten free tickets for a dolphin game with a wind-dixie promotional thing.

[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.640]
And there were thirty-two dollars.

[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.420]
You know, if you buy groceries, they give you tickets.

[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.920]
So I went out, you know, I had like four tickets that I wasn't using two of them.

[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.300]
I call up there and I say, you know, can I sell my tickets?

[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.040]
They tell me, yeah, you know, you can sell them.

[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:42.260]
But not for what more than, they're worth, they were worth thirty-two bucks.

[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.400]
So I go up there to the stadium, the sell them.

[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:50.020]
I got a cop tell me, you know, if I try to sell those zero-faced, badly tickets, they're going to arrest me.

[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.900]
And I'm like, you know, I already got okay with the ticket, you know, with the ticket office.

[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.020]
You know, but he was throwing his power trippy one, let me sell the ticket.

[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.900]
So I'm like, do you have a problem with me giving them away?

[01:02:58.900 --> 01:02:59.960]
He's like, yeah, I do.

[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.280]
So I couldn't even give him away.

[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.220]
What, what do you mean he had a problem with you giving them away?

[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.420]
What's the problem?

[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.580]
Is it, again, the law to give you your tickets away?

[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.440]
No, he just didn't want me there.

[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.000]
He said, you know, he said that I, he already...

[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.680]
From other words, he's an asshole, is what you're saying.

[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:17.140]
Yeah, that's what I'm saying, you know, and it's pretty scary that we got cops in Miami like that.

[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.440]
A cop like that that's it just called.

[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.020]
And you know, we got people, you know, not, you know, not worried about it.

[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.840]
You know, not seeing anything wrong with it.

[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.700]
That's all I got in the office.

[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.400]
Okay, I have a little thing.

[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.720]
And he don't want you there.

[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.660]
Here's the fact that it says, turn your TV to MSNBC, which I'm practically trying to do,

[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.800]
but I have no idea what MSNBC is on the, on the small dish.

[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.440]
Because I never watch it on the small dish.

[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.780]
I've never even done on me.

[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.700]
Let's see, 355 of CNBC.

[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.400]
It must be in the bunch of channels.

[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.240]
And that there's Bloomberg.

[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.480]
And there's C-SPAN-2 and C-SPAN-1.

[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.660]
And this and that and a partridge and there's much music.

[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.040]
And a partridge and a pair of three.

[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.120]
Can I find MSNBC?

[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:50.400]
No.

[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.200]
No, I haven't got any idea what number it is.

[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.580]
Because evidently, they're doing a story about the 60-year-old kid that got shot in school.

[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:58.600]
And for MSNBC, you can buy one of his schoolmates.

[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.440]
Because you crazy gun people.

[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.020]
I want to make them sure that everybody gets their hands on guns.

[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.840]
And that we are drowning in a sea of guns.

[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.140]
And shooting instead people and bodies.

[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.060]
You crazy people, you.

[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:14.260]
And I forgot about the American teenagers who were arrested in Germany speaking to small penis this morning.

[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.200]
Do you see that story?

[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:16.260]
No.

[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.480]
Yeah, they went on the overpass.

[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.240]
They killed a woman in her car.

[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.720]
They were throwing rocks off the overpass.

[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.920]
Like they used to do in Detroit when I lived there.

[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.040]
That's a famous American past time.

[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.960]
Throwing bowling balls in large objects off the overpass and seeing who's windshield.

[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.680]
You can penetrate and how many people you can kill down below.

[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.280]
356.

[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:34.900]
Although I can't get it.

[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:35.660]
Well, that's okay.

[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.960]
I don't care if you can get it, okay?

[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.340]
And the channel either.

[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.280]
Well, there's Cal Rican on there, so in the panties or something.

[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.820]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T lines.

[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.320]
1126 of QAM.

[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.160]
Panthers hockey.

[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.120]
Only on.

[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.440]
4 radio.

[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.280]
560 QAM.

[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.960]
Holy mackerel.

[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.160]
Oh, God.

[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:58.720]
This is Joe Boyle on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the

[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.680]
hockey authority Neil God.

[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:07.840]
Yes.

[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.520]
Yes.

[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:18.180]
Well, go do the convention hall where a lot of consensus goes.

[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.580]
Easy, do five.

[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:21.600]
That's right.

[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.720]
In our area, there's everything fine.

[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.440]
If we sell fun, down in town, there's time.

[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.500]
Little fly, a gun.

[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.600]
Throw it in the trunk.

[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:35.740]
Hop and hop and suck.

[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.020]
It's good and drunk.

[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.140]
All the ride.

[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.540]
He's all over town.

[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.720]
We're three-floor rounds.

[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.120]
He does something up and up and up and up and down.

[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.100]
That's right.

[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:49.920]
New ride.

[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:51.520]
In our area.

[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.900]
This is everything fine.

[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.480]
Get yourself a gun.

[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:55.560]
It's a good time.

[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.460]
Go bow and get the spotting.

[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.500]
The exercise is a ride.

[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.480]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.080]
Say to get the same guy.

Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:28.620]

Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:37.640]

[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:37.820]

[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:37.820]

[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:38.300]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:38.680]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.320]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.420]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:42.620]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:43.840]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.560]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.580]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:46.960]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.420]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.960]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:50.300]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:15.840]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:17.500]
Say to get the same guy.

[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.380]
Or be in a small room,

[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:19.520]

[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:19.520]

[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.460]
And when we talk to a spokeswoman at the hospital,

[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.020]
there you can see the pictures of the evacuation of the school.

[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.640]
When we talk to the spokeswoman at the hospital,

[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.460]
she could not provide us with some information

[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.320]
at this point on the child's condition.

[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.920]
So we'll have to wait and hear how the child who's been shot,

[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.300]
how they're fairing.

[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.480]
And Mr. Reports, that a first grade student brought a handgun to school

[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:46.480]
was showing it off to classmates and it fired.

[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.040]
So that's when they evacuated.

[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:48.600]
How unusual.

[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.700]
And then parents had been notified.

[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.680]
How unusual, isn't that very unusual?

[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:54.180]
Uh-huh.

[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:54.460]
Yeah.

[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:55.900]
I didn't know the gun was loaded.

[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.480]
Little kids playing with guns that just somebody leftly in around.

[01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.860]
See, I'm going to say it again.

[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.420]
The parents of those, the owners of those guns,

[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.520]
the parents, they should be in jail for a hell of a long time.

[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.940]
One hell of a long time.

[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.600]
And what are these bugs?

[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.100]
Wait, am I got to kill some bugs?

[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:14.980]
Got to kill a chigger.

[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.660]
So there you are.

[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.720]
Hope that all you gun squeezes out there,

[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.440]
all you apologists, all you NRA, uh, uh, car, uh,

[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.280]
uh, what assholes, I hope you're happy now.

[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.880]
Just never stops.

[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.320]
Just bodies laying around.

[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.100]
You know, wow, uh, we can't be responsible for irresponsible people.

[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.940]
We got 16,000 open lines here this morning.

[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:41.940]
This is one fair well to the 24th year on a year and it's done.

[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:44.760]
This is exactly the sum up, just like my parents on Saturday

[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.740]
at the Seminal Indian Casino during a geriatric time.

[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.540]
Yeah, it must have been the sleepy hour.

[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.620]
It's one I had us in there.

[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:50.860]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.460]
Sleepy hour.

[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.380]
Here's a mobile into question.

[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:53.720]
Hello.

[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:54.660]
Neil.

[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.220]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.560]
I'd like to talk about the cops up in New York again.

[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:57.840]
Yeah.

[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.240]
I'm a retired New York cop.

[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:00.920]
Okay.

[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.320]
And I just, I've been listening to you for two days.

[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.540]
And I really like your show.

[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.060]
I like listening to you.

[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.260]
But there's just a few things I'd like to get across.

[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:11.020]
Well, of course, because the retired cops and the present cops,

[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.040]
no matter what you look at me about cops, I'm always wrong.

[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:13.480]
That's right.

[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.020]
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think they, you know, I don't think you are wrong.

[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.700]
I lay off a lot about, about when you say things about Miami cops.

[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.060]
I didn't hear that cop earlier.

[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:23.580]
I wasn't on the, in the car.

[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:23.900]
Yeah.

[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:29.500]
Anyway, if that guy was a white guy and got shot that night, he still would have been shot.

[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.320]
They would have shot him white black or whatever comment he was.

[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:32.380]

[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.380]
And Neil, you know how that guy caught you off the other day

[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.220]
or you went through the red light and he pissed you off.

[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.500]
And you said if you had a shotgun, you would have killed him.

[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:39.800]
Yeah.

[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.500]
Because you were afraid you might have got killed.

[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.140]
But I don't have a shotgun.

[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.700]
No, but if you had one, you would have shot him, right?

[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:46.380]
Probably not.

[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.200]
Oh, you know, you would piss off.

[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.300]
It's something that you say.

[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.420]
I understand.

[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.500]
And Neil, when, first of all, they teach cops.

[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.860]
You can shoot as many rounds into a guy as you want.

[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.620]
There's no laws against that.

[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.680]
Everyone's up tight, how many times they shot him.

[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.260]
That has nothing to do with it.

[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.080]
It really don't.

[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:04.680]
You're off time.

[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.500]
I hate to break the news to you.

[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.920]
Maybe according to your brainwashed mind, it has nothing to do with it.

[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.120]
I'm not afraid of what they feel.

[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.040]
Just a minute, just a minute, because the cops aren't supposed to be

[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.060]
the judge, jury, and executioner, okay?

[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.840]
And that's what they were doing in the situation.

[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.980]
They certainly have every, can I finish without you like burping in the middle of it?

[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:22.500]
We're just once.

[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.060]
They have a right to defend themselves, of course.

[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.280]
And if they thought he was pulling a gun, I can understand why they reacted.

[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.840]
But at a certain point, when a guy is going down,

[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.660]
how many shots need to be fired before you're confident that you're not going to get your gun?

[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:35.520]
They're going to be shot at yourself blown away.

[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:36.200]
Okay.

[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.580]
I mean, what you're suggesting is that any time the cops are suspected for anything,

[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.080]
once they decide to start shooting, they can blow you away.

[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.360]
I'm sorry, that's a police officer.

[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.520]
I'm not willing to endorse that or accept it.

[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.280]
No, that's not nearly what you think.

[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.000]
And they just kept shooting.

[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.320]
They were terrified.

[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.600]
They were terrified of what?

[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.700]
That this guy might have it done in his hands.

[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:57.460]
They were terrified.

[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.140]
Maybe they should find a better line of work than if they were terrified.

[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.460]
Of course, but when it hit you, I mean that.

[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:03.780]
Of course, what does that mean?

[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.380]
Of course.

[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:06.620]
Let me ask you.

[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.180]
What about the guy?

[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.400]
Do you think he might have been terrified?

[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:10.760]
Of course he was.

[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:11.080]
Yeah.

[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.020]
And you know what?

[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.180]
He made a mistake too, because he was taking his wallet out to show his ID probably right away.

[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.420]
So they wouldn't shoot him.

[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:17.660]
Yeah.

[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.200]
And they were talking about he was in a doorway.

[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.120]
The light bulb was out in the doorway.

[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:22.820]
It was dark.

[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.640]
And they were not in uniform.

[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.720]
They were playing clothes.

[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.380]
He had, he's from a foreign country.

[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.840]
He doesn't speak much English or didn't.

[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.460]
He's been in a very short period of time.

[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.420]
He had no idea what the hell was going on.

[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.360]
Of course he didn't.

[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.300]
And they didn't know what he did.

[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.240]
What he knew either.

[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.240]
They didn't know.

[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.080]
Neil, I was shocked once.

[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.020]
And I was in about three shootouts.

[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.740]
And you only have a second to decide.

[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.900]
Does he have a gun or a doni?

[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:47.440]
Am I going to die or is he going to die?

[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:48.820]
And when one cop stopped...

[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.760]
So that means you had a start firing 41 shots.

[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.380]
Neil, when one cop started shooting, they all started shooting.

[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.940]
And the reason it had so many rounds, they all died.

[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:03.180]
And it's amazing to me that it took four cops that many shots to make him less dangerous.

[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:07.060]
Neil, they didn't look at the guy next to them to see how many times he was shooting.

[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.180]
You don't even know if the other guy is shooting in that.

[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.180]
You're just shooting.

[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.220]
Each guy didn't know how many cops were shooting at each other.

[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.920]
At each guy, I'm sorry.

[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.120]
So if you're not shooting, you say, I hope he's shooting.

[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.140]
Nobody stops.

[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.760]
No, I'm not buying it, sir.

[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.800]
You can sell it now until the end of time.

[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.280]
I have to be in that circumstance at some time in your life.

[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:28.820]
I don't want to be in that circumstance.

[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.680]
No, well, I was in that.

[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.080]
And I'm not...

[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.560]
It was the most tragic accident that happened.

[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.800]
In addition to which the person that they were looking for is a serial rapist.

[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:40.680]
Not a murderer.

[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.000]
I mean, a rape obviously is a very serious crime.

[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.920]
And obviously, the guys have a scumbag that they're looking for.

[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.220]
But he wasn't a murderer.

[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:51.200]
They thought that they were limiting somebody who was the threat to everybody's life.

[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:51.820]
Nearly.

[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.240]
They saw him pull something out.

[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:53.600]
Yeah.

[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.680]
So what he had had gone.

[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:55.880]
Mm-hmm.

[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:56.940]
They can...

[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:57.680]
They can even mistake.

[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.040]
Sir, the cops get nervous every time they think they see anybody pull something out.

[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:07.460]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T...

[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:08.880]
...whirless line.

[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.260]
Unless they're German.

[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.260]
21 before noon at 5, 60, WQM.

[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.180]
So we don't have any award.

[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.900]
We'll keep on CNN here and see if the 6-year-old kid is going to live or die.

[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.360]
Assuming that anybody out there would care.

[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.020]
No.

[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:20.300]
No.

[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:20.680]

[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.180]
Brings a gun to school.

[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:23.800]
Hey, Tommy.

[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.520]
Look what I got.

[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.320]
Here I just...

[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.580]
Oh, Tommy.

[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.380]
Tommy's dead.

[01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:38.880]
This is a sickness, a disease, an illness that you will not find any place else, any place else,

[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.380]
and the civilized or uncivilized world.

[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:42.660]
No place else.

[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:48.220]
Where people are arming themselves to the teeth in Switzerland where everybody and their brother

[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.780]
is a member of the military and they all have guns.

[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:50.960]
Are they blown each other away?

[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:51.180]
No.

[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:53.220]
No.

[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.160]
And even in Israel, where of course we have all the...

[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:57.720]
They like bombs.

[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.080]
They prefer bombs on school buses.

[01:13:59.080 --> 01:13:59.780]
They're much bigger.

[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.480]
But they're all members of the military, including the women.

[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.780]
Are they blown each other away with guns?

[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:04.100]
No.

[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:04.340]
No.

[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.980]
20 before noon at 5, 60, WQM.

[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.600]
I want to badly make what?

[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.040]
I want to be a part of it.

[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:28.580]
In the media, I see more trouble with gasoline.

[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.900]
Find it also hard to feel it.

[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:02.120]
I want to be a part of it.

[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:02.160]
I want to be a part of it.

[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:02.160]

[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:02.160]

[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.880]
I want to be a part of it.

[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.580]
I know for work all day they ain't Swiss.

[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.240]
And say you fly.

[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.540]
And say you fly.

[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.360]
I'm 45, so we got some good news finally.

[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:20.200]
Someone confirmed me.

[01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:24.580]
Fortress of Factus is, the show, the morning show this morning.

[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.240]
What's the name of that show?

[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:34.160]
Uh, whatever it is with Regis and Kathy Lee something with today tomorrow this week, whatever it is.

[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.300]
I'm sure I'd if that bitch is off the air probably quit this before they were going to blow our ass out anyway.

[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:39.580]
Kathy Lee.

[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:40.560]
God.

[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:43.460]
No talent. Can she sing?

[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:43.740]
No.

[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.300]
And she act.

[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:44.520]
No.

[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.160]
Is she amusing?

[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:45.380]
No.

[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.100]
Does she look great?

[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:47.340]
No.

[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.220]
But nevertheless,

[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.500]
See, I guess now that Regis has got the clout that he's on at the grotesque millionaire show,

[01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:02.540]
we probably told that bitch to take a hike, take a good fly and five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:12.340]
See, if somebody if a cop pulls you over if you're speeding and he wants to see your driver's license and registration and you're reaching your wallet to pull out based on this, uh,

[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.660]
retired cop, this brainwashed X cop.

[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:21.240]
The cop can say, oh gee, I thought it would look like one of those wallets, the guns to me start firing.

[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.800]
Now, how many shots would it take to disable you?

[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:29.920]
See, that's the point not to blow you away necessarily, but to disable you to make you not a threat to him anymore.

[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.580]
How many times would he have to shoot you?

[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.200]
It would be not a threat.

[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:34.360]
All of them.

[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.300]
Oh, okay.

[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.000]
No, we're just trying to kill you.

[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.080]
Now, the reason for all your kids out there, be sure and trust those men in blue.

[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:42.460]
They're your friends.

[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:50.020]
Like that, like that little kid that would not be able to help me on the bike that day. Remember that the kid would have in the Palm Beach.

[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:50.360]
Uh huh.

[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:50.620]
Yeah.

[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.960]
And the public supported the cop, either way.

[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:57.220]
Oh, yeah, he handcuffed them and kept throwing them down to the ground because he was riding his bicycle without a helmet.

[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:01.200]
I think the cop may be played too much football without a helmet like Jerry Ford.

[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.400]
Here's a mobile and curl gable.

[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.780]
Hello, Daniel.

[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:07.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:12.160]
Listen, being the father of a two young daughters, that first story about this kid's horrified me.

[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:18.480]
Uh, but on the note, I wonder how many thousands of people have been stopped by police officers, uh,

[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.840]
and have successfully pulled out their walls without being shot.

[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:22.320]
Mm-hmm.

[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:28.300]
If I'm a prosecuting attorney, I'm going to pose every New York City police officer and ask that question.

[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:30.560]
I just don't think it routinely happens.

[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.060]
Yeah.

[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.760]
Well, let's hope.

[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.580]
I mean, you just don't think.

[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:44.260]
Let's hope it doesn't routinely happen because listening to these cops and ex-cofs that are calling in, evidently, they believe that all they got to do is to think just to believe that maybe you might be pulled out of the gun and by the big.

[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:45.160]
They can unload on you.

[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:45.600]
Yeah.

[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:46.200]
No, trust me.

[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.680]
There was a touch of sarcasm there.

[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:54.340]
Uh, on another note, it's amazing how the New York law enforcement community rallied around these guys.

[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:59.520]
They'll be blown the sky away completely innocent, but doesn't that always happen now?

[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:09.720]
If a cop in Polkips in New York gets killed in the land of duty, then cops come in from like ishboming, Michigan, and they drive in from clear water and the Dallas and all over the country.

[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.440]
I know, I know, but listen to this.

[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:25.860]
We've got something going on in North Florida right now up in games though, where there are four corrections officers up from murder charges for allegedly beating this death row double convicted murderer in stark and attention.

[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.140]
Right.

[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:38.380]
Who, again, allegedly, they beat him up after the inmate said he was going to murder one of the corrections officers and they want to burn these guys.

[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:44.700]
They want to bust their balls over this and the guys is convicted murder and we're making a big damn deal about it.

[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:50.260]
So it's not otherwise because he's a convicted murderer, that means that they got to write to beat him to death. Is that what you're saying, sir?

[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.980]
No, that's what you just said.

[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.780]
No, absolutely no, but I'm trying to compare this.

[01:18:55.780 --> 01:19:00.820]
Sir, I hate to break the news to you, but nobody has the right in this country to kill anybody else.

[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:09.560]
We're not talking about capital punishment. That's a lot of stuff under the law, which is our very, but other than that, nobody's got the right to kill anybody for any reason other than self defense.

[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:14.020]
No, and I'm sure there are a lot more clandestine things going up up there that we'll never know about.

[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:14.320]
Yeah.

[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:23.120]
But, but it just, I think these guys are entitled to do process and it doesn't think that they're getting the rallying support that these cops in New York got.

[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:30.960]
And on my last note is the protesters in New York, seriously need to watch national television and take some tips from the Cubans down here.

[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.460]
My any how to successfully protest.

[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.760]
Let's an alien up there. In fact, get rid of Al Sharpton and send alien up there.

[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.920]
Yeah, well, I'll put a thousand cars in front of the Wall Street and that take care of it.

[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.820]
Okay, have a great day.

[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.040]
5 6 7 or yeah, that's, but that's always the problem with the dark folks.

[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:48.840]
They always protest and the burned down the wrong neighborhoods. You know, they always do it in the wrong spot.

[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:54.380]
They burned on their own neighborhood and then they protest were like a lot of other dark people are who gives a crap about that.

[01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:02.000]
He's right. If they just go out there and the Thai up Wall Street for a couple of hours, then you'll see some action probably really juliennied be out there doing the shooting.

[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.500]
Guns and the people who embrace them scumbags and the people who love them.

[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.940]
These are all part of the American effing way man. Beautiful.

[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:19.060]
Lovely. Like my mother says life could be beautiful, but it ain't.

[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.380]
Here's a mobile invoker. Hello.

[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.140]
Hey, good afternoon. Yeah, great.

[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:29.080]
I never heard your comment regarding the rocker situation.

[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.120]
Remember when he's bad mouthed all those people.

[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:35.960]
Okay, what happened when when I read you white that mouth?

[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:42.220]
It's old news. We've already been to that a million times. John Rocker's got everybody every much right to be a bigot as anybody else does.

[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:48.000]
He's not a spokesman for baseball for the Atlanta Braves or anybody else and it's he can say whatever he wants.

[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:55.780]
That's right. That's my Luther Campbell as big of as he wants to be. That's he can be as much of a redneck bigot as he wants. I couldn't care less.

[01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:02.860]
But how come nobody went wild when right? You like it? He's the man of the cloth. Don't you understand? He'd be doing it for God for the Lord.

[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.200]
Oh, he can get away with it. That's that correct. Plus he's a little on the dark side.

[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.760]
Oh, because he's black, he can get away with it. No, because he's black and he'd be a minister.

[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:15.600]
Oh, okay.

[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:22.180]
Okay, and I have a great thing not to mention that and of course a lot of the black athletes who have said grotesque and unacceptable things, but we got this double standard.

[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:28.240]
But why do we have to get into this now? This thing in New York is not a racial case, but America. They love it. They love race.

[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:33.280]
They basically hate each other like poison. The whites hate the blacks and the blacks hate the white and it's never going to change.

[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:42.600]
Never going to change words of a feather do it together. That's what George W said. That's why it's against that interracial dating or is he for it?

[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.300]
Let's see. Are you for it? Yeah, but what's what's the deal here? George, we can't.

[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:54.860]
Watching him like a trip all over his tongue. He didn't know what the le was saying and getting redder and redder in the push and his face was getting red too.

[01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:02.600]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound five. Here's John McCain up there on making his big deal is town hall meeting in Stockton, California.

[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.760]
Never met a gun owner. He didn't like. Never met a gun that ought to be registered.

[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:13.700]
There's nothing in the Constitution about cars. See, this is kind of strange to me.

[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:19.420]
A man who thinks that he should be the president of the US says that there's nothing in the Constitution that gives you a right to have a car.

[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.260]
Is there anything in the Bible that says you have a right to have a car? No. No.

[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.880]
How about in the Magna Carta? Did they write about cars in there? No. No.

[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:40.000]
I mean, thank God for the Republican Party. Maybe every time you have a feeling that they got a chance to get back in a White House.

[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:51.160]
They come up with like a dead man like Bob Dool. Or they're going to come up with a a dunderhead like George W or this guy who of course for the moment is fooling a lot of people.

[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.520]
But what they see what he's really all about. They'll say, oh, no, thanks.

[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.420]
And how is the Gary Bauer doing? I'd rather take my chances with Papa Bauer than Gary Bauer.

[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:07.960]
And what about that poor what's your name? And then what about poor Lizzie there on guiding light? That's what we ought to be concerned about. And what you get all those bruises from.

[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:16.200]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi, I'm a gunhugger from Miami.

[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:26.260]
What those cops did in New York is unspeakable. I agree with you. I mean, when they were confronted with the situation, they were just reacting how they were trained.

[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:32.180]
But the truth of the matter is once the person is stopped, it was no reason why they should have kept firing. Right.

[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:38.480]
I mean, we're trade. I have a few weapons permit. They thought if you shoot somebody, that person falls.

[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:50.460]
First thing you do after you call 911 is you try to resuscitate them. And obviously those cops were out to do something else. I mean, you know, there's those those people up in New York should just send those guys up the river.

[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:56.220]
Yeah. Well, they did send them up the river up the Hudson Albany and the people in Albany said they're not guilty next.

[01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:04.060]
Yeah. So that's all I have to say. And by the way, you know, if those triggers start dying, the Nazis in the next room are trying to gasp.

[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:10.220]
Okay. Have a great day. And that's a good point. You know, something. If the triggers start at that excellent point, we can keep our eye on them.

[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.160]
If they start falling off the goddamn ceiling, then we're in deep trouble. We're in the key area.

[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:22.700]
Okay. Deep crap. That's right. Better than a hummingbird. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:28.980]
Little kid get shot. We don't know if he's alive or dead because we got to hear John McCain on CNN. No, yeah.

[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:38.560]
But what do you say lotion? What did he just say? Did you hear that? Well, I talk about still other people's material. John McCain just said it puts the lotion in the basket.

[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:52.760]
Nice going, John. Here's a calling for Myers. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. That was a good one there. Listen, the one thing got me that one caller before you took the break that X cop. Yeah.

[01:24:53.320 --> 01:25:03.620]
They come in and they say how terrified these cops were. That's what he said. Right. Picture is for, you know, guys, bopping down the street with their guns out, ready to go.

[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:14.440]
This guy makes a move. They couldn't wait to jump on him and kill him. Yeah. I mean, I don't believe all of a sudden they turn him into little, you know, frightened, little innocent children.

[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:29.660]
But like they were carpenters or something or plumbers, not the trained law enforcement. They were scared to death. Yes. We hear the doctor who's at least five foot six tall, always 140 pounds, whatever. He was 120 pounds.

[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:42.540]
I know. It's amazing. These X cops, they just go into it like, you know, let, you know, some things are factual. We're not really, you know, stupid as they want us to be. And I just picture these guys out there as a vigilante group.

[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:47.980]
And they basically saw the opportunity jumped on them, you know, 41 shots later.

[01:25:49.900 --> 01:26:01.980]
But the one cop said after he saw that they supposed to gun was a wallet. And he said, where's the effing gun? And he realized there wasn't any guns. He leans over and says to the guy who's lying there dying on the sidewalk. Please don't die. Please don't die. Yeah.

[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:11.160]
Because I'm going to be in deep crap. Yeah. But they can't come after the fact and make up all these stories about we're supposed to believe how, you know, and using the word terrified.

[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:21.200]
Yeah. If me and four of my buddies were running down the street with a gun and some little guy pulled his wallet on a terrified would not be the word. Yeah, right. Exactly. You know, you can't scare me that easy. But.

[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:32.660]
And you know, as far as you were right as far as the parents of the kid, it ridiculous. You know, my dead had guns in my bedroom since I was growing up, never loaded double, blah, blah. Those parents definitely need to be.

[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:52.760]
Gotta be in jail. Have to be in jail. Definitely. I'm going to go up there to Michigan and throw the rest in jail if nobody else will do it. Yeah, definitely. It's not the six year old kid. He's playing with the toy gun. And, you know, but how did the game go last night? Now I missed it. The same crap. That's all I can say. It was the same. More of the same old crap. Deadly.

[01:26:53.720 --> 01:27:04.240]
Five two. That's a dominant cash for nothing at one point. No, it wasn't dominant cash. It was the Florida Panthers is one of them. Not dominant cash. Same thing applies. Neil no goal. Okay, I have a rate.

[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:10.500]
Three minutes before noon at five sixty WQM. The neo Roger show.

[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.080]
Make a shit.

[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:20.280]
10. He'll do sports radio five sixty Q. A. M.

[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.800]
You turn.

[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:40.240]
Night on Fox. What happens with a television network will do anything to get you to watch. And when we put on the live game of Russian roulette, well, we had to admit that was over the line when good.

[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:49.280]
Networks go bad tonight right after all new world wackiest circumstances only on the. Yeah, definitely over the line.

[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:58.280]
From 0215 60 WQM. Here's one of the great facts as I've ever received this is without knowing that you might have discovered why Jeff Rimmer never pulls out his wallet. He's afraid he's going to get shot.

[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:08.020]
Nice call Bob. Great facts. They stop. Yeah, I know I saw it. It was pretty weak. How about those months? They stuck them to how about that defense?

[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:17.220]
They stuck five six seven oh five sixty. Let's see. Oh, here we go. We can't tell you that the school has been evacuated and the children and staff.

[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:17.660]
Count you.

[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:27.080]
The street to a church where they're being kept away and giving parents a chance to catch up with their children and make sure that they are okay and to comfort them.

[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:37.560]
A news conference with police and school officials is scheduled to begin at any moment and hopefully then Frank will have some concrete details on exactly what happened.

[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:44.760]
I had police presence noticeable. Police presence is quite noticeable. They're keeping the public a good distance away.

[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:52.540]
Crime tape is is around the scene and they're trying to keep the scene as clean and secure as they can so they can get accurate evidence.

[01:28:53.540 --> 01:29:02.880]
Ed Garson reporting from not more as township in Michigan. Okay, great. But what what a response on our poll question today. Well, it's not the kind of a silly thing, but nevertheless.

[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:12.880]
And you know what so far George is right on the money should full nudity be allowed on television in the US is our question. They yes 28 note seven only 35 votes so far.

[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:22.500]
Pretty weak. That's 80% yes. I'm on the money. They're just doing that to make George happy. I mean, I agree with that, but I'm sure that there must be a lot of really prudent chance holes out there with their own.

[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:33.720]
And that's discussing the children might see or some pervert might see or George might see on being redundant 5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:45.820]
Here's a mobile and coral spring. Hello. Hi, how you doing? Okay, sir. I just want to make this real short regarding the cops shooting in New York. Yes. Okay.

[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:53.120]
What ever happened to keep your hands where I can see them before you start shooting? You know, the cops don't do that anymore.

[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.620]
Keep your hands where I can see them before I start shooting. Well, first there are all the guy understood very little English. That might not have helped anyway.

[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:11.240]
Okay. But then you know, you know, you got four cops one guy. Right. Yeah. Somebody could have, you know, stopped him or, you know, you know, to do it before they started shooting, right?

[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:23.260]
You would think so. Yeah. You would think so. What is this world coming to? Oh, well, that's all I got. Okay. I think I'm hanging there. What's not what the world is going to do? It's what American society has already come to a long time ago.

[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:38.900]
And that is a huge out that we can't get away from. We can't get away from the guns. We can't get away from the shootings and how anybody could vote for a candidate for any office who says, oh, yeah, well, you got this absolute right to have guns and just do whatever you want with them. Basically is what they're saying.

[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:55.440]
You cannot regulate it because it says in the second amendment, which is a product crap anyway. Not what it says. Do we have a militia? No, we need a militia. No, but we need is an end to guns. That's what we need and the people that squeeze them and hug them and blow each other away with them and let kids run around with them.

[01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:04.440]
And just like the guy to call before, oh, yeah, well, he's a gun squeezeer, but you know, it's terrible that the parents should be responsible. I'm sorry. I'm not buying it.

[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:28.320]
All the rationalization in the world isn't going to convince me that individual that private citizens should have guns. But then only the scumbags will have guns. Okay, whatever you say, whatever you say, and that's because the NRA owns lock stock and barrel one of our two political parties. And that's one of the main one of the reasons that I'm vehemently opposed to any member of that party, vehemently and unilaterally opposed. I don't care who the hell they are.

[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:36.740]
I don't care if they still look a boost to the rest of the freight train, which party's that? The gun party. Let's have a gun party. Come on.

[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:56.800]
Here's Weston. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes. I just want to give you a little bit of my background so you understand where I'm coming from. I moved down here. I retired for poor names. Yes, sir. And we don't have the violence up there that they don't have any people up there for that. Correct. We got about 40 people up there. Something like that.

[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:09.360]
It's just about what I want to tell you is the hatred in the bigotry is taught. No one's born with it. It's sickening happening to this country.

[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:23.260]
What's happening? This isn't something new. No, it isn't just started. It isn't new. But we have no further now than we were 30 years ago. Right. It's just that we have laws to protect different issues.

[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:39.520]
And then that's why we need to have those laws because if we have the action, it's just like this crap about hate crimes. We have to have hate crime laws now because if somebody kills you for a special reason because you remember whatever group, therefore the punishment has to be worse. Where's the logic in that?

[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:49.400]
I don't know. I mean, does anybody shoot somebody and kill them because they like them? No, no, no. They shoot them because they hate them. Yeah. At the moment.

[01:32:49.400 --> 01:33:04.660]
But anyway, you take the individual who shot and he off the policeman shot. I mean, the bottom line was he, he, he put out an all point for the description in any black man with the description because that's the way they think.

[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:17.500]
So that was five feet, five, six. He's like a midget. That's right. It was wrong, wrong, wrong. Well, we have as a bunch of wire derpself there. I don't know how old you are. I'll give you my age. I'm 50, 70. Okay.

[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:28.500]
Pretty old thing is in the home to kids. People have lost respect for their parents. They lost respect for the law. And so what you got out there is the people.

[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:41.560]
And the police are losing cheer. Oh, wait, I have to go. I got a kill a bug here. Okay. I said, I'm starting to each all over now from these goddamn sugars. We got in here. We got a sugar problem here at QIM. Let's get them. Okay. I'm shooting sugars right now.

[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:50.140]
Whether anybody likes it or not. That this place is a toilet. This is starting to become like the right and festive bug and festive place. Then I never worked that. Thank God over in Sheridan Street.

[01:33:50.720 --> 01:34:00.080]
Because this is a bunch of slabs that run this company. Slabs with the capital S. Just take a look at the walls out here with the schmutz on a guy that calls you to pick your guts out.

[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:12.720]
Stop hanging from the ceilings. Bugs flying around here. They got the guy slapping a guy that wall paper glue on the wall and it's coming through the vent here. And we're polishing from it. We're puking our guts out.

[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:26.620]
And these people are broadcasters. No, like my dog is a broadcaster. My little miniature pincher stick him in front of a goddamn microphone. Okay. He's a broadcaster like the one of bees. These are broadcasters.

[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:39.040]
Bugs flying around in here. How the hell could have you could see where we are? We're on the third floor. We're like in the middle. We're not near a window. We got bugs flying around. Probably trying to escape from the goddamn stench from that wall paper glue.

[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:53.040]
Well, I sure hope we pay him by the way. The wall paper people. They probably got paid in front. You think we would be. Oh, that's right. Cash only that's probably why they could get him in here today. Probably a special that Tuesday special.

[01:34:56.620 --> 01:35:00.220]
I don't want to say these people don't pay their bills, but you know what? They don't pay their bills.

[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:11.420]
Well, you know, I can't talk about that other thing, but I can sure tell us the way it is. I'm not making that up where that money come from. From that OJ golf room, by the way, anybody seen. Yes. Yeah, right. Exactly.

[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.200]
Nine minutes after noon at scandal written 560 WQA.

[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:16.900]
Basta.

[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.120]
They're too bad.

[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:27.460]
Predecessor at Burger King 999 bottle of cheap wine. You're old about a picked up for you at the liquor store for 95.

[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:39.220]
Cab ride to the dance 850 putting your hand down the pants of your drunken day price. There are a lot of things money can't buy. But for everything else, there's master card.

[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:44.140]
The official credit card to get laid in the millennium. All right.

[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:51.420]
1214 at 560 WQ. I got hang out at the route to when it's show from to the 60s afternoon to most of it. Six. Her coupons in the Panthers.

[01:35:52.060 --> 01:36:00.700]
Or back into that again. How do I know this is a different hercune and Panther. This is the money hercones in the pit Panthers with her accune basketball seven o'clock tonight at any K after the game.

[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:06.840]
560 705 60 pound 560 on the 18 T line. Here's a mobile in Oakland Park. Hello.

[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:06.840]

[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:08.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:15.440]
I didn't get a chance to come down to the high days of game last time. But you know the goal that they want to stare the ball when they crash in that and everything.

[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:23.400]
Yeah. My wife had played it back on TV. That goal was blocked in by them by Buffalo. Yeah.

[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:31.160]
He said from the TV camera. Let me ask you a question. What difference did it make? Yeah. 4252. We still sunk a joint out. It's discussed.

[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:39.020]
There was no contest. There was never any contest. Buffalo was flying like the wind. They were skating like there was nobody else out there on the ice.

[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:48.240]
And we will walk with sneakers on that's right on the ice. I swear. I mean you got me started hockey years ago. And I love hockey. But like God that's not hockey.

[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:57.920]
And he's screaming. We've got to get more players. Why all these players that are out there now are the same ones that we had at the beginning of the year when we got 16 points out of the capitals. Right.

[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:06.720]
Except for what's his name? Sir you're you're forgetting one thing and that is that if the goal tending can keep him in the game every game which Trevor can did play great again last night.

[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:17.620]
But if the goal tending can win him the game which they've been you can't depend on that all year long. People have been deluding themselves into believing this is an outstanding team. It's not there's too many there's too many dead spots out there.

[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:26.300]
I mean what's with including the kid with a long hair. Kavasha that they're so intent on because he's only 21 years old. I got news for what he's 31 years old.

[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:34.280]
He's still going to be a stiff. He still can't play. And then last night we get treated to the big sparts are out there. Peter were well. He's on the top line. How do you like that?

[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:43.740]
He comes out and starts out with Victor Kraslov and Paul Belbury and gets a bigger hand from the crowd at the introduction to the opening introduction that Paul Belbury does and does absolutely nothing to game.

[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:50.000]
I think all they're going to stick them in front of that on the park. He's out there in a power play. Did we score in a power play? Who was pathetic?

[01:37:50.400 --> 01:38:05.460]
We fell on the public and I talked to Terry Sunday at the NHL breakout. I said, Jesus do something tomorrow night. We're going to win. We're going to be work. I'm going to change the lines around and this and that. I don't look at him like this man is cool. I'm a roller hockey coach. I coach kids.

[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:14.080]
You're right. Terry Maria's coolest. I would agree with you. I mean like I said I coach roller hockey. What are you lining about? Why are you squealing? What are you?

[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.100]
I'm not sad because I give my what are you upset about because they're sticking to join out now. What can I tell you?

[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:30.220]
I don't know. You're right. I shouldn't get a step of God almighty. See I'm one of those people like those whether they're winning whether they're losing now. I did leave after the second period last night. We got that a lot of their cause it was for nothing.

[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:37.220]
In the game there was four or one. The game was over and we knew that. But I mean I'll show up regardless. The fact is they're not playing well. That's all I can tell you.

[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:57.620]
And the fact is that they got a lot of stiff too many stiff on this team. I don't I can't show up for financial because I got kids and I mean you know but yeah I give my support and I let me ask you this how come everybody's always winding carrying on about they can't afford to go there and last night maybe we had 10 or 11,000 people there forget that attendance in the paper. That's just tickets all from season tickets.

[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:27.600]
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

I don't know. I don't know. I

[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:41.480]
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.umber. It's only a game.It's only a game. It's only a game. It was only a game. It was only a game. It was only a game. It was only a game.

It was only a game OK. It was OK.

[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:44.860]
It's only a game. It was only a game OK. It was only a game OK. It was only a game. OK. It was only a game OK. It was only a game. It was only a game OK. It was only a game OK. Tell me one of those old Xuqiots

[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:49.100]
I'd given you this L-tea

[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.320]
G-enPlay

[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.960]
five sixty three forty five

[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:03.080]
no more news about the condition of the kid there i mean that anybody cares

[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.620]
you know they don't know who this

[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.920]
say this business about the right to have gun

[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.620]
i say that every parent in his country got the right to send their kid to

[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:13.500]
school every day and the right to expect that they'll come home alive

[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:16.360]
would that right should supersede the right to have guns

[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.160]
and you can take your second amendment and

[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:23.220]
and your militia to the assays for more for the militia and their while you're

[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:23.940]

[01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:18.290]
dear white folks couple of things you ought to know when I'm born I'm black when I grow up I'm black

[01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:31.050]
when I get sick I'm black when I go out in the sun I'm black when I go out in the cold I'm black

[01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:43.470]
when I get scared I'm black and when I die I'm still black but you my white man

[01:56:44.250 --> 01:56:54.130]
when you're born you're pink when you grow up you are white when you get sick you are green

[01:56:55.090 --> 01:57:05.610]
when you go out in the sun you go red and when you get cold you turn blue when you get scared

[01:57:06.130 --> 01:57:14.610]
you turn yellow and the happiest time of my life is when white people die you turn purple and you've

[01:57:14.610 --> 01:57:22.710]
got the damn nurse to call me colored okay it's a 1244 or 560 WQAM so what you trying to say

[01:57:22.710 --> 01:57:29.050]
starts is a chart so I don't have anything like that 560 705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line

[01:57:29.050 --> 01:57:32.770]
it's like a it's a tragic story but it's like a comedy of errors to see the way the media

[01:57:32.770 --> 01:57:37.450]
are covering this shooting North of Flint in Michigan it was 940 by the way that said that the

[01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:42.610]
kid was dead well guess what she's not hey to break the news to you on stupid talk well maybe she

[01:57:42.610 --> 01:57:46.190]
is but if it's a case they must be the only ones that know it maybe they got a psychic in there

[01:57:46.190 --> 01:57:50.070]
although I doubt it's a psychic that got burned it up and down here yesterday but at any rate

[01:57:51.590 --> 01:57:57.030]
yeah she got burned it by her ex-husband boyfriend whatever he was and then he was inside but

[01:57:57.030 --> 01:58:01.890]
oh wait a minute in custody charged with shooting her according to a press conference which

[01:58:01.890 --> 01:58:07.230]
has held just moments ago one shot was fired there were 22 students in the classroom and as you

[01:58:07.230 --> 01:58:13.410]
just heard one child was injured injured critically there are more than 400 students who were there

[01:58:13.410 --> 01:58:18.670]
at the school they were evacuated parents came to the scene and took them away while the scene

[01:58:18.670 --> 01:58:23.970]
is now safe the parents of one little girl are having a very difficult time of it and parents

[01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:29.290]
of those other students trying to explain to their children how this could have happened again

[01:58:30.090 --> 01:58:34.290]
so we've gone from them the first reporting here on MSNDC that it was a kid who took

[01:58:34.290 --> 01:58:38.010]
to go to school to show to a schoolmate and that they're accidentally went off any other kid got

[01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:43.730]

Neil what is it is this is Neil yes it is okay first time caller um i've been listening to your

[02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:27.010]
show and off and the police officers that call in almost justify the action they took

[02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:32.570]
except for this last guy except the last day county cop yeah i don't think i'm going to be very hot

[02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:37.410]
yeah which is voice sounds familiar i think i know uh the thing is that they really need to go

[02:02:37.410 --> 02:02:42.530]
that sixteen year old drill no no the call okay it sounds like they have to uh go after the

[02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:47.270]
department because it's the training they have to make them accountable because all these officers

[02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:53.590]
are justifying the fact that they're emptying out their guns yeah i mean what what does that mean

[02:02:54.190 --> 02:02:58.990]
well they have to go after the department these guys are being trained to be you know aggressive

[02:02:58.990 --> 02:03:03.170]
so in other words the department is responsible for the actions of each individual cop is that what

[02:03:03.170 --> 02:03:08.210]
you're saying and and not only that how do you go after the department oh you go after the state

[02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:14.630]
i mean they're the one state police officers this is after the city go after the city okay so we're

[02:03:14.770 --> 02:03:18.750]
going after the city the department the state and the dog can't you is that how about it

[02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:23.670]
crocs a lot of people didn't like him should we go after him too okay the little girl died by the way

[02:03:23.670 --> 02:03:27.550]
she did yeah so i'll go through sure and maybe they got the psyche over there it's super talk

[02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:33.850]
because the little girl just died where'd you get that three different uh people box news in

[02:03:33.850 --> 02:03:41.210]

[02:03:56.650 --> 02:04:01.410]
american that's right because it's a violent barbaric country where everybody including little

[02:04:01.410 --> 02:04:07.050]
kids now are running around with guns that is gun mommy's gun big brother's gun somebody's

[02:04:11.650 --> 02:04:16.130]
call an issue try to give me a song and a dance and sell it on your second amendment and all

[02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:20.410]
us other horse crap okay because civilized people don't want to live in the midst of a whole bunch

[02:04:20.410 --> 02:04:25.330]
of lunatics running around with guns and letting their little kids pick up their guns like play toys

[02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:30.910]
of course i said civilized people and the pardon me for saying that here in america okay

[02:04:33.150 --> 02:04:36.510]
see when you when you come on here here you say oh in europe they think we're barbaric and

[02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:39.910]
the people here are they get very uptight about how can you say that that's on american that's

[02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:44.190]
this guy well i'm just telling you the way it is they think we're a bunch of barbarians

[02:04:45.130 --> 02:04:48.450]
now of course if the germans start talking about those grotesque kids that uh through that

[02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:52.370]
boulder off you overpass and kill that woman in the car and if the germans start calling us barbarians

[02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:55.910]
then we might raise a couple of eyebrows or like scratch our little mustache a little bit

[02:04:56.710 --> 02:05:00.710]
i'm proud worst if i were them i'd just keep drinking that beer and dummy up a little bit

[02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:11.790]
here's a lady in aventura hello hi me yes ma'am hi in regards to the cops in new york yes okay first of all

[02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:20.330]
yes 41 shots were fired uh-huh yeah until you walk in someone shoes all right what does that

[02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:26.490]
what does that mean okay first of all only one officer only four shots winnow up they they when

[02:05:26.490 --> 02:05:32.010]
they got there they identified there were looking for a suspect that's this for gentlemen uh

[02:05:32.010 --> 02:05:38.510]
fitted they didn't he description he was in a dark and a dimly lit you know corridor no he

[02:05:38.510 --> 02:05:42.550]
wasn't that when they first saw him he walked into the corridor he wasn't standing in there and

[02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:47.210]
first of all it's a doorway yeah okay if he would have been in a dark dimly lit corridor if that

[02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:51.910]
would have been where they first saw him how could they have identified him he was walking home

[02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:55.510]
they saw him going home and they thought they they misidentified they thought it was the

[02:05:55.510 --> 02:06:02.350]
erasure suspect the serial rapist well when i'm trying to say to you is that when they were shooting

[02:06:02.350 --> 02:06:06.850]
yeah those those bullets were ricocheting off the building and those police were

[02:06:06.850 --> 02:06:10.670]
the miracle nobody else got killed exactly it's miracle the police office didn't think it killed

[02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:15.230]
it's a mirror miracle that no bystanders got killed innocent bystanders yes them too uh-huh

[02:06:15.230 --> 02:06:19.450]
which is not what you shouldn't be just unloading your guns like uh-when you defend the people around

[02:06:19.450 --> 02:06:24.830]
you didn't be a lot of women but a lot of people around yes i am told you against god yeah so what's

[02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:32.650]
the point my son is a police officer no surprise oh yeah my surprise i know but i might live down

[02:06:32.650 --> 02:06:41.030]
here in Florida yeah and my son no for my health yeah and my son first of all he doesn't even

[02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:47.170]
bring his gun home because he does have children home also so his gun stays in his locker in the police

[02:06:47.170 --> 02:06:55.950]
station that's number one yeah number two is though when you are confronted with a wall at that

[02:06:55.950 --> 02:07:01.670]
when you're confronted with a wall at five i was five foot six right if a police officer

[02:07:01.670 --> 02:07:06.770]
identifies himself and says police who is just adopted the combat stance like kind of like a

[02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:12.910]
little gorilla there in the uh-huh you not move okay and you go and you move and you reach for

[02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:18.750]
your pocket and you're dead what would you assume what would you move to begin with if a police

[02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:24.970]
officer says to you do not move police are you going to reach for your pocket no wonder for what if

[02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:28.850]
i didn't understand what they were talking about but he did understand how do you know that he

[02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:34.150]
understood anguish come on okay well everybody's got a different report about that as of yesterday

[02:07:34.150 --> 02:07:37.510]
he didn't understand speak a lot of English he was here in the country a short time and now all

[02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:44.570]
of a sudden he was he was a he's a linguist i don't know there there we will never know

[02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:49.830]
well we sure won't because he ain't going to be around to tell us no he won't unfortunately no he won't

[02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:53.910]
and i pray for those crops because they have to live with themselves for the rest of their

[02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:57.470]
lives also well i always saw a Ted Bundy would have had to live with himself for the rest of his life

[02:07:57.470 --> 02:08:00.710]
too soon we have spared him she would have should that have been enough penalty instead of putting

[02:08:00.710 --> 02:08:05.230]
him to death and you know frying him in the electorate here here in Florida you can't talk about a

[02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:10.630]
serial killer no no you're but you you're suggesting that they're putting their line of

[02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:13.870]
being they're going to have to live with it the rest of their lives they were doing their line of

[02:08:13.870 --> 02:08:18.870]
duty yeah and how about a doctor who commits malpractice that butchers somebody up and he was doing

[02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:23.090]
it in the line the line of duty wasn't he does that mean he shouldn't be punished for it in some way

[02:08:24.490 --> 02:08:29.450]
night if they are hired to do in a line of duty i am sorry there i have to disagree with you

[02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:34.350]
so in other words they're hired to just make their own judgments and if they make a bad judgment

[02:08:34.350 --> 02:08:39.070]
we just let them free they are not free they're guilt will live with them for the rest of their life

[02:08:39.070 --> 02:08:44.110]
okay thanks they can do no wrong did we hear that the other son is in the New York cop don't you

[02:08:44.110 --> 02:08:50.510]
understand this is the cops and the cop people against the rest of us with water two exceptions

[02:08:52.050 --> 02:08:56.890]
that that's what it's all about if you're a cop if you ever were a cop if you know a cop if

[02:08:56.890 --> 02:09:00.910]
there's somebody a cop in a family then whatever cops do they can do no wrong it's like doctors

[02:09:00.910 --> 02:09:04.430]
who are butchers and whose patients wind up dying because of them they just had another

[02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:08.970]
piece here a few days ago about all these people with these iatrogenic diseases that they get in

[02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:14.430]
hospitals from being butchered and given the wrong medication etc and so on we have an epidemic

[02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:19.630]
of that in this country but i mean if they got a license to practice and they're a doctor but

[02:09:19.630 --> 02:09:23.450]
only they made a mistake they have to live with those mistakes the rest of their lives can't

[02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:26.790]
sue them and you can't punish them and can't take away their license because after all they're

[02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:30.550]
a doctor anybody with a uniform like the old strawberry for example there's another good example

[02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:36.110]
he wears a uniform hopefully with stripes on but that's right Yankee pin stripes i forgot sorry Joe

[02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:42.550]
and what what's the point are we going to convince any of these people oh no

[02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:47.050]
the police officer is your friend he can do no wrong

[02:09:49.670 --> 02:09:52.970]

president i thought she was going to say today there are other

[02:11:15.890 --> 02:11:19.870]
constituting that a small interface so this is not even a lead story on cnn

[02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:24.370]
we got no primary reason god damn Washington state

[02:11:25.190 --> 02:11:29.010]
north Dakota which has got like six people in it and a redneck place like virginity does

[02:11:29.010 --> 02:11:33.950]

[02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:37.530]
anybody else care no no a bunch of farbiss in the glam nobody cares of course

[02:11:38.850 --> 02:11:42.870]
and so the best i can do is the facts that are a chronic facts and jethro facts to me which is

[02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:46.510]
obviously old news that the girl died but nevertheless they still don't know what they're talking

[02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:50.030]
about as usual the media reporting a lot of stuff by shooting before they uh

[02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:55.410]
look so to speak shooting from the hip a six year old girl was shot and killed

[02:11:55.990 --> 02:12:00.870]
if she really you're positive about that all three different people five seven year old class

[02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:04.690]
made an elementary school this morning this is in Mount Morris township Michigan which is just

[02:12:04.690 --> 02:12:09.270]
north of flint kind of like almost over to the thumb you ever seen Michigan with a big sore thumb

[02:12:09.730 --> 02:12:13.790]
a single shot was fired during a first grade class at dual elementary school it was not

[02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:17.370]
immediately clear if the shooting was accidental or intentional and here we are now a couple

[02:12:17.370 --> 02:12:21.150]
hours later and does anybody still know no because they're too busy showing this bush

[02:12:22.330 --> 02:12:26.770]
the class made a boy was in custody king uh said that's the who the hell is king uh

[02:12:26.770 --> 02:12:30.710]
police chief about 22 pupils were inside the classroom when the shot was fired

[02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:36.190]
crystal Watson eight was in her third grade class that she didn't know anything had happened

[02:12:36.190 --> 02:12:40.330]
until she heard sirens we were told to stand our class and stay calm she told the newspaper

[02:12:40.330 --> 02:12:46.150]
couple of boys were crying but everyone else was staying calm about 500 kids attend dual elementary

[02:12:46.150 --> 02:12:52.410]
in this town which is near flint and some 65 miles northwest of Detroit we're interested in

[02:12:52.410 --> 02:12:56.550]
how the little boy came into possession of the weapon jennessey county prosecutor Arthur Bush said

[02:12:57.410 --> 02:13:01.610]
got bush on tv bush and a thing here painting this hour in columbus after which he had

[02:13:01.610 --> 02:13:06.010]
south we don't care about that Lou come on Lou let's get with it to our essential California

[02:13:06.010 --> 02:13:10.670]
Jesus Christ we're interested in how the little boy came in possession of the weapon said the

[02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:14.210]
bush we've had other school children take guns elementary schools before but it never went

[02:13:14.210 --> 02:13:18.950]
this far it's a sign of our times when we have a fully armed society that doesn't take its

[02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:23.050]
responsibility to secure its weapons seriously isn't that exactly what i've been saying

[02:13:23.050 --> 02:13:28.310]
a fully armed society a bunch of irresponsible assholes everyone who's got a gun and how the kids

[02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:34.910]
can pick up the gun anybody their brother can pick up the gun six-year-old kids this is special

[02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:40.870]
remember that slogan i would eat someplace special for whatever used to be we got some

[02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:49.570]
place special for gun it's called USA baby god and these people are sitting out here like

mental health that pitch on channel four with all of her name which i keep i have to keep

[02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:06.610]

[02:14:11.710 --> 02:14:17.310]
to scare anybody away but uh she's just out of control there are times when she starts going

[02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:21.530]

[02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:47.030]
to live with that but the guy's dead yeah well he won't have to live with it yeah i guess not

[02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:54.070]

[02:14:54.070 --> 02:14:58.070]
involvement like that or son is a new york cup when you're blinded by your involvement in lack

[02:14:58.070 --> 02:15:02.250]
of objectivity you have to create some kind of rationale you have to rationalize away

[02:15:02.250 --> 02:15:06.050]
why you feel a certain way so she's done it by saying they're going to have to live with this

[02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:10.070]
the rest of their lives that's their punishment and that's that a lot like lucky lucky lucky

said something like that here's a mobile in Miami hello Neil guy she's wreaking yes sir

[02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:13.270]
one thing about these cops in New York i always thought an officer's job was to serve and protect

[02:25:13.890 --> 02:25:19.670]
you mentioned this before it just started going at me if you have four officers that are after a

[02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:26.630]
rape a suspected serial rapist yes right okay they followed this guy down the street

[02:25:27.430 --> 02:25:32.710]
why confront him in an alleyway why not confront him on the street aren't an area that

[02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:37.790]
that is that is possibly safe you know or where they did it easier for them to apprehend somebody

[02:25:37.790 --> 02:25:42.450]
why not according to according if you follow the story they were yelling at him to stop and to cut

[02:25:42.450 --> 02:25:46.730]
the crap into and and he just kept walking and of course you must understand that these were

[02:25:46.730 --> 02:25:50.890]
they were in an unmarked car they get out they're playing clothes there's nothing about them that's

[02:25:50.890 --> 02:25:54.750]
it and for for somebody that just came to this country maybe they've never even heard of a playing

[02:25:54.750 --> 02:26:00.550]
clothes cop okay yeah so he has no idea who they are he's in a total state of panic

[02:26:01.270 --> 02:26:06.650]
yeah i just i just i mean forty one shot i just i just i just i just i just i just appalling

[02:26:06.650 --> 02:26:09.910]
no no i'm telling you what's appalling is the fact that we have so many people defending it

[02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:14.150]
that's what's appalling you're absolutely correct and you've got this this year old i mean

[02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:18.390]
this this is what goes hand and foot together yeah that's right the pure okay i mean the

[02:26:18.390 --> 02:26:23.670]
the parents the art of one today should be taken out one on a telephone pole and just shot

[02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:29.350]
to death i mean i mean i used to own gun well let's talk about the violence well i used to own

[02:26:29.350 --> 02:26:35.190]
gun when i had my first kid i got rid of my gun because kid been gun spirit don't mix here

[02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:39.510]
responsible people in guns definitely do not that is correct and you know something i

[02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:43.430]
that's that's the end of the argument because there are so many irresponsible people in america

[02:26:43.430 --> 02:26:47.270]
it is very clear if it's the same with booze prohibition didn't work but you know something

[02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:51.690]
if we had if the majority of people in this country couldn't handle booze and we're going out

[02:26:51.690 --> 02:26:54.730]
killing people because they were drinking too much we'd have to go back to prohibition because

[02:26:54.730 --> 02:26:59.750]
we'd have total chaos and it's been shown very clearly that far too many people a very scary

[02:26:59.750 --> 02:27:03.950]
number of people in this country are too irresponsible to have guns and we got people like john

[02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:08.110]
McCain who don't even want to have registration of guns don't even want to have registration

[02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:12.830]
you got to have you have according to him you got to write the habit to whatever you want with it

[02:27:13.850 --> 02:27:19.050]
yeah i don't know the the constitution when it was written was written back when we you know we

[02:27:19.050 --> 02:27:23.430]
were trying to conquer the united stand only want to go there at such a ridiculous

[02:29:08.310 --> 02:29:12.010]
and you know who that was Bruce Beasley i'm embarrassed for your Bruce i really am

[02:29:13.390 --> 02:29:17.350]
the Beasley's not what he's called that's how desperate they are not gonna work sweetheart

[02:29:17.350 --> 02:29:20.670]
he's got pictures of me with six year old boys walking down the street in Naples

[02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:24.390]
Italy of course i never been there but don't confuse him with that

[02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:31.750]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T were call us when you get some help okay pal

[02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:37.670]
call us back when you get some ass systems and say hi to your family priest to why you're at it

[02:29:38.510 --> 02:29:44.390]
here's sunrise hello yeah how you doing Neil okay sir i have a proposal if everybody one

[02:29:44.390 --> 02:29:48.690]
year to turn in their guns outlaw guns from one year to turn them in yeah

[02:29:48.690 --> 02:29:52.750]
two like it if they want to go hunting let them go and rent a gun at a hunting range uh-huh

[02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:58.570]
why do they have to go hunting well some people need to hunt why but not in the city why do they

[02:29:58.570 --> 02:30:02.890]
need to hunt for what well that would take care of the you know already you know what they were

[02:30:02.890 --> 02:30:08.570]
hunting for in the Bronx was wild game uh no i think all hang on should be outlawed all gun

[02:30:08.570 --> 02:30:13.390]
here it should be out right private citizens unless they're in some kind of a special

[02:30:13.390 --> 02:30:17.430]
occupation where they can get a license where they obviously need to have a gun like a security guard

[02:30:17.430 --> 02:30:21.170]
maybe or something like that and there are many unarmed security guards as you know but i mean if

[02:30:21.170 --> 02:30:25.610]
they have some if they're standing waiting circumstances i can understand that license

[02:30:25.610 --> 02:30:30.230]
then heavily regulated but the idea that the average Joe on the street is responsible to have guns

[02:30:30.230 --> 02:30:34.250]
is ludicrous and unacceptable it's never going to change because like i said they got the uh

[02:30:34.250 --> 02:30:39.150]
the government lock stock and barrel they got them by the balls yeah look at Japan or England i

[02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:44.670]
mean look at the um murder rate by guns yeah those countries it's anywhere any civilized country
