[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100]
What the hell is your pair?

[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.460]
I think it's not me who goes to meet me in the station.

[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.820]
Man, don't you ever take a bad...

[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.820]
What are you talking about?

[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.040]
Wait, where are you going?

[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.640]
You don't want me to lose that all!

[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.320]
Can I check it out? I can slow-follow her out of my dollars.

[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.940]
Hey, no taxes! That's what you're doing, sir!

[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.300]
I ain't telling you, but I know again.

[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.540]
Can you tell me you're talking to these dead drugs?

[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.600]
They're made of white heads.

[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.740]
And in fact, that's where we'll be doomed, you.

[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.800]
These are just more honey.

[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.940]
So grab my hand, now what I want you is getting sick.

[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.120]
But everyone's been scusted and scared.

[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.040]
Walk through hallway sideways.

[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.520]
And these covers, it's very long hair.

[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.600]
Mama said he's a fairy.

[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.540]
He's such an handsome young man, please, and alone.

[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.600]
We're not too sure what's going on there.

[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.020]
Stay away from me.

[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.700]
Josh, please, I'll ask you a thing, these money,

[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.960]
but he's no sad agent.

[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200]
I'll ask you a thing, and he'll cut your face.

[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.600]
Josh, please, I'll ask you a thing.

[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.140]
He's a second-screase, and she's out of my belly button,

[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.460]
and he's going to sell it by the fount.

[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.660]
It's sick.

[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.700]
Got so bad his guts exploded.

[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.600]
You ain't wretched while all alone.

[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.240]
There's April's up and down his roof, baby.

[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.320]
Just you holding all that greasy old food.

[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.800]
Stay away from me.

[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.320]
Josh, please, I'll ask you a thing.

[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.120]
I dare a printboy don't like me.

[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.440]
Why do I think he does?

[00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.980]
Don't come to me.

[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.880]
Josh, please, I'll ask you a thing.

[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.900]
I'll ask you a thing.

[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.060]
Don't come to me.

[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.380]
Josh, please, I'll ask you a thing.

[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.380]

[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.040]
I'll ask you a thing.

[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.680]
You were right.

[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.060]
I was wrong.

[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.220]
I was wrong.

[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.160]
I just tried to cut people a little bit of slack.

[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.280]
Just a little thing.

[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.980]
I don't.

[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.440]
I get along with everybody.

[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.220]
I'm the one that's got the reputation of being a hard-ass.

[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.220]
And the fact is that you're a much harder-ass than I am.

[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.620]
I'm an old junkie.

[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.780]
Pretty hard.

[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.320]
But at any rate, Josh Friedman, all I can say is he's an asshole.

[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.920]
Thanks for aggravating me a little bit.

[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.760]
Josh, because ordinarily, I don't really take,

[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.920]
I don't care what anybody thinks.

[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.600]
But in your case, in what happened yesterday, I'll make an exception.

[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.160]
You jackass, you lying piece of turd.

[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.460]
Let me just first mention that all the people who work in,

[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.960]
not only in sports, but even in the periphery of sports,

[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.200]
anybody that he has any contact with in this town,

[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.640]
they hate him like poison.

[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.700]
He's walking arsenic on two legs, on two stubs.

[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.980]
I'm leaving here yesterday.

[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.600]
We had a pretty good show yesterday, I would say.

[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.240]
It was fine.

[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.520]
We had a Zinion calls, a lot of idiots, but that's okay.

[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.520]
Yeah, that was all right.

[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.440]
I was feeling pretty good.

[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.040]
And as I head around the corner to walk out of the elevator,

[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.100]
there is a bluff in there, and he's got big fat,

[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.420]
Josh Friedman in there with him.

[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.340]
So I kind of waved and got out of there real quick,

[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.980]
because I don't want to smell the linger too bad.

[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.820]
I don't want to catch a gift with, if he catch my drift.

[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.960]
But then as I kind of went out in the hallway,

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.540]
I thought, well, I'm going to go back and give him a shot,

[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.260]
because he did such a crappy job.

[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.880]
I mean, I'll horrendous job.

[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.300]
You give a big fat piece of turd,

[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.260]
a little bit of an assignment.

[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.420]
And can he do it?

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.720]
No.

[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.460]
Can he get it done?

[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.720]
No.

[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.400]
Can he do it right?

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.680]
No.

[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.000]
No.

[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.020]

[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.940]
Well, I suggested here, you know, weeks ago, weeks and weeks ago,

[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.580]
I suggested how come we don't have, since we're paying millions of dollars

[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.640]
for the rights of all these sports franchises,

[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.160]
how come we don't have any of the jocks recording promos

[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.420]
for all the shows on this station, including mine,

[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.200]
especially mine, since this is the one that I do.

[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.520]
Oh, yeah, green idea.

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.220]
Green idea.

[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.580]
I mean, here's a station that the other end of the dial,

[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.220]
who in their mind, they believe they're competing with this station.

[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.540]
They have no audience.

[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.420]
They have no measure of a lot, and they don't exist.

[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.060]
And they've got the ingenuity to go out there

[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.680]
and get some of their nerds off their ass,

[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.700]
and go out there and say, hey, cut a promo for us.

[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.120]
Hi, this is Schlimey Cohen, and you're listening to whatever the hell it is.

[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.300]
What's wrong with that?

[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.880]
Good idea.

[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.720]
Everybody does it.

[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.620]
So who do they send out?

[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.660]
Somebody with a brain?

[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.980]
No.

[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.000]
Somebody with a personality?

[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.500]
No.

[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.840]
Somebody that doesn't smell too bad?

[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.160]
No.

[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.440]
No.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.440]
So you want to think I really respect about this radio station

[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.340]
as the people that they sent out to represent it.

[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.480]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.000]
They must have a factory, where they just whip all these people out,

[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.400]
although we have encountered some of them in other places prior.

[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.320]
Not to mention fat boy.

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.180]
See, that's the prerequisite is that you have to be big and fat,

[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.260]
much better than I am by a long shot.

[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.620]
I'm slim compared to...

[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.140]
You have to be big, disgusting, and waddle a lot,

[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.480]
and smell real bad and make a lot of body sounds,

[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.200]
and offend everybody immediately, or if not sooner.

[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.820]
And then you're qualified to go out and represent WQAM.

[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.200]
Basically a scumbag place anyway.

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.720]
Oh, I will say this.

[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.640]
This is Paul Adams, the Florida Panthers,

[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.440]
Wilson and Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560.

[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.220]
Oi!

[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.160]
Hey, boy Paulie.

[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.800]
So there's one, and of course you got me to one with Robbie Needermar,

[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.700]
which I mean, Anne Mark Perish.

[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.860]
And then we got the promos from Joe Bowen

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.340]
and the hairy Neal the voices of Toronto Maple Leafs back on

[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.800]
had great Monday night when they were here in town.

[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.760]
The ones that...

[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.240]
Hardly lovely.

[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.280]
And you can't understand any of their useless

[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.400]
because they're all distorted.

[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.840]
Because again, you give a piece of turret a very simple job

[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.020]
to go out there and you can't get a done.

[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.160]
So anyway, to make a longer story even longer,

[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.380]
which I will.

[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.680]
Oh, no, I...

[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.020]
Seriously, I know the governor said,

[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.640]
get their black ass out of here or whatever.

[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.340]
And then what's something like he said?

[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.300]
That's the rumor that I'm starting out here in.

[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.420]
Get their black...

[00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.920]
Spook asses out of here or something.

[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.180]
So that on Channel 7, we'll talk about that.

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.580]
And then finally, better late than never,

[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.260]
the FBI agent charged in the I-95 debts.

[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.040]
You know, they're a little bit slow on these things,

[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.920]
but sooner or later, if they come up with enough protest,

[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.240]
they get to it.

[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.440]
And then we got the Vermont hockey team.

[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.700]
The University of Vermont hockey team been suspended.

[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.780]
For another one of those hazing incidents.

[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.120]
Oh!

[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.520]
We'll talk about it.

[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.860]
But first,

[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.440]
let's do 20 or 30 hours on that slide.

[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.260]
Josh Friedman, because he's an asshole.

[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.840]
So anyways, I'm walking out of there.

[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.980]
I come back and I said,

[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.840]
when a nice job, I'm doing what was promo,

[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.600]
John, and Duff says,

[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.300]
Bluff says, Mr. Weekney's, Bluff Lindsey says,

[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.960]
well, we're talking about that right now,

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.040]
as a matter of fact.

[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.780]
And big fat smelly, disgusting,

[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.260]
oozing, stapled up in one piece,

[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.740]
Josh Friedman says to me,

[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.420]
he says, oh yeah, well, I was over there this morning

[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.140]
and Paul Laws is the only one I would do it for.

[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.900]
He's the only one I would record a promo.

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.580]
I said, he's the only one.

[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.840]
I find that kind of hard to believe.

[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.620]
He says, yeah, he says, I asked Ray Whitney

[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.080]
and he looked at me and turned around and walked away.

[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.320]
And I thought to myself,

[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.880]
no way.

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.460]
It's not possible.

[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.360]
My good close personal friend, Ray Whitney,

[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.420]
who listens to this show,

[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.060]
who shook my hand so hard on the plane at time

[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.640]
and Toronto that it's still bleeding from it?

[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.960]
I don't believe it.

[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.920]
So to make a long story even longer,

[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.420]
I made a couple of calls that I want to mention

[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.560]
in names during the day,

[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.760]
but I thought I'll get to the bottom of this

[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.780]
because it sounds real.

[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.740]
It sounds fishy.

[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.960]
Something's things here.

[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.240]
Besides Josh Friedman.

[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.380]
It's hard to tell when he's around

[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.720]
because the aroma is so pungent and overwhelming.

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.240]
You can't really tell where it from which it's emnating,

[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.620]
from which orifice.

[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.680]
Correct him, probably.

[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.900]
So anyway, I made a couple of calls

[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.620]
and I make a very long story even longer.

[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.480]
Last night at about the 10 past 11 o'clock,

[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.760]
one of my hockey people,

[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.920]
I don't want to mention rumors name,

[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.980]
called and said,

[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.960]
Ray Whitney just returned by call.

[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.260]
He said it's absolutely untrue.

[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.040]
He's furious.

[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.300]
He's psychotic with fat Josh Friedman.

[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.980]
He'd like to beat us not out of him.

[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.560]
And he tells me what the real story was.

[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.540]
Then five and later by phone rings again,

[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.700]
and there's my good close personal friend, Ray Whitney,

[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.220]
on a phone.

[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.460]
Telling me the real story about this,

[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.200]
which I'll get to is,

[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.680]
it's not really important because most of you

[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.880]
don't even know who Ray Whitney is.

[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.020]
You wouldn't know a hockey puck from a goddamn door stop.

[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.080]
But the fact is,

[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.640]
what do we have people like this going out

[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.240]
to represent this radio station?

[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.740]
Why can't we get something as simple and basic as this done

[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.640]
by people who like us, for example?

[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.140]
And I know it may come as a shock,

[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.380]
but actually are people out there who like us.

[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.100]
God.

[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.280]
Josh Friedman, man.

[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.060]
He's an asshole.

[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.040]
It's a matter of fact.

[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.000]
I almost forgot about this.

[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.180]
This would be perfect for this.

[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.180]

[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.040]
I'm going to tell you a story about the brand new world's

[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.500]
biggest ass hole.

[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:12.640]
And it's a brand new story about the brand new world's biggest ass hole.

[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.060]
His name is Josh Friedman.

[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.680]
And he's a new world's biggest ass hole.

[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.800]
Head past 10 at 560 WQAM.

[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.120]
No forcing of this broadcast may be reproduced without the word.

[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.000]
No, no, no.

[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.540]
A WQAM, B3, acquisition, court.

[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.820]
Hail Rogers Guy.

[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.340]

[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.960]

Dave and Danny and Dave.

[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.140]
Oh yeah, what's your take on this day?

[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.220]
Oh, I love it.

[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:22.820]
Oh, dance.

[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.100]
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.

[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.680]
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.

[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.460]
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.

[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.800]
I don't know.

[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.440]
Who is it?

[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.840]
It's dais, man.

[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.940]
Baby and daddy.

[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:54.180]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

[00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:00.400]
So anyway, 10, 15 at 5.60 WQM, so getting back to my good close personal friend, Josh Friedman, he's an asshole.

[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.260]
So the reason that Ray Whitney turned around and walked away was because for the eight million time he was asking him,

[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:12.160]
as he always does, from what I'm told in our conversation last night, to record some stupid, comical thing for

[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.060]
Gelty and the guys in a worse team, which they're always going over there and bugging the guys to record silly love to make them back to sit down comedians,

[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.000]
which are the comedians?

[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.200]
No.

[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:20.700]
No.

[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.460]
They're athletes.

[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.680]
They're whatever they are.

[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.960]
And so after about the forum was, and my name was it ever mentioned?

[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:28.340]
No.

[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.560]
No.

[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.480]
My name was never mentioned.

[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.720]
And Ray Whitney assures me that if my name would have mentioned, he'd have been delighted.

[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.320]
He'd have been ecstatic to do a little promo, no problem at all.

[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.080]
But did Josh Friedman mention my name?

[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.220]
No.

[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.960]
Did he bother telling anybody that in the story?

[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.020]
No, because he's a piece of crap. He's a big disgusting obnoxious piece of crap

[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.240]
Was over a year ago that you told me that and I said yeah, you know cut the guy break

[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.380]
And then of course I didn't have to say when he weighed 700 pounds and I said you know something the big obnoxious part

[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:04.600]
And the smelly part right through the glass window. He's the only person I know can stand on the other side of a soundproof

[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.960]
Bulletproof glass window and you can still smell it

[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:15.580]
The chair still out there in the hall. Oh the Josh read memorial chair that they pushed out in the hallway because he stuck it up so bad

[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:21.120]
Nobody would sit on it the musical chair. It keeps moving around like somebody says sad on it with an H

[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.940]
Is what it's like if you catch that on he shed on it if it catch my drift he shmatt on it

[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.360]
Yeah, that's right

[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260]
That's the past tense of Schmidt is Schmidt. He shmatt on it

[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.240]
Toba crap, okay, they hate you like poison over there Josh Freeman

[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.060]
They don't want to ever see your ugly pus again. They don't want to smel you. They don't want to know from you

[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:48.360]
They don't want to be bothered with you. They don't want to record anymore stupid little silly promos for guilty either while you're we're at it

[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.360]
You jackass you

[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.760]
One of them that Josh have a nice day

[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.140]
How many times have I talked about that this is the most bizarre place all

[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.060]
All all these years a hundred years. I've worked in radio and every place I worked

[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.260]
I got along with most of the people over some people like me some who hated me

[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.360]
But the generally speaking that we spoke

[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.500]
Because you go to work you get along here. I got a list as long as my arm of people

[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.300]
I won't look into might I want to speak to them. I don't want to see them

[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.400]
Now use the term people loosely by the way. They're not people. They're cretens

[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:30.360]
Because Greg reads specializes in that all the scum all the sewage that nobody else in a market will touch

[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.500]
That nobody would hire on a bet or all the sewage that they're desperately trying to squeeze out the door

[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.860]
They wind up here at Q.A.M. I hear it for your scumbag station for the 90 for it was now

[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.500]
What am I gonna say now? I can't say for the 90s anymore for the for the

[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.740]
Yeah

[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.940]
That does present a problem

[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.940]
For the 21st century. Are we in the 21st century? No, don't start that crap again, please

[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.000]
20 way governor Bush says get their black ass out of there something like that

[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.680]
Maybe that isn't exactly what he said. I didn't see the piece on Channel 7 this morning and he called Channel 7

[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:12.740]
To make sure they understand he was talking about the the news people the camera people not the two black legislators that are protesting

[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.800]
And I have to do agree by the way with the getting rid of affirmative action

[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.940]
So I disagree with those two smarts are sitting there, but they got to write this at their own protest. They're doing a little sit down

[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.960]
Get those smarts asses out of here something like that. He said get those spooks out of here. Is that what he said something?

[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.640]
Something sounded like that to me

[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.960]
Boy if we could only bring bring back the old hecoon, huh?

[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.540]
He could relate a little bit better to this problem. I'm against the affirmative action boys and girls if you're qualified

[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.180]
You're hired if not get lost go cry on somebody else's shoulder

[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.120]
Here's a very depressing thing

[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:56.740]
Speaking of a Whitney in the panthers and by the way Robert Steinbach in a hero today almost right to column that makes some sense

[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.080]
You go about halfway down and he gets lost

[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.380]
He totally gets lost, but he started out with good intentions

[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:10.900]
He says hey Dolphans get over it the worst thing about the Dolphins ignominious exit from this year's playoffs is the prospect of hearing Dolphans

[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.320]
Wine about it for the next seven months

[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.540]
Oh

[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.440]
With Jimmy Johnson tasty departure a new head coach and uncertainty about aging superstar Danny Marino's return

[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:28.420]
The typical software sports panel have plenty to obsess about until the kickoff of the 2000 season mercy

[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.600]
I have a suggestion get over it

[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.880]
Let football go for a while

[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.040]
South Florida's got two exciting first place pro teams that at least compared with the hapless Dolphans almost know what is noticed

[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:45.020]
The Florida panthers are dominating the NHL Southeast division behind goal scoring machine Tom Elbury and my close personal friend Ray Whitney

[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.400]
And led by Alonzo morning the best center in basketball the mommy heat is leading the NBA's Atlanta division

[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.680]
You can know they lost to the bowls last night and over time

[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.020]
Despite having to play without injured all star points are too hard away most of the season

[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.800]
And here's the interesting paragraph by Robert Steinbach

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:06.740]
He says a real sports town would find a lot of consolation in those two winners using their success to suit the pain of the

[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.460]
62 to seven stomping the Jacksonville Jaguars put on the dolphins on Saturday

[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.760]
Yet I expect the usual pattern to hold

[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.580]
Let's pour local sports fans will waste three perfectly good seasons winter spring and summer

[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.160]
Drowning on endlessly about what went wrong and what must be done to save next year?

[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.960]
Spare me and at that after that he just think it's lost

[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.520]
Nice going there Robert

[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.560]
For half a column is better than none

[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.120]
And in my channel syrfan last night

[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.440]
I did see the guy from I mean win the million dollars by the way and that really got awful show

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.380]
But it kills a good hour

[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.280]
We've come to a conclusion that's a really a very weak crucial

[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:47.440]
But it kills a good hour if there's nothing else on at all which there usually is not you flip over there and there's readers everybody likes readers right?

[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.280]
He's a good guy

[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.120]
And that show is it's taken off it got like a 99 sure it's the biggest damn thing

[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.200]
It's big nail it's big in a boat in the universe

[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.440]
So I did see the attorney of the lawyer guy from I mean win the million bucks, but I'm channel syrfan last night

[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:09.600]
And I come across on wendy which I never watch of course in less than a loaner with somebody I turn on wendy and there's the end the heat game

[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.520]
And it's almost over and I see that now they're like nippin tucked life and death with the bulls with the worst team in the history of basketball

[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.420]
And I thought that was kind of bizarre and I look around and a stand and looks like they just had a bomb scare

[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.060]
There's all these people disguised as yellow seats

[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.780]
It looked like a flea venomous center in Boston. There's all these empty seats. I mean thousands and thousands of empty seats

[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.840]
So a few minutes later I turn it on it says Chicago 80 Miami 80 going it over time

[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.540]
And now I look at the seats and it's the ends of people disguised as empty yellow seats

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.140]
There's nobody there a few thousand maybe a handful

[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160]
And just out of morbid curiosity I watch the overtime

[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:58.420]
Which do I ever watch pro basketball when I watch you over 10 to watch him get their ass to kick by a girls team

[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.260]
And by the time there was like 30 seconds left and that over time

[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.840]
You could have had your own section and gone bowling and played partigian there you could have played grab ass in the stand

[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.920]
There was nobody there

[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.140]
So this morning I'm watching on channel seven

[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:18.260]
I see governor Bush and get their black asses out of here or whatever you said and I see the clips from the lowlights from last

[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.140]
Game and they show in the first quarter and it's just as empty in the first quarter as it was at the end

[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.620]
Irregulated there was nobody there. I look at the paper this morning

[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.440]
You don't think Mickey is fake and he's attentive doing slipping out phony numbers

[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.400]
It said 19,000 some almost the sellout

[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.520]
There must be one hell of a lot of unsolved tickets for those guy named heat games. I'll tell you that because

[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.580]
Nobody is showing up now

[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.500]
Talk about a real sports pound or real town of any kind

[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.000]
Then I find in Michael Russo's column this morning this unbelievably a distressing piece

[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.240]
The Panthers who have a 14 point lead in the southeast division are months ahead of last year's pace

[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.460]
They've got the best home money percentage in the international hockey league

[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.720]
16 win three losses and two ties and unbelievable

[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.120]
833 percentage yet

[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.280]
Attendances in the bottom half of the league and the worst of any of the six division leaders

[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.760]
They're averaging 15,000 six eleven a game 350089 shorter capacity

[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:22.060]
They haven't sold out a game this season and they've drawn more than 17,000 only four times as of yesterday afternoon

[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.580]
5500 tickets remain for a night's game against the Washington caps

[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.900]
They won a five in a row the Panthers won five in a row

[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.960]
They're in second place in the division even though it's not close to the closest competitor

[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.620]
It should be it's an important game

[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.300]
Does anybody care? No anybody interested? No anybody buying any of those 5500 tickets? No

[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:46.840]
It's still Danny and Jimmy and Dave and Danny and just like Robert Steinbeck says a one note town just like I said yesterday

[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.040]
I'm embarrassed for this town. I'm humiliated guys come in here

[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.540]
They do a real good job to put an exciting product out there for you

[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.260]
And I'm tired to hear in the belly. He can and all these front-running ponies. Oh, we'll wait till the playoffs start

[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.360]
If you can make the drive if you can make the slut from all the way down there in Kindle wherever you are

[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.520]
A good friend Howard Kleinberg it is why they show up every guy then game just about right

[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:15.120]
For some strange reason they make it all the way from way down here and South day up there and it's not that dig of a deal okay?

[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.240]
That's that dig of a slip

[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:23.000]
There everybody here. It's the town of excuse makers and town of whiners like the guy to call yesterday

[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.920]
Well, we wanted to buy four tickets, but we had to do this and he lives like 15 minutes from the arena

[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:34.140]
He could have gone down there anytime he wanted or sent somebody down or anytime he wanted and bought the tickets right there at the box or office

[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.480]
But he'd rather wine and belly ache and bitch and complain and yeah

[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.740]
Get really old and still

[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.240]
really tired

[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.320]
And this afternoon I got to go for my abdominal and pelvic catch scan so no

[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.240]
Let me forget 35 minutes. I got a drink. They're really good crap. That's what they call it

[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.520]
You called it vile

[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.000]
Oh, seriously, what do they call that stuff?

[00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.580]
Periam

[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.400]
Periam and about through the mouth. Yeah, we're heading to animal through your mouth

[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.000]
Yeah, well, that's what it is you got to drink that stuff and then three

[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.120]
I got to drink another one and then they just want to take a look inside because this stuff just lingers on and I feel like crap

[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.360]
And I got this cold sore here on my lip and I look like yeah, no, I can invulid

[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.760]
But I'll still make it over the game sooner or later. Maybe a little later than usual. I'll be there

[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.940]
With this front running to Tony town. It's all that they think they know they don't even know it because they don't know what they're talking about

[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.040]
That's all they think they know

[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.880]
Is the fish this and the fish that and you can smell it all the way over here

[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.420]
It's either that or Josh Friedman. Do I want to talk about him again?

[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.000]
Maybe a couple more hours that jackass the disgusting turd

[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.920]
Stayed out away from here your persona non-grata and I use the term persona loosely. Okay?

[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.220]
Your fat sonon grata in this studio Friedman

[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.460]
Jim Manditz talks for a rat

[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.400]
Yes, right here on sports radio 560

[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:04.980]
Hey, ow can beat that gator meat and now it's time for another edition of the unpublished works of Dr.

[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.460]
Suks today selection

[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.820]
Horton hears a hoe

[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.440]
Forny Horton hears a hoe calling to him have you got money to blow?

[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.620]
Why yes, Horton said quickly sporting a pole. There's a hundred in my bucket and it's burning a hole

[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:27.000]
I'll take off my clothes if you give me your cash and Horton got excited as she exposed her bear

[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.360]
Essential thin Horton did mount her and boy was he glad when she screamed you're the biggest Horton

[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:43.240]
When Horton was done he smiled and sat for a smoke but the hose started laughing Horton said what's the joke?

[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:50.540]
Then the hole turned around and Horton looked and got sick because this hole like Horton had a big

[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:51.440]
Harry

[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:58.220]
That was another selection from the unpublished works of Dr. Suks

[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.280]
Thank him 31 you welcome to 560 W to QAM

[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:06.840]
So anyway the word is Josh Friedman is doing that hockey beat over there because it was kicked off every radio show on his radio station

[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.780]
Is that the real word?

[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.740]
Then nobody will let them produce the show because he's disgusting and obnoxious and the nauseating and smells real bad

[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.780]
And this personality's like in a minus column. Is that the real reason? Uh-huh

[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.020]
So he wants to have taken a good guy's job

[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.940]
From covering the a panther beat over there and the doing the stuff which is somebody competent like the other guy

[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.320]
Would have been doing that job. We'd already had the promo a long time ago without any problem without any stories

[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.220]
When I bother and read Whitney or uh rumor anybody else

[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.460]
But when you're dealing with people who are just obnoxious and nobody wants nothing to do with them

[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.160]
And because he's on a salary they got to find something for this tub to do

[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.160]
How about just sitting in there in a bullpen

[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.040]
And eat all day they would be good which quite frankly every time I've ever seen him in there

[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.860]
He had food shoved in his big fat push not a lot of half food in there by the way. Oh

[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:58.080]
Oh, I don't like what's his name find out from over there Bob the Moose from the West Coast. They'll you know, stitch on him

[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.760]
Like a kindergarten

[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.580]
kindergarten we got three adults the ledge working on it morning show

[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:11.000]
Oh, we don't want to be eaten and they went on a food and hear what Bob the Moose is around because he'll go back and stitch to the bees

[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.200]
Over and four mires

[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.680]
Oh my god

[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.100]
Get out the pale in the sandbox get out the shovel

[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.120]
Yeah, that too

[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.280]
Vermont hockey season ended after investigation

[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:30.460]
Vermont lawmakers say they're disappointed by the decision the cancel the rest of the season for university of Vermont men's hockey team

[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.040]
But most field was inappropriate step. Uh-huh

[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.540]
University president Judith Ramley announced Friday that the remainder of the season was being canceled

[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.660]
Because some players have been dishonest with school officials during an investigation into

[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.260]
Hazing that occurred last fall

[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.740]
It's a very sad thing for the university hockey program

[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:53.680]
But it's a good thing for establishing a tenor that hazing will not occur governor Howard Dean said

[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:01.320]
The hazing allegations surface last fall the situation gained urgency last month after former goalie Cori and Lot Tulip

[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.000]
filed a suit that outlined the details of the hazing

[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.260]
I guess they were looking at his to leap

[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.040]
University officials were criticized for the speed of their response to the allegations on January 4th

[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.080]
Officials released to report detailing the allegations against the ECAC division one hockey team

[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.660]
Freshman players were allegedly required to play drinking games parade naked while holding each other's genitals

[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.580]
All right and threatened with other degrading acts

[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.920]
I rest my case for the eight billionth time you assholes out there who winded in aisle

[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.360]
About this whole fraternal ass grabbing thing there you are

[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:44.760]
Freshman players were allegedly required to play drinking games parade naked while holding each other's genitals

[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.560]
And threatened with other degrading acts like maybe a few spankings on a rectum stuff like that

[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.900]
But mostly sir a circled around jerk getting a naked

[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.220]
Sounds awfully familiar like that book that I read that I brought in here that one day

[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.080]
That's certain hockey people not to mention remember and they all stracking a lot of other people don't want to read

[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.300]
Because they can't face the truth because they're in denial

[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.640]
That's that I want to quote anybody out there, but they're in denial about these all of these things

[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.000]
All you

[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.660]
Macho sports guys man all you macho fraternity guys like that guy to call that day about running naked

[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.720]
There's nothing like running naked on the beach with your buddies

[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.860]
Yeah, that's what he said

[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.800]
There's there's nothing like running naked on the beach with all your buddies. Here's a mobile in bouquet. Hello. Yeah, how you doing?

[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:39.780]
I'm doing okay. Well, you know, yeah, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this fraternity business. Yeah, that's him

[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.620]
We saved the call that would that that along with the bridge center. I guess that's the

[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.240]
Yeah, two classics over 24 years the fraternity hazing guy

[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.220]
Who culminates who caps off a an otherwise brilliant call

[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.820]
With that statement there's nothing like running naked with your buddies on the beach a real good heterosexual sounding

[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.040]
thing to make yeah

[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.900]
Almost as heterosexual as holding each other's genitals

[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:06.640]
Yeah

[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.080]
Well if there's no passion. Oh, that's right. I forgot that's what they say in the church

[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.920]
There was no passion involved so it didn't make it sexual was just

[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.840]
There's no fact in the church. We're just having fun boys will be boys stuff like that

[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.900]
Priests will be priests

[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.560]
So there you go goodbye to the University of Vermont hockey season

[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.360]
And you mostly continue to be into not you won't mess up

[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.060]
I mean that one day we did have a little bit of success including that guy getting some fraternity people to call in on a show

[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.740]
After years and years of trying, but I you know, I'd be embarrassed too. Well, no, I wouldn't be embarrassed because

[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.880]
You know, I like it but at any rate

[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.860]
No, seriously, I mean if I were supposedly some heterosexual guy am I heterosexual guy? No, I suppose

[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.700]
There were some

[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.220]
And I came on a year and talked about all of these activities

[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:55.200]
I participated in in college and athletics and so on and in gym class and in wrestling class

[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.320]
I'm groping some guys genitals down there

[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.620]
And grasping under his armpits and under his spectrum all his other body parts

[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.140]
I'd be probably embarrassed to talk about that in detail too

[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.060]
Real embarrassed

[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.000]
Now somebody like Joe Castello on the other hand who's a real balls-on guy

[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.240]
Okay, let's leave him alone. Okay, he's already had enough

[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.580]
pressure left stress

[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.600]
Protest occupies bushes sweet. We'll get to that

[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.400]
Let's take somebody's great calls because he was a mobile in Nassau. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir?

[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.100]
I'm calling this is the eye man. I love you guys, Daniel

[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.980]
What's what's going on with your boy when he wanted to get those guys asses off the TV man?

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.960]
How do you like that? He said get their dark black asses out of here something like that

[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.640]
I was just slipping through

[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.180]
Next thing I know is I get those asses out of like what the hell on?

[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:55.520]
Okay, those porch muckies off my couch or something of that effect. I'm maybe a you know paraphrasing

[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.100]
Yeah, let's go. Let's say uh second time. Carla

[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.600]
Could I call one of my cool wigs to do strike? Yeah, man. Go ahead. Oh, not on the year though

[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:11.500]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T line as they continue asking the musical question here in South Florida

[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.520]
Where are the fans?

[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.940]
Not just the usual winers the Danny and Jimmy Crowe the one note Charlie's

[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.660]
But where are all the fans? Where are the living and breathing people as you drive around down here

[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:29.320]
Don't you see all just tons of living and breathing people? No, no last time I saw live in breathing people with this past weekend at the MGM granted Vegas in all over the city

[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.860]
Living and breathing people there were old people there were like kids there were people of all ages

[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:41.100]
But loads and loads and loads squirt squirt not that kind of load well. I guess so loads of living and breathing people

[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.460]
What a shock and you want to know one of the reasons I had set one of many reasons

[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.720]
I had such a great time in Vegas even though I left my usual contribution is because Josh Friedman wasn't there. Oh

[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.440]
I may just do the next month every day may do an hour and a half son of a bitch, you know

[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.420]
Turned and walked away. He neglected to mention that he never mentioned my name

[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.060]
That had anything to do with oh god just convening to let that out

[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.460]
And over the years I've said many many times and I do believe that just like that jackass son Nelson

[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:18.260]
You know from the airport that the parks from Toronto do I care about people like that? No, I don't know them

[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.680]
So if you want to be rude go right ahead doesn't influence being a least bit

[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.420]
But if it's somebody I like somebody I respect somebody I assume who likes me

[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:33.660]
And allegedly they shine me I have to raise four eyebrows about that and assume that once again Josh Friedman is just being Josh Friedman

[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.280]
He's an asshole

[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:34.980]
He's an asshole

[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.900]
despised by all

[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:46.380]
If we took a poll in this building it would be unanimous is there anybody this building could say anything good about this tub of large no

[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.020]
Would anybody raise a whimper in protest and say you're being a little bit tough on this big turd burger

[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.220]
What anybody say that no?

[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.980]
Would any of the people over there at the panther at the macarena defend Josh Friedman

[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:02.660]
Say boy, we'd sure like to see him again here every day. No practice and with a stupid tape recorder. No shoving him in our place. No

[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:11.120]
How does it feel to be universally reviled by the entire real human race Josh Friedman how does it feel

[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.960]
Besides fat and smelly

[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.200]
24 11 at 560 WQM is

[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.100]

16 before a lot of it at 560 WQM FBI agent charge and i95 death

[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.000]
It's that better late than never

[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.020]
Nearly two months after an FBI agent nearly drive allegedly driving the wrong way and i95 plugged into and killed two

[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:12.280]
Lotter Hill brothers the barricaded attorney's office finally yesterday filed manslaughter and homicide charges against the agent

[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:19.660]
David Firol 36 of coconut Creek and charged with two counts of vehicular homicide two counts of driving under the influence a slash manslaughter

[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:24.480]
And two counts of driving the unlawful but alcohol level slash manslaughter

[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.560]
Line issue I spoke to him from the broward state attorney's office

[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.700]
The charges include one count each for the death of brothers morris Williams 23 and Craig chambers 19

[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:37.620]
Isn't that interesting by the way how they tried to turn the tables around in the beginning and say the brothers were driving the wrong way

[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.800]
Uh-huh, which they were not

[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.340]
Just covered up just get the big pale out there and try to get enough sand and crap to cover it up

[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.800]
But they couldn't do it this time

[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.020]
I

[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.400]
Protest occupies the governor's suite

[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.940]
What we'll need to say those two uh-s books does that what you say get those books out of their asses out of here something like that

[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:05.120]
After failing to persuade governor bush to back off his plan to end affirmative action two black state legislators states in

[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:11.040]
1960s style uh- sit in on Tuesday night taking over Bush's office suite in telehasse

[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:17.480]
With nine reporters in two capital security guards looking on senator Kendrick meek and represented a Tony Hill

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:23.840]
We're still camped out in lieutenant governor frank brogans office and the governor suite 11 30 last night following they were just getting started

[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.960]
Meek was angered when he learned that bush was caught on videotape saying kick their asses out

[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:36.560]
Your mark came after a news briefing. It wasn't clear. Who he was addressing or whether he was referring to the legislators or reporters or both

[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:43.080]
Bush called WSBN channel seven in Miami which aired the tape and said the comment referred to the reporters in brogans office

[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.280]
We believe that no no, I don't believe that

[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:52.300]
I mean of course he's gonna say that he's gonna pretend that because it's not politically correct to say get those spooks out of here get their asses out of here

[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.360]
Get those are clouds those monkeys those uh

[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:03.240]
Coons go those mulees get them out of here. That's just not politically correct. Is it no for the governor of the state of Florida

[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:10.220]
I wouldn't be surprised very soon if we joined Georgian South Carolina and have the rebel flag right up there with a goddamn US flag on a state capital in talent

[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.100]
I can't believe it yeah, I believe it

[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.720]
And like I said, I'm vehemently opposed to affirmative action, but

[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.960]
But who he'd be kidding. How's this governor fooling anybody with a brain. No, no

[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:29.040]
When you say get those nigger asses out here whatever was he said and it's something like that

[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.920]
Not really positive when you say something like that. I have to really wonder about it

[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:43.300]
There's all kinds of crap visions of Latin Grammy show dim for South Florida

[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.380]
Wish we already pretty much were sure of that weren't we?

[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.160]
South Florida's hopes to win the first ever Latin Grammy Awards and internationally televised show

[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.360]
They would have paid huge dividends for the entertainment industry in Broward County appear to have all but faded

[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.060]
Boy the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences which we

[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:06.920]
Wish puts on the Grammys will announce today that CBS has been selected and televised the show in September that decision

[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.920]
There will be an out in Los Angeles is telling because the announcement is usually made in the host city

[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.560]
They're gonna be in Los Angeles. They got plenty of Julio's out there right?

[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:22.520]
And do they care about alien in Los Angeles? No, no, do they care about performers from Cuba performing out there? No

[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:22.760]
No

[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:31.660]
It says the county owned facility the American Airlines arena the Mickey arena can't be used in date county because of a law and date

[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:36.420]
Barring the county from doing business with any group that includes representatives from Cuba

[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.900]
Grammy officials said they wouldn't organize the show in any city where Cuban musicians cannot participate

[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.680]
The National Car Yanta Center and Sunrise had emerged as an alternative

[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.400]
Particularly because attendees could have been shuttle to post Grammy parties in Miami Beach

[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.720]
Broward and Miami Beach offered generous incentives, but not enough to overcome

[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.700]
Days unwillingness to offset the cost of cultural programs

[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:04.160]
So once again the entire South Florida area suffers from the myopic hysteria of the county of those idiots who are running around going

[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.260]
Non stop to the detriment of all the rest of us pretty god damn annoying

[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.880]
5 6 7 0 5 60 let's get these phones smoking here this morning boys and girls

[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.040]
Because then about a couple of minutes here. I'm gonna have to start drinking my barium stuff man

[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:25.700]
It's gonna be delicious. What are you looking like that? There's only about what a gallon of this then I got to drink another one of three

[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.620]
And then another one when I get there and then they stick the iodine and the IV you know and they look all around it

[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.660]
I haven't seen that and

[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:36.580]
And by the way, it's only gonna cost me because I don't have medical insurance. I have hospitalization

[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:41.040]
I'm not an employee here, so I have no medical insurance and I can afford to pay for my prescriptions and stuff like that

[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.900]
It's only gonna cost four grand

[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.760]
For two x-rays today

[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.840]
How do you like that?

[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.320]
$1,000 freaking dollars for a couple of x-rays

[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.560]
You think it's gonna cost them four thousand dollars to do it? No, no

[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.160]
That's medical care in America for you boys and girls

[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.860]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.080]
Yes, sir. How you doing great? I was watching that at Channel 7 and then a rich anxious trying to cover up for

[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.760]
The boy saying that cover up his white ass. Yeah, I doubt it

[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.480]
But uh anyways, before you go to doctor today, I'm gonna say put on two gowns

[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.980]
Uh, they don't have to see your butt, you know, but when I'm back as well. Okay, great

[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:33.260]
Here's point and V. Tello. Hey, Neil, my first time calling. Yes, sir. You talking about the fat people earlier

[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:38.360]
The worst things we've done is be trapped in an elevator in an old person. It's a fan. Yeah

[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.600]
One day I got stuck in an elevator the elevator stops

[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.200]
Just cut off I had caught an elevator with an old person for about a half an hour

[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.120]
Man, it was like hell. I mean

[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:54.700]
It smelled anything worse in my life. Yeah, even the toe jam is bad enough to drive you out. Oh, yeah

[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.220]
Especially their breath is like taking like Bruce Lee

[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:03.360]
I mean, it's like the worst thing. Okay, don't do it again speaking of old people by the way. So yesterday I'm going home

[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.240]
And I feel which album getting off on pineapple off 595 and there's two lanes

[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.880]
Turn right there's one that's backed up forever and in the middle lane you can go straight or make a right

[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.340]
But there are two big signs there that say in the right hand over there right hand lane

[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:23.640]
It says turn on right on red allowed in this lane and when the middle lane it says no turn on right allowed in this lane

[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.300]
Which makes sense

[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.000]
Because it never is when you have a middle lane that you can make a right turn you can't do it on red

[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.580]
There's a big sign to tell you that

[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.200]
And I hear I'm sitting there. I'm first in line

[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.460]
And the people of the right of me are making the right turn because there's no oncoming traffic

[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:42.800]
And I would like to go but I'm not going to break the law there get a ticket because I'm impatient for 45 seconds and can't wait for the light to turn green

[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:51.240]
I hear a hawk behind me and I take a look and here's this old geezer in his wife in this big white some kind of Toyota back there

[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.040]
And I start getting very agitated. I rule the window down

[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.680]
I says you see the sign asshole it says no turn from this lane on red

[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.520]
And he opens up his way

[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.140]
And he starts talking to Horn again

[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.400]
So finally I made the turn even on a red light. I made the turn anyway

[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.580]
You didn't shoot him. He didn't pull out your gun. I was thinking about it

[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.000]
But the best news is that I have a mile up the road

[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.520]
He'd done your wife somebody else out. I'm looking at the review mirror

[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.460]
And he starts pulling over in the middle lane the only problem is there's somebody else there already

[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.200]
This man was 175 easy

[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.500]
And his wife she looked and looked to me like she must have died 20 years ago

[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.240]
He just had the body like like

[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:36.960]
Anthony Perkins

[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:42.420]
He just had the body hanging around just to keep him company because nobody it's kind of like a Josh Friedman thing

[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.700]
Nobody else would get near him

[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.760]
So we had a dead body sitting in the passenger seat. That's what she looked like

[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.800]
Like she belonged in a mortuary

[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:56.520]
And he's I hate to break the news to asshole but you should get off the road park it and throw it to keys

[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:57.740]
Walk

[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.940]
Get the walker out and get out of our face get off the road

[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:04.220]
It's people like you that are causing the rest of us to get killed you all disgusting

[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:05.860]
Slav you

[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.940]
Make it up a big no

[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.620]
Like this

[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.980]
Of course, could you read the sign? Probably couldn't even see the guy damn sign

[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.840]
Probably got a 20 year renewal in the mail from the state of Florida

[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.160]
How come none of these oh, I see here's a mobile and coconut creek hello

[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.040]
Hey Neil yes, sir. Let's talk about some important. Yes Tom Green

[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.640]
Have you seen the show lately? No, I don't think he's on anymore. I heard a rumor

[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.060]
Hey, we we dispel that rumor yesterday. Okay. I didn't didn't hear the show yet. There's another internet rumor

[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:45.120]
He didn't dress up as a popular debar mitzvah mtv hasn't canceled the show

[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.420]
He never stole a freight train and Tom Green is alive and well can't do it

[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.520]
And maybe the show is on hiatus or whatever, but there's no problem

[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.660]
Good I was oh god scared I just heard that today

[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:59.800]
And well you hear it because this is what happens with these internet rumors all but that some little geek starts this crap and right away

[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.640]
It's all over the internet and people are spreading the rumors and it's just another bunch of crap. Tell me that wouldn't have been funny

[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.420]
Yeah, it would have been pretty good. Well, you do it. Oh, thanks. No, thanks. Bye. Okay

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.360]

[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:32.240]

[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.800]
Did I take advantage of that opportunity? No, because I figured it's another good excuse to fast

That's gonna be my new diet. I'm just gonna fast. I'm gonna do a Mahatma Gandhi diet

Don't have to worry about carbs. Don't have to worry about calories. Huh? What's wrong with that?

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound it look come on. Let's go back to some doctored talk

[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:47.580]
Last week they looked at my rectum down my stomach and didn't find a guy named thing and to be honest with this

[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:52.400]
Sunday's I feel like it's all gone away and that other days it makes a comeback and then I got this cold sore that I think really

[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.960]
Had more to do with my chaplips from Vegas than anything else

[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:00.040]
It's called getting old and sick is what it's called. It's called being a walking wreck

[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.720]
I think there maybe it's just a QAM disease you think that might be it

[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.560]
Uh-huh because I felt pretty good yesterday and after one day back here all of a sudden I'm having a relapse

[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.740]
Well, maybe that was because of Josh Friedman

[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:15.320]
He could do it. He's the killer. That's what somebody told me. I don't want to mention any names on the ear

[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.020]
Here's a call from Jacksonville. Hello

[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.920]
Neil home of the jaguars who beat it off in 62 to 7 on Saturday. That's right baby. Yes sir. Nice going pal

[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.820]
Long time with sir for the offense to him and great job

[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.460]
Thank you very much. Give me sexual excitement to see that

[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.740]
I like to think I had a big part in that win. Mm-hmm, but I didn't

[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:39.560]
Me, you uh, I'm listening up in Jacksonville on the internet right and I gotta say I'm wasting my precious internet time on these callers

[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.600]
I vote for no calls

[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:48.060]
And I hope your rectum's okay. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. No, it's fine. I don't think there's anything wrong with my

[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:53.300]
rectum. My rectum's okay. Although I did one time have that bruise rectum. Remember that? Oh, that was bad

[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.780]
No, it's my guts that I'm worried about like but you know, it's uh all around here

[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:03.220]
But this thing moves around. It's here. It's there. It's all over the place and the doctors can they diagnose anything? No

[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:06.160]
Maybe for a million dollars they might diagnose something but I doubt it

[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:13.580]
They do blood tests. They look in your ear. They look in your rectum weird. They look all over the place and uh, and then of course the stool samples

[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:14.460]
I'll forget about that

[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.940]
Since I can't eat today. Why should the rest of you have an appetite? Let's talk about those stool samples

[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.540]
They were lovely. They were beautiful

[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.500]
Was there anything amiss in the blood sample? No, yeah stool samples. No. My stool was as

[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:30.300]
As pure as the fallen snow as ivory soap

[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:35.700]
Which is comforting to know if you fill up all those tubes and the ish mirrored on those things

[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:44.120]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and of course, this is your god. He works in mysterious ways. You do understand that. Don't you?

[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.040]
Uh-huh. This is the Lord

[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.180]
He's sending a message

[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.940]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal. Hello

[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:54.180]
Maybe I'll order. Okay, sir. Well, you're lying's really early and you have never been through this quick

[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:57.220]
I don't know. There's nothing going on today. She's the least

[00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.400]
Well, they're all in morning now. Don't you understand they can't they can't deal with reality

[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.820]
I got a couple things on my shits gears there first of all staying the doctor thing

[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.340]
I had a bad doctor kidney stones before. Yeah

[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.500]
They stick a tube in the front of you not in the back of you to go up and check around up in there

[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:18.180]
Right, I guess they call the catheter I think. Oh god. Whoa. They knock the stone out of the way so you can pee

[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:24.560]
Uh, let me tell you that's nothing. We're a little drinking the bearing. He is nothing compared to what you got to go through for that. Yeah

[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.780]
Um, like I said, I want to shit here. They just wrote through a

[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:33.440]
um, uh, how do you say it a non-caucasian neighborhood being politically correct? Yeah, cool neighborhood. Yeah

[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.880]
And uh gas places were about 10 to 12 cents a gallon higher

[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:43.020]
In those neighborhoods. Oh sure, and if you go into the stores there like the convenience stores

[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:46.120]
It'll be the same thing every item will be like 5 10 15% higher

[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:50.700]
Well, you know, just to show you what I'm talking about I had to stop you gas you know the bulb is scared of my life

[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.700]
I got in there. I thought I'm out and do this is all part of the new the governor's new

[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.820]
Gouge the coon program anyway go ahead

[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:01.340]
I went in and I bought one of those 20 ounce mountain dudes which of course is loaded with kittings which is the worst thing

[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.220]
I was you can have for kidney stones, but I did it anyway

[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:09.260]
Normally I pay 99 cents for those you know, I could dollar five with tax whatever it was a dollar and 27 cents

[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.040]
You know, yeah, and I'm not worried about the 27 cents. I don't give a crap about that

[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.580]
But it's just a simple matter of the fact that

[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.740]
Why is it that in these neighborhoods that are a little you know recessed to start with why they charge so much more

[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:27.720]
Like I said, it's good pushes rip off the a darky program a bro a loaf of bread was 225 in this place. You know

[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:27.940]
25

[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.180]
Wonder why those people are knocking off for convenience stores and gas stations

[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:39.500]
Absolutely unheard of here. Here is a pretend it's uh, you know, so they can feed their crack problem. Oh, it is right one more quick question

[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:44.040]
Yes, sir. I'm not gonna say the name of the gas station. I want to put anyone down, but you drive by and you see the

[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:52.040]
A gas station a big chain and at the dollar 41 you drive two blocks down the road the same brand gas station at the dollar 33

[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.720]
In the same neighborhood. How can they you know, you know, I got a

[00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:00.280]
Unless unless you want your kidney stones to come back stay out of the hood you got a body

[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:06.760]
Yeah, Governor Bush is instituted his new rip off the porch monkey program and it seems to be working very effectively

[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.160]
56705 sticky get the raster's out of here

[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.880]
I sure hope you had a chance to see that on channel seven

[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:19.380]
I was very very lucky see I watched seven in the morning because four now is got to that Brian Gumball thing

[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:23.440]
They have no local news anymore, which is a total waste and they got all these network shows on here

[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.120]
I want to see what's going on right here

[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.840]
I want to see all the good crap all the bodies and that stuff. Oh, and by the way, speaking of bodies

[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.180]
Do you see the thing all the TV shows were showing last night because they've got it that video

[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.740]
From when they abusted the swing clubs and they got the video

[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:42.740]
The surveillance video, which is very like he knows that no, somebody was telling me about that. Yeah, it's not a new bus

[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.620]
They just have the video from the old bus. That's what's right. Okay, but nevertheless

[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.840]
I mean there's some

[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.120]
Parts in their somewhere and they're showing it on there. I guess because it's hazy and whatever it makes it okay

[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:59.860]
I want to know who the female cop is that got naked as part of the undercover rock. Oh, she's got a lot over her head

[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.160]

[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.300]

Hurry, I'm in a mouth through the mouth whatever that stuff is with the straw and it was delicious

[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.020]
man

[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.940]
Here's the mobile in Hollywood hello

[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.760]
Hey, now how you doing okay? I wanted to call about why people are coming to the

[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.080]
Panther and the

[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:25.340]
Heat game yes, sir and I believe it's because they priced them out of the market is that it it costs too much yeah

[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.680]
The average for working person just can't afford to go anymore

[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.500]
With all the cock parking and the ticket prices and the

[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.720]
Well, let me let me ask you this question

[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.640]
I mean the only raise the prices a very small amount this year and how come last year

[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.140]
I know it was the novelty of a new building

[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.460]
How come we had so many sellouts last year game after game after game and a lot of games there was

[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.740]
17 18,000 and this year is like death Valley days

[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.280]
Well, you make a good point. I don't know the answer to that one

[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:55.000]
It just seems to me that in addition to which the thing I find bizarre is that last year the team really was pretty boring

[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.460]
And had a very bad year mr. Playoffs again and this year we got to one of the two hottest teams that league going right now and

[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.340]
Nobody gives a crap. Yeah, well, you know, you know how the fans around here either they're front running their

[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:07.220]
You know, come on the bandwagon

[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:13.780]
They can't handle success you know for the life of me the heat thing just amazes me because at least the Panthers are even on a bad night

[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.720]
You know doesn't look that bad in there, but watching that thing last night

[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:23.400]
I bet you there weren't half the seats filled even at the height of the crowd or whatever it was there were half of the seats were empty

[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:28.240]
Well, who wants to go to the balls if you can't see Michael and Scotty and all the rings, you know

[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:33.220]
Yeah, but that's a pretty sad commentary that you know people picking shoes what teams they want to go to see instead of

[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:38.520]
Going to see the home team. You know how to stand here. There's more New York fans down here than there are many fans. Yeah

[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.000]
Also, I

[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.700]
Well, we can count on the 50 Washington cast fans you want up tonight

[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:50.740]
For sure get out to sympathize with your your procedure this afternoon. Yeah, I had a similar thing where you have to drink a gallon of

[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.580]
Of stuff to flush out right go in and they put the little tube in the other end and pump you fall and take a picture

[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.520]
No fun. Oh, so they're gonna they're gonna put a tube in my

[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:04.920]
Backdome and pump a floor or that stuff. I'm not sure because you're you're drinking stuff

[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.420]
You're drinking the barium sulfate see when I had it

[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:10.400]
I had to drink the there was like it was like a

[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.940]
Laxitive solution. Yeah, I don't think they do that anymore. They completely clean me out

[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.460]
Well, this is a couple of years ago, and you know technology

[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:21.920]
Yeah, they're amazing where they stick it now. They're always stick it away the torture you know

[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:27.400]
Those doctors, you know, they love to watch you squirm. Well, I'm gonna try to hold it in the save it for the high-end game

[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.300]
And just to have him give you something nice, you know the little valium

[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.580]
Oh, they don't they don't this is just an x-ray. They don't the knock you up for this

[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:42.700]
Yeah, well, hopefully not then because the one that I had boy, I tell you what it was not fun. Okay

[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:48.360]
All right, sir, looking forward to it. Thanks a lot pal. Okay, there sounds like some encouragement there, huh? It's gonna be bad

[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:54.740]
It's gonna be bad for a cat scan. I had a cat scan in my brain just like Greg Reed did although at least they fun one in my head

[00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.180]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line

[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:04.420]
Here's homestead. Hello. Good morning, sir. How are you okay? All right a couple of things one

[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:08.420]
My wife for she works in the medical field. She heard you mentioned your MRI and the cost

[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.020]
Um, if you don't have insurance don't even hesitate to ask for a discount

[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:20.180]
Because these HMOs have driven the to ask for a discount or based on what my good looks or because you're paying cash

[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:25.620]
Yeah, if if they build a insurance company or an HMO they're gonna collect maybe 1500 bucks

[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:29.040]
Top right out of four thousand. Yes

[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.980]
If that so why are they soaking me for a grant? It's because they can't one, huh? Because they can't because I got a big

[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:38.920]
Spender in a big shot. Well, no because if you're willing to pay it they're willing to charge it

[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:42.680]
I see see the Medicare rates the way they're set is they say they'll pay 50%

[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.000]
up to

[00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.500]
Save $1300 of any procedure so they build it at five six eight ten thousand dollars. They still get 1300

[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:54.700]
Oh, that's a great scan and it's the federal government now

[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:59.360]
That's when they set it up and the only HMOs are following. I would it would seem to me since I got 50 different doctors going now

[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.600]
The one of my doctors would have arranged since he arranged for this thing to be done there in the hospital in Coral Springs

[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:09.300]
He would have arranged uh for you know since he knows I have no insurance and I'm paying cash even a big shooter like me

[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.360]
He would have saved me some money. Why would you do that?

[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.760]
Yeah, that's a good point. He wanted to care. There are two other things real quick

[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:15.680]
Hank

[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.480]
Hank redeemed himself yesterday on one he trashed thoroughly trashed one of the

[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.820]
X coaches of one of the Miami teams

[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.480]
And accused him of ruining the team and all this other stuff

[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.700]
What the X coaches? Yeah, the big X coach

[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:34.080]
Not Jimmy. Yeah, I'm going to go that's not what I heard when I was driving home yesterday

[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.220]
He was he was falling over one of the great three years we had it on a personal level

[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.240]
I like going out and getting a beer and he was great. He was a lot of fun

[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.120]
I didn't hear that one and I thought to myself that's all fine personal

[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.960]
But my comments are business. I don't care about what the guys like personally is a business

[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.760]
He accused him of personally ruining the offensive team really yeah nice going airhunter

[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.440]
On sardis game must do how to take it with yes sir on sardis game

[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.500]
I couldn't stand the listening to channel four so we had the TV on and we put on

[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.440]
On the radio. Yeah, Mandage is the best he is man

[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.800]
You know listen to the tape of that game just to get the manage out of it

[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:12.620]
You could do a CD on drops of his I agree the crappy pulled on it. Okay. All right, man. Thanks for the good news

[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:16.600]
Okay, I'm going in there. I want a discount. Okay. I want a big discount

[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:22.100]
In hospitals afternoon or I may be a protest. I may spit out the crap. I may just squat right there and

[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.240]
dump it all out on the lobby

[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:32.540]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. This is starting to sound to me like a little bit more than I would bargain for

[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.720]
You know what I'm saying? I thought would like a

[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:45.540]
A what do they call it the cow cat scan and they have abdominal cancer you drink this stuff and it goes into your kishkis and then they put you under the thing because I've been in that thing and they take a look and that's it

[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:52.720]
And evidently no they have one more excuse to screw it around with your acto. Yeah, always got some excuse to stick their nose in there

[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.460]
Or whatever they can here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey Neil

[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.980]
The adkins died. I went out about three years ago. I lost 40 pounds. Yes

[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:07.480]
And I've heard you since then say how it stopped working for you. Yeah

[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:16.980]
Well, I gained about 10 pounds over the holidays and it stopped working for me too. So does the doctor changing about that in his book that phenomena?

[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.560]
That it stops working? Yeah, that it just

[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.020]
He claims that you can't go through plaque toes. You know, you just have to keep with it and it'll kick in again

[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.840]
I don't know. It just does nothing for me

[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.800]
I can't do anything since the first of the year. I've been trying to lose the 10 pounds and I've done a thing

[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.480]
I've been behaving myself real good. Yeah

[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:39.000]
All right, see you at the game and I would prefer a couple of these tests. I'm having you'll lose weight like crazy

[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.860]
No, thanks. Okay. See you tonight. I'll be there tonight. I'll be the one gushing out there

[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.580]
Burium all over the place

[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.000]
Five six and fact that's what somebody said to me yesterday if you see Josh Freeman burium

[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:56.200]
five six seven oh five sixty pounds five sixty on the AT&T wireless line

[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.420]
eight seven seven seven eight five sixty three forty five got a real

[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.720]
lackluster or response here today. I'll tell you

[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.900]
really lackluster weak

[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.940]
I didn't price this all out this time got more guided excuses than Carter's got pills

[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.700]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello

[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:21.900]
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. I just have a comment to say if any heat player is listening to this show. Yes

[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:27.100]
I am so glad that we have a real team in the fanters to watch

[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:33.780]
This is incredible. We have no team. They all do the same. I'm just expecting the panthers to do the same

[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.180]
Anyone and I hope they don't go. What does that what does that mean?

[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:42.940]
I mean they all do the same. I don't understand. They are they're all up at the top at one point and then booth

[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:49.940]
They go back down. Yeah. I don't see the panthers going back down anywhere. I hope not I hope not

[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:55.740]
I mean that's a hot team to watch right now. I really enjoy them right well. Hope see you again tonight. Okay. I'll be there

[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:58.360]
I'll be there. I'll be there. They want to bring it on the stretcher

[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:03.020]
5 6 7 0 5 60 so I think the message I'm getting here is that you have to win

[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.500]
Or if you really start sticking the joint out we don't want to come and see you

[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:11.720]
Is that the message we're getting? I kind of think so especially at those prices maybe I don't I don't know

[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.620]
I have a tough time buying it

[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:20.840]
I mean the prices are steep and the food is overpriced and it stinks like crap that food in there

[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.960]
But this like I said yesterday don't buy the food

[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:32.640]
But how much better of a product how much more excitement can you ask them what's going on there in a macarena and they still just it's basically predictable it's the same

[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:40.580]
miserable turnout night after night after night. Let me say it again the worst of the six division leaders in a whole league and in the bottom half of the entire league

[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.880]
This poor I think is the expression I'd be looking forward to describe it

[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:51.380]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I like it. Okay. I guess

[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:56.260]
What a good hockey fan is my daughter married a Canadian a number of years ago outside Toronto

[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.860]
I spoke to my nine-year-old grandson right after Christmas week what you do

[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.760]
I went with daddy to Long Island by call we watched Toronto

[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.840]
Islanders. I couldn't understand it if the talk is when I got my daughter in the fall

[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:13.780]
What is this you can't get tickets to the Toronto game to the whatever the make of whatever the stadium is called of your reader is called rather

[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:18.900]
I think that really shows the fan he drove to Long Island to watch with Toronto Maple Leafs. Yeah

[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:26.060]
And it's just the idea you'll never find anyone here even traveling to Tampa probably to watch the fan they won't travel from Kendall to sunrise to

[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.080]
That's right about driving to the Long Islander Toronto

[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:35.480]
Yeah, they did they spent some nights or whatever there but let me if you that possible they can get tickets for the

[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.480]
To Toronto games. No, but it was your Santa was in Long Island the islanders don't draw flies

[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.360]
No, no, no, no, I think it goes to Toronto. They have standing remoling every home games

[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:51.680]
Yeah, I can't believe it the capacity the air Canada Center's 18,800 every game you'll see the attendance 18

[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:58.120]
9.50 9.20 there's standing remoling every well that speaks good for a good hockey town for a real city that's correct

[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:02.960]
I know okay good talking to you see you there see a T.O. In fact wasn't that Toronto this past weekend

[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.680]
It looked awfully much like Vegas, but maybe was that weather

[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.020]
27 past 11 to 560 WQM

[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.740]
Ed Cap will know the score

[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:16.900]
30 and some of last game in weeknight only on sports radio 5.50

[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.300]
A.M Florida sucks

[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:27.360]
Hey four years the Italian people have been known for a few things goblin your shoes making threatening phone calls when you're

[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.480]
Bounce a check in a family restaurant and carving little puppets that come alive

[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.700]
Trilling in a little boy singing air goddle strings on me

[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:41.420]
But recently they've discovered a secret to nice hard crunchies for daddy when you boil ordinary pasta

[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:47.600]
It gets off the mushy but barilla always cooks up al dente which is Italian for bells

[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.680]
Technically it's some kind of term. I don't know

[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:57.380]
But if your pasta is not al dente then it's not barilla 40 years. I've been eroaling my own pasta

[01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:02.300]
But now with the advent of barilla by grandchildren don't even come over anymore

[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:08.400]
A tradition passed down from generations to generations made of the finest shut up your face

[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.180]
When I find it the stool gets a ton of part of my family

[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:19.000]
I'll make a fool cause of my cousin schoengele and mr. Barilla or whatever his name is will bite himself in the tongue of a lick

[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.800]
That's for all pasta the choice of I

[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.180]
Did you bury love?

[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.880]
It's love the 32 at 560 WQM. Here's a fact from unsigned but nevertheless

[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.980]
I'm a huge hockey fan that I that hates going to the games because of the atmosphere when you're surrounded by people who think

[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:41.280]
interference means go block off an intersection and you have to listen to people who know nothing about hockey going

[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.500]
Bop bop bop bop bop very well written by the way sir. It is less enjoyable

[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:49.480]
I'd rather watch games than my mini dish or in another city while I'm traveling at least when I'm watching my hockey

[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.920]
Packaged at home some idiot won't spill a six dollar beer on me while lunging for a five dollar t-shirt

[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.840]
Very good points there. Signed a loyal ranger span with 49 years of support to go before their next cup

[01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.860]
And you're probably right about that

[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.160]
Yeah, there are a lot of reasons uh to stay away

[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:07.840]
And I'm annoyed by the assholes that stand up in front of you and hold their kids up under shoulders

[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.100]
And do everything and then the drunk who was sitting there

[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.200]
Cross uh by the aisle the other night

[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:15.240]
And then the two jerks that were sitting behind me

[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.960]
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop as loud as they could talking about nothing that had to do with what was going on there

[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.820]
So maybe it's just that no matter what they do

[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:29.740]
I just uh unless it's the playoffs unless it's some special special uh species hyped event

[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:33.420]
I just don't think you're gonna get all that many more people. I think what you see is what you got

[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:40.160]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, new. Yes, sir. What times are your tests? What time? Yes five

[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:44.820]
Uh, well, you know you're gonna be on the crap for a bar or afterwards. I'm gonna save it for the game

[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.240]
I think

[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.440]
I really they give you that uh and they give it to you in the rectum

[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.040]
Very much so sir. Wow, and you're gonna have to hold it for about 45 minutes. No. Yes, sir

[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.880]
What do you mean hold it for 45 minutes?

[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.920]
They well they need a liquid in there while I take the pictures. Well, how do you do that? Oh you squeeze your cheeks as far as you can

[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.500]
Oh my god, well, I always do that. Good luck. Okay. Thanks

[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:08.860]
Oh, man

[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:16.040]
This sounds like it's gonna be a lot more fun than I bargained for. I thought it was just gonna be a quick uh in and out, you know, so to speak

[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:17.460]
Instead

[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.080]
It's gonna be more like that

[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:28.440]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. I don't think they're really looking for anything at all when you do these tests

[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.380]
They're just having fun to poking around with your body

[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.280]
Here's Davy. Hello

[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:40.280]
Yes, sir. Listen to you for 15 years. I love your show. You're the best. Yes, I am. I'm calling from Davy and I was while I was on hold

[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:40.780]
I was thinking

[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:48.000]
My god, what are we gonna do when somebody actually that lives in Davy called Danny calls name Danny calls from Davy

[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.940]
Danny from Davy and then what I talk about Danny and Davy and how about Danny and Denny's

[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:57.580]
Here you go. I've heard you before. Listen about talk about Godfather's pizza

[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:01.040]
And I saw one was opening up now the head by the head station

[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:07.220]
We keep hearing all the threats on Davy wrote extension. I believe it just out to 595 right? Yeah. Is it open yet?

[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.920]
Uh, I don't think so. Yeah, because I figured just after I squish out my

[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.460]
Spirit of minimum because I want to have been able to eat all they would be great to make a quick pit stop at the odd father's perfect

[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.920]
Yeah, I'm thinking of to keep your cheeks

[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.560]
Later than a frog's ass in water. It's incredible

[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:28.620]
Unbelievable right here. I was anticipating a piece of cake so to speak and it sounds to me like it's gonna be worse than last week when at least they put you out

[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:33.540]
Piece of cake sounds like more like icing right frosting. There you go. Okay. Thanks

[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:40.480]
65,000 open lines on the board here today. They're very very I don't know what it is if I get the games

[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:46.340]
I'm still shocked at that thing with a he came last night anybody see that thing was anybody there? No

[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.020]
probably not

[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.440]
Nobody there. I mean nothing

[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.980]
And to think of all the expense all the money that's wasted building his goddamn arena so that a rich guy can get richer

[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:02.440]
So we can have more sky boxes and more club seats and soak the corporations all that big money so they can get that's all

[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.060]
That's all about

[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:09.400]
The rest of the people to them. That's what that's the message and they're kind of like back I guess

[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:15.540]
Although somebody bought all those tickets and that's another thing if everybody's so upset about the guy damn price tag of the tickets

[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.640]
How come they're selling all those tickets and nobody is showing up at those games?

[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.580]
Maybe they're afraid they're gonna go there to the new a Mickey arena and somebody's gonna be outside

[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:25.660]
Like that

[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:32.420]
Here's Coral Springs. Hello. Let me tell you something about that Barry and Emma. Yeah, be sure you put a pile in the seating event

[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:38.580]
Yeah, oh my god. It's unbelievable. When in doubt it seats you're right out. Oh, if you're not careful. You'll have radioactive shorts

[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:44.320]
And whatever you do don't melt because that stream can flow both ways

[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.620]
It'll make you great all right

[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.900]
As far as the M.I. Go's you know most of these

[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:55.700]
Hospitals lease these things from G or Siemens or Toshiba and they get big money for it

[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.960]
And they're trying to get as much money as they can to meet their monthly nut on those things. I see

[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.820]
So if you're in a trailer if the M.I. is on the trailer

[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:08.960]
They'll usually deal if they fixed the building to put it in they usually try to get as much as they can nice

[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.860]
Well, yeah fun. Okay. Thanks. So the rest of you anybody ever has one of these sets

[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:19.960]
You owe me a debt of gratitude because I'm going to help pay a nice truck out of my own pocket evidently is what it sounds like as a sucker is born every minute

[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:29.580]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 t level having the overhead there to just vanishes in my imagination just to just uh like died

Is somebody potsking around with the levels and the overhead the other studio and how come everything that goes on in here is like

[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.120]
We're dependent on somebody screwing around on the other room over there. We're like stepchildren in here

[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:49.060]
Huh nothing happened to just kind of like dying on its own. Okay. Well, I got a cra- oh geez

[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.420]
Here's Cooper City hello

What just happened are we out of business again here with this studio

[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.600]
Cooper City's gone. Let's try Hollywood. Hello

[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:09.100]
Good morning. Yes, sir last week the Kansas legislature passed the bill banning

[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:17.900]
Evolution in taught in school only creation is a movie caught by the vote was passed by a 16-volt majority. Yeah

[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.220]
Thank God for the ACLU. They're taking them to the Supreme Court

[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.720]
Because the state cannot interfere with what has been taught the school

[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.800]
Stayed investigating Bible history courses in 14 districts. They got from page 13 B in the heraldous morning right here in Florida

[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:38.420]
Well, I'll tell you these born against a crazy. That's what we're curious

[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:43.860]
Yes, absolutely correct sir. I would put them on an island and then sink the island. Okay

[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:49.520]
Have a nice back to your fantasy island sounds good to me two schools in Mary and levy counties in an exam on

[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:56.200]
One Corinthians ask why is it hard for a non-Christian to understand things about God a lesson on John eight used in levy county

[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.100]
Lee V. County

[01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:59.180]
Levy sounds Jewish. Oh

[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:06.600]
Who according to Jesus is the father of the Jews and the answer the devil and they're teaching that in the schools in Florida. How do you like that?

[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:10.600]
Hey, get those smokes out of here coming at the rest. Okay

We're cheap because you are

[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:12.240]
60 till noon club was just in here for a second. I said what's wrong with that Josh Friedman? He said he's an asshole. Oh, that explains it

[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.320]
That's what he said

[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T line. Are we gonna get some responsibility or what? Oh, what is it?

[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.560]
It's the same thing with the ball games that they're everybody must be gone. Is that what the deal is?

[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.780]
Everybody's gotta be out of town

[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.480]
Last time I checked that big holiday was over with I don't get it

[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:35.860]
Feel like I'm doing a show in a vacuum here today and all I'm hearing about is oh you better hold your cheeks real tight because it's

[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.360]
Squirt's quirk I'm a pouring out of there and your corvette is gonna be like drowning in burium

[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:45.540]
I don't think so. I think the reason they have you drink all this stuff now is in lieu of what they used to call the

[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.660]
rectum barrier minima in lieu of isn't it? I hope

[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:56.620]
Because I for I just can't envision myself laying there on a damn thing for 45 minutes squeezing my cheeks real tight so we don't come like pouring out

[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.760]
Doesn't sound like my idea of a really great time

[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:07.360]
Here's Miami hello. Yeah, Neil. How are you today? Okay, sir? Yeah, it sounds like maybe you're just gonna go through an upper GI study

[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:07.720]
No

[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.740]
abdominal and uh, it's not upper GI. It's an abdominal cat scan and a pelvic

[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.200]
Oh, okay, well in any case so that's not the reason I call it anyway on back on the third

[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:23.260]
Charles Schultz announced his retirement, but evidently you must have done a Jimmy Johnson because

[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:29.160]
I hadn't looked at the comics until yesterday and there's peanuts in there again. Yeah, but they're probably old ones are redone

[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:34.040]
Oh, it's got the dates the dates on it are for the 18th and the 19th how's that possible?

[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:38.220]
I don't know you can pull the Jimmy Johnson somebody but they they had a big to do about it

[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:43.980]
I know that it was ever gonna be seen and everybody better go out and buy 20 copies of the paper. I got a copy here

[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:48.100]
I saved it for you right now. I'm you got scan man. I'm wondering how much

[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.180]
How many more I missed you know, because they probably millions of Americans have got that big sous-vita

[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:56.600]
Reditioning they might as well as shop cannon. Yeah, because there's there's either the ones from yet today

[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.200]
And today I don't know if there's been ones before that or not. Why he wouldn't that happens. I know really it's

[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.000]
Probably they want that. That's something to do with it evidently or we ain't okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks for your bad news

[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.480]
Thank you five six seven oh five sixty come on. Let's all get sick together

[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.800]
Intrusive procedures which they love doing

[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.740]
See one thing if you've got like a viral infection

[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.540]
Doctors that have no idea what that is because they don't know how to diagnose it

[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.980]
They have no way of tracing it doesn't show up in your blood test

[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:31.260]
It doesn't show up in your rectum your stomach or anything and maybe that's what this is and maybe it's not

[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.780]
But it's your been lingering malingering for a hell of a long time

[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.960]
Here's a mobile in four-letteredale. Hello. Yeah, hello mill. Yes, sir

[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.900]
Yeah, I've had the same problem with the actions that you do it keeps my sugar down, but I don't lose any weight

[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:49.240]
But maybe I can maybe I can give you some information that might

[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.260]
help you the

[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:58.380]
Those psyllium laxatives that you take and I mean that I was taking also are loaded with cards really all the ones all the ones

[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.880]
I've ever checked the regular metamusel has 11

[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:02.600]
grams of carbohydrate

[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.340]
I never took metamusel well

[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:10.620]
All of them do I mean all the psyllium that I've ever checked because it's it's carbohydrate basically

[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.280]
Uh

[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.600]
Uh, it came down to a choice with me between being able to go the bathroom good and lose weight

[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:21.540]
And to tell you the truth I would rather go to the bathroom. Yeah, well me too when it's out

[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:27.700]
It rather empty it out one thing you can do try and get down to the minimum of it and then don't don't

[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.260]
Take in any other carbs other than that and it does work still

[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:35.500]
But it's much slower because of the psyllium right okay

[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.140]
All right, thanks

[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:41.520]

Okay, you want to lose some real weight. I'm not talking about getting prepping for x-ray

[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.740]

[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.320]
If you were on a straight diet of this believe you me you wouldn't be

[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:05.020]
Inviving too much if you catch my drip you'd be like a little sip here little sip there. No thanks. I'll pass. I'll skip this meal. Thank you

[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:26.460]
That's what happens to you start following a part. It's called being a dottering old man

[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.680]
Which is perfect for living in Florida

[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.860]

Dispainment that kind of hurt the tail end of

Even the government the government of me. The government made about get those cool those two coolances out of here

Or was he talking to the new that he tried to cover is Lily White as he called channel 70 said

[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.700]
I was talking about the media people not those two cool. I mean those two black guys in there

[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:06.080]
And we all know what he was talking about right because he said get those two

Boy, he really is some uh and when you look at him, he's got that that hostile that just like his brother too by the way

[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:39.400]
Shortfused ill tempered ill prepared for any guy named job in public service with absolutely no qualification whatsoever

[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:45.320]
Other than his name is bush and we have especially the men in this country with this morbid obsession with bush

[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:46.800]
Not this kid

[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:52.020]
In fact, I'm surprised I didn't vote for Nixon because his name was

[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:58.760]
Here's the mobile in Washington. Hello. Hey, Mio. How you doing? Good listen. I've been a long time listener

They're trying to make all their money back, but I'm telling you this beautiful. So must see I did a little punch in there

[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.460]
But you're absolutely right. It is beautiful

[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:05.640]
Did you get a chance to go in any of those like ballrooms or anything like that in there?

[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.140]
There's just absolutely unbelievable

We're supposed to handle years and you know, it was kind of born in New Year's

[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:14.980]
I was kind of speaking to hotel hopping and everything trying to get in the Paris. Yeah, I don't see that

[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.880]
Unbelievable. It looks like you know

[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.140]
I was so bad. I run into the bathroom

[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.700]
Didn't on the pot, but I can't do that until I bend over and puke in at first

[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:56.660]
Really? Yeah, and then just as I'm done puke and I got to get up there and you know take a crap

[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:02.140]
And it was the worst feeling I ever had I will I didn't eat anything for the rest of the night

[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.480]
I wake up at 11 puke again

[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.000]
And then I'm in bed for the whole day and I haven't eaten in three days

[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.040]
I can't believe it great

[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.620]
It's going it's going to run on the best part of it is that the no doctor's don't can't diagnose anything

[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:20.440]
I'm not even going to go to the hospital if I don't have ten thousand dollars to spend today

[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:24.280]
No, what's wrong with me? That's right and if I get a cold sore, I'm going to stop listening. Okay

[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:31.680]
Oh, yeah, you better turn it. Well, that's why they're all gone today. They heard about the cold sore. They can say uh-oh

[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.260]
That's your pee problem

[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:37.520]
Yeah, you can't catch that right through the speaker to your radio. Do you know that? Uh-huh sure

[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:49.680]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line the State Department of Education is investigating Bible history courses offered as an elective in 14 of Florida 67 school districts

[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.520]
Those districts none in South Florida. Thank God

[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.460]
Serve roughly one fifth of Florida students

[01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:03.440]
The courses authorized under the state law passed in 1996 came under fire last week when people for the American way charged at some school districts

[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.160]
Have been violating the US Constitution by teaching the Bible from a religious perspective including some of the quotes that I just gave you

[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:16.140]
Artitle boom Southern area director for the anti-deformation league, you know, Artitle boom. He's an asshole. Yeah

Said Tuesday that such materials are wholly inappropriate in a public school setting

[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:25.300]
These statements if they're in the material might certainly be the bias for bigotry he said

[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:32.540]
Statements like that the lesson on John 8 who according to Jesus is the father of the Jews the devil

[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:34.700]
How do you like that?

[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:45.740]
Here's West Palm Beach hello. Yeah, I'm glad that you've finally seen the light on that to a Confederate flag issue. Yeah, why is it okay?

[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:50.180]

[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:07.980]
Don't be feeding me a song and an answer about that goddamn rebel flag okay because it stands for one thing slavery

[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:12.540]
segregation racism bigotry like I said it stands for a whole bunch of things

[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.480]

12.1.5.50 WQM cheating hearts make a good excuse for a business

[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:46.040]
Here's a guy's name is John Watson

[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.480]
Says he has no plans to cheat on his spouse

[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.720]
But he knows there are plenty of air-run husbands and wives who do so we started a business called ace alibi

[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:59.080]
And the the perfect the thrust of his whole business is he makes up alibis for people who cheat on their spouse

[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.460]
And evidently he's making a fortune doing it. Uh-huh

[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:06.860]
The fee is 25 bucks and up depending on the extravagance of the tailor made fib

[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.360]
It's a say you want to me to love her for the weekend

[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.760]
But don't want the spouse to get suspicious

[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.820]
Ace alibi will mail you a phony invitation to a business or sporting event

[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.980]
Giving you a valid reason for being away from home

[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.240]
Cilling doesn't have any carbohydrates in it how to help could it it just fiber

[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:43.920]

I'm closing things out. I'm not looking to expand at this point. I'm closing the chapters

[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:12.880]
I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, we'll get that to the fall to you and just want to thank you again, sir

[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.500]
Okay, thanks you take care say I did the beastly

[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:15.780]
Okay

[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:20.700]
Okay, we got two calls left in the board. I guess that's gonna be it and then we'll just play a bunch of stuff

[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.240]
Because I gotta and I'd be honest drinking that stuff wasn't all that bad. It didn't taste good

[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.740]
But you see if it's your straw and you just grin and bear it that's all

[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:34.280]
Well, I can't really get a definitive answer on what the procedure is because all these other people that are calling

[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.820]
Head stuff done two three five years ago. There's no way in the world

[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:42.240]
That they're gonna have you drink all that stuff and then stick a whole bunch of burium in your rectum

[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:42.640]
are they

[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:47.360]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T work

[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.540]
Not that I'm all concerned about having it up in there

[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:52.720]
I'm just concerned about having a squeeze and keep it in there for 45 minutes

[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:58.220]
I don't think that's a lot of sounds like a fun hour to me and then go to the hockey game. Am I going depends?

[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:01.660]
You're wearing depends. Yeah, that's what I'm saying

[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.920]
That's about the only way I think I dare go anywhere is within fact

[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.060]
I'm gonna have to an Allison come by and hold my hand and bring me some depends

[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:14.620]
Preparing for a future life in San Florida. Here's a mobile in four-later Dale. Hello

[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.300]
Yeah, Neil are gonna about a week. Yes, sir

[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:23.740]
I'm calling about your your comments regarding I know new fans doctor game. Yeah. Yeah, I ask you ball games

[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:29.280]
I've been I'm a season ticket holder. I've been a couple of games and I brought some folks with me who haven't been to games

[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:32.240]
They're becoming fans. I'm noticing new people there that haven't seen before

[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:34.520]
So I think it's catching on

[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:38.360]
Well, what do you mean it's catching on we've had the team here for seven years. It's not like it is

[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.980]
We just started. Oh, I know

[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:44.440]
I mean the fact that the team's doing so well now people are starting to realize it and then get on the bandwagon as you head

[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:47.720]
I don't think so they got 5,500 on sole tickets for tonight's game

[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:49.100]
They go one five games in a row

[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:54.720]
There are a hundred points ahead of the caps in a division. They're either kicking ass and they got 5,500 and that's terrible

[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:55.360]
It's pathetic

[01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:01.080]
You may be right. I was down the river walk the other day. I ran to Trevor kid and nobody else down there knew who he was right

[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:01.640]
That's right

[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.740]
I'm just entirely possible. There's a little buzz going on

[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:09.120]
I think I'd like to see if I'm around any other reason why I call the point system

[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:15.820]
Is it kind of deceiving because you have a number of games played versus the points don't really match up

[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:18.220]
Yeah, because I got to talk to guys right yeah

[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:22.180]
I always do the ticket chocolate and I do some number crunching which is a pain to ask

[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:25.680]
You come up with the number of games played versus the points. Give you an average

[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.620]
Is there any column and any newspaper that has a better perspective like that?

[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:31.960]
You know, I don't understand what you mean

[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.680]
What difference does it make with the averages?

[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:36.120]
Why don't you just look at the total points that's right there in the standing?

[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:41.300]
Yeah, we have total points for some teams have played more games than others. It's deceiving. Yeah

[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:45.520]
So you actually have to look at the number of games played and the points to actually get out there

[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.880]
Well, don't worry. Don't worry about all like the games in hand and all of that

[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:52.200]
I mean, you know you get your points as you play the games and then you worry about letting everybody else catch up

[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:56.340]
Don't worry about those things. All right. Well go campers tonight. Okay. I'll even hurt you

[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:00.220]
There's a guy he's gonna be there. He's not pretty excited or what huh?

[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:08.980]
It's not excited. No five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line out of town. It's eight seven seven seven eight five sixty three forty five

[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.840]
Here's a mobile and West Palm Beach hello

[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:21.620]
Maybe I don't okay. Listen to how one of those barrier minima done has done a let me tell you it's not fun. Yeah

[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:23.820]
They put you on this table. They just about

[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:26.080]
Move you around like some kind of

[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:32.800]
Lender or something and when you've got to go to the bathroom. Let me tell you you're crapping chalk for about a week for a week, huh?

[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:33.340]
Yeah

[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:37.980]
Well, at least you can always find a trailer where you've been anyway. Oh man. It's embarrassing

[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:41.560]
But anyway, I'm gonna use me out of the stadium to that football scene is over

[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:44.140]
Yeah, Henry can use me out there for the marlins

[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.060]
With those baselines going there you go

[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:52.480]
Listen also, um, I think about hockey. I've noticed I've been a hockey fan for a while now

[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.000]
And I noticed now in the game that they don't play that much along the boards like they used to

[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.760]
In the area use them while you think that is they don't want

[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.580]
You don't play on the board as much as they use them. What does that mean? I don't know what does it?

[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:11.540]
I have no idea like like Dave Maloney are of the ranges five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless

[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.900]
eight seven seven seven eight five

[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:18.040]
sixty three forty five. Did he say baloney here's some rise hello

[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:23.440]
Yeah, whatever happens to like us and the other guy are till I'm on nine four to have him here many more

[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:25.840]
I just I mean I'm trying to

[01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:30.140]
Probably because they're not on there anymore. Yeah, but you know, no, you don't know what they are right now or

[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:35.560]
Like this is the dump this show. Yeah, he's not on it. He had a minus. He owed points. He's on the air anymore

[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:39.600]
There were boys. I beg your pardon? I'm on the air anymore. Not not not in this market

[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.720]
Uh, oh, I might like a spare in our till but our till wasn't really that good. I don't think our till

[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:51.320]
He was all right, but he wasn't as good as you mean ed till yeah, I tell rope. All right. I gotta go. Oh, uh-huh. Yeah, our till

[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:53.520]
Oh

[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:55.960]
Good god almighty

[01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:02.700]
That's like the guy yesterday told me about Tim Simpson the great defenseman for the Panthers. Anybody know who that is? No, no

[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:07.380]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five oh you sure are critical. Yeah, well

[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:11.800]
I mean generally speaking if you're gonna come on a radio with a 20 or 30 people listening

[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:16.020]
It would be a good idea if you had some idea what you were talking about all the white and how should you be?

[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.840]
I mean the people on this station a lot of them haven't got any idea what they're talking about

[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.380]
Well, you know Danny oh

[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.200]
God mighty

[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:28.740]
Of course you got to give Joe a little slack because I took a leak next to Joe Rose this morning

[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:32.420]
Now I know what they're calling the little dog, but nevertheless he's there been also sick

[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.540]
Sicker and hell he was holding his head up against the wall saying been sick as a dog for days sick as a little dog

[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:43.020]
Everybody is sick and these doctors pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop can they find anything? Oh no

[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:48.640]
They just keep running you around and giving you gigantic bills and making you go through excruciating tests

[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:56.040]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line here's a lady in sunrise hello

[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:59.080]
Hello, yes, ma'am. Oh

[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.280]
I was freaking back and forth of it work

[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:03.380]
I

[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:08.500]
You were getting a bearing a man ever I didn't say a burium and myself

[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:13.020]
I said what I'm having is a cat scan and abdominal and

[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:18.640]
pelvic cat scan oh, okay, I'm drinking all this stuff now these people are all calling me up

[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:23.080]
Probably trying to get me to pee in my pants they're all calling me and telling me that they're gonna put all this burium in my

[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:26.680]
Bracto, I'm gonna have to hold it for 45 minutes. Is that correct?

[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:31.500]
Well, I haven't put it haven't had to put it in that way. I've had it done

[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:38.880]
Through intravenous, you know, and I can't scan is that intravenous is not the very intravenous they put a die in no

[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.720]
If you were saying you were having it the other way

[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:43.680]
No

[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:45.980]
No, not if I can help it

[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:51.380]
But I don't know about the belly and I've never had to drink it and then you know hold it

[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:53.340]
No, I don't know but I don't think so

[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.940]
I don't think so

[01:47:54.940 --> 01:48:01.300]
Oh, I think they had big problems on that table. Yeah, no, I don't think so. Well, I'll let you know tomorrow. Yeah

[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:04.200]
Okay, so I'll bring you in some samples

[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:12.160]
60 on come on welcome to be in talk. Let's go. Yeah. How's this one?

[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:13.900]
John's healthy to me

[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:20.800]
God very simple question and they always become complicated and carvalued and you got 70 different people

[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:23.020]
Given you and then and usually all of them are wrong

[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:29.540]
Like you like people give me a son of antony about getting ready for the test I had last week

[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:33.980]
And colonoscopy in the endoscopy and drinking that stuff. Oh, it's the worst there. That was a piece of cake

[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:38.040]
That was delicious compared to this direct that I'm drinking today this burium that was delish

[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:42.560]
That was sensationally mentioned with a little gatorade and no problem and then the out

[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:45.420]
Here's plantation hello

[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.160]
Yeah, I know you're very funny guy. Yes, I am

[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:54.100]
I had the same thing I had the

[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:56.920]
The colon last time and I that fleet was awful

[01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:03.520]
But uh, what did you mix what did you mix it with? I mixed it with water like they told me. Oh see that was that no

[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:07.180]
We mentioned with water I can imagine but if you mix it with gatorade, it's not that bad

[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:11.120]
No, it's drinking it actually the 5 a.m. prep was the worst part

[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:15.020]
That's that was that was the killer. Yeah, what was that?

[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:19.900]
Well, you had to take another one of those fleet the 5 a.m. So that you were perfectly clean

[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:21.620]
Oh, you had to do a fleet animal

[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:27.400]
No, you had a fleet sponsor so that's the stuff that you drink right yeah, I had to drink that twice I believe

[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.380]
Yeah, in the second time is

[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:35.460]
You just gotta be so clean you can actually eat off the colon almost right but my question is I was squeaky clean man

[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:42.560]
So why would you have to have a burium now if you had that all done that shows pretty much everything doesn't it?

[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:47.460]
No, well, this is for the outside that looks inside and then this looks outside like in the I don't know

[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:50.540]
I have no idea. I'm not a doctor all I'm doing is what they're telling me to do

[01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:55.080]
What you realize everybody in South Florida wants to know this need? Yes, they do

[01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:58.600]
Okay, thank you very much. Okay, pal have a great day

Everybody wants to know of course they want to know they want to know what's on your insides your outsides

They're nosy. They got their nose right up in there. It's deep you can you can smell it

[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:13.680]
Or is it Josh Friedman 26 past noon at 560 wq remember Josh Friedman

There we go

[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:56.960]
And you know there's a lot of people's idea to think just because I smoked a little marijuana when I was in college

[01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:59.480]
Yeah, they were nothing but a penjoy

[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.540]
Maybe the guys I enjoy I know remember y'all

Did they don't think I'm fit to be on the supreme car? Yeah, I got it much

[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:12.400]
Let's do this quick and get out of here. I want to catch y'all straight when I stop reviewing the law

[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.440]
I don't just review the law

[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:15.800]
There y'all

[01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:19.840]

See I know a lot of you people out there like to keep me on a string give me all whipped up to the wafer and see which is okay

[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:40.700]
It's fun

[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:46.840]
But we had a couple of people didn't have time to wait called an off-year to relay the information that I'm not gonna have to have no

[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:51.440]
Barry a mechema and nothing in the old rectum not have to squeeze my cheeks etc

[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.400]
And so on you just drink this stuff now to give you some more vial taste and craft it drink over there

[01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:00.380]
And they stick any IVD iodine whatever that is and it goes all through your stuff and then they take a look at it

[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.500]
They go home and that's it

[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.020]
plain and simple

[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:08.740]
But these people out there in the audience they want you like on pins and needles

[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:11.000]
Yeah, you need to see this

[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:17.900]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Miami. Hello

[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:22.780]
Neil yes, sir. Hi first time call I've listened to you for a while. I love your show all right

[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:28.920]
I'm not gonna talk about your rectum. Please I want to find out what you're opinion on is do you hear about that teacher that got

[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:33.660]
That he was arrested in the swingers club. Yeah, and they had a hearing last night

[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:38.340]
And they decided that the best place that he can teach school is inside the jail

[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:44.300]
Right, I was in the yesterday's paper. It's ridiculous. It's ludicrous that the consensus

[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:49.260]
They had one consenting opinion that said that he couldn't that she shouldn't be able to be teaching kids

[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:53.640]
Yeah, he got up there and she's the moral authority for the all the people in Browark County

[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:56.580]
Right, I just think it's a bunch of crap what people do in their private lives

[01:52:56.580 --> 01:53:02.120]
Consenting and aren't hurting anybody and there's no minors in there people have to pay a I mean it's the most ridiculous thing

[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:06.100]
I've ever heard in the world in civilized countries they would laugh at us like we're a bunch of barbarians

[01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:10.840]
They say we're all caught up on this sex thing. Yeah, everybody's doing it, but they just don't want to admit it

[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:14.500]
Why don't you love your show have a great day. Bye-bye. Oh, yeah

[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:19.240]
He's not fit to teach kids anybody out there that's having sex which of course is why we had all the homos the teachers

[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:22.280]
Because at least they weren't having sex with the opposite sex

[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.300]
They're having sex with each other and that's not good either

[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:29.500]
So anybody I guess you have to be a unit to be a teacher. Uh-huh. So send out your kids to Catholic school

[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:32.320]
Because we know beyond a shadow of a doubt

[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:35.360]
There's no fact in the church. They're gonna be real safe there not

[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:42.880]
Well, look at this phone boy. Just breaks my heart. I may have to go and have to have my ticker look that again here have to have another stress test

[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:48.940]

[01:54:57.780 --> 01:54:59.640]
Here's a mobile in bouquet. Hello

[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.780]
You want to talk about a little bit depressing?

[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:08.220]
I was at the Carolina panther's game the other night. Yes, and I swear to you that place was less than half full

[01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:08.900]
I believe it

[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:11.200]
Less than half. I mean there was huge

[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:12.060]
Sexy

[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:15.940]
This is supposed to be the height of the season now. It's January 19

[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:19.760]
It's supposed to be when the snowboards are all back when the people are gone in the summertime

[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:25.280]
Well, why is he replaced vacant now? There's something going on. I mean my phones are vacant the heat game last night

[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:30.280]
Looks like they had a bomb scare in there the panther game is nobody showing up. We got 50 500 sold seats for the night's game

[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:35.640]
What where did everybody go? I don't understand it myself. I'll be there tonight. I'll be there

[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:41.400]
With it without my with or without my burium. Well, whatever happened with Ragwin. Did he make a little promo for you?

[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:44.200]
He's going to he I talked to him last night

[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:48.380]
He called me at home. He got my number from remember and he called me and was psychotic with Josh Bremen

[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:52.700]
He said the Josh Bremen is he's an asshole. Yeah, that sucks. Yeah, Josh

[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:56.860]
He never you never mentioned my name if he would have said to Ray

[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:57.660]
I want you you know

[01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:58.960]
I'd like you to cut a promo for Neil

[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:01.600]
He would have been delighted to do it. He's a big fan of mine

[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:05.940]
I've been his biggest promoter because I knew when he played in San Jose. I watched the play is a great little player

[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:12.640]
And Josh Bremen cannot get it done no matter what the job is sir unless it's eating he can't get it done

[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:13.180]
Yeah

[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:15.020]
One other thing the

[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:23.700]
The panthers marketing department sucks. They're always making these commercials during the Panther game. Yeah, they played commercials during other tv shows that we have here

[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:28.100]
Right exactly. It's like preaching to the choir. Yeah, I mean the point

[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:33.000]
How vel Burry played 11 games in scored 13 goals. Yeah, what do you do for you in a full?

[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:36.840]
But for watching the game how the hell we supposed to know something different right

[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:43.900]
Plano and channel 4 news at 11 o'clock or something you're high on hell you're hired. Okay. Have a great day. See you

[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:50.620]
We love the panthers. Let's get on fire. Come on. Let's go. Let's get all worked up and into a frenzy. We can say come on

[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:54.100]
Let's get out there tonight. No, Jesus Christ. I'm gonna rush up there to the hospital

[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:59.920]
I'm gonna stick a bunch of stuff in my rectum and they're gonna look on the thing and I'm gonna go rush it back down there and go to the game

[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:04.120]
Not gonna miss some game just because I'm having some intrusive rectum seed you there

[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:10.080]
And even if I stink the joint out it'll be payback for some of those assholes in my section 101 by the way

[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:12.460]
And I'll wear whatever maple leaf jacket. I want dock

[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:15.720]
Show you a finger to mister hotshot

[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:19.440]
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop. No. I don't know what I'm complaining about

[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.180]
See it's better for the players. It's better for the ambience like that maple leaf game

[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:28.800]
We had almost 18,000 at the biggest crowd they've had since the Detroit game earlier in the season

[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:32.120]
Nearly 18,000 people in there it was like a playoff game

[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:35.360]
And the least go ahead to nothing the panthers go ahead 4-2

[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:40.320]
Least come back with four in the third period win six to four it was a game filled with excitement people were screaming

[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.120]
That's the way you want to enjoy a sporting event.

[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:48.380]
Not in a half-empty place where people are sitting on their hands and going, you know

[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:48.920]
how they're going.

[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:49.340]
Yeah.

[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:51.560]
That's no fun.

[01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:55.360]
Want some enthusiasm, some excitement, just like me on this show.

[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.580]
Looking for enthusiasm in this town is like looking for gold in your

[01:57:58.580 --> 01:57:58.960]
rectum.

[01:57:59.140 --> 01:57:59.940]
Jesus Christ.

[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.700]
And by the way, if they look for gold in your rectum, they found it, do you think they

[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:05.120]
would tell you?

[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:05.340]
No.

[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:06.140]
I don't think so.

[01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.380]
I mean, your gold tooth is something like that.

[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:11.060]
Huh?

[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:12.060]
Probably in those swing clubs.

[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.780]
You know, it's big with the kids down there, gold teeth.

[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:17.720]
They're probably gold teeth in every body part you can ever imagine.

[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.060]
And what's wrong with little jewelry?

[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:22.880]
21 before 1 at 2 a.m.

[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:26.180]
This is 560, QAM.

[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:27.500]
Sports radio.

[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:30.160]
560, QAM.

[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:32.620]
Ray Whitney has a pair.

[01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:37.640]
So is that new year's diet now with the Calista Flock Heart Mega Diet.

[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:42.560]
If you feel overweight out of shape or as bad as Kade Moss, then you need the

[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:44.680]
Calista Flock Heart Mega Diet now.

[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:45.900]
And it's so easy.

[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:47.220]
You can do it at home.

[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:50.680]
Just run around the house about 150 times.

[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:59.200]
Then gorge yourself on a delicious Styrofoam casserole.

[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.600]
Purge and repeat.

[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:03.180]
The Calista Flock Heart Mega Diet.

[01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:04.100]
Maybe harmful as well.

[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:06.400]
Consult the psychiatrist before starting diet.

[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.240]
Obst both pants are larger than they appear.

[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:13.860]

[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:20.360]
Any interest?

[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:20.920]
No.

[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:21.400]
Okay.

[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:23.880]
Here's the Pember Pine.

[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:24.220]
Hello.

[01:59:24.660 --> 01:59:25.220]
Hi Dale.

[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:25.800]
Yes sir.

[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:26.740]
Long time fan.

[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:31.780]
Last time I saw you, you were with a gentleman by the name of Bill Calder.

[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:32.260]
Right.

[01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:40.020]
I think it was in his last days you were at the track with him and trying to bring him a little bit of enjoyment during those days.

[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:41.280]
There were very sad days.

[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:42.660]
Wonderful man.

[01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:43.940]
Yeah.

[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:45.860]
Anyway, I have a hockey trivia.

[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:49.180]
I go back way back in hockey and hockey.

[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:52.380]
And I wanted to get your opinion on four players.

[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:55.180]
A rockery shark, Gordy Howe, Greth and Burry.

[01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:56.540]
Well, what do you mean my opinion on them?

[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:57.940]
I like to know how you would rate them.

[01:59:58.620 --> 01:59:59.680]
How would you rate them?

[01:59:59.760 --> 01:59:59.900]
Yeah.

[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:03.360]
You can't compare old time players with, it's not possible.

[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:08.420]
Well, do you remember when they had the big ratings between rockery shark and howe they went back and forth?

[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:13.040]
But if you can't compare, you can't compare, oh yeah, you can compare them because they were contemporaries.

[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:13.360]
Right.

[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:16.080]
You can't compare today's players in any sport with old time players.

[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:20.220]
So you wouldn't, you wouldn't have an opinion whether Burry would, uh...

[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:22.080]
And why would you leave Murray or Lemue off that list?

[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:22.980]
That's true.

[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:26.180]
For my money, he's better, he was better than Gordy Howe or Murray's for a shark.

[02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:28.740]
The move was better than, than, than, than how?

[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:29.760]
That's my opinion.

[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:31.140]
Well, that's what I wanted.

[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:32.740]
Anyway.

[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:35.100]
If you leave out Bobby Orr, but anyway, have a great day.

[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:36.360]
Oh, I hate doing that.

[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:38.360]
Does everybody else hate that?

[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:38.720]
Uh-huh.

[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:38.980]
Yeah.

[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:41.280]
Oh, is that Jack Orr?

[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:41.880]
I remember him.

[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:46.500]
5670560, pound 5660 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:48.920]
Remember, Jack Orr, he was mayor of, uh...what?

[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:49.280]
Miami?

[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:50.220]
Where was he?

[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:51.800]
Who?

[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.140]
What is wrong with you, little illegal alien?

[02:00:55.140 --> 02:00:56.200]
Oh, did I say alien?

[02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:56.700]
Sorry.

[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:57.240]
Capers.

[02:00:58.080 --> 02:00:59.560]
Here's a mobile and FIU.

[02:00:59.560 --> 02:00:59.860]
Hello.

[02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:03.140]
Mobile and FIU?

[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:04.600]
Yeah, hey, how you doing, Neil?

[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:05.000]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:05.540]
Time call.

[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:06.260]
All right.

[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:09.740]
Because I'm not here to talk about your colon or nothing, about panthers.

[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:12.640]
I got major problems in my stomach.

[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:15.540]
I was wondering if you should figure out what it is.

[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:16.200]
Yeah.

[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:17.240]
The doctors can't.

[02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:17.580]
Uh-huh.

[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:19.280]
That's what I'm gonna do like you.

[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:20.380]
All right.

[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:21.760]
Um, let's see where we can start.

[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.200]
Well, the doctors, I go to the doctor, they stick fingers up my blood, try to figure out

[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:26.540]
what's wrong.

[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:28.140]
And it can't.

[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:31.260]
And then he put air up my blood.

[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:32.680]
We can't figure that out either.

[02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:33.700]
You don't know what's wrong.

[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.020]
I mean, I eat a lot of food, it ain't that spicy.

[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:36.380]

[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.740]
Maybe there's something wrong with your...

[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:39.540]
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:40.420]
Yeah, that could be it.

[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:43.040]
5670560, pound.

[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:44.020]
Maybe it's just...

[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:44.620]
He's an asshole.

[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:45.540]
Yeah, speaking of blood.

[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:49.820]
5670560, pound 5660 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:52.740]
There's one of our bright students at FIU for you, by the way.

[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:54.920]
Something you can be real proud of.

[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:59.060]
One more great reason that we're proud to live here in South Florida.

[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:01.020]
Here's North Miami Beach.

[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:01.260]
Hello.

[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:02.320]
Neil Godd.

[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:02.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:07.900]
Uh, I'm the unfortunate recipient of four CAT scans in the last year.

[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:08.300]
Yeah.

[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.480]
Or abdominal CAT scan.

[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:09.680]
Really?

[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:10.220]
Why is that?

[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:13.640]
Um, well, not like the previous asshole, I have...

[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.300]
I've got real severe stomach pain too for about a year.

[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:16.780]
Yeah.

[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:18.040]
It took out my appendix.

[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:19.360]
I was in the hospital for a week.

[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.000]
And, uh, here, about a year later, I still have the pain.

[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:24.280]
I have no clue what the hell it is.

[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:24.660]
Really?

[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:25.180]
Oh, yeah.

[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:25.660]
Absolutely.

[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:26.220]
Sounds familiar.

[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:28.700]
I don't have severe pain, but I have it like comes and goes.

[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:30.640]
Well, I mean, it was real severe in the beginning.

[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:33.640]
It was constant, and it's still constant, but I'm just so used to it now.

[02:02:33.700 --> 02:02:34.580]
I don't even notice it happening.

[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:34.760]
Yeah.

[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:35.460]
Oh, yeah.

[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:36.920]
Are you diabetic?

[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:37.900]
No, not at all.

[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:42.540]
I mean, reasonably good shape, but, um, you know, anyway, that...

[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:44.460]
So they've looked in all the ends and they did the...

[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:45.260]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:46.060]
They can't find anything.

[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:49.920]
They gave me a colonoscopy, a barriam, a minima, four cascans, a sonogram...

[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:50.960]
And a partridge and a pear tree.

[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:51.340]
Exactly.

[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:53.420]
The worst part about the cascans.

[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:56.540]
Um, they clean out the day before that really sucks.

[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:57.040]
It's terrible.

[02:02:57.180 --> 02:02:59.280]
And I mean, I had most of those within a one week span.

[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:00.780]
No, no, no, that's not the cascans.

[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:01.740]
That's a colonoscopy.

[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:02.240]
No, no, no.

[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:03.400]
I mean, I've had...

[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:04.220]
I've had them all.

[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:05.740]
And I had a...

[02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:13.140]
The cascans in the hospital, they gave me something to drink that tasted like really warm, disgusting, crystal-white lemonade.

[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:13.740]
Mm.

[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:14.800]
It was repugnant.

[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:15.340]
Delish.

[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:20.260]
But that was great compared to the stuff that they gave me in the outpatient center that they call a milkshake.

[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:20.720]
Right.

[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:24.400]
And at seven o'clock in the morning, this stuff is disgusting.

[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:26.320]
I mean, it was so bad.

[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:27.260]
It was like...

[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.560]
It was like sour eggnog.

[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:29.000]
Mm-hmm.

[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:29.820]
It was really terrible.

[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:31.320]
You just got your drink in that two hours ago.

[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:31.780]
Yeah.

[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:34.120]
Well, in the next three, I'm going to go home and drink another thing.

[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.980]
And then, uh, it's 4.30 when I go over there, but it drinks some more of it.

[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:39.880]
Well, see, they... they sucker you in.

[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.240]
Because they give you one while you're sitting out in the waiting room.

[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:46.500]
And you've got to sit there and wait 45 minutes for it to tinkle down your colon and everything.

[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:46.860]
Mm-hmm.

[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:48.700]
And then you figure, okay, I'm in the clear, no big deal.

[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:52.000]
They get you in the back room, and then they go, well, that back room.

[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:53.900]
Then they give you the other drink.

[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.600]
And they get you drink that one too.

[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:57.840]
So, and then they don't make you wait.

[02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:58.920]
They bring you right into the room.

[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.400]
They stick the IV in your arm, and you can well heat it up by the eye.

[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:03.080]
That's it.

[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:04.700]
I mean, they test itself as a breeze.

[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:05.900]
How long does it test take?

[02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:07.640]
Um, about 20 minutes.

[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:08.300]
20 minutes.

[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:09.100]
Yeah, not too bad.

[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:10.740]
The barriam minimize terrible.

[02:04:10.740 --> 02:04:12.040]
I don't have to do that.

[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:14.880]
And the colonoscopy is great because for about 20 nights...

[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.420]
In fact, I've got a sign on my back side that says the orifice is closed.

[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:20.340]
I mean, I've realized we ignore that.

[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:23.020]
But the colonoscopy was fine because...

[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:23.440]
You're asleep.

[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:26.420]
Well, the drug feels really good for about 10 seconds.

[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:28.360]
You're stoned to sell and then it can help them.

[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:32.160]
But actually, um, when I was told afterwards, which I felt was kind of shocking,

[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:34.400]
you don't actually sleep during the procedure.

[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:34.880]
You're awake.

[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:36.840]
You're just so stoned, you don't know.

[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:38.120]
And they call it amnesia.

[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.040]
It has, like, an amnesia.

[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:39.920]
You just don't remember any.

[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:40.320]
Thank God.

[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:42.320]
Can I make a shameless request?

[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:42.700]
Sure.

[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.760]
I mean, you know if you still have this because this is back from like the Gulf War days.

[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:48.120]
Um, exit 69.

[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.000]
Remember that one?

[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:50.860]
Exit 69.

[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:51.560]
Yeah.

[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:52.620]
That was a Bob and Tom.

[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:53.880]
I'll see if maybe it's still around.

[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:55.800]
No, it's not in the DCS, but I'll see if we still got that.

[02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:56.600]
That was a great bit.

[02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:57.320]
Okay, Pat.

[02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:57.900]
I know you're God.

[02:04:57.980 --> 02:04:58.360]
Good luck.

[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.140]
Take care of your colon.

[02:04:59.300 --> 02:04:59.780]
Okay, you too.

[02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:02.160]
Okay, it's all the bad stomach people here.

[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:02.960]
We don't still have that.

[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:04.440]
Doing it was from an old Bob and Tom thing.

[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:06.800]
Remember that exit 69 was a little on the...

[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:09.660]
Back in those days, it was a little on the marginal side, but it's okay now.

[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:11.440]
Because now we can even say Schmidt on the year.

[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:17.320]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:20.760]
Can we find a doctor who can diagnose a head cold?

[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:21.640]
You think we can do that?

[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:21.900]
No.

[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:22.320]
No.

[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:24.560]
Here's a mobile in Pompo-no.

[02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:24.800]
Hello.

[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:27.180]
Hello.

[02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:27.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:30.700]
You know, I just want to talk to you about the Panthers for a second.

[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:31.000]
Okay.

[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:33.500]
I was at the game on Monday.

[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:35.240]
And it was a good turnout.

[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:37.620]
But let me tell you, the fans are ridiculous.

[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:38.900]
I mean, they are so quiet.

[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:39.640]
It's like a cemetery.

[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:42.480]
And I'm so sure that it's one of the seats.

[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:45.380]
I just wanted to say something to fans out there.

[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:46.260]
God damn it.

[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:48.200]
When you go out to the damn game, be a fan.

[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:49.260]
Don't sit in your hands.

[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:50.900]
I mean, why?

[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.140]
The flyer I don't want to stand on.

[02:05:52.180 --> 02:05:55.520]
Half of the people who are there, I got corporate seats that somebody gave them.

[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:57.200]
They don't know what the hell is going on.

[02:05:57.500 --> 02:05:58.340]
They're on their cell phone.

[02:05:58.340 --> 02:05:59.740]
They're not interested in what's going on.

[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:02.900]
And they don't tend to get animated as when that stupid little blimp comes by.

[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:04.880]
Or when they're slinging a t-shirt up in the crowd.

[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:07.620]
And then they're trying to kill each other for a 50 cent t-shirt.

[02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:09.860]
That's the only time you see any excitement in the place.

[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:12.600]
I'd tell you, I thought I really started excited when they finally scored a goal.

[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:13.500]
Maybe they didn't come alive.

[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:14.160]
Yeah.

[02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:16.380]
The red light goes off to make it crazy.

[02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:18.840]
But then after that, they'll sit in their hands and they do nothing.

[02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:22.860]
But a whole damn game until something, my actual tap is going to say like a goal.

[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:23.900]
And then they wake up.

[02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:24.360]
Yeah.

[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:25.380]
It's ridiculous.

[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:26.080]
Welcome to Miami.

[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:27.420]
I'm going tonight.

[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:29.060]
I've been to 14 games this year.

[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:30.280]
I missed like three or four.

[02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:31.240]
And I can't wait.

[02:06:31.540 --> 02:06:32.180]
Okay, I'll see you there.

[02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:32.940]
All right, man.

[02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:38.740]
I'll be the guy that's dripping five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:43.200]
And by the way, you know, every now and then because you know, I pick my spots when a pink light comes out.

[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:44.460]
I'm going to go into a TV timeout.

[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:46.540]
I run up and go take a leak if nature is calling.

[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:50.520]
Now tonight if you see me go running for the exit to go to a run to the magic room.

[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:51.840]
I'd get out of the way if I were you.

[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:54.280]
That's my personal advice based on all the information I'm hearing.

[02:06:54.580 --> 02:06:56.080]
I would just make a clear pathway.

[02:06:58.080 --> 02:06:58.880]
Here's North Miami.

[02:06:58.940 --> 02:06:59.260]
Hello.

[02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:00.780]
I'm going to go to the

[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:01.880]
North Miami.

[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:06.580]
Is long gone on a famous line seven, by the way.

[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:08.040]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:08.380]
Hello.

[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:09.960]
Hey, Neil.

[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:10.500]
Yes, sir.

[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:11.440]
How are you, man?

[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:11.880]
Okay.

[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:18.720]
Listen, I think some of these people really need to check their heads not their stomach because they've gone to a doctor 20 times.

[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:20.900]
They can't figure out what's wrong with them.

[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:24.340]
They need to get like a hit in the therapist or something going like that.

[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:24.880]
What do you mean?

[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:26.200]
In other words, you think it's in their head?

[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:29.300]
Yeah, I think a lot of that stuff might be in your head.

[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:31.100]
I had a lot of stomach problems years ago.

[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:35.900]
And I honestly, I went to a hypnotherapy and he helped me out a lot.

[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:37.020]
By doing what?

[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:38.500]
Help me deal with the stress.

[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.040]
With the stress?

[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:40.580]
No matter how to relax.

[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:44.700]
So, other words, your stomach problem was from stress?

[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:45.460]
Yeah.

[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:49.980]
And I think a lot of these people probably have a lot of stomach problems from stress.

[02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:52.780]
That's just my opinion.

[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:53.480]
Okay, thanks.

[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:56.020]
You think my stomach problems are from stress?

[02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:57.520]
It sounds like a good lawsuit to me.

[02:07:57.800 --> 02:07:59.240]
I think they're QAM stress-related.

[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:00.600]
Yeah.

[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:03.360]
Let's get that little thing there that the thing you stare into.

[02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:04.340]
What do they call that?

[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:06.060]
I call it a swirly.

[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:07.260]
No, what do they call that thing?

[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:12.620]
The little this round circular with lines that you stare.

[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:12.980]
I don't know.

[02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:13.360]
Huh?

[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:15.560]
The peppermint candy pattern.

[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:16.700]
That's what it looks like.

[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:20.580]
And then in the background is you're playing the pushing music you know.

[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:22.920]
And that too.

[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:25.260]
And Bert Tannen is talking and whispering in your...

[02:08:25.260 --> 02:08:27.260]
Hey, Bert, you're a great guy, but you know those TV spots.

[02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:28.760]
You can't understand a word that you're saying.

[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:30.940]
You're putting the audience to sleep.

[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:33.660]
Bert, you're supposed to wake him up and get in the car, your number, and go out and get in.

[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:34.760]
He's a good guy, Bert Tannen.

[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:36.100]
You want to go get hit in the tie?

[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:40.580]
It's just that even like in conversation at the dinner table, he could put you to sleep.

[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:41.580]
Just his nature.

[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:43.700]
Here's a mobile in Haya-Lia.

[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:43.980]
Hello.

[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:45.380]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:45.940]
Okay, sir.

[02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:46.880]
Yo, man.

[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:48.220]
You're a funny character, yo.

[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.120]
Me and my homeboy is the plug-in off your shelf.

[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:50.760]
All right.

[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:52.160]
Yeah, but check this man.

[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:55.180]
Yo, I had a thing I obviously one time.

[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:55.600]
Why not?

[02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:57.880]
That's bad because they don't knock you out.

[02:08:57.940 --> 02:08:58.740]
Yeah, they don't.

[02:08:58.800 --> 02:08:59.860]
They still didn't even...

[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.000]
They twisted and turned it on the thing too.

[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:05.800]
That doesn't hurt, but it's a feeling to have...

[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:08.120]
Very uncomfortable and you get very nervous about that, you know?

[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:08.780]
Yes.

[02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:09.780]
Not good for your image.

[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:12.880]
Well, it was, I'm not near, but hey, if you can't, can you pay that?

[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:14.260]
Yeah, F words, get...

[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:14.520]
Okay.

[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:15.620]
All right, thank you, man.

[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:16.180]
You got it, man.

[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:17.760]
And you know what the governor said?

[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:19.060]
Get you a black ass out of here.

[02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:20.520]
And that what the governor said, something like that.

[02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:22.240]
Yeah, get those darkies out of here.

[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:24.780]
What kind of a governor have we got?

[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:25.640]
Oh, man.

[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:31.840]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60, on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:34.480]
Wait until, uh, alien in this bloody scope.

[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:34.840]
They're crispy.

[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:36.760]
Keep in mind that the governor is married to a Mexican lady.

[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:38.420]
So he's not going to say, get those...

[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:40.060]
Tell those fix to get their ass out of there.

[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:40.700]
Is he going to say that?

[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:40.940]
No.

[02:09:41.860 --> 02:09:45.080]
So just probably say, tell those crazy Cubans to get their ass out of here.

[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:48.560]
Because you know how the Mexicans and Cubans get long.

[02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:51.140]
Not too well.

[02:09:52.020 --> 02:09:53.480]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:54.040]
Hello.

[02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:55.280]
Neil God.

[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:55.840]
Yes, sir.

[02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:58.040]
Neil, I just had something quick to share with you.

[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:01.140]
You know those, those fish that people put on the back of their car?

[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:01.420]
Yeah.

[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:02.420]
You know the Jesus stickers?

[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:03.100]
Yes, sir.

[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:04.500]
Well, I saw one today.

[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.380]
You want to say, give filter in the middle?

[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:10.820]
One mother used to make her own.

[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:15.820]
Anyway, it was one of those fish, but it had little feet on it.

[02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:18.880]
And inside the fish and big letters, it said Darwin.

[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:19.260]
Yeah.

[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:20.440]
I'm getting one.

[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:21.260]
That's old.

[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:22.160]
That's it.

[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:22.500]
Ancient.

[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:23.800]
I was old as Darwin, but close.

[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:24.100]
Is it?

[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.240]
I get one today.

[02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:26.680]
I've never seen one of those.

[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:31.100]
In fact, I would just get the little Darwin thing and say slapping on all the cars that are parked that it got to the irregular fish on.

[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:32.260]
I'm out of material.

[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:32.720]
Okay, pal.

[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:33.420]
So, yeah.

[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:36.820]
Yeah, you people would have stupid fish on your car and all your little religious symbols.

[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:38.500]
Keep it to yourself, okay?

[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:39.720]
Keep it to yourself.

[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:42.340]
Jesus saves 1-800 Jesus this.

[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:44.920]
In the meantime, these are the worst drivers you ever saw in your life.

[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:48.060]
So many times have yelled out in traffic at these people.

[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:51.620]
You need a prayer when you're driving on the road with you, you asshole.

[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:54.920]
God, always the worst frickin' drivers.

[02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:58.200]
The only ones worst in that are the ones that have a...

[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:00.340]
How's my driving called 1-800-Each-Mit?

[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:00.640]
You know?

[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:02.500]
Those ones are even worse.

[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:06.100]
Like an invitation to a...

[02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:07.460]
And of course, most of us are too lazy.

[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:09.320]
Who's going to take the time to call and say,

[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.980]
you know, your 1-800-Each-Mit guy is driving like Schmidt.

[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:13.860]
Right, Mike?

[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:18.720]
5-6-7-05-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T line.

[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:22.000]
12-56 at your 6th station, WQAM.

[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:25.280]
This is 5-60 QAM.

[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:29.580]
Only one South Florida radio station has that...

[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:30.780]
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

[02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:31.660]
Let's stick to it.

[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:33.820]
Hey, Goldberg, weekday afternoon to two.

[02:11:34.020 --> 02:11:36.800]
Sports radio 5-60 QAM.

[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.420]
I know this is on.

[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:45.140]
This is not a tumor.

[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:47.120]
It's the ones of two hours.

[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:51.800]
Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word...

[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:56.820]
...f*** out of all of the English words that begin with a letter F.

[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.620]
F*** is the only word that is referred to as the F word.

[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:03.260]
It's the one magical word.

[02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:08.280]
Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.

[02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:13.220]
F*** as most words in the English language is derived from German.

[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.760]
The word Fliken, which means to strike.

[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:20.160]
In English, F*** falls into many grammatical categories.

[02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:24.840]
As a transitive verb, for instance, John F*** surely.

[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:27.120]
Its meaning is not always sexual.

[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:29.340]
It can be used as an adjective such as,

[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:31.760]
John's doing all the f***ing work.

[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.620]
As part of an adverb, surely talks to f***ing much.

[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:42.120]
As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, surely is f***ing beautiful.

[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:45.680]
As a noun, I don't give a f***.

[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:51.340]
As part of a word, abso f***en loosely or in f***ing incredible.

[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:57.060]
And as almost every word in a sentence, f*** the f***ing f***ers.

[02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:02.400]
As you must realize, there aren't too many words with a versatility of f***ing.

[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:06.160]
As in these examples describing situations such as fraud,

[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:09.020]
I got f***ed that they use carolot.

[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:11.820]
This may all f*** it.

[02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:15.460]
Trouble, I guess I'm really f***ed now.

[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:18.940]
Aggression, don't f*** with me, buddy.

[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:24.300]
This missile, why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself?

[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:28.040]
I'm sure you can think of many more examples.

[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:30.480]
Say it loudly and proudly.

[02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:32.540]
F*** you.

[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:35.320]
I can think a lot more like Josh Readman is an effing idiot.

[02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:38.880]
And Josh Readman is as well, so effing bad just state of hell away and things like that.

[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:40.280]
All around Josh Readman.

[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:41.000]
He's an asshole.

[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:41.480]
That too.

[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:46.500]
Two minutes after one at 560 WQM, welcome to Dr. Talk again here on a Wednesday.

[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:48.840]
On your six days, and I do mean sick.

[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:49.600]
Is this play sick?

[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:49.940]
Uh huh.

[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:50.420]
Or what?

[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:52.480]
Here's Pompato Beach.

[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:52.640]
Hello?

[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.060]
Yeah, well you mentioned Jeb and Columbus a minute ago.

[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:03.680]
For the since that story, first broke, I'd been one and she said the reason she did it,

[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:07.460]
she was afraid to let him know.

[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:08.720]
How much he spent, yeah.

[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:09.700]
Oh yeah.

[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:14.840]
Well, my question is to her.

[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:16.880]
What is your answer to the question?

[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:23.100]
What we were afraid he would do and what was your afraid he would say?

[02:14:23.380 --> 02:14:26.640]
It is the ever said people would have beat the crap out of that bitch.

[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:28.500]
Well, I wanted it out of her mouth.

[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:29.040]
Right.

[02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:30.660]
No, I wanted it out of his mouth.

[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:35.320]
Yeah, well, after he finishes taking care of those books in the out there in the office.

[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.660]
Yeah, well anyway.

[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:38.580]
Kicked her ass there.

[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:39.660]
Well, maybe nobody cares.

[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.480]
Okay, 567, huh?

[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:43.280]
Well, I mean, he's all whipped up to a frenzy.

[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:45.400]
Nobody's ever, because it's old news, okay, sir.

[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:48.420]
I hate to break the news to you, but after he are, he just ain't feeling good anymore.

[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:49.840]
He just fell right out of the chair.

[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:56.400]
567, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:57.340]
Let's go, Panthers.

[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:57.760]
Let's go.

[02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:00.100]
Let's kick them, Washington, Capitol last tonight.

[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:06.780]
God, this town is like trying to wake the dead year after year.

[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:08.340]
That's what they're going to write on my tombstone.

[02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:12.200]
Maybe very soon if they want to put his 20 pound tumor in my gut tonight, but very soon.

[02:15:13.060 --> 02:15:16.800]
He tried to wake the dead and still couldn't do it.

[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:18.820]
David is best shot like Jimmy.

[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:20.160]
He had a shot.

[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:21.980]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:22.360]
Hello.

[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:23.980]
Hello, Neil.

[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:24.440]
Yes.

[02:15:24.980 --> 02:15:25.620]
How you doing, sir?

[02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:26.060]
Okay.

[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:29.720]
I just want to take the subject real quick, make a quick comment about the FBI.

[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:31.500]
You don't want to talk about Buriam?

[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:32.580]
And I'm going to go ahead, please.

[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:33.700]
Oh, please.

[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:34.940]
No, yes.

[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:39.180]
Well, that, yeah, the agent that is finally getting charged with a murder of the...

[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:40.400]
Yes, they're David Ferrell.

[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:42.040]
Jesus Christ.

[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:43.220]
I mean, I don't know what...

[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:44.040]
I mean, come on.

[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:49.140]
I mean, even though he's an FBI agent, a cop or whatever he is, he still should be treated and...

[02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:51.700]
And faulted as a regular, you know...

[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:55.880]
Like some other schmuck like any other putt who was drunk as a skunk and driving on a wrong way the highway.

[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:56.520]
Exactly.

[02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:58.080]
And they're going to try and cover it up.

[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:00.000]
I'd say fry his ass is what I say.

[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:00.780]
I'd say exactly.

[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:01.160]
Just like that.

[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:04.320]
When on Channel 7 news, let Ricky Tiki pull us switch.

[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:05.180]
Oh, yeah.

[02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:07.220]
Make sure they run it over and over like the...

[02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:08.700]
I get those darkies out of here, you know?

[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:12.720]
Or they can just run him over to get even for the guy that he killed in front of the stadium a few years ago.

[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:13.640]
You know that guy that's dead?

[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:15.020]
Oh, yeah, with that...

[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:16.400]
I got, I got people, right?

[02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:16.600]
Right.

[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:18.580]
Anyway, two quick comments.

[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:22.380]
One, please no more rectum talking to, no more phone calls, you know.

[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:22.780]
Okay.

[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:24.440]
That sounded just...

[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:24.920]
You know who that was?

[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:26.320]
Yeah.

[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.680]
How come it took me so long to catch you on?

[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:31.180]
How come I was so slow on it?

[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:32.860]
That was that asshole who that was?

[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:33.900]
Oh, God.

[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:36.460]
Yeah, no more phone calls for the whole station.

[02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:37.820]
What the hell would you do then, sweetheart?

[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:40.840]
Everyday, I'm on my way home.

[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:42.280]
First call, they put on with Hank.

[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:43.320]
Here's Steven Hollywood.

[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:47.160]
I mean, do those guys have any clue what life is all about?

[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:47.300]
No.

[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:48.280]
What these callers are?

[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:48.460]
Oh.

[02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:52.520]
Putting the same bozos on their over and over and over again with no material?

[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:57.240]
I sure must be a little under the weather because I learned how long was he on like throughout too long?

[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.740]
If it was 42 seconds, it was 42 seconds too long.

[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:02.660]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:03.020]
Hello.

[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:04.300]
Oh, hi, Neil.

[02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:04.840]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:07.720]
Hey, I'm still a little sidebar here.

[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:10.160]
You were talking about that bumper sticker, right?

[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:11.020]
The 1-800-E.

[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:11.520]
Smith?

[02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:12.080]
Yeah.

[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:12.760]
Okay.

[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:14.360]
I called the number.

[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:16.100]
You know what they're doing?

[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:17.260]
What are they doing?

[02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:23.440]
They're hawking one of these 1-900 things, you know, for like $3 a minute or whatever.

[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:25.020]
Party line?

[02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:27.360]
Yeah.

[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.260]
Yeah, I don't know.

[02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:30.680]
I'm not going to call the party line.

[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:32.660]
Maybe you would.

[02:17:32.660 --> 02:17:34.880]
But anyway, that way I just was checking that out.

[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:35.620]
Did you know it?

[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:36.700]
I know what?

[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:39.160]
That they're hawking a 900 number.

[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:40.100]
Who's they?

[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:40.760]
Who's they?

[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:42.580]
What do we call about 1-800-E?

[02:17:42.580 --> 02:17:43.320]
Each met, yeah.

[02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:43.620]

[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:45.340]
It's not a say who sponsors it.

[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:45.800]
Yeah.

[02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:48.380]
Okay, well have a good time.

[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:48.740]
Okay.

[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:50.440]
Anybody know what he's talking about?

[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:50.700]
No.

[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:51.000]
No.

[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:53.060]
Let's go back to Burial Menor as quick.

[02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:55.680]
5-6-7-0-5-60.

[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:58.420]
Top 5-60 on the AT&T.

[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:02.160]
You got to understand this town is in bad shape after this weekend.

[02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:05.720]
These people feel like little lost sheep.

[02:18:06.860 --> 02:18:07.640]
They're lost.

[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:08.700]
They're desperate.

[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:10.940]
Their egos have been badly deflated.

[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:12.300]
They've all gone into a van.

[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:13.400]
They're all hiding out of the bed.

[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:16.380]
Hoping for the whistle to blow or somebody to blow.

[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:22.160]
And my wife, let me ask you why is it that maybe I would call one of those three way numbers.

[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:25.200]
Don't have a sexual people call out their straight three way numbers.

[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:26.700]
Are there straight five way numbers?

[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:29.860]
Oh, only facts do that is that what it is.

[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:30.600]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:32.320]
No, I'm not into phone six.

[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:34.700]
I'm more like I'm more of a hands on guy myself.

[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:37.880]
Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale.

[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:40.180]
Hello, I'm like Joe Castello who's more of a ball-zone guy.

[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:40.600]
Hello.

[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:41.480]
Hello, Neil.

[02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:42.100]
The face.

[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:42.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:43.880]
Yeah, a long time.

[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:45.200]
Listen, the first time in college.

[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:45.780]
All right.

[02:18:45.900 --> 02:18:47.860]
A little bit of the way you went through this morning.

[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:48.860]
There is some justice.

[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:51.280]
I turn from Hollywood to Fort Lauderdale.

[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.680]
I have a morning to get on the turnpike.

[02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:53.520]
I got one of these.

[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:54.820]
Do not turn on.

[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:57.900]
There are no right turn on the crib's signal.

[02:18:58.140 --> 02:18:58.340]
Right.

[02:18:58.340 --> 02:19:00.540]
And you guys blow their horn to her and me.

[02:19:00.660 --> 02:19:02.480]
I pull over right for you to turnpike.

[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.500]
Three times, this is happening this year.

[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:06.920]
As soon as I make a right turn, a cop is set knowing this one will take it.

[02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:07.640]
I love it.

[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:08.340]
You eat.

[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:08.800]
Beautiful.

[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:09.700]
There is a little justice.

[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:10.300]
Thank you, pal.

[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:10.920]
Thank you.

[02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:14.120]
Yeah, this old fossil behind me is blowing a horn.

[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:16.000]
I mean, these wrong as wrong can be.

[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:16.780]
There is a sign.

[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:17.760]
I pointed the sign.

[02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:18.800]
I rolled on the window.

[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:20.980]
I said, hey, what's your problem, asshole?

[02:19:21.140 --> 02:19:21.980]
Can't you read the sign?

[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:23.520]
There's no turn right.

[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:24.600]
I'm ready from this lane.

[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:25.760]
You old fossil.

[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:27.000]
You're disgusting old fart.

[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:29.300]
And he's back there.

[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:30.280]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:34.040]
You know, you could see the toe jam come flying out the window as soon as he rolled it down.

[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:36.080]
Man.

[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:40.840]
Eight minutes past one is five, 60 WQAM.

[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:42.880]
Sports radio, five, 60 QAM.

[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:44.720]
One million pounds for needle rogers.

[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:45.800]
He's in the his house.

[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:46.800]
What word did you say?

[02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:53.020]
Cheats W4.

[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:56.980]
How many drugs did you have?

[02:19:56.980 --> 02:19:57.500]
You say.

[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:01.040]
Cheats W4.

[02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:02.820]
Oh.

[02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:05.920]
They must have a good deal for us.

[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:10.320]
To get your complete grasp to look young.

[02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:13.940]
It's locked to daddy of things from good times.

[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:17.640]
Cheats W4.

[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:22.180]
Here's another million from the MRM.

[02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:26.360]
You want to meet the President.

[02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:31.040]
Leader of the band.

[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.880]
Leader of the universe.

[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:39.480]
You're raising our hands.

[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.640]
Got enough bread to make it.

[02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:46.620]
You have the country for the fight to play.

[02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:50.180]
Cheats W4.

[02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:54.840]
I'm going to get my passport today.

[02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:56.860]
Smok.

[02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:57.920]
Smok.

[02:20:58.500 --> 02:20:59.820]
Just only smoke.

[02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:01.360]
Time for that.

[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:02.840]
Out of pain.

[02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:05.800]
Our passport is ready.

[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.020]
Oh, there's a letter.

[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:09.480]
It's not a letter.

[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:14.940]
Cheats W4.

[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:18.600]
Time for that.

[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:21.220]

[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:23.240]
Cheats W4.

[02:21:24.180 --> 02:21:25.140]
Time for that.

[02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:26.180]
Time for that.

[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:27.740]
We'll write it today.

[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:31.820]
The office is waiting.

[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:35.680]
We're so strong over here to read that girl right.

[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:37.700]
Go go ahead.

[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.220]
Go go ahead.

[02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:46.260]
When you hear the final thing said.

[02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:53.740]
How many times did you say you saw the beautiful?

[02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:57.880]
You saw the weird thing that you said.

[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:00.760]
All right.

[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:01.600]
114-10.

[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:04.580]
I'm sure glad that the bushes are coming around on that Confederate flag.

[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:06.920]
5-6-7-05-60.

[02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:09.780]
I'm sorry to rebel flag.

[02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:11.600]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:11.960]
Hello.

[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:13.780]
How you doing?

[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:22.200]
Are you aware of the fact that the first trial has been completed on these American airline ramp rats or Miami International?

[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:22.640]
No.

[02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:25.720]
It was in USA last Thursday or Friday.

[02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:33.260]
And the gentleman that was tried was the one that supposedly put the hand grenades and weapons in the overhead.

[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:35.360]
And he was found not guilty.

[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:38.440]
Based on what?

[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:44.540]
Based on the fact that the jury thought that he was coerced into doing this by the...

[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:46.000]
So in other words, he was kind of like the Nazis.

[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:47.420]
He's just the following orders?

[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:50.640]
Well, supposedly...

[02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:57.020]
So in other words, if you're a hitman and somebody hires you to murder somebody, you're not going to be guilty because somebody else...

[02:22:57.020 --> 02:23:01.100]
He evidently what the jury found was that he was...

[02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:03.340]
He was pestered into doing this.

[02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:04.020]
Pestered?

[02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:04.460]
Exactly.

[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:08.320]
He was offered it more than once or twice or three times.

[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:08.620]
Yeah.

[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:09.920]
Take the money and do it.

[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:11.380]
And finally...

[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:19.120]
Well, how about the guy that the government entrapped with the kidney porn that time years ago that was on 60 minutes and they kept sending him the stuff in the mail over and over and over again, like 8 million times?

[02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:21.560]
And he finally ordered something and they nailed his ass.

[02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:22.420]
Yeah, I...

[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:24.020]
I don't know.

[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:27.240]
I'm just thinking about the news media here.

[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:28.500]
I haven't seen anything on it.

[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:29.640]
I haven't heard a word about it.

[02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:34.980]
I found in the USA, in the USA, they have state-by-state news.

[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:35.180]
Right.

[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:35.860]
It was in there.

[02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:36.780]
It was in there.

[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:36.880]

[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:43.300]
And other than that, our media made such a big deal out of it when they were prosecuting and watching the...

[02:23:43.300 --> 02:23:45.740]
How did that hooker ring in down a candle coming from?

[02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:46.720]
Which one would that be, Neil?

[02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:48.560]
Yeah, the one with the cops that were all screwing out.

[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:49.520]
Oh, that doesn't happen.

[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:50.680]
That doesn't happen, South.

[02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:51.320]
Oh, that's right.

[02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:51.660]
Yeah.

[02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:53.240]
How did that happen?

[02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:55.300]
I don't know.

[02:23:55.300 --> 02:23:56.180]
I don't know.

[02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:56.340]
I don't know.

[02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:56.360]
Exactly.

[02:23:56.900 --> 02:23:57.520]
You just disappeared.

[02:23:57.800 --> 02:23:58.340]
How did it happen?

[02:23:58.440 --> 02:23:58.560]
Yeah.

[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:01.160]
Keep reading that paper with all the colorful pictures in it, Sir.

[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:02.440]
You might learn something in there.

[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.380]
Would you ever learn anything reading these local papers?

[02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:05.620]
No.

[02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:05.880]
No.

[02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:07.720]
See, everybody's raven about the Harold.

[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:12.240]
Even I gave him brownie points where an investigative series all over his years too late about the airport scandal and everything.

[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:13.580]
And about American Airlines.

[02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:15.920]
But then, does it already follow up?

[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:16.140]
No.

[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:16.380]
No.

[02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:18.280]
No, they got Carl Heiss enough.

[02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:19.740]
They're chasing the allocators and townspeople.

[02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:21.520]
So, he's running around in his rubber raincoat.

[02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:24.940]
Here's the mobile and curl springs.

[02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:25.340]
Hello.

[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:26.340]
Hello?

[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:27.000]
Yes, Sir.

[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:28.000]
Neil?

[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:28.780]
Yes, I am.

[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:30.580]
Hey, Neil, what's happening there?

[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:34.560]
Speak to me, Sir.

[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:35.160]
Come on, let's go.

[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:36.080]
It's only a four-hour show.

[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:39.140]
I just want to say, put the lotion in the various shoes.

[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:43.800]
Yeah.

[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:47.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:52.560]
Oh, man.

[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:56.760]
Of course, with this procedure coming up, I guess it's better than saying put it in the rectum.

[02:24:56.900 --> 02:24:57.620]
Oh, no, not for me.

[02:24:58.060 --> 02:24:58.800]
No, thank you.

[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:00.920]
Here's a call.

[02:25:01.100 --> 02:25:02.100]
Oh, sorry about that.

[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:03.280]
Here's a call from my mama.

[02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:03.580]
Hello.

[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:04.600]
How you doing, Neil?

[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:05.140]
Okay, Sir.

[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:07.680]
Hey, your airline starts at 27th of this month.

[02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:09.100]
January 27th?

[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:09.420]
Yes, Sir.

[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:10.520]
My biggest national airline.

[02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:12.900]
Right, I saw it had in a paper about it.

[02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:17.540]
And it's $119 for slippers and $599 for a pair of shoes.

[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.420]
I saw it in a few people like, well, people like you get it free, but.

[02:25:19.900 --> 02:25:21.120]
599 for first class?

[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:21.700]
Yes, Sir.

[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:22.300]
Oh, right.

[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:23.200]
Pretty damn cheap.

[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:24.040]
That's what it said.

[02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:24.540]
Wow.

[02:25:25.100 --> 02:25:26.760]
And it's flying from Miami for a lot of days.

[02:25:26.820 --> 02:25:27.340]
Oh, Miami.

[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:27.980]
Great.

[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:29.780]
I saw it in a state of it.

[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:30.680]
My favorite airport.

[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:32.180]
I like taking a couple of those hand grenades.

[02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:33.000]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:36.780]
I saw it in a state of edition of the Miami Hill, which is just a bunch of piece of trash.

[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:38.120]
It's the one you all got down there.

[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:38.560]
You bet.

[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:41.440]
But anyway, I just, I got a statement request.

[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:42.120]
Yes, Sir.

[02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:44.320]
Gordon is gay for Joe Costello.

[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:46.820]
And Steve Kane, you are a butt clothes.

[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:47.560]
All right.

[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:49.160]
And Joe is a ball-son guy.

[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.580]
There was a call from, uh, from.

[02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:53.060]
Mama.

[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:55.740]
How do you like that?

[02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:57.980]
567, I'm sorry.

[02:25:58.160 --> 02:25:59.380]
I apologize to whoever was on the line.

[02:25:59.460 --> 02:25:59.620]
I need that.

[02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:00.180]
Cut you off.

[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:01.440]
Actually, I put my thumb on it.

[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:06.560]
5670560, pound 560 on the 18 T wireless long world of the long.

[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.280]
So you're going to song.

[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:09.600]
Wonder where everybody went.

[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:10.660]
Where did everybody go?

[02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:11.480]
It's kind of like a mystery.

[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:15.080]
I'm still thinking either because of the dolphin game or maybe because of too much.

[02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:17.340]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:19.740]
For the last several weeks, I'll you notice it's kind of calm down.

[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:20.340]
I'll thank goodness.

[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:21.360]
Thank goodness.

[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:25.380]
Oh, a day without alien is like a day with lots of sunshine.

[02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:26.900]
That's what I would say.

[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:31.340]
It's like a breath of fresh air or day without alien without that.

[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:32.600]
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

[02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:33.040]
God.

[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:34.400]
Give it a freaking rest.

[02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:35.840]
Leave that poor little kid alone.

[02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:41.520]
Yeah, in fact, the lab guys told me that they also had these ball specimens.

[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:43.300]
And remember, when I had this in my stool assessment.

[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:46.160]

falling on the floor laughing and I don't have the copy of the paper with me but

[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:42.240]
it was in the USA today about two weeks ago we got I don't know if it was

[02:29:42.240 --> 02:29:46.540]
international copy or what but they were saying that a group of acidic

[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:54.020]
rabbis have asked their people not to use the internet because it's connected to

[02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:55.940]
pornography they can use the computer

[02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:59.260]
oh yeah that's right let's to make sure you think you wanted to

[02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:16.480]
whatever happened to a filibug man by the way

[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:23.980]
oh yeah service in Florida man my air conditioning works again but the heat

[02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:27.280]
doesn't work now I don't want to say who fixed it a couple weeks ago

[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:32.760]
and then I had my garage door fixed again and just all of these things I mean

[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:35.540]
it's not like you used to be where you'd look at a phone book or you knew

[02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:38.380]
somebody and you'd call them up and they'd come and fix something like the

[02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:41.180]
first time and charge you a fair price now it's just a question of how many

[02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:44.580]
times will they have to return and are they going to gouge anymore is what

[02:30:44.580 --> 02:30:49.420]
it's all about and ordinarily do I really care about whether the heat works in

[02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:51.740]
the house or not no last couple of nights it's like a

[02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:55.560]
freezing in there but I'm not going to call them until after I find till

[02:30:55.560 --> 02:31:00.120]
after they take this tumor out 5 6 7 0 5 60 and you know it's kind of interesting

[02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:02.400]
remember norm can't had that 13 pound tumor removed

[02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:08.140]
I think that stress from Greg Reed is what the

[02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:10.980]
created that would be surprised at all if I got the same damn thing if I got

[02:31:10.980 --> 02:31:13.380]
like a big one in there in a tumor too I'm serious

[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:20.360]
sounds like a massive gigantic lawsuit to me if I survive it like a big fat

[02:31:20.360 --> 02:31:23.940]
lawsuit stress lies BS

[02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:32.340]
got tremendous enthusiasm build up for that big game tonight no the macarena you know it's interesting

[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:37.100]
because I'll listen to like on Hank's driving home and people will actually call and say they

[02:33:37.100 --> 02:33:40.900]
were the heat game the night before we must not have the back to ball crowd which I'm not complaining

[02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:45.180]
about that because I can't imagine why any white person whatever the black people can't afford to

[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:49.660]
go see it and white white people why would a white guy go see a bunch of sparsers seven foot tall

[02:33:49.660 --> 02:33:57.340]
go smack it around in a ball too and I don't get it and it would be furry it would be like finding

[02:33:57.340 --> 02:34:01.060]
a needle in a haystack to find anybody in the audience who was at that game last night because I

[02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:08.180]
am telling you it was vacant in that spacious new Mickey mouse arena they needed that like a lacheng cup

[02:34:09.380 --> 02:34:13.980]
that's what they say in little Havana we needed this like a lacheng cup see one thing about Yiddish

[02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:19.000]
their words that are just so like schmutz you can say and there's some dirt the dirt is like

[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:23.040]
but schmutz you got some schmutz on your face you know I say it in German

[02:34:25.180 --> 02:34:30.120]
26 after one I think there's a word called fired is what you say if you don't stop with a crap we

[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:33.140]
need those spots head cap with nose the scores

[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:40.460]
weeknight only on sports radio 5 60 Q a L

[02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:46.140]
just tell me what you problem

[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:06.780]
like the high-weight

[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:09.780]
The green Martha Stewart.

[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:14.680]
These women must raise their heads

[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:17.380]
and the padded wind and the path

[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:18.180]
and the rain.

[02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:19.940]
Very hard to know.

[02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:22.720]
The green suitors just get the mud

[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:23.800]
and go on the jump.

[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:25.860]
Or just a rainbow.

[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:28.780]
We're just sitting there.

[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:29.380]
Tom.

[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:32.100]
I'm wiping as a hard.

[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:35.000]
The threat she said,

[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.280]
the game is over.

[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:39.340]
The head is full of these circles.

[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:42.720]
When they find out he's made six dribbles,

[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:44.840]
he's watching face to face.

[02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:47.000]
I stand up on his face.

[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:47.560]

[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:52.340]
The dragon is gay.

[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:53.960]
Yeah.

[02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:56.000]
The dragon is gay.

[02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:58.880]
The dragon is gay.

[02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:01.940]
Well, yeah.

[02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:02.060]
Yeah.

[02:36:12.940 --> 02:36:14.600]
We've known the race track.

[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.900]
Lefty kids and doobers.

[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:21.020]
He has the biggest fan club.

[02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:24.200]
And he sucks just like a hoover.

[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:27.920]
This man's over for his cat.

[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:29.620]
And he's got a face to face.

[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:32.240]
And his daddy likes to hoover.

[02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:34.960]
He's racing out his own faces.

[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:38.480]
This is a face that is wearing red armor.

[02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:40.640]
And his fans are falling behind.

[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:44.520]
When they find out he's made six dribbles,

[02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:46.680]
he's watching face to face.

[02:36:47.300 --> 02:36:48.860]
I stand up on his face.

[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:49.160]
Yeah.

[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:54.560]
The dragon is gay.

[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:56.620]
Woo!

[02:36:58.300 --> 02:37:00.140]
You are gay.

[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:03.520]
You're so fair.

[02:37:04.460 --> 02:37:05.220]
Woo!

[02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:06.680]
Woo!

[02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:08.120]
Woo!

[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:08.160]

[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:08.160]

[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:08.160]

[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:08.180]

[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:10.260]
Woo!

[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:11.080]
Woo!

[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:12.120]
Woo!

[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:13.560]
Woo!

[02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:15.840]
Woo!

[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:15.840]

[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:16.400]

[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:18.440]
Woo!

[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:20.040]
Woo!

[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:23.140]
Woo!

[02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:33.000]
133-550-W-T-A-M-560-050-050-050-050-080-18-2 wireless line.

[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:33.820]
Here's four Myers.

[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:34.140]
Hello.

[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:37.000]
Oh, Neil O'Wide's stage.

[02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:37.740]
Please, sir.

[02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:39.340]
Excuse me, a little speaking, magnetic.

[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:42.460]
I got a benign tumor story for you.

[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:43.080]
I'd appreciate it.

[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:43.340]
Yes.

[02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:46.840]
I was dating this girl when I was in college.

[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:48.520]
And she thought that she was pregnant.

[02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:50.340]
And she wanted to get checked.

[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:51.940]
And in turn, now she had this large tumor

[02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:54.280]
and sought her out the size of grapefruit.

[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:55.320]
And they had it removed.

[02:37:55.940 --> 02:37:57.200]
And it was completely benign,

[02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:59.640]
if I could have had a fragment of bone and teeth in it.

[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:03.160]
And what the doctor said, this is a kind of a vestigial twin

[02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:06.340]
that just began to grow in her in her early 20s.

[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:08.020]
And...

[02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:08.720]
Is she an alien?

[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:09.920]
No, no.

[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:11.900]
But maybe it's a fairly common thing.

[02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:13.880]
Did she know Sigourney Reaver or Rick?

[02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:14.740]
No.

[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:15.320]
Or Bob?

[02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:17.380]
But I was thinking, no, if it turns out,

[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:19.060]
it could be like your long-awed twin brother.

[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:19.960]
That could be it, yeah.

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:21.720]
You could bring it into work with formaldehyde.

[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:22.800]
Could be like Elvis's brother.

[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:23.320]
Yeah.

[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:24.600]
Maybe a little kitty story.

[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:25.580]
Maybe it is Elvis.

[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:27.140]
Maybe he's trying to make a comeback.

[02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:28.440]
Maybe he's trying to force his way out.

[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:30.700]
I have a serious question for you, though.

[02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:32.920]
I think it's a viral thing is what I think.

[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:34.780]
At least I'm hoping, because I'm not really looking forward to it,

[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:36.600]
like a seven or eight-pound tumor.

[02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:38.480]
But I don't think they're going to find anything.

[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:41.000]
I just don't have any confidence that can diagnose anything.

[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.980]
Well, it could very easily be nothing,

[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:45.060]
even if it is a tumor, it could be totally benign.

[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:45.360]
Yeah.

[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:47.420]
And something freaky to boot.

[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:48.080]
Right.

[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:50.320]
I have a serious question for you, though.

[02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:52.540]
And I know that you rag on religion alone.

[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:54.560]
We talked about religion, and I'm kind of anti-religious.

[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:57.020]
But what about this stuff that's going on in China,

[02:38:57.200 --> 02:38:58.160]
and what the phone is going on,

[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:00.400]
and what's as far as the persecution of...

[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:01.140]
The long-gone?

[02:39:01.420 --> 02:39:01.600]
Long?

[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:02.840]
Yeah.

[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:04.660]
Well, these people are being locked up.

[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:06.680]
I mean, the government decrees that it's...

[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:07.380]
Well, what about them?

[02:39:07.980 --> 02:39:08.920]
What is there to say?

[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:11.380]
I mean, they find some way to repress.

[02:39:11.580 --> 02:39:14.140]
That's the way we press it, totalitarian government's work.

[02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:15.940]
But what do we say to...

[02:39:15.940 --> 02:39:16.600]
What do people that are...

[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:17.460]
The people that are in the square...

[02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:18.480]
Well, we're screaming about religion.

[02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:19.600]
They were screaming about freedom,

[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:20.680]
but the making difference,

[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:23.060]
because they made an offer that couldn't refuse.

[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:25.780]
And there are a bunch of corrupt barbarians over there.

[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:27.100]
So what should we...

[02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:28.020]
I mean, what does Americans...

[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:28.500]
What should we do?

[02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:30.000]
I mean, how do we respond to it?

[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:31.300]
How do we buy so much stuff?

[02:39:31.460 --> 02:39:34.440]
It's just almost possible to find things in the store that aren't made in China.

[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:36.640]
The American public only cares about one thing.

[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:37.940]
Is the work in the price right?

[02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:38.740]
That's all we care about.

[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:40.660]
We don't care about freedom.

[02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:43.920]
Well, I mean, I guess as far as you're Jewish,

[02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:45.780]
and I'm right, I'm...

[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:47.580]
I guess, but I mean...

[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:47.760]
Oh!

[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:50.420]
If somebody had, you know, spoke up

[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:52.820]
of the American people that spoke up in the 1930s...

[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:54.420]
The American people didn't care.

[02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:55.080]
Don't you understand?

[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:57.140]
We were all isolationists back in the 1930s.

[02:39:57.340 --> 02:39:58.740]
That was the last thing that they wanted

[02:39:58.740 --> 02:40:00.000]
was to get involved in the war.

[02:40:02.100 --> 02:40:02.820]
That's right.

[02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:05.500]
And if it weren't for the fact that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor,

[02:40:05.500 --> 02:40:06.420]
there wouldn't have been any...

[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:08.340]
We wouldn't have been involved in the first place until maybe they were

[02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:11.440]
like coming into San Francisco with their bratwurst, you know?

[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:14.040]
Although I do like the German bratwurst.

[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:16.100]
German sausages, dude.

[02:40:16.460 --> 02:40:16.800]
Oh, yeah.

[02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:18.000]
And the bratwurst ain't bad either.

[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:18.760]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:21.200]
Nothing like a delicious German sausage.

[02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:23.340]
I'll tell you that in Berlin or in Kohl, in Kohl.

[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:26.440]
Are you back on that Kohl and again?

[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:27.900]
Jesus Christ almighty.

[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:28.940]
Will you give it a rest, please?

[02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:30.720]
Let that thing heal up a while.

[02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:36.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:37.280]
Here's a call in Bokeh.

[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:37.480]
Hello?

[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:38.460]
Hey, Neil.

[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:39.200]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:41.360]
Didn't you think it was weird earlier this week, you know?

[02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:43.460]
All those dolphins down in the Keith started beating.

[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:46.160]
Yeah, just as weird as the 85 calls we had about yesterday.

[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:47.460]
And it was just as exciting then.

[02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:53.400]
Boring as a...

[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:55.560]
News flash.

[02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:57.580]
President Lincoln enjoyed to play a lot.

[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:04.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:06.340]
Here's Miami.

[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:06.680]
Hello?

[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:07.820]
Neil.

[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:08.360]
Yes, sir.

[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:12.180]
Hey, my friend of mine had one of those surgeries done for up a 9-2-Mur.

[02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:18.120]
And basically, it was so full, you know, it was so full, you know, for a couple of weeks.

[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:19.580]
But, you know, about...

[02:41:20.180 --> 02:41:24.140]
I'd say he was up on his feet with about three full weeks after the surgery.

[02:41:24.140 --> 02:41:25.680]
Well, first of all, let me say this.

[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:27.840]
Why does everybody all of a sudden assume I have a tumor?

[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:30.500]
Because I don't have pain, or even on places, in different places,

[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:32.960]
which you would have to be one hell of a big tumor for that.

[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:33.120]

[02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:34.800]
I don't... I wouldn't think it is.

[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:39.860]
In the audience, all of a sudden is doing instant diagnosis, which at least they're making a shot, which is more than doctors.

[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:41.000]
So, well, here's the thing.

[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:48.200]
I wouldn't think so because I had my appendix ripped out and I know exactly what it feels like to have something totally have stuck inside you.

[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:48.560]
Really?

[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:52.100]
Well, in other words, it aches in one spot, right? It's constant?

[02:41:52.100 --> 02:41:55.400]
Exactly. And it felt like I was near death.

[02:41:55.700 --> 02:41:55.840]
Yeah.

[02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:04.100]
But, hey, and getting back to the Ileon thing that I hate to talk about it, but I was downtown waiting for my plus.

[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:06.460]
And all of the major TV stations are there.

[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:07.740]
Can't decide the federal court out.

[02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:12.540]
So, it looks like there's something going on and it's going to be another Ileon frenzy again this evening.

[02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:14.460]
Well, thank God we played a game in Broward tonight.

[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:14.960]
Thank you.

[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:15.760]
Thank you for warning.

[02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:16.020]

[02:42:16.780 --> 02:42:17.920]
All right. You're at the copa.

[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:18.500]
Thanks.

[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:19.280]
Not.

[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:25.460]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line.

[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:29.020]
It's a big tumor man. It's like a bowling ball.

[02:42:29.980 --> 02:42:34.740]
I'm starting to give like other associated sorted, you know, little likes and just from here and all this crap.

[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:39.020]
21 before 2 at 5 60 WQA.

[02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:45.280]
The sports leader sports radio 5 60 Q.A.M.

[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:51.460]
Suck it in and hold it.

[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:47.300]
It's like shopping for three toys better.

[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:04.060]
You've got your Pokemon t-shirt and your making out here.

[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:06.560]
You've had your fun.

[02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:07.640]
Starts acting.

[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:10.740]
So they can get you out of here.

[02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:14.640]
It's at the point where we can't stand it.

[02:44:16.100 --> 02:44:17.420]
Everybody's not enough.

[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:20.700]
I'm all the movie young striker.

[02:44:22.060 --> 02:44:23.820]
Rupert's done is far enough.

[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:27.320]
Hey, hey, hey, young starless.

[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:30.300]
Why don't you go home?

[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:31.940]
Why don't you go home?

[02:44:32.260 --> 02:44:33.860]
Hey, hey, young starless.

[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:34.680]
I'm so mullian.

[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:36.000]
I'm so mullian.

[02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:37.600]
I feel lazy.

[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:40.840]
Look, they're giving away three SNH green cards.

[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:41.940]
Can I have one?

[02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:44.040]
I'm dying of it.

[02:44:55.140 --> 02:44:57.840]
One 45 on 5 60 WQA.

[02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:00.600]
I was just saying Josh Friedman still lives and that's the bad news.

[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:02.420]
Anyway, where we going next?

[02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:06.800]
I can't wait to go to hockey games tonight.

[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:10.440]
I can like spend all over my seat and spread it around a little bit.

[02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:14.260]
And then I can let everybody come up and take a close look at my canker sir on my lip.

[02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:18.660]
And if you look real good, maybe I'll be in kiss you like I'm a lips too.

[02:45:20.460 --> 02:45:22.120]
Here's a mobile on West Palm Beach.

[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:22.380]
Hello.

[02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:23.660]
Hello, Leo.

[02:45:24.900 --> 02:45:25.620]
Hey, Malparillo.

[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:26.580]
I'm not going to be a Nazi.

[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:30.540]
Meaning you don't know.

[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:34.400]
That's something about nobody being bored or has anything been bored or I don't know.

[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:35.900]
Oh, I missed the first part.

[02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:37.640]
What do you say mama?

[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:37.980]
What?

[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:42.420]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T wireless line.

[02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:45.880]
That's what happens when you got a bunch of no-speak in English.

[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:47.900]
People run around and go, bap bap bap bap bap.

[02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:49.880]
Even the George don't know what hell he's talking about.

[02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:51.340]
Here's Virginia key.

[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:51.660]
Hello.

[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:53.020]
Hey, I'm Neil. How are you?

[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:56.460]
Great. I had to call you about that Nazi tumor the guy was telling you about.

[02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:56.740]
Yeah.

[02:45:56.940 --> 02:45:58.420]
It's called a dermoid tumor.

[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:01.860]
And I don't know if you remember they had a Guinness book show a while back.

[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:03.000]
I think you talked about on your show.

[02:46:03.060 --> 02:46:04.780]
Someone had a 300-and-some pound tumor.

[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:07.220]
Maybe that's what I got. Maybe I really only weigh about 40 pounds.

[02:46:07.220 --> 02:46:08.340]
I just have a big tumor.

[02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:11.440]
She, after the tumor was removed, she weighed 146 pounds.

[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:13.260]
Wow. It was a dermoid tumor now.

[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:17.040]
What the gross thing about dermoid tumors is it's differentiated tissue.

[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:21.640]
Meaning you'll get hair, fingernails, and even teeth growing inside in this lumpy mask.

[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:22.340]
And your body.

[02:46:23.260 --> 02:46:23.620]
Wow.

[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.740]
So it's not really a point like the guy said.

[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:30.680]
It's just an actual tissue that differentiates into all those weird things that your skin grows into.

[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:33.020]
I do have a light polymer.

[02:46:33.260 --> 02:46:33.800]
You know what those are?

[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:34.360]
No.

[02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:37.500]
Or like my golden reachiroid dogs get them as you get older.

[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:40.400]
If you're old and fat or even like middle age fat, they're like lumps.

[02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:44.240]
They're like not in the internal organs, but they're like in the folds of the skin, you know?

[02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:44.660]
Yeah.

[02:46:44.740 --> 02:46:45.600]
And all they are is annoying.

[02:46:46.020 --> 02:46:48.700]
So maybe they'll yank that out or something.

[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:50.040]
Yeah, I think they're all set at the same time.

[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:51.080]
Okay.

[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:54.720]
And also, I just wanted to say, all these stupid people that are calling up and worrying about the dolphins.

[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:57.600]
Let me tell you, they aren't actually doing neck-ropsies on these dolphins.

[02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:02.400]
So there are things being done just to lay weight to some of the rumor-milk connections.

[02:47:02.460 --> 02:47:03.560]
Well, they don't care about that.

[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:07.440]
All they're worried about is that they're trying to make a joke out of it because the dolphins are stunk.

[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:08.020]
Yeah.

[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:08.840]
And they're in football.

[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:09.700]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:11.240]
They don't care about dolphins.

[02:47:11.380 --> 02:47:12.220]
They don't care about animals.

[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:13.340]
They're not dog lovers.

[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:14.220]
They're not animal lovers.

[02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:15.120]
They look at a mirror.

[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:16.420]
They hate themselves, these people.

[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:18.780]
And you show me somebody's not a dog lover.

[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:20.440]
And I'll tell you right now, he's an asshole.

[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:21.380]
He's on a shadow who does.

[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:23.480]
Here's Miami.

[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:23.840]
Hello.

[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:27.120]
Listen, you were talking about the Miami Marine earlier.

[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:28.360]
Yes.

[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:32.340]
They played a team last night at 5-1.

[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:33.300]
They're the worst team in the league.

[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:35.240]
Okay, my point is this.

[02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:37.720]
So wait, but they sold 19,000 tickets.

[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:40.420]
Why does somebody buy a ticket if they're not going to plan on going?

[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:46.260]
Well, if you looked at the game that's there on TV, a lot of the seats that are sold are the seats that are empty.

[02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:47.440]
Where the seats are way down below.

[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:48.940]
I mean, you can, you know, those seats are painful.

[02:47:49.180 --> 02:47:50.820]
There were seats empty all over the place.

[02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:56.840]
I mean, they showed, they, you know, they took back the shot from a distance in the middle of the first quarter.

[02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:58.400]
And I was on the highlights this morning.

[02:47:58.420 --> 02:47:59.160]
There was nobody there.

[02:47:59.160 --> 02:47:59.880]
It was half empty.

[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:00.960]
Well, I understand that.

[02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:01.480]
Yeah, that's true.

[02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:03.360]
Now, my thing is, little worse team in the league.

[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:04.460]
Now, my question is with the parents.

[02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:08.700]
Now, when the parents were at Miami Arena, they sold out every single game.

[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:09.840]
For a long time, yeah.

[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:10.140]
Exactly.

[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:11.880]
But again, the capacity was much smaller.

[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:12.500]
Well, that's true.

[02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:15.340]
But since they moved to Broward County, okay, they haven't sold out.

[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:16.800]
And, you know, that's not true.

[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.780]
Last year, they sold out the hell of a lot of games.

[02:48:18.780 --> 02:48:20.640]
It's just this year they haven't sold out one.

[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:22.480]
Yeah, but this year, last year, they had a terrible team.

[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:23.400]
This year, they got a good team.

[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:24.180]
They can't sell out.

[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:28.700]
And not only that, but the attendance has been even below what it was at Miami Arena.

[02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:30.660]
No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not.

[02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:34.520]
The attendance average is about four or five hundred more than the older arena held.

[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:35.700]
Well, I don't know.

[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:36.820]
I see a lot of NPCs when I go.

[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:37.440]
Right.

[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:39.920]
Because the place holds over 19,000 people.

[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:40.980]
Well, it's, but what are you saying?

[02:48:41.100 --> 02:48:41.560]
What's the reason?

[02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:43.320]
I don't know what the reason is.

[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:47.020]
I just think that a lot of the ticket holders in Dave County just, just been renewed.

[02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:49.300]
Then part of that is true.

[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:51.520]
And a lot of people that did buy tickets, they don't show up.

[02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:52.480]
That's true.

[02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:53.200]
Okay, pal.

[02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:53.740]
All right.

[02:48:54.500 --> 02:48:59.160]
Maybe if we stop blocking the roads off in Dave County, let those people have, you know, get on the roads and go where the hell they want to go.

[02:48:59.200 --> 02:48:59.840]
You think that might help?

[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:00.180]
I don't know.

[02:49:00.260 --> 02:49:00.840]
Am I doing it?

[02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:04.800]
I'll be racing there.

[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:06.360]
I don't care if I have to be there on a gurney.

[02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:07.860]
Just wheel me in there.

[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:08.840]
I gotta see that game tonight.

[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:09.300]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:09.640]
Uh-huh.

[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:11.720]
Just keep Josh Friedman the hell away from me.

[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.780]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.

[02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:19.560]
There's, there's just no legitimate, there's no answer for it.

[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:23.600]
This is just a horse in Bucky Town and the people got a million different excuses.

[02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:24.780]
But there's no answer.

[02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:30.100]
If things aren't set up just exactly the right way and it isn't just the right team and on the right day.

[02:49:30.140 --> 02:49:32.100]
The moon isn't in the right phase and whatever.

[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:33.540]
Uh, they're not going to be bothered.

[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:34.600]
They're too busy.

[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:36.180]
They're too busy sitting home.

[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:38.160]
I'm literally, you know, how come we're in?

[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:39.460]
By the way, we just ain't on tonight.

[02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:42.920]
Yeah, Tuesday Thursday and Saturday now.

[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:44.340]
Read the saying on tonight.

[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:47.760]
So no more doctors are lawyers from Miami winning a million bucks on the air tonight.

[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:49.380]
It's not a good show.

[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:50.840]
It's not a good show.

[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:54.980]
So dumb and for a million bucks, how far is the earth from the sun?

[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.720]
I'm sitting there screaming at the TV before they put the earth in.

[02:49:58.040 --> 02:49:59.280]
93 million miles.

[02:49:59.940 --> 02:50:01.360]
Learn that in grade school.

[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:07.460]
So for a million bucks, they give them a marshmallow and for like 2000s.

[02:50:07.460 --> 02:50:08.840]
Like what?

[02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:14.360]
Name the 16 dogs that Maya Angelou owned before she came out of the closet.

[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:16.000]
Yeah, some stupid thing like that.

[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:17.360]
I'm going to what is that?

[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:21.240]
I'm pretty wouldn't HMO is man.

[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:22.000]
It's a piece of Schmidt.

[02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:23.380]
That's what an HMO is.

[02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:28.900]
Jim Mandage talks sports weekend right now on sports radio 560.

[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:31.200]
Where's my me?

[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:35.180]
Treat your family to a Cuban Italian meal that'll have a lion industry.

[02:50:35.180 --> 02:50:37.440]
Thomas Rigoloto Rigatoni.

[02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:38.600]
Homemade maclone.

[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:41.300]
They buy thousands of vegan-naked women in hair nets.

[02:50:41.620 --> 02:50:45.880]
You'll bang your fist on the table with every demand and threats that's printed on every noodle.

[02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:48.840]
Like you can't let them leave us to eat the baby Jesus.

[02:50:49.220 --> 02:50:51.180]
Or life ain't hard with libidod.

[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:53.740]
Rigoloto Rigatoni won't stick to the pot.

[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:55.000]
So clean up is easy.

[02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:55.720]
No more.

[02:50:56.060 --> 02:50:56.560]
Tomah.

[02:50:57.020 --> 02:50:58.380]
Don't be a front-running pony.

[02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:00.160]
Give a Rigoloto Rigatoni.

[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:00.760]
Come on.

[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:02.760]
Okay, 155 at 550 WDQM.

[02:51:03.540 --> 02:51:05.240]
Well, I can't wait to go home and drink some more of that good.

[02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:05.640]
Good.

[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:06.340]
Good man.

[02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:07.740]
That's three o'clock sharp.

[02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:09.700]
Where are we going?

[02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:11.060]
Here's a mobile in Ojias.

[02:51:11.140 --> 02:51:11.320]
Hello.

[02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:12.820]
Uncle Nail.

[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:13.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:18.400]
I hate beating a dead horse, but I just have to say something about this.

[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:18.960]
Go ahead, pal.

[02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:21.600]
Beat on this alien thing here, the alien.

[02:51:22.140 --> 02:51:28.640]
I saw the lawyer on Channel 7 last night saying they don't want to send them back because all that will happen is Castro will take...

[02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:29.160]
I saw that.

[02:51:29.220 --> 02:51:29.620]
I saw that.

[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:31.420]
That was the Jew lawyer with a schmata on his head.

[02:51:31.460 --> 02:51:32.500]
Yes, but the Jew had a fight.

[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:32.760]

[02:51:32.900 --> 02:51:34.820]
We'll see you around saying what a victory.

[02:51:35.220 --> 02:51:37.660]
Oh, what in the hell are they doing down here?

[02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:39.140]
Right, making a circus out of it.

[02:51:39.640 --> 02:51:40.840]
There's no freaking difference.

[02:51:41.060 --> 02:51:50.200]
And not only that, but look at all the politicians from who aren't anywhere near Florida or South Florida who have nothing to do with this who all of a sudden are chiming in on this crap.

[02:51:50.780 --> 02:51:51.640]
Yeah, both of them.

[02:51:51.640 --> 02:51:54.260]
I quite isn't that I and S call the US marshals.

[02:51:54.260 --> 02:51:59.420]
The US marshals will go to the house, pick you in a room on a little puddle jumper and send them home.

[02:51:59.480 --> 02:51:59.920]
Good point.

[02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:02.300]
Come on. They've made the ruling. Why aren't they enforcing it?

[02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:04.800]
I think about 11 o'clock tonight would be good when everybody's asleep.

[02:52:05.360 --> 02:52:05.760]
All right. Good.

[02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:06.740]
I'll meet you there.

[02:52:06.940 --> 02:52:07.140]
Okay.

[02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:09.340]
About 2.30 in the morning would be good.

[02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:09.880]
What do you say?

[02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:13.860]
Oh no, they're standing by an alert.

[02:52:14.060 --> 02:52:15.300]
Joe Basuto there.

[02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:16.520]
He's got them all standing by.

[02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:22.200]
Ready to start hopping up and down like a bunch of almost Mexican jumping beans almost.

[02:52:22.760 --> 02:52:24.700]
Is there such a thing as a Cuban jumping being?

[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:27.880]
How's that horse meat coming by the way?

[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:29.740]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:31.880]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:33.340]
How are you doing? All right.

[02:52:33.680 --> 02:52:35.900]
Seems like you got a bunch of doctors calling you today.

[02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:37.040]
Everybody to next for you.

[02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:38.540]
I got a tumor.

[02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:40.120]
I got teeth in the hair.

[02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:42.680]
I mean, I really hate to hear that.

[02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:44.500]
You know, you've been psyched out for the tumors today.

[02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:45.300]
Right.

[02:52:45.300 --> 02:52:45.980]
Wow. Yeah.

[02:52:46.220 --> 02:52:48.220]
Neil, the reason I'm calling, um,

[02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:49.500]
Elian, right?

[02:52:50.180 --> 02:52:52.160]
If he is sent back to Cuba,

[02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:56.120]
you think that dog would go back with him because I mean, he's gotten attached to the dog.

[02:52:56.480 --> 02:52:59.820]
And I mean, I would have very right to protest because that dog is American.

[02:53:00.140 --> 02:53:00.840]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[02:53:00.980 --> 02:53:03.260]
Maybe we made me forget granted dog US citizenship.

[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:04.220]
You ever think about that?

[02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:05.060]
Yeah, really.

[02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:11.340]
Better get it in the horn to Ilyana Gross, Rosanna Dana and tell her we got a granted dog citizenship to get him one of those US dog tags.

[02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:12.700]
I mean, that dog goes to Cuba.

[02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:13.920]
They'll ease him in two days.

[02:53:13.920 --> 02:53:14.800]
You could be.

[02:53:14.860 --> 02:53:16.460]
Yeah, you can feed a family of us.

[02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:18.980]
I tell you what, I tell you what, I get a good thing they gave me a pony for a gift.

[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:22.120]
Oh, that was bad.

[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:23.080]
That was terrible.

[02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:25.760]
Where'd you get that thing with a Cuban horse meat anyway?

[02:53:26.680 --> 02:53:29.200]
I just made that up to piss off George and he's on the phone now anyway.

[02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:30.760]
Here's a hi, Ilyah.

[02:53:30.840 --> 02:53:31.000]
Hello.

[02:53:34.980 --> 02:53:36.200]
Oh, what is that?

[02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:37.240]
Oh, he was still on there.

[02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:42.860]
He said Josh Friedman is so he's an asshole.

[02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:43.680]
Effing fat.

[02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:45.000]
Yeah, he really is.

[02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:51.860]
Which you know, I know a lot of fat people like my friend fat rich and there's me and Hank and there's fat people who are good people.

[02:53:52.160 --> 02:53:57.100]
And then there's fat people like Josh Friedman who are assholes and despised by all universally.

[02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:05.400]
I mean that for Bluff Lindsay, who's usually so kind of like wishy washy and weak need to go out of here this morning yelling about Josh Friedman.

[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:06.100]
He's an asshole.

[02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:08.240]
I thought that was a pretty ballsie move on his part.

[02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:13.160]
Just ask my good buddy Ray Whitney what he thinks about Josh Friedman.

[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:13.960]
He's an asshole.

[02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:14.580]
He'll tell you.

[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:19.640]
And by the way, Josh, if I were you, I wouldn't hang around in practice too much down there too close to number 14.
