560-72 AMI, ME 4 Waterdale presents the best of Neil Rogers.

[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.360]
No live calls will be taken today. Neil is on tape.

[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.280]
Okay, that's me. For many this, but it's not.

[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.660]
Please don't call. The opinion served on the Neil Rogers show are those of the hosting scholars

[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.260]
and do not necessarily reflect the views of easily need that position.

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.260]
Or the beastly broadcast group.

[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.420]
Its management or anyone else for that matter.

[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.240]
Now remember, this is the best of Neil. Do not call.

[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.020]
Put the damn phone down.

[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.220]
Just relax and enjoy. On 560-2 AM.

[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.740]
560-2 AMI, ME 4 Waterdale presents the best of Neil.

[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.000]

[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.040]
360-2 AMI, ME 4 Waterdale presents the best of Neil.

[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.220]

[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.880]
360-2 AMI, ME 4 Waterdale presents the best of Neil.

[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.460]
360-2 AMI, ME 4 Waterdale presents the best of Neil.

[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.420]
Peekaboo Street My Ass.

[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.040]
Does this tell you what's wrong with the world today?

[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.640]
And how those poor Canadians, man, those poor bastards,

[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.060]
they lost their gold medal because this gabriotti guy, this goofball,

[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.780]
tested positive for pot.

[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.040]
Now pot stays in your system for like a month, three to four weeks.

[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.180]
Now I think the whole thing is ridiculous at best because certainly Mara Gowini is not a performance enhancing drug

[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.120]
by any stretch of the imagination, no way Jose, unless your contest is an eating contest,

[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.140]
then you've got an edge or a watching TV content.

[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.800]
But other than that, I mean, if anything, it would be a performance dulling.

[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.880]
So maybe three, four weeks this guy is so stupid that he smokes some weed back in Canada,

[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.280]
which of course is very commonplace to say the worst, extremely commonplace,

[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.860]
like I'm on Young Street and Church Street all over Toronto way.

[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.980]
And I'm sure in Vancouver, even in Moose Drop, wherever this guy is from.

[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.620]
He's probably from Whistler, BC or someplace like that.

[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.580]
Oh yeah.

[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.120]
He is from Kitchener and the Medicine Hat and Whistler, eh?

[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.720]
What a silly bunch of people.

[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.040]
I mean, love Toronto, but what a silly bunch of people.

[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.780]
And in any rate, so it's so stupid, these guys practice their whole life,

[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.600]
to do the silly crap and go over there because it's such an honor and such a big deal.

[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.280]
And the smoking dope like three or four weeks before they go over there.

[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.540]
So on the one hand, naturally, it's stupid.

[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.080]
And just like now, there's an article in the Sunsettle,

[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.260]
which hasn't learned about that yet.

[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.780]
I guess because they're sleeping, but pot testing gains support for the NBA

[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.720]
and some of the NBA biggest stars, favorite mandatory testing of players from marijuana,

[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.480]
breaking ranks with the players union.

[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.080]
And it goes on about Chris Weber and Isaiah Ryder and this one and that one and the Peekaboo Street

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.620]
and it's said her and so on.

[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.200]
Joe says that the guy says that he got it from second hand smoke at his going away party.

[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.700]
Second hand smoke.

[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.620]
Yeah, like it sounds like Bill Clinton now.

[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.420]
We're kind of like a second hand blowjob.

[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.360]
That's going to be the new excuse after today.

[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.680]
After the grand jury testimony was second hand job job.

[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.660]
Oh, sorry.

[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.640]
Can't say that.

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.600]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.020]
Oh, I'll guarantee it was more than a second hand job.

[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.880]
Well, at any rate.

[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.880]
I wanted it.

[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.760]
Hey, dude.

[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.440]
Jennifer Capriotti here.

[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.780]
And when I'm at the left and ball on the court, I'm getting stoned off my ass.

[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.400]
And I get my best hit off the Jennifer Capriotti, cut his ball, can bomb.

[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.600]
That's right.

[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.360]
It's the Jennifer Capriotti, tennis ball, can bomb.

[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.520]
Cups will never suspect it.

[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.680]
It isn't looking bad.

[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.100]
Just empty the balls.

[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.360]
Screw on the ball.

[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.300]
Fill it with water and you're set to destroy brain cells.

[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.380]
The Jennifer Capriotti way.

[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.940]
Oh, this is so smooth.

[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.540]
It's the bomb that thinks it's a tennis ball can.

[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.800]
A tennis ball can that thinks it's a bomb.

[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.260]
First needs benefit.

[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.640]
The Jennifer Capriotti legal defense, but normal approved.

[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.680]
Okay, so that big goofy David Robinson, all star center of the San Antonio Spurs says we should be tested.

[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.160]
It's an old brainer, meaning marriage or winning.

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.180]
And I said to you, David Robinson, you're an asshole.

[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.660]
Okay, and a goody-two shoes in the phone.

[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.680]
Why is it anybody's business?

[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.560]
Unless it affects somebody's performance, why is it anybody's business in any profession?

[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.460]
All this mandatory drug testing and all these different jobs now.

[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.300]
It's nothing more than a goddamn witch hunt.

[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.800]
And it's nobody's business if you're smoking weed.

[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.800]
Well, it's illegal.

[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.720]
So are a lot of positions in sex, too.

[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.400]
Okay, but that doesn't mean that it's anybody's goddamn business.

[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.800]
Oh, it's picking up positions in sex.

[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.000]
I'm at Monty's house.

[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.120]
I'm going to have to start taking notes every week she comes up with another classic.

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.000]
Now she's decided that probably the president must be gay.

[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.160]
And I said, why would you say that with all these women that he's doing?

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.020]
Oh, but he likes oral sex.

[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.420]
Forget notes.

[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.240]
You need to rotate.

[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.860]
Oh, my God.

[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.660]
Talk about out of touch with reality.

[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.920]
Talk about from a very distant generation of the long, long past.

[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.840]
And I try to explain to her my all men like oral sex.

[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.280]
Ah, of course, she just went out to her next topic.

[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.060]
Well, that explains why your dad so early.

[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.200]
You really want to get me started, don't you?

[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.680]
Even Monica Lewinsky wouldn't do that.

[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.120]
Okay.

[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.620]
For a lover of money, trust me when I tell you.

[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.540]
The thought is so grotesque.

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.680]
The thought of that is so puke inducing that I can't even begin to tell you.

[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.540]
Oh, my God.

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.680]
So no wonder Ma's gotten a version to it.

[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.320]
I think he did make a good point, but in reverse.

[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.100]
But at any rate, yeah, the president's a faggot.

[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.460]
Okay, because he likes oral sex.

[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.960]
So that goes back to the survey we took last week, which most of you lied about, by the way.

[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.640]
But there you are.

[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.040]
Ma thinks the president's a faggot because he likes to oral is moral.

[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.580]
But at any rate, getting back to this weed business, it's nobody's god damn business.

[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.040]
And unless it affects your performance at the orifice, on the playing field,

[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.480]
if it's some stupid god damn sport in the snowboard, whatever the hell this guy is riding over there.

[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.660]
This poor Canadian bastard.

[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.300]
This capriotic gabriotic whatever this guy's name is.

[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.820]
He ain't no peekaboo street.

[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.500]
I'll tell you that.

[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.700]
Listen, they got a curler, a woman curler from Canada.

[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.460]
Her name is Sanda Schmurler.

[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.280]
Sander.

[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.600]
Where the God.

[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.660]
We laughed so hard last night.

[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.820]
I thought I was going to pee in my pants when I heard on the CBC.

[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.540]
They were talking about Sander Schmurler, the woman curler, and she's from Whistler B.C.

[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.460]
Or something like that.

[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.220]
Oh my god.

[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.280]
And you people are taking this seriously.

[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.180]
Any of you?

[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.020]
Oh man.

[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.820]
Sander Schmurler, the lady curler from Whistler B.C.

[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.200]
But she ain't got nothing on peekaboo street.

[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.000]
I'll tell you that.

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.000]
Who is almost as good as I be hip or whatever that the coons name was.

[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.480]
That basketball player from Maryland or Virginia.

[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.840]
Who have it?

[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.900]
Who have it?

[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.100]
Who have it?

[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.100]

[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.100]

[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.100]

[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.660]
Who have it?

[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.100]
Who have it?

[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.760]
Who have it?

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.780]
Who have it?

[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.440]
Who have it?

[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.660]
Who have it?

[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.880]
Who have it?

[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.400]
Who have it?

[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.000]
Who have it?

[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.540]
Who have it?

[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.220]
Who have it?

[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.780]
Who have it?

[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:45.780]

[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.000]

[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.100]
Who have it?

[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.100]

[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.440]
Who have it?

[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.140]
Who have it?

[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.640]
Who have it?

[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:47.840]
Who have it?

[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.760]
Who have it?

[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.460]
Who have it?

[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.780]
Who have it?

[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.820]
Who have it?

[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.940]
Who have it?

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.060]
Who have it?

[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.060]

[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.060]

[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.060]

[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.060]

[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.780]
Who have it?

[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:17.780]

Who have it?

[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.700]
Who have it?

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.060]

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.060]

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.060]

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.160]
Who have it?

[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.200]

[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.760]
Why did you take me alive?

[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.060]
You didn't even get the tattoo.

[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.040]
That'd be a good little pet character and go back to your office.

[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.520]
Okay.

[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.220]

[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.180]

[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.480]
In every field you'll never face.

[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.260]
Too bad for David's face.

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.920]
His career could fade cause.

[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.900]
All he has left is that label TV show.

[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.820]
He won't be taking money movies no more.

[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.360]
And you wanted to be just like John Balushi and have John Pantheon these two.

[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.300]
You finally made it.

[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.200]
But we're not too careful what you wish.

[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.600]
You gave us lots of laughter on Saturday night.

[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:26.960]
But you were way too young to die to convince Batman to a side.

[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.960]
Goodbye Chris Farley.

[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.400]
What did you teach him?

[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.120]
Blow up like a big balloon leading like a fool.

[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.620]
That would only bring you certain death.

[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.440]
The farmers are obsessed.

[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:54.920]
And all you left was some cable movies and a few tales of your time.

[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.640]
That will fill to make community fools.

[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:07.580]
And you wanted to be just like John Balushi and have John Pantheon these two.

[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.460]
You finally made it.

[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.820]
But we're not too careful what you wish.

[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.820]
Your past is in hold of piano.

[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.240]
That's it.

[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.180]
Why?

[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.600]
Now you reach the pizza in the sky.

[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.840]
You got so fat you died.

[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.680]
Chris Farley the night they had some broad under one of the tablet shows last night.

[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.360]
The night before he croaked.

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:44.820]
How much heroin and coke and fish food and whatever else he was doing all together.

[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.960]
And vodka on top of it.

[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.240]
You got to wash it down.

[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.200]
You got to wash it down with some good vodka.

[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:50.660]
That's right.

[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.220]
That's what Boris said.

[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.260]
It wasn't bad enough that he was doing a hero.

[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.220]
But he was doing coke too.

[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.360]
So he's dead Chris Farley.

[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:57.800]
There you go.

[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.440]
But I mean this guy comparing.

[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.700]
I mean, oh yeah.

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.860]
They're getting away with enough.

[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.840]
Who cares about that?

[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.220]
Why don't we get all upset if they're beating up their wife and their girlfriend?

[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.460]
Why don't we get upset about that?

[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:13.240]
How come nobody gave a crap at the Jimmy Johnson sign up Lauren Phillips who's nothing but a god damn gangster?

[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.040]
How come nobody cared about that?

[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.880]
But we're concerned if he passes a drug test or not.

[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.340]
That really concerns me with resumption marijuana.

[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.800]
Not whether he's going to be beaten women up all over the place.

[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.360]
What kind of mentality we be talking about in this country, man?

[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:31.420]
We're talking about people that just they can't sit down and look at this thing rationally because most of them are emotional cripples.

[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.040]
Emotional cripples.

[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.700]
And this crap about the NBA is going to do pot testing.

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.220]
David Robinson says, oh yeah, we should also object to what it's a no brainer.

[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.920]
The NBA as a no brainer.

[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.340]
Okay. It's for a bunch of illiterate freaks is what it is.

[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.100]
David Robinson.

[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.200]
You asked whole here's Miami.

[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:47.580]
Hello.

[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.380]
Hey Neil.

[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:48.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.680]
How you doing?

[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.140]
Okay.

[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.260]
We shall pick dogs.

[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.340]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:52.740]
I'm listening.

[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.120]
Okay.

[00:16:53.260 --> 00:17:02.420]
Well, anyway, on the second hand smoke with the marijuana, I have a friend who basically kidnapped smoke because of the government watching over him.

[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:02.940]
Yeah.

[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.300]
And he enjoys burning every couple of times.

[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:12.520]
So when he went to get mandatory, you know, his test and he came back positive.

[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.080]
He told his probation officer.

[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.480]
He's like, oh no, I was in a room with a bunch of people smoking.

[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:25.320]
And the probation officer gave him a bunch of like, I got a great bit for both of Brian by the way of the two in the second hand row.

[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.060]
Second hand smoke, but anyway, go ahead.

[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:38.280]
Anyway, he says that the probation officer gave him a bunch of evidence about how much second hand smoke you had to be in exposed to for you to come back positive for even a minute.

[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:44.280]
You know, you had to be in a room that was spogged up for a couple of hours, you know, constantly breathing it.

[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.600]
Yeah.

[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:53.480]
And I mean, if you smoke pot in the past at any point, if you like to smoke that stuff and you're in a room and they've been smoking it for two hours, you're going to tell me you're not going to take a hit or whatever.

[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.300]
And I mean, snowboarders.

[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.640]
So let me ask you something.

[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.100]
Not a good idea.

[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.300]
Well, no, wait, oh, I want to hear this about snowboarding.

[00:17:59.300 --> 00:17:59.940]
What's here this?

[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.980]
Oh, I mean, snowboarding in the Olympics, who is not going to think that these snowboarders are not pot addicts?

[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.420]
Let me think.

[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.580]
All these guys are watching.

[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.220]
Pot addicts, oh yeah.

[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.500]
I mean, they are the biggest burnouts.

[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.220]
All the surfers I knew in high school.

[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.220]
Yeah, surfers and snowboarders.

[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.260]
There you go.

[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.080]
I love your logic, man.

[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.700]
This is great.

[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.720]
I mean, just follow the bouncing dots.

[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.660]
Here we go from A to Z to T to FU.

[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.020]
Okay, great, great job, pal.

[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.340]
Excellent.

[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.160]
That could have been the greatest call in history.

[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.600]
Oh, man, those chronic pot heads, man, those snowboarders.

[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.580]
I wonder about Sandrich Smurler, the curator.

[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.580]
I wonder what he's doing.

[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.700]
He's probably got her hair up in curvers.

[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.280]
That bitch.

[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.240]
Oh, and Sweden, by the way, one of women's curling mats against Canada.

[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.400]
Oh, my God.

[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.600]
The Canadians, like 95% of all curlers in the world are Canadians.

[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.980]
And they already lost one match between that and maybe losing this gold medal.

[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.180]
They may never come out of hiding.

[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.080]
They may like to start doing like the Eskimos and build igles and go inside and never come out.

[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.340]
Come out, Oop.

[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.040]
Here's a mobile lady in Hollywood.

[00:18:59.240 --> 00:18:59.420]
Hello.

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.440]
Hello, Neil.

[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.200]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:01.900]
Good morning.

[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.340]
I've been to the first time I'm calling you.

[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.360]
However, I listen to you for years and I do admire.

[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.560]
Many of the things that you say.

[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.700]
However, I take issue a little bit this morning with the pot testing with regard to your employment.

[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:26.120]
There are some situations where it is very dangerous to smoke pot, particularly if you like to drink beer, lunch, or even have a drink at lunch and you mix it with the pot.

[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.920]
There are things you can do that you normally wouldn't do.

[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.400]
Like what?

[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:37.240]
Well, for example, I know of a personal experience because it happened to be an insurance agent and we have a very serious situation

[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:44.420]
that occurred in one of our insured business operations where the man did that just that at lunch time.

[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:51.260]
He came back and in a job that he had been working on for 10 years, stuck his hand in the mixing bat and cut it off.

[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:51.800]
All right.

[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.560]
Excellent. Well, let's see, Jim.

[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.700]
I guess he won't be doing that again.

[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.740]
No, I guess he won't.

[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.540]
So what's the problem?

[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.020]
Well, the problem is that drug testing on the job is in many cases very important.

[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.240]
And so if you smoke pot, you shouldn't be doing it while you're working.

[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.160]
I mean, maybe if you're working in a job or a job or a job.

[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:08.780]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:16.380]
You said you shouldn't be doing it while you're working, but if it stays in your system for like up to a month, then how do you know when you're doing it?

[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.420]
Well, I suppose you smoke it recreationally on the weekend at home, not when you're on a job.

[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.540]
Well, I don't know very much about how long it stays in your system.

[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.300]
Well, I just got through telling you up to a month.

[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.360]
Well, that we should be testing after lunch.

[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.280]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.940]
How about booze testing after lunch?

[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.940]
Well, let me tell you something.

[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.420]
And those kinds of things.

[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.380]
How about a little breathalyzer test after lunch?

[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.200]
Well, I don't.

[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.820]
I mean, where do we stop this insanity is what I say.

[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:49.680]
Well, actually, I really do believe that we have become insane with testing, except that in the case of drugs, it is a very important thing in some situation.

[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:56.460]
I'm not saying that we should be testing everybody for everything because we're losing totally our rights in this country.

[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.120]
We don't have any rights in this country.

[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.700]
We have a right to be oppressed by a fascist police state is what we have.

[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.560]
We don't have any rights.

[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.820]
This is a free country.

[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.480]
It's a joke.

[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.580]
Hey, listen, we still have the right to talk to you about these things which makes it a right.

[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:08.960]
Yeah.

[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.660]
Unfortunately, we're limited as to what we can say.

[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.200]
Debbie, you still got to watch your language.

[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.720]
You're the word police are going to come down and take your way.

[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.200]
That's something else again.

[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.800]
I don't agree with that either.

[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.760]
I think if you want to say foul things, you can say them and that shouldn't be oppressed by anybody.

[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.300]
Whether it's on the radio or TV or wherever.

[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:38.660]
The point is that I don't know if you agree to this completely, maybe impartially, you agree that there are certain situations where drug testing,

[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.920]
whether it be marijuana or heroin or whatever, is an important factor.

[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.720]
I would say if you're working in a candy store, then they definitely shouldn't be able to drug testing.

[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.440]
You don't want to be in any kind of a restaurant.

[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.760]
They don't want you to drop it.

[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:49.980]
It's right.

[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.400]
Don't drop.

[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.400]
That would be a good one.

[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.200]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.120]
We have an open line in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60.

[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.200]
Because God forbid, if you smoke weed like two weekends ago and you had a beer for lunch today,

[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.280]
we know that you are a danger to society.

[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.140]
God forbid.

[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.000]
Pizza chef or delivery boys definitely tend to.

[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.560]
That's right.

[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.940]
Chinese food delivery guy, like Don De la Ways, he would never.

[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.260]
He didn't even have to smoke weed.

[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.880]
How do you like that?

[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.480]
And he still had the munchies.

[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.280]
He was a hungry boy.

[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.560]
He was just a big chubby, hungry guy.

[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.040]
That's all.

[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.740]
And he ate all $40 worth of Chinese food on the way back to the house.

[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.100]
Can you imagine if they tested radio management for alcohol after lunch?

[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:26.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.320]
If they went up there right now.

[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.740]
Oh, my God.

[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.600]
How about brain testing for management?

[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.620]
That sounds good to me.

[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.900]
Of course, where there's no sense, there's no feeling.

[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.180]
Here's North Miami.

[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:36.560]
Hello.

[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.380]
Hello.

[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.240]
Yeah, you doing Neil?

[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:39.560]
Great.

[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.020]
I have a question.

[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:42.440]
Yes.

[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.940]
Have two questions and then I want to say something about the five.

[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.720]
How come you can't get ice cream like Italy here?

[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.220]
Because I ate a lot of pistachio.

[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.440]
I don't eat a lot of ice cream, but man, I used to eat it.

[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.820]
I eat it every day in Italy.

[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.280]
But stash or ice cream in Italy.

[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.060]
Jolato, sir.

[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.280]
Jolato is not ice cream.

[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:57.840]
It's jolato.

[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.320]
It's made that doesn't have all that cream.

[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.380]
And it's not all that chalk and artificial crap.

[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.660]
It's made from all natural stuff.

[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.960]
And they don't make it here.

[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.200]
There's, you know, once in a while a place will come along and try to make good jolato.

[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.560]
And even if it is good, the public's tasty or so bad.

[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.000]
Because they're busy eating, briers, and seals.

[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.300]
And they're busy eating.

[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.460]
I don't eat ice cream.

[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.880]
But I was eating it every day twice a day.

[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.600]
Every little shop had it.

[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.060]
Well, when I go to Italy, I eat it a lot and ice cream too.

[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.580]
Hey.

[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.280]
And I have a question for George.

[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.160]
You guys used to have this commercial called Field Extreme Watches.

[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.280]
Was this voice on it?

[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:32.920]
Yes.

[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.380]
Oh, I thought.

[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.320]
He apologized this profusely for it, too.

[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.180]
And if I were to ask a question, if this guy would have been from Amsterdam,

[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.980]
or if he was legal, he would have been from Germany.

[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.840]
And if he was a professional cop, what were they going to say to the guy?

[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.720]
Well, you know, it's interesting because that is a good point.

[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.100]
Merowanna, they were just saying on CNN that Merowanna is not among the substances listed

[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.840]
at the Olympics as being illegal, but that it reverts back to the country and the laws there.

[00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.080]
So if it were one of the Dutch players in like a soccer player, of course,

[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.100]
not playing those soccer in the winter or a little bit, but whatever the Dutch competitors are,

[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.560]
ice skater, then it would not be a problem.

[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.120]
How do you like that?

[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.780]
And Canada says that's blatantly unfair and a bunch of crap and they're a crying foul.

[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:10.580]
Hey.

[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.220]
That's not.

[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.420]
I don't think that's very fair.

[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.100]
How do you like that?

[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.300]
How do you like them, Green Apple, sir?

[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.620]
Those Green Apple, I don't know.

[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.280]
Do I say that this guy, this Grafciano or Greg Gabriotti,

[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.920]
I say he should move to Amsterdam would be a good idea.

[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.140]
Hey, there you go.

[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.180]
At least you'd have a good time.

[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.760]
And as far as drug testing in the workplace.

[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.140]
Yes.

[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:35.900]
Till they can figure out, till they can drug test you at the moment and know how much you've had at that particular moment,

[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.740]
I think they should just band it off together.

[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.060]
Because there's no way that you're going to tell me what I have to do in my house,

[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.100]
in my car, or what I do at any time that I'm not at work.

[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.840]
Because I only work for them for eight hours, not the rest of my day.

[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.560]
So that's the bottom line with that.

[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.640]
Next thing they're going to be doing fish food testing.

[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:51.660]
Hey, there you go.

[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.460]
Yeah, why don't we just survey, let's see, let's pay your back.

[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.680]
I want you to visit see how much food you've been eating.

[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.800]
Right, exactly.

[00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.880]
Yeah, I mean, where do you draw the line?

[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:00.460]
You know what I mean?

[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.240]
Let me get a cute tip and check this woman mouth.

[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.420]
Maybe she's been giving more sex to somebody in the parking lot.

[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.360]
Now you're talking, okay, have a great day.

[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.040]
Okay, sounds like a job he wants.

[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.660]
I did that one time, about 15 years old.

[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.420]
No offense football sports radio 560s.

[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:26.200]
QA&WQAF is proud to bring you the WQAM School of Broadcasting.

Yeah, we have the Jolo's Beginners course.

[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.320]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.320]

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.320]

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.320]

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.320]

[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.320]

[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.280]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.600]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.560]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.420]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.880]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.380]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:29.240]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.620]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.800]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.680]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:39.420]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.680]
We feed after me now.

[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.520]
And now we're here.

[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.040]
We have the HIKES of activism.

[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:54.280]
Ah, and I'll open your books when pages 14,

[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.400]
okay?

[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.420]
Okay, they have to read.

[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.220]
And daaa.

[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.640]
Nah, that's-I want you to re soup.

[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.660]
Oh, okay.

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.780]
Eeeeehh, daaa.

[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.760]
And don't believe this woman's illustrated on the left.

[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.540]
Da, by, by, by, yup, yup, hahahaha.

[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.400]
Aaaaiherei.

[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.940]
the wonderful world of radio.

[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.880]
Ah, radio.

[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.760]
Where you can hear your own voice.

[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.320]
Let the WQAM school of broadcasting provide you

[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.140]
with the essential tools you'll need

[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.380]
to make your wet radio dreams come true.

[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.160]
I mean, a one-quam smooth.

[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.420]
We'll be losing the world.

[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.440]
So anyway, let's do a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:48.700]
Hello?

[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.640]
Neil, can't disagree with you more about the possible thing.

[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.620]
OK, I'm an ex-pot addict from the age of 15 to 25.

[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:56.960]
Yeah.

[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.140]
I'm telling you, I was more dicting than Coke than any other.

[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.560]
I mean, we had to smoke.

[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.220]
And more dicting than fish food, too, I bet.

[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:03.720]
Correct.

[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.360]
You're just being in his pants in the room.

[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.860]
Better take a sample, by the way.

[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.520]
Before we got 38 now, I stopped 13 years ago.

[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.320]
But before we played baseball, we smoked.

[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.740]
Before we went to the movies, we smoked.

[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.360]
Before we had sex, we smoked.

[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.200]
Before anything, we needed pot.

[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.540]
We couldn't do it without pot.

[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.040]
Yeah.

[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.860]
And a lot of my friends are still.

[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.880]
Well, let me ask you this.

[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.980]
As much as I frown upon people who are like obsessed with pot,

[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.800]
because there are people who are juvenile and sit

[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.720]
around sifting and picking seeds all day.

[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.540]
And I think that's a life.

[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.740]
But nevertheless, we got to wait a minute.

[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.400]
Wait a minute.

[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.340]
You've got this green stuff that had no seeds in it.

[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.040]
How did it affect your life?

[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.600]
It affected it tremendously, because it opened the door to,

[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.920]
and you're going to think this is a joke.

[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.140]
It opened the door to Coke.

[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.120]
It opened the door to the fucking gate.

[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:45.600]

[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.640]
No, once you violate your body, that's fine.

[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.920]
So I guess you better never have a beer

[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.060]
because next thing you're going to be talking about.

[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.180]
I never liked beer, but I'm telling you,

[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.380]
it affected me in the workplace.

[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.620]
It affected me driving.

[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.820]
I had a lot of that.

[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.280]
No, but the argument that it's the same argument

[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.020]
as you better never have a beer, because then you're

[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.880]
going to become an alcoholic.

[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.660]
And you're going to start drinking, you know,

[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.980]
sticking vodka bottles in your pocket.

[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.920]
I mean, there are always going to be people

[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.080]
no matter what you're talking about.

[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.420]
They're the alcohol stains of the world.

[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.660]
They're going to go out and eat until they get to be 500 pounds.

[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.060]
Does that mean we should outlaw any foods that are fanding?

[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.440]
No, no, but I, you know why I've changed?

[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.960]
I have two kids of my own now.

[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.800]
And they're 14 and 11 and they're getting to that age

[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.680]
where I remember when I was.

[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.420]
I think, let's say you better stop.

[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:26.700]
Yeah.

[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.900]
No, no, no, I've stopped a long time ago,

[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.300]
but I'm saying now I'm overprotected.

[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.900]
Oh, he can't celebrate the bringing his home.

[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.820]
By parents, like George, there were refugees from Cuba

[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.640]
that came down here.

[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:36.940]
Yeah.

[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.180]
Well, we know humans don't smoke.

[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.940]
We know that.

[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.180]
They didn't know any better.

[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.520]
They were working 14 hours a day.

[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.720]
I was alone at home and all my friends did it.

[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.300]
We did it.

[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.800]
And I'm telling you, I didn't know any.

[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.820]
They didn't know any but I couldn't disagree with you more.

[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.400]
I'm not testing for it.

[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.060]
And I hope they keep it out of everything

[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.240]
because it's just like my life.

[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.520]
You know something I know that when I go over to Holland, man,

[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.600]
every time I've only been in Amsterdam about 30 times,

[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.240]
I'm going to go over there.

[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.960]
It's a miracle that the country can function.

[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:00.460]
You know what?

[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.420]
Well, let me tell you something.

[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.480]
Well, while we were on it, we were less aggressive.

[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:05.740]
Sure.

[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.920]
Let me ask you, have you ever been to Amsterdam?

[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.480]
Never been to Amsterdam.

[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.560]
Well, get on a plane to go there.

[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.280]
You might learn something.

[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.860]
There's a pot added for you there.

[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.920]
Boys and girls, there's a good lesson for everybody.

[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.980]
He's obsessed.

[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.540]
So like the fish food addict,

[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.060]
I say we go to publics right now,

[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.320]
and may enforce them to take it right out of the freezer container

[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.900]
because we have fish food addicts already.

[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.340]
And those people are going to kill themselves

[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.720]
on that crack because they're out of control.

[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.300]
And let's close down every bar

[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.060]
because we got alcoholics.

[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.940]
Let's bring back prohibition, baby.

[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.940]
Let's prohibit everything.

[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.460]
Then we got sex addicts.

[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.940]
Just watch what's his name?

[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.040]
Jerry Springer, he'll do about 20 shows on that this week.

[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.280]
Sex addicts, people who can't get enough.

[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:39.920]
They're doing it.

[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.740]
The NBA they want to do drug testing.

[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.900]
We got a guy of Canadian, the jock.

[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.000]
If a snowboarder can wear a jock strap,

[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.760]
whatever the hell he was,

[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.160]
this guy may lose his gold medal

[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.040]
because he may have actually inhaled a little bit

[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.980]
or may have actually smoked a little bit

[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.000]
or may have actually walked through a room somewhere

[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.260]
where somebody may have smoked it

[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.360]
or not as the case may be.

[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.820]
And they found like a little trace in his...

[00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.320]
Squirt, squirt.

[00:30:59.560 --> 00:30:59.740]
Yeah.

[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.680]
And they're having a nervous breakdown now

[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.100]
because they, you know, suit a fit.

[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:03.880]
What else?

[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.980]
What else can we test for in your system?

[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.700]
Definitely have fish food testing

[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.600]
because we know it makes your blood sugar go way up

[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.360]
and you become irresponsible

[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.540]
and got only nose.

[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.800]
You're going to, you're not fit for driving.

[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.720]
I wouldn't be surprised if they stop

[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.720]
you at street corners now.

[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.700]
It's stoplights and they do

[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.540]
on the spot checks blood sugar tests.

[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.280]
You know, they give you that little pin prick,

[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.040]
if I can say that.

[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.060]
And, yeah, look at my fingertips, man.

[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.120]
Look at all those pin pricks.

[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.560]
That's right, when you die a pedic,

[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.040]
you have a lot of pin pricks

[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.940]
on the tips of your fingers.

[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.200]
But at any rate,

[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.440]
yeah, they're going to be starting

[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.480]
doing that spot checks on street corners now.

[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.480]
And if your blood sugar is like over 250,

[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.040]
man, you're a straight to jail.

[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.660]
You're a menist to society.

[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.920]
You're going to kill somebody out there.

[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.220]
Your line pilot, before you get on that plane,

[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.580]
make sure he didn't have no fish food before he took off.

[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.120]
Here's a four-letter deal.

[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:46.320]
Hello.

[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.160]
Hello there.

[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:47.760]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.680]
For some color, I guess I'd be in the cute color

[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.200]
since I'm not chronic.

[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:52.800]
OK.

[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.500]
Anyway, I can show myself a well-trained,

[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.700]
high precision cynic.

[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.660]
I agree with a lot of the things that you talk about.

[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.780]
But in the United States, of course,

[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.100]
what right we all have really is the right

[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.740]
to be as irresponsible as we want to be.

[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.620]
Until you reach a certain limit.

[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.080]
And we have these freedoms

[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.900]
and people sort of they abuse them

[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.200]
until it starts costing somebody some money somewhere.

[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.580]
And then they got to go and do something about taking that freedom away.

[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.240]
But what does that mean?

[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.620]
When has marijuana ever been decriminalized in America?

[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.620]
Well, I mean, it hasn't.

[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.060]
But the reasons for that.

[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.880]
I mean, they tried prohibition with booze.

[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.120]
That's your work real well, didn't it?

[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.340]
No, and everybody.

[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:27.880]
It's a powerful deal.

[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.180]
Work for a jail candidate real well.

[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.540]
We can't expect our people to be responsible

[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.720]
with the freedoms that they have.

[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.940]
Like, we have a small business.

[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.980]
And we've got, you know, we do contracting

[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.720]
and that sort of thing.

[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.580]
And you've got guys.

[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.380]
They're not exactly the top model society.

[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.740]
But they go out and they're doing physical labor for you.

[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.820]
And they're climbing the roofed off and things like that.

[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.540]
And we've had cases in the past

[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.680]
where people were on the influence of substances

[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.900]
and they can't access it.

[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.560]
And then the customer...

[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.760]
Well, if you're liable for it, I can understand it.

[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.100]
And you're talking about a person.

[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.420]
Right, I understand that.

[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.800]
And then not only that, but the employee who's you too.

[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.620]
Even though he was the one who was irresponsible on the job.

[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.580]
So what do you do about that?

[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.040]
Well, in that case, that's an exception.

[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.400]
I wouldn't have any problem with that.

[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.280]
I can see in the NBA where if a guy is stone,

[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.920]
he's not going to injure somebody on the court.

[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.340]
If anything, he'll take fewer shots.

[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.820]
And he probably wouldn't beat up the coach.

[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.080]
Well, I'm good point.

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.820]
But the thing is, we have something that we do at work here.

[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.660]
Not that it works, but it's an attempt anyway

[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.160]
that's called a drug free workplace.

[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.180]
And you start off your relationship with the business

[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.720]
under the assumption that, you know,

[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.660]
you're not going to...

[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.560]
This isn't going to be something you're going to be doing on the job.

[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.480]
So we're allowed to drug test before you start the job

[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.140]
and that sort of thing.

[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.700]
And what's sad about this is it's amazing how many people

[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.740]
who call us looking for a job and say,

[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.460]
oh, but by the way, this is a drug free workplace.

[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.360]
How many people show up, fill out the forms,

[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:44.680]
and then just never appear again.

[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.160]
It's huge.

[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.500]
But isn't that their choice?

[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.540]
You just got to examine it.

[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:48.600]
Oh, really?

[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.220]
But the thing is, if the business is going to be responsible

[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.980]
for what its employees do, then we have to know,

[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.400]
we have to feel safe and secure

[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.660]
that they're not going to be out during K-1.

[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.940]
No, I would have seen with that.

[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.240]
I think that you've got to, you know,

[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.700]
you have a right because you're liable,

[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.060]
and you have a right to make sure that they're not doing

[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.100]
whatever might impair their senses, et cetera.

[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.000]
So, you know, that's a very rare exception.

[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.580]
If somebody's doing an office job at a desk,

[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.360]
unless, of course, they're making decisions,

[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.080]
decisions that are like national security

[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.220]
risking something like that,

[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.120]
I could understand that.

[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.480]
Or for radio equipment or something like that.

[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.040]
Exactly.

[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.640]
And I think it might help to have some drugs

[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.820]
for these bastards over here.

[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.660]
But the thing is, once again, as a society,

[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.400]
if the people aren't going to be responsible enough

[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.760]
to be able to decide when they are going to use

[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.860]
some substances you can't expect.

[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:36.980]
But, you know, you know something?

[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.100]
You can't expect them to be responsible.

[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.140]
But you know something, I'm sure.

[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.720]
Let me say something to you.

[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.520]
And that is that as long as things are forbidden,

[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.940]
when you go to Europe, there is no drinking age

[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.580]
in any country that I know of in Europe.

[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.780]
And yet, Italy, especially, public drunkenness

[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.940]
is frowned upon, such an extent that, I mean,

[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.820]
they would come and beat the crap out of you

[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.680]
if they found you staggering around drunkenness street.

[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.560]
They would take you under cover somewhere

[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.480]
and give you a lecture and sober you up

[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.920]
and tell you better not to ever do it again.

[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.560]
Yes, but you don't have any problem

[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.880]
of young people staggering around drunk

[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.100]
or killing each other because they're drinking and driving.

[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.100]
You don't have that.

[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.120]
Now, the French habit, because they got a bunch of drunks

[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:11.920]
over there to begin with.

[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.840]
But I'm talking about countries where they're generally

[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.280]
socially responsible in the first place, like Italy

[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.680]
and like Holland and those.

[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.960]
You don't have that problem.

[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.440]
Yeah, but there's no drinking age.

[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.120]
There's no small thing in the world.

[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.700]
There's no capitalism rates in the world, though.

[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.180]
And you have this fame in Russia,

[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.300]
have very high alcohol rates, and they also have...

[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.460]
Well, what does that have to do with Italy?

[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:29.800]
It does it.

[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:30.660]
But, you know, it's just...

[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.820]
What has been happening with Holland,

[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.340]
which is the freest country in the world?

[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.340]
What does that have to do with it?

[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:34.920]
It depends on the culture.

[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.600]
They grow up with that kind of freedom in the world.

[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.120]
Ah, there you go.

[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.340]
That's what I just got to say, and then...

[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.220]
I wonder if you make things forbidden.

[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.740]
The more people want them, that's my point.

[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.360]
Okay, before I leave, or you cut off the bottle.

[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.820]
I want to give you something.

[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.320]
I don't know if you can use this as a card,

[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.720]
but I want to do a celebrity impersonation for you.

[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.140]
Yeah.

[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.900]
Okay, see, now that wasn't bad.

[00:35:59.020 --> 00:35:59.880]
Georgia was almost cute.

[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.020]
It wasn't a very good...

[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.520]
Yeah, and the consensus is, let's see.

[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.960]
Mike from the key says it's too expensive.

[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.680]
That's his...

[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.560]
Wow, that's his opinion.

[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.040]
He likes it a little weed, and then he said,

[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:08.680]
too, that's expensive.

[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:09.840]
Here's Miami.

[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:10.260]
Hello.

[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:10.920]
Neil.

[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:11.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.080]
What's up, Neil?

[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:12.540]
Love you, Shul.

[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.500]
Thank you so much.

[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.080]
Listen, it is kind of expensive, but I wanted to say

[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.360]
this little marijuana thing is just out of hand.

[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.360]
I mean, the government...

[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.320]
Like, battling chips, pushing buttons on where they don't realize that

[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.860]
marijuana is probably the basis in toxicant on this planet.

[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.500]
It's less harmful than alcohol.

[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.780]
It has never been documented to give cancer, like, you know, cigar and cigarettes.

[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:33.900]
Yeah.

[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.320]
Which I'm not complaining about the cars.

[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.420]
And it doesn't send your blood sugar raising up like sugar does either, but...

[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:38.820]
Not at all.

[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.940]
Sugar, I guarantee you right now, sugar was a lot more dangerous than marijuana ever can be.

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.780]
And I don't think they did any sugar testing on this...

[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.460]
I remember Gabbriotti guy, that this snowboarder, that won the gold medal over their noggino.

[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:49.880]
Absolutely.

[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.240]
Let's take a blood sugar and see if he was doing fish food before he did the thing.

[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:54.860]
Absolutely.

[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.160]
And, you know, I like the cars too.

[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.640]
I was listening to the idea.

[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.660]
I was wondering how come you didn't like our thing in Vegas.

[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.760]
I wanted to ask you out as well.

[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.760]
That's like my cigar of taste.

[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.920]
Do I do like car sure Vegas?

[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.460]
Oh, you like them?

[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.200]
But it's... they don't make them in nicks, which is my sponsor.

[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.560]
So I'm not going to come on here and say, hey, I smoked car sure Vegas.

[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.880]
Which one do you like in particular the...

[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.380]
The Galante?

[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.800]
You never had the English coronavirus?

[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.100]
Oh, I don't touch those English ones.

[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:17.620]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.180]
The English coronavirus is especially derolling your toe pin.

[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:20.960]
Oh, okay.

[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.440]
But thank you for our meal.

[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.340]
Okay, have a great day.

[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.940]
Let's go to a Miami.

[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:25.280]
Hello.

[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.080]
Neil.

[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:26.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.440]
Hey, how's it going?

[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:27.880]
Great.

[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.140]
Well, listen, you know, a couple of bad things.

[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:35.000]
Unfortunately, marijuana is classified as a schedule one drug, which means it's right up there with cocaine, heroin,

[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:40.620]
methamphetamine, and Jerry Springer, as perhaps the worst drugs of all mankind.

[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.280]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:42.620]
And fish food.

[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.620]
And fish food.

[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.840]
But, uh, you know, this is just a word for that guy who was that guy kidding when he...

[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:54.500]
There was a guy he called and he said, I run a workplace and I tell people that I drug test, but I don't really drug test.

[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.780]
And then that just sort of weathe out the part in mind the point.

[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.400]
I mean, weathe out the people that really don't want to drug test.

[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.180]
I tell what he said.

[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:02.880]
What was it?

[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.080]
What was I missed that whole thing?

[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.780]
But he said that he drug test and he drug test.

[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.180]
No, he does drug test.

[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.200]
And he said that a lot of people come by and they fill out the application when they find out it's a drug free workplace,

[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.320]
but they don't hear from him again is what he said.

[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:21.260]
All right. Well, I think he's a fascist because, you know, he's basically just got a bunch of people that we're doing like yard work or something, you know.

[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.660]
And then they're going up on roofs and things and he's responsible.

[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.320]
He's got the liability insurance for that. I can understand that.

[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.580]
Uh, I don't know, man.

[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:30.280]
I mean, if you're...

[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.480]
If you're still looking, if you're still on any substance, I don't care what is.

[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.900]
Uh, I don't want to be responsible for your work or driving or whatever else you're doing.

[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.820]
You know, the thing is that they might not be up on the roof and be stoned at the same time.

[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:47.520]
They might go home, watch Jerry Springer and then be stoned and then go back to work and be perfectly straight and still fail at miserable tests.

[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.000]
Okay, I think the show's on now. What the hell was the point?

[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.100]
I wasn't going to wait around long enough to find out.

[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.460]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello.

[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.520]
Hello, Neil.

[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.160]
Yes, ma'am. Hi, how are you?

[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.180]
Great. How you be doing?

[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.080]
Hi, I'd be doing fine.

[00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:58.700]
All right.

[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.060]
I just wanted to make a comment about the pot shed that called earlier that said he's small for 10 years.

[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:03.460]
Yeah.

[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.340]
He said that the marijuana made him try other drugs.

[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:16.920]
I think that he's been betrayed as everyone else has been betrayed by all the uptight people in this country because they tell you that marijuana be bad for you and it's evil and all this stuff.

[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.640]
And then when you try it and it's not that bad, you say, well, they lied about this. Well, maybe they lied about everything else too.

[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:30.980]
So, I can't be maliciously different marijuana, maliciously different marijuana.

[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.820]
This poor guy's been able back to Canada with his metal between his legs.

[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:43.880]
Never be the same again because they found this little teeny tiny trace of marriage witty in his test.

[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.840]
Neil, I say we all get on the plane, go to Italy and smoke a blot.

[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:49.460]
All right.

[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.380]
All right. See you.

[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.740]
The Pope is over there. He's doing it. If it's okay for the Pope, I'll come and answer.

[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.900]
But you think that big puffer over the Vatican is? That's not what you think it is.

[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:04.140]
That's the celebratory smoke. Yeah, they're celebrating it. All right. Why do you think they keep burning incense? Covered up.

[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.900]
That's why they do a lot of things. That's why they put those gowns on to cover it up. That's why there were no kilts in Scotland, baby. Covered up.

[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.160]
When it scores some pot. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:19.000]
I've never listened to your show before, but I was interested in reviews on why it's illegal in the first place.

[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.360]
I mean, is it all a conspiracy?

[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:26.180]
Sure, because this is a repressive society in which we live. Let me say it again.

[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:35.800]
These are KXotomy laws that are in the book and most dates in this country in which anything except a face-to-face missionary position sex between married, male and female.

[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.520]
What you're laughing about it, okay?

[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:38.780]
But true.

[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:51.340]
All these are KX laws on the books because this is a country of hypocrites, a country that's living in the stone age, because we got a bunch of old funny duties up there who don't have the balls to repeal these RKX stupid intrusive laws that have no place in the city.

[00:40:51.940 --> 00:41:00.040]
Well, in the marijuana case, camp whatever. There would be no national debt if they were taxing and growing it the last 20 years.

[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:09.660]
Let me say this, Ducer. The idea that the federal government, listen to this. The federal government can tell you what seed you can plant in the backyard of your home on your property.

[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:17.580]
The idea that the government can legislate that is so outrageous and so unacceptable as to be inexplicable.

[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.480]
I agree. I can't argue with that one bit.

[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.600]
They have all these helicopters are wasting time because people are growing a few plants in their backyard.

[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:32.940]
In the meantime, up the corner, kids are shooting themselves because Daddy left his six, his six shooter laying around and everybody in their brother in his company is running around with a goddamn gun.

[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:38.700]
But God forbid that somebody's growing a few plants in the backyard. We got the helicopters going overhead, baby.

[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.820]
And we're going to catch you. The the pot police are there.

[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:46.340]
You maniacs. Just like in a low, where the hell I do with that local section this morning.

[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:53.080]
Here we go. Businessman or sex purveyor police. This Arthur van Morker Kirk and whatever name is Kirk and Jerkin.

[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.880]
Granted, a six million dollar prostitution ring. How do you like that? In Fort Lauderdale.

[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:03.980]
He had 50 women under payroll. Their names neatly lined up on a magnetic board under heading such as blondes, brumettes and orientals.

[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:14.400]
The clients more than 20,000 men between West Palm Beach and North Miami. You'll pay 180 bucks and cash or 200 by credit card for acts that range from a straight sex to unusual fetishes.

[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:23.680]
So who the hell gives a crap? Probably ran a clean operation. Probably not too many people getting no diseases from that operation. Probably headed on the up and up. He's going to jail.

[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:34.740]
Everything in his goddamn country is illegal, man. Everything is the forbidden fruit, if we can say on the course that's. Oh, forget that. Talk about a fruit. Forget about that. Everything's illegal.

[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:47.340]
Everything's immoral unless of course it's the politicians who are doing it like Dan Roelmer. He's doing it over there and like Bill Clinton, of course, he's doing it the left and right and which we like and a lot more respect him because he's getting that that's okay.

[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.860]
But if we're getting it, then of course it's evil and we all go to jail.

[00:42:51.800 --> 00:43:02.080]
Juvenile and unacceptable, unacceptable. Your brainwashed baby, when are you going to just wake up and sniff it a little bit in the flowers too brainwashing goody two shoes.

[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:10.740]
We have to have a drinking age and we have to have a we have to have an age for everything a smoking age. In other words, when you're 21, it's okay to get yourself lung cancer.

[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:21.840]
But if you're 19 and that you're not old enough to make that decision, just like this crap about the age of majority every, you know, most countries, we just isn't just a matter of opinion. Most countries, even something that we consider very backward.

[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:36.780]
The legal age for consensual sexual acts is 15 or 16 in this country. It's what 17 for heterosexual act and 18 for yes, there's a different age for heterosexual or homosexual acts. Of course, or is it 18 for both?

[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:45.760]
There's all these gray areas, depending on which state you're in. I didn't say gay areas. I said, what's what's well we'll find out what state you're in lies in the prone or what does it do?

[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:52.540]
If you're more than two years older, you can be 16 as long as the person isn't more than two years older and over 18. Well, it's an added credit on another.

[00:43:52.540 --> 00:44:00.080]
So if a 19, well guys bang on a 16 year old chick, he's in violation of the laws that we were saying to me something like that isn't that ridiculous? Yeah, isn't that absurd?

[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.300]
Here's a Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Nail. Yes, sir.

[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:12.900]
Very gross. Back to you. Happy Sookas. Yeah. On the prostitution ring, the guys from a folk in our Fort Lauderdale. No big deal.

[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:21.260]
There you go. You're right. Close enough for us. Yeah, you got it. Another thing on the bottom of pot. I own a business. I drug test. Right on the application.

[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:34.420]
He brings drugs, man. I test. All right. All right. See you at the track back where we certainly know nothing about drugs. There's your kind of boss George. I thought we had that. Oh, yeah. He wouldn't know what to do with him.

[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.580]
As in. Happy.

[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:43.980]
From. The frog. Back. And I think I want to kill what.

[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.660]
I heard that. Back. Up. So. And down. You at one.

[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:57.320]
I see what's right. The time is 45, but it's doing 22.

[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:11.320]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:34.280]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.800]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.320]
I'm going to run you down.

I'm going to run you down.

[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.900]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.140]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:38.840]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:59.060]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:20.540]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:28.900]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:51.500]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:58.880]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:28.620]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:41.620]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.040]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:58.580]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:28.560]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:54.200]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.480]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:27.460]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.460]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:52.760]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:58.420]
I'm going to run you down.

[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:10.140]
I'm going to run you down.

[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:00.280]
Let me do home it.

[02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:06.500]
Hold it.

[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:07.780]
This be infinite.

[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:09.280]
You can't hear any of this.

[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:10.780]
It's an apparent of this.

[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:11.220]
It's an apparent of this.

[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:13.680]
It's an apparent of this.

[02:19:15.140 --> 02:19:16.060]
Who's that home?

[02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:25.000]
You be voted.

[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:33.560]
Now try it, look it folks.

[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:37.340]
Talk to us about the better, talk to us.

[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:39.420]
Look.

[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:44.480]
This is how it is going.

[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:50.320]
This is how it is going.

[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:56.700]
This is how it is going.

[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:03.820]
I think I'm going to start talking sports.

[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:06.080]
Maybe we'll take a week and I'll talk sports for one week.

[02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:10.100]
And see if we can search for one caller that has any clue what they're talking about.

[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:11.840]
Just amazing to me.

[02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:14.140]
Just an ongoing word.

[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:18.160]
It's baby crap.

[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:21.420]
That's the exact expression to use for baby crap.

[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:25.300]
Like all these people calling in like this is something that's meaningful in anybody's life.

[02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:27.200]
Who showed up at the White House yesterday?

[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:31.720]
Not to be a Iraqi ambassador show up to see if we're going to avoid a war over there.

[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.620]
Not if the president's lawyer showed up to see if he's going to want to be in a pizza or not.

[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:38.400]
But did all of the Marlins show up there at the White House yesterday?

[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:41.220]
This is important for Jinya.

[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:41.700]
Miami.

[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:42.060]
Hello.

[02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:42.980]
I'm Danielle.

[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:43.540]
Yes, sir.

[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:44.840]
I've got a question for you.

[02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:48.500]
You're talking about your anniversary 22 years in the business?

[02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:48.880]
Yes.

[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:52.180]
I was arguing semantics with a friend of mine.

[02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:54.080]
It's not really the pinionate answer.

[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:55.280]
I mean, it's fact somewhere.

[02:20:55.740 --> 02:20:57.920]
When you were brought out, you're a contract.

[02:20:59.540 --> 02:21:01.980]
We were arguing that I was saying you were unemployed.

[02:21:02.300 --> 02:21:09.060]
He was saying you were still employed by the people who were unemployed.

[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:11.240]
I mean, we were arguing semantics.

[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:13.080]
You weren't working.

[02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:15.860]
That was basically what I was saying.

[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.180]
What's the point?

[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:18.660]
What difference does it make what you call it?

[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:21.400]
I'd like to be unemployed like that to rest in my life.

[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:22.400]
It wasn't employed.

[02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:23.880]
You were employed.

[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:24.860]
Let me see it again.

[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:25.960]
I was not unemployed.

[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:26.760]
I was employed.

[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:27.880]
I just didn't have to show up.

[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:28.360]
I got a check.

[02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:29.820]
I came and picked up a check every week.

[02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:31.400]
You can't be unemployed and get paid.

[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:33.500]
No, did they consider that employed?

[02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:34.140]
Of course.

[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:35.040]
Absolutely.

[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:35.880]
Really?

[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:36.380]
Yes.

[02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:38.100]
I figured it was something like that.

[02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:38.700]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:39.780]
Oh, my God.

[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:43.160]
Oh, the world is coming to an end with that call right there.

[02:21:43.980 --> 02:21:44.500]
That's it.

[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:46.140]
That's the end.

[02:21:46.660 --> 02:21:50.040]
I actually had a feeling for about an hour and a half today that we were going to make it today.

[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:51.220]
That we really were going to have a show.

[02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:54.220]
We're going to have some real azipity doodas, some real people on this phone.

[02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:55.100]
Forget it.

[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:56.920]
I mean, talk about get a life.

[02:21:57.180 --> 02:21:58.140]
Well, it's really semantics.

[02:21:58.280 --> 02:21:58.940]
Yeah, semantics.

[02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:02.060]
People have argued semantics are people in desperate search of life.

[02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.600]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:03.880]
Hello.

[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:04.620]
Hello.

[02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:05.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:07.080]
Good old story.

[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:11.720]
When I first came down here right out of college to become a school teacher, I went downtown

[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:14.940]
Miami and crossed the street there and came on out.

[02:22:15.060 --> 02:22:17.360]
And as I came out and crossed the street again, it was a cop there.

[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:17.880]
Yeah.

[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:19.280]
And he said to Jay walking.

[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:20.660]
And I said, Jay walking.

[02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:22.520]
And he pointed a sign out, turned off.

[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:23.000]
There's a sign.

[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:23.700]
And he said, Jay walking.

[02:22:23.980 --> 02:22:24.800]
So I said, okay.

[02:22:24.940 --> 02:22:26.140]
Well, I guess that's going to take a second.

[02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:28.360]
So he said, let me see a license.

[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:29.200]
I said, I'm walking.

[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:29.820]
I'm not driving.

[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:31.120]
You don't need to see my license.

[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:34.200]
So he said, is this your car?

[02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:35.560]
And I said, yeah, but I'm not driving it.

[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:37.280]
And he says, well, it's parked an expired meter.

[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:40.100]
And I said, oh, my God.

[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:41.180]
I just wanted to take a look at that.

[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:43.080]
So he gave me a ticket for Jay walking.

[02:22:43.260 --> 02:22:44.720]
He said, you'll cross the street when you went in.

[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:46.200]
I said, yeah, he said, okay.

[02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:48.020]
So he gave me two Jay walking tickets.

[02:22:48.500 --> 02:22:50.400]
And then he gave me an expired meter ticket.

[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:54.500]
Then he gave me a ticket because there was a construction sign next to the car.

[02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:57.420]
And he gave me a ticket for parked in a restricted zone.

[02:22:57.940 --> 02:23:00.740]
And then he said, I refused to give him my driver's license.

[02:23:00.740 --> 02:23:02.800]
He gave me a ticket for a no license.

[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:07.400]
He handcuffed me, had my car towed, and took me to jail.

[02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:09.260]
Went to court a couple days later.

[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:12.100]
The judge read the thing, called me up, called a cop up.

[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:13.880]
And he said to the cop, he said, first of all,

[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:15.680]
you're going to pay for his car that you towed.

[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.860]
Secondly, you're going to reimburse him for his time.

[02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:20.920]
And if I ever see you coming to my court with this kind of car again,

[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:22.440]
I'm going to get you off the force.

[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:23.120]
Oh!

[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:25.280]
Great, great story, sir.

[02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:26.120]
That was it.

[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:27.000]

[02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:28.380]
Don't do it again.

[02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.320]
Okay, how do you like that?

[02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:33.720]
See, that cop was one of those pricks that I'm talking about who gets into it.

[02:23:33.820 --> 02:23:34.700]
So we can brow-beat people.

[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:35.780]
And there are plenty of those.

[02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:38.100]
If you're visiting, if you're one of the snowbirds down here,

[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:40.600]
and you're tuned in today by accident, and wondering what it's all about,

[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:42.280]
this is what this town is all about.

[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:43.920]
Okay, it's a bunch of dead people walking around,

[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:45.180]
a bunch of dead people driving.

[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:48.080]
It's a bunch of people who have moved their lips a lot.

[02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:48.940]
They don't say too much.

[02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:50.700]
They don't have an opinion about anything.

[02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:53.980]
And yet somehow I've survived 22 years in the midst of all of this.

[02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:55.120]
How is that possible?

[02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:57.260]
How in God's name is that possible?

[02:23:57.260 --> 02:23:59.700]
Man, oh man, I was thinking about that the other day,

[02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:02.640]
thinking about surviving 22 years with a bunch of dead heads.

[02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:04.780]
In the minute that I came, that thought came to my mind.

[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:06.040]
I pooped my pants.

[02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:13.660]
Oh, God, I just let loose 22 years of frustration of trying to coerce of force people

[02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:17.160]
to like say something, have an opinion, get some passion.

[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:18.480]
There is no passion.

[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:21.420]
That's the thing that is lacking in this town is passion.

[02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:22.660]
It doesn't exist.

[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:24.540]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:24.820]
Hello.

[02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:25.380]
Neil.

[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:26.080]
Yes sir.

[02:24:26.300 --> 02:24:27.820]
Anything has cops stories for you?

[02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:28.300]
Oh yeah.

[02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:29.620]
Coconut Creek PD.

[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:31.700]
I'm going up Lion's Road.

[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:34.560]
Keep out on three or four miles an hour to steal it.

[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:35.900]
Two motorcycle cops.

[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:37.020]
One of them shoot this thing.

[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:38.420]
I had to think nothing of it.

[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:40.120]
One of them all of a sudden I look at my rearview,

[02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:42.660]
I go past them, look at my rearview, one of them is behind me.

[02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:43.360]
What did I do?

[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:44.480]
So he posed me over.

[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:45.940]
I asked him what I did.

[02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:46.960]
How fast were you going?

[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:48.260]
That's a rear four over.

[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:50.120]
Three or four miles over this building.

[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:51.680]
So let me finish.

[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:57.620]
So he says the tent on your windshield extends too far down the windshield.

[02:24:58.020 --> 02:24:59.560]
I said well, wait a minute.

[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:00.960]
I said, Neil, get this.

[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:02.660]
It's factory kit.

[02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:04.620]
It comes from the factory that way.

[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:05.880]
It's inside the glass.

[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:06.880]
Oh.

[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:08.800]
So he writes me a ticket.

[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:09.860]
Let's take it for what?

[02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:11.060]
For what?

[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:12.180]
For what was it?

[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:13.760]
Because your thing is too long?

[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:15.020]
Yeah, the thing was too long.

[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:16.560]
So he writes me a ticket.

[02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:17.700]
I'll never get a ticket for that.

[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:19.300]
So then now listen to this.

[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:27.740]
Not only do I have to pay the ticket, but I have to bring the car to Copenacreek PD to prove that I comply with whatever I got to go.

[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:29.900]
I got to go put a new windshield in the car.

[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:31.220]
Oh my God.

[02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:32.640]
I swear to God.

[02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:33.700]
Unbelievable.

[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:34.360]
There you go.

[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:35.320]
Wrist my case pal.

[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:36.060]
In closing?

[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:37.440]
And your paint is salary, yeah.

[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:37.940]
Yes sir.

[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:38.480]
In closing?

[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:38.940]
Yes.

[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:40.820]
Okay, let's take a boi-ton beach.

[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:41.320]
Hello.

[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:41.960]
How's it going?

[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:42.680]
Pretty good.

[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:45.060]
I don't envy your position.

[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:46.340]
These people have been sitting here.

[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:48.440]
God knows why I'm about to have an hour waiting for you.

[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:48.440]

[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:50.420]
God was six minutes and six seconds.

[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:52.460]
The guy was placed, mister.

[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:53.900]
What the hell was he talking about?

[02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:55.220]
I haven't got any idea.

[02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:57.240]
Oh, I think he was talking about Mark Forset.

[02:25:57.480 --> 02:25:59.120]
I swear to God I was going to hang up after him.

[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:00.200]
But Mark Forset.

[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:02.440]
I'm sure I'm going to have to have a force it.

[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:03.820]
I love for a force it.

[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:04.700]
Not now I used to.

[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:05.480]
But anyway.

[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:06.840]
One of the measures you've been to.

[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:09.660]
There's never the same action she got beat up by that intruder that time of the spray.

[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:09.940]
Remember?

[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:11.620]
And she tied him up and put him in the fireplace.

[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:13.000]
What was the name of that movie George?

[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:14.760]
Oh, that was a good movie.

[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:15.460]
It's just remedies.

[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:17.260]
She's not good at it.

[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:19.260]
He beat the crap out of it.

[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:19.680]
Hockey.

[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:20.340]
Yeah.

[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:22.700]
I played college hockey, love hockey.

[02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:24.020]
Unfortunately a Ranger fan.

[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:25.960]
A few other things South Florida.

[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:27.400]
I moved down here about two years ago.

[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:28.800]
Now you're talking for it.

[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:29.260]
From Boston.

[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:29.900]
Boston.

[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:31.720]
It's terrible here.

[02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:35.160]
Miami is the armpit of the United States.

[02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:36.120]
The place to be.

[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:36.720]
South Beach.

[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:38.540]
A bunch of weirdos down there.

[02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:39.260]
A bunch of drug addicts.

[02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:40.660]
But the imposers.

[02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:42.220]
Muscle bon posing bag.

[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:44.520]
And these cars with the matchbox wheels.

[02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:45.700]
Stick out ten feet.

[02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:47.940]
And the shorts down in the middle of their ass crack.

[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:48.300]
Right.

[02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:50.200]
Religion is another thing.

[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:50.640]
Yeah.

[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:52.600]
I'm a first time caller, last time caller.

[02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:53.740]
Because I don't have time to call you.

[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:55.880]
But I want to get a few more things off with you.

[02:26:55.980 --> 02:26:56.360]
Go ahead.

[02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:56.980]
Religion.

[02:26:57.160 --> 02:26:58.640]
I totally agree with you.

[02:26:58.700 --> 02:26:59.620]
I laughed in the car.

[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:01.960]
It is the biggest bunch of crap.

[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:02.440]
Yeah.

[02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:04.360]
The Bible is a fictional story.

[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.480]
I can see the guys riding the Bible way back when.

[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:07.820]
I'll drunk around the table.

[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:08.240]
Right.

[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:09.260]
Telling stories.

[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:12.320]
Well, I mean people have been inventing gods in the side of the whole script.

[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:13.740]
They're going on since the beginning of time.

[02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:18.760]
And anybody who's got even a tiny ability to think for himself or for himself knows that.

[02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:20.500]
And would just laugh at this crap.

[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:23.020]
But the sad part of it is that the people don't want to think.

[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:23.860]
You get chastised.

[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:25.540]
That's why if you say anything today.

[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:26.680]
Anyway, I would be trippy.

[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:27.740]
You told the women out there.

[02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:28.020]
Okay.

[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:29.040]
I had a heterosexual.

[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:30.120]
I love women.

[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:33.920]
But this women powered bulls**t going on right now.

[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:35.340]
What the hell is that all about?

[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:35.860]
Okay.

[02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:36.820]
Okay.

[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:37.880]
He said crap.

[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:39.360]
And I just, he's getting a little worked up.

[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:40.560]
I left him on there.

[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:42.440]
But you know, bull crap is right.

[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:43.460]
You can't say shot.

[02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:45.020]
You can take one, but you can't say it.

[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:48.620]
Because this is America, after all, just like the things that brought up about the T-shirt police.

[02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:50.280]
Got almost no response about that.

[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:52.840]
See, you people are so conditioned.

[02:27:53.220 --> 02:27:55.380]
I mean, the cop who called Friday was right about that.

[02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:58.220]
We want to condition you to doing fill in the blank.

[02:27:58.780 --> 02:27:59.920]
To being nice and obedient.

[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:02.240]
And whatever it is, we're going to condition you.

[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:05.760]
Even if you shouldn't have to be doing this, we're going to condition you to doing this.

[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:08.880]
Because we decided that you can't wear a T-shirt that says this.

[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:11.660]
And you can't have a bumper sticker that says that.

[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:13.000]
Here's a mobile and sunrise.

[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:13.380]
Hello.

[02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:14.840]
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?

[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:15.180]
Great.

[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:17.000]
You know what ticks us all off?

[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:20.660]
Neil is the fact that you have these cops working overtime by the sawgrass.

[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:26.140]
You know he's supposed to stick the 50 cents in those at Oakland Park in commercial.

[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:27.620]
And they get you.

[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:32.400]
If you don't stick the 50 cents in the little hole there, these cops are working on OT.

[02:28:33.020 --> 02:28:33.300]
Uh-huh.

[02:28:33.740 --> 02:28:37.660]
This is the most amazing thing that a cop is getting paid to even do these things.

[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:37.760]
Yeah.

[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:39.580]
Well, listen, pay the 50 cents and cut the crap.

[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:40.900]
You know what that reminds me of?

[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:42.220]
Oh, I think it was yesterday.

[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:45.200]
I should have brought it and there was a letter to the editor from some old fart.

[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.600]
You could tell he was an old fart by the nature of the letter.

[02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:51.680]
And this guy was complaining because he had gotten a ticket.

[02:28:51.780 --> 02:28:54.060]
He went through the toll booth like a deterrent pike or somewhere.

[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:58.300]
And the arm was stuck up in the air and the green light was stuck in the on position.

[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:00.060]
So he just goes through.

[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:03.800]
He doesn't put in his 50 cents or 75 cents because the green light is on.

[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:05.900]
And then he's belly again and then he gets a ticket.

[02:29:06.380 --> 02:29:07.280]
Well, guess what, pal?

[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:11.760]
Now just because the thing that stuck doesn't mean it's an invitation to just go right through you asshole.

[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:13.040]
I thought it was a free day.

[02:29:13.220 --> 02:29:13.640]
Yeah, right.

[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:16.240]
It's like that salad dressing free.

[02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:18.840]
I'll never forget that if I live in the be 500th.

[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:20.080]
And I didn't make this up.

[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:21.480]
It's a true goddamn story.

[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:25.420]
Seven years ago, I mean, my publics over there, it's got to be like four or five years ago.

[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:27.780]
And this old bag is in front of me in line.

[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:29.660]
And of course, she's making a big to do.

[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:31.080]
She got like six items on here.

[02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:32.300]
And Airbnb, what is the big?

[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:33.200]
Oh, how much is this?

[02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:33.680]
But I beat.

[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:40.480]
And then the girl takes, you know, the bottle of craft salad dressing and puts it through the scanner there.

[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:43.300]
And a woman says, wait a minute, what'd you do that for?

[02:29:43.500 --> 02:29:44.660]
And the girl looks at her, what do you mean?

[02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:46.720]
It says right in the bottle free.

[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:48.220]
Fat free.

[02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:51.960]
You stupid old disgusting obnoxious idiotic.

[02:29:52.180 --> 02:29:54.980]
I mean, God, that's fucking bitch free.

[02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:57.460]
So why didn't you get 20 or 30 of them, by the way?

[02:29:57.940 --> 02:29:59.120]
Only in Florida, baby.

[02:29:59.260 --> 02:29:59.960]
Only in this town.

[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:02.920]
Only where the living people are really dead masquerading.

[02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:07.440]
Ed Jappwin knows the scores, starting in 10th of a last game.

[02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:12.560]
And weeknight, only on 4th radio 560, Q-A-L.

[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:15.240]
My dad knocked me off.

[02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:17.860]
He made two in G.

[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:18.840]
He hit me up.

[02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:23.220]
When I went to the game, he hit me up.

[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:25.940]
I was killed by my daddy.

[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:29.920]
And what's so hard, dad knocked me off.

[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:33.160]
I was a smith, a dream.

[02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:36.940]
It's not a media mystery.

[02:30:38.060 --> 02:30:40.780]
I'm a person who knows.

[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:47.240]
He beat me in, beat me in the bathroom house.

[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:49.820]
And got my head in you down.

[02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:54.440]
He got me in, oh, he's also covered up now.

[02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:56.960]
But they're gonna let him go.

[02:30:57.960 --> 02:30:59.580]
My dad knocked me off.

[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.660]
He made two in G.

[02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:03.060]
He hit me up.

[02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:08.000]
He beat me in, beat me in, beat me in.

[02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.820]
You'll never hear him, and that's me.

[02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:13.660]
My dad knocked me off.

[02:31:15.160 --> 02:31:17.380]
My dad knocked me off.

[02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:21.000]
My dad knocked me off.

[02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:22.880]
So let me just mention this thing here,

[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.120]
because I'm gonna forget about it, and I don't wanna do that.

[02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:27.420]
Boy tossed out of car on I-95,

[02:31:27.780 --> 02:31:29.660]
child's mother charged with attempted murder,

[02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:33.200]
hope sound, and apparently drugged and paranoid mother,

[02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:36.460]
once accused of starving her newborn daughter,

[02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:38.840]
pulled her toddler son from his car seat

[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:40.360]
and tossed him out the window on Thursday,

[02:31:40.780 --> 02:31:43.200]
as she raced along interstate I-95.

[02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:44.200]
That fucking bitch.

[02:31:44.420 --> 02:31:45.980]
She picked him up by his coveralls,

[02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:48.660]
and threw him out to Florida Highway Patrol Trooper, Deborah Busby,

[02:31:49.060 --> 02:31:50.860]
the screaming two and a half year old boy,

[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:54.160]
hurtled across the median as shocked motorists pulled over to help him.

[02:31:54.840 --> 02:31:56.440]
Steven had died, lost consciousness,

[02:31:56.660 --> 02:31:58.400]
only his paramedics placed him on a gurney.

[02:31:58.700 --> 02:32:00.380]
The boy was in serious but stable condition,

[02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:03.320]
with broken bones on Thursday night at St. Mary's Medical Center,

[02:32:03.420 --> 02:32:04.580]
was undergoing CAT scans.

[02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:06.400]
And Barry Jackson's worried about

[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:08.440]
if we're gonna have the Jimmy Johnson press conference.

[02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:09.400]
See what I'm saying?

[02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:10.200]
We're worried.

[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:12.260]
Actually, I got this TV in here, thanks to Jeff Cohen,

[02:32:12.260 --> 02:32:15.160]
and the satellite dish, thanks to our friends at Digital World satellite.

[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:20.600]
Not so I could watch ESPN and find out if there's any big sports stories breaking.

[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:22.560]
But so we could have CNN on here and find out

[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:24.000]
if the president's gonna get impeached.

[02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:25.740]
If he's had any good blow jobs this week,

[02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:27.560]
if we're gonna have a goddamn war with Iraq,

[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:29.240]
what's going on in the outside world?

[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:31.460]
Barry Jackson, I suggest you open up the window

[02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:32.840]
and stick your fat ass out there,

[02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:34.620]
and find out there's other things going on in the world.

[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:36.580]
OK, you simple, then you jackass you.

[02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:37.440]
You fit in loud.

[02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:40.060]
You're just like those people that that guy was talking about.

[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:42.600]
Anyway, this little boy's mother, Chris Anhadad,

[02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:43.700]
30 of West Palm Beats,

[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:45.940]
was charged with attempted murder and aggravated child abuse,

[02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:49.400]
and was being held on $60,000 bail at the Martin County Jail.

[02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:51.800]
It was Hedad's second child abuse arrest.

[02:32:51.800 --> 02:32:54.860]
In 1991, Hedad pleaded guilty to child abuse charges.

[02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:58.240]
After her infant daughter turned up malnourished and convulsing

[02:32:58.240 --> 02:32:59.820]
at a hospital emergency room.

[02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:02.480]
She received five years probation court document.

[02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:03.960]
She'll and here's the best part.

[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:07.320]
Hedad was going through a divorce and had won temporary custody

[02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:08.880]
of her children court record show.

[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:10.200]
How do you like that?

[02:33:10.700 --> 02:33:13.720]
She was going through a divorce and what temporary custody of her children.

[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:15.840]
Hedad and apparent manic depressive,

[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:17.240]
it was no longer taken her medication,

[02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:19.300]
had lost a lot of weight recently.

[02:33:19.300 --> 02:33:21.960]
She'd become obsessed with the notion that a secret agency

[02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:23.300]
was trying to steal her son,

[02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:24.920]
according to neighbors and friends.

[02:33:25.340 --> 02:33:26.980]
Probably the Illuminati,

[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:28.520]
or the trial lateral commission.

[02:33:29.020 --> 02:33:30.940]
She told them she discovered the plot on the internet

[02:33:30.940 --> 02:33:32.120]
was playing with her child.

[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:33.480]
Oh, the plot was on the internet,

[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:35.620]
just like all those great NHL trade you see on there.

[02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:38.220]
About 10.45 a.m. traveling north on Ionini,

[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:40.020]
five at speeds of up to 85 miles an hour.

[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:42.340]
Hedad threw the toddler out of the driver's side window

[02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:43.480]
and then skidded into a ditch.

[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:46.180]
The boy hit the ground, screaming witnesses told police

[02:33:46.180 --> 02:33:47.080]
and continued to cries,

[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:48.280]
witnesses raised to comfort him.

[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:49.880]
Hedad ran back to her child,

[02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:51.580]
ranning about pornographic movies

[02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:53.700]
and poor international news coverage in local papers,

[02:33:54.020 --> 02:33:55.060]
according to witnesses and police.

[02:33:55.380 --> 02:33:56.040]
Well, now in that last part,

[02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:58.240]
I think she's got a plot about poor international news coverage.

[02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:00.160]
There was nothing in there about the Disney connection?

[02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:00.880]
No.

[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:03.780]
I heard somewhere on one of the radio news,

[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:05.080]
obviously not the thing.

[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:05.700]
Well, it's not us.

[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:06.740]
We wouldn't know.

[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:08.420]
We wouldn't know if she was throwing it out of her head.

[02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:11.800]
Hedad should rather see the kid dead than be exposed

[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:13.900]
to the pornography of Disney movies.

[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:15.660]
Oh, yeah. She probably saw priest.

[02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:17.720]
Well, maybe she's smarter than we thought.

[02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:19.960]
She knows that people sagged in the church.

[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:22.260]
She probably saw priest and got bent out of shape.

[02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:24.400]
This woman, she's getting custody of her kids.

[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:25.600]
The first one, a little girl,

[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:27.080]
was convulsing and starving to death.

[02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:28.560]
And this one, she throws out the window.

[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.340]
And people are worried because we're having too many abortions

[02:34:31.340 --> 02:34:32.700]
because we're not making enough babies.

[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.320]
And the Pope is running around telling people

[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:35.360]
they got to make a lot more babies.

[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:36.940]
And no, no, with that birth control.

[02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:37.980]
That'd be bad.

[02:34:39.020 --> 02:34:40.220]
Oh, God Almighty.

[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:42.740]
But I bet you the right to life is not going to be screaming about this,

[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:43.900]
because this kid's already alive.

[02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:46.040]
See, they never care about anybody that's already alive.

[02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:48.200]
It's only that fetus that they're in love with.

[02:34:48.460 --> 02:34:49.420]
Here's Tom Beach. Hello.

[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:50.460]
And you know, good morning.

[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:52.840]
I've been talking about porkers the last few days.

[02:34:53.180 --> 02:34:53.520]
Yes, sir.

[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:54.740]
A story on CNN.

[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:56.900]
A North Florida man arrested handcuffed,

[02:34:57.600 --> 02:34:59.620]
taken away for standing on the roadside

[02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:01.360]
with a sign that says, speed trap ahead.

[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:03.280]
You was, you know, see, this reminds me of the thing

[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:05.720]
about the flashing your lights to warn the other motorist

[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:06.680]
that there's a speed trap.

[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:07.780]
How can they do that?

[02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:09.160]
I just thought on that.

[02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:11.500]
I guess what they say is that you're interfering

[02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:13.180]
with law enforcement when you do that

[02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:16.020]
is the technicality option of just obstruction of justice.

[02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:17.460]
Oh, my God. Is bad is Bubba.

[02:35:17.620 --> 02:35:19.440]
You're not even getting any harm job out of it.

[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:20.060]
Have a great day.

[02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:21.420]
Here's North Miami. Hello.

[02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:22.160]
Hey, Neil.

[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:22.760]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:25.260]
Yeah, I've written the Miami Morning Rag here.

[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:28.740]
And Barry Jackass got an article in there about you.

[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:32.400]
Now, how this service is to these sports idiots

[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:36.300]
that they're not having the sports updates every hour on your show.

[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:36.920]
Yeah.

[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:37.980]
I mean, police.

[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:41.120]
You know, something very Jackass is a little immature asshole.

[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:44.540]
If there was anything very earth shaking and important happening in sports,

[02:35:44.540 --> 02:35:46.740]
they would fax it to us over here in the middle of the show.

[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:47.780]
And I would put it on the ear.

[02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:50.780]
But the fact that not only that, like Joe Sackett gets injured,

[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:52.800]
we find out we had it on the ear here yesterday.

[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:53.400]
Right. Right. Right. Right.

[02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:55.180]
So if there's anything earth shaking, I mean,

[02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:58.400]
anybody that's that much of a fanatic that has no life whatsoever,

[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:00.000]
which is very Jackson, by the way.

[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:01.140]
I mean, this guy's pathetic.

[02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:03.320]
And of course, he's nothing but a shield and an asshole.

[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:05.080]
No, the thing of it is you do.

[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:07.680]
There is no, those fanatics who are listening to this station.

[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:09.340]
Because I hear him yesterday,

[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:12.520]
the sucking up the Hank, you sports drills.

[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:14.420]
I mean, it's it's thickening.

[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:15.040]
Get a license.

[02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:17.380]
So don't listen to the, if you don't want to hear that.

[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:18.240]
Or the Hank is entertaining.

[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:18.740]
Yeah.

[02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:21.160]
But it's just too bad that we can get all these people.

[02:36:21.380 --> 02:36:23.400]
Well, when you've got a sports station,

[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.360]
you're going to attract a lot of those people who this is their entire life.

[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:30.040]
They're incapable of thinking or talking or doing about anything else in the world.

[02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:32.860]
And they want to, they want to soak that up every minute of the day.

[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:34.580]
And those, you're right, those people are pathetic.

[02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:36.660]
I've said that since the day I came on this station.

[02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:38.260]
And Barry Jackson is one of them.

[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:38.480]
Yeah.

[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.420]
And then he goes, because you didn't carry, they didn't carry Jimmy Johnson's press conference

[02:36:43.420 --> 02:36:44.000]
last week.

[02:36:44.140 --> 02:36:45.120]
And then it's a rough view.

[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:47.660]
No, they aren't going to be interrupting the show for, I hope not.

[02:36:47.660 --> 02:36:48.440]
No, no, I hope not.

[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:50.260]
For his Johnson already, but he also is.

[02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:52.420]
Talk to him about what the free age is to free age.

[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:54.640]
These people in the spring of town football season is over.

[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:58.780]
If I hear one more talk about football about the dogs is drafting.

[02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:01.780]
I mean, God, these people get a friggin life already.

[02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:02.200]
Amen.

[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:02.820]
God.

[02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:03.420]
Calm down.

[02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:03.860]
Right.

[02:37:04.060 --> 02:37:04.260]
Okay.

[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:05.160]
But he's right.

[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:08.000]
See, Barry Jackson, this is not a sports show.

[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:09.840]
I hate to paint you a picture.

[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.840]
I'm sure you're listening right now, your little pun wacker.

[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:13.380]
This isn't a sports show.

[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:17.920]
It's the Neo-Rodger show, which is probably the best god damn thing that ever happened to this radio station.

[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:19.420]
If I do say so myself.

[02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:23.100]
And the notion that we're going to be interrupting it to put Jimmy Johnson out of there to go,

[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:24.200]
blablablabla like that.

[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:25.620]
Get a life, okay.

[02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:26.180]
Take an interest.

[02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:27.100]
Take up a hobby.

[02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:29.760]
Like, uh, Rude Russian roulette would be good, okay.

[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:31.700]
Barry, take up something really worthwhile.

[02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:33.200]
And get with it.

[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:37.840]
But, but see, he feels compelled to write that because he's catering to exactly the people this guy is talking about.

[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:39.300]
That's what his column is all about.

[02:37:39.860 --> 02:37:40.580]
Broadcast sports.

[02:37:41.060 --> 02:37:42.220]
Here's a mobile in Miami Beach.

[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:42.420]
Hello.

[02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:46.440]
Hey, Neo, who's, uh, who's going to be the 31st draft pick for Seattle?

[02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:48.100]
I guess coming summer for the NFL.

[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:50.940]
I'm telling you, old kid with a great arm who plays for Ishtra Ming Hai and Michigan.

[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:51.960]
Absolutely correct.

[02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:52.340]
Okay.

[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:52.900]
We'll be right back.

[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:52.960]
We'll be right back.

[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:54.040]
I'm sure lots about that, Tommy.

[02:37:54.320 --> 02:38:00.820]
You know, if you thought IOD went crazy on draft day in April or the year, just wait till you hear what goes on on this station when the NFL draft comes a boot.

[02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:01.540]
Oh, geez.

[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:09.780]
Well, anyhow, Neo, uh, man, I saw that cover of the Harold with that crazy woman running down the highway, dropping her kid 18 months old, not two and a half.

[02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:14.420]
So that's a, that's a, I mean, and the mother, they want to give the kid to the mom.

[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:15.420]
That's in my paper here.

[02:38:15.420 --> 02:38:16.720]
The kid is two and a half years old.

[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:17.060]
Really?

[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:19.160]
Oh, the Harold has 18 months.

[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:21.120]
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

[02:38:21.260 --> 02:38:24.300]
I guess it actually big difference whether it is 18 months or 30 months or whatever.

[02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:28.940]
The younger the soccer is a little, he's a little kid and she threw him out the goddamn window onto the I-95.

[02:38:28.940 --> 02:38:30.280]
That's just sad.

[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:33.960]
And then, you know, the other woman that stabs the mom in front of the other kids, I mean, it's nuts.

[02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:36.180]
No, it's so, well, anyhow.

[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:40.360]
And people like Barry Jackson, they're worried about who the dolphins are going to draft in the 32nd round.

[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:43.200]
I mean, you talk, this last guy that called was right on target.

[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:47.000]
He said, everything that I've been saying and thinking for a long time, I have no respect.

[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:49.020]
I have nothing but disdain for people.

[02:38:49.300 --> 02:38:52.660]
Hey, uh, you think you think so and so, but on Tennessee last night, you have to.

[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:58.140]
I mean, what are we talking about bidding on goddamn college, brawl game, get a life already for Christ's sake.

[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:02.740]
Hey, uh, one minor request for my brother McKenzie, the, uh, the Scottish bagpipe.

[02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:03.760]
Have a great day, bag.

[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:05.180]
So, it's going to be the same.

[02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:07.320]
It's going to be the same three or four things, George. That's a problem.

[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:08.600]
Just play him over and over again.

[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:11.120]
Well, let's just play it for 400 times.

[02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:13.440]
If we can do it with spots, we can do it with comedy bits.

[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:14.880]
Here's Hi, Alia. Hello.

[02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:15.440]

Yes, sir.

[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:21.080]
You were talking about the lady who, um, you know, the lady who threw the kid in the street.

[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:21.880]
Right.

[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:23.440]
Well, I'm a pro-lifer.

[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:29.060]
And we're, we, we care about the children, you know, happen to them.

[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:29.720]
Tags in the church.

[02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:30.020]
Okay.

[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:32.420]
Oh, yeah. That's right. This is the fact in the church guy.

[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:32.860]
That's right.

[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:34.100]
You know, fact in the church.

[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:34.660]
Oh, okay.

[02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:35.980]
What are you going to get a life, man?

[02:39:36.180 --> 02:39:37.500]
We care about all the children.

[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:38.460]
We care about all the children.

[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:40.580]
Did father, did father or two that your boyfriend run away?

[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:41.120]
Is that what happened?

[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:42.060]
Is that why you're so psychotic?

[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:42.680]
No, two.

[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:44.560]
What do you problem with father or two?

[02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:45.800]
I don't have to know him.

[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:46.220]
Okay.

[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:47.220]
It's just because.

[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:47.960]
How was he?

[02:39:48.380 --> 02:39:50.180]
There's no bags in the church.

[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:50.580]
Okay.

[02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:51.620]
There's none.

[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:56.920]
I'm not in the right to life, but then he faxed it.

[02:39:56.920 --> 02:40:00.240]
In fact, there's an article in the advocate this week for quoting some guy from the Vatican.

[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:02.300]
Who says that everybody at the Vatican is a fact?

[02:40:02.420 --> 02:40:03.200]
You think that he's a liar?

[02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:04.060]
He's a liar.

[02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:04.460]
Okay.

[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:05.480]
He's hurting the church.

[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:08.780]
He's probably just a fact propaganda, this is what I think.

[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:09.720]
He's trying to hurt the church.

[02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:10.580]

[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:10.740]
Yeah.

[02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:13.620]
Just like you try to hurt the Catholic Church, but it's not gonna work.

[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:14.500]
I know that.

[02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:16.000]
So he's not gonna work that way.

[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:17.100]
Because they reproduce too fast.

[02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:17.760]
I can't slow it down.

[02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:18.140]

[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:20.200]
And just because you hate the pope.

[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:24.400]
But I mean I hate to Pope I love the Pope I love the Pope. He's an old bag just like I am

[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:29.040]
Yes, he is only I'm a better dresser although quite frankly. I've never seen his dress

[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:34.400]
Other than that white smatha he wears all over the place understanding private he wear dresses up just like a gay and grouper

[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:36.260]
Wake up with the first team

[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:56.700]
My religion better than yours

[02:42:56.700 --> 02:43:00.680]
My religion better than yours

[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:05.040]
My religion marks required you Continue to avoid the lack of fire

[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:07.580]

My religion better than yours

[02:43:11.420 --> 02:43:14.240]
My religion better than yours

[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:16.240]
Why my religion annotates

[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:18.980]
Vigitory and racial hate

[02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:21.340]
My religion better than yours

[02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:25.140]
I believe in the standard that the order is.

[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:28.120]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:32.980]
Like we like about it best, I find no voice in where the dress.

[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:35.220]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:38.340]
What do you believe in the standard of the word?

[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:41.900]
What do you believe in the standard of the word?

[02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:45.160]
We have no respect for the word.

[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:47.040]
We have a driver cap to make the limit.

[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:49.000]
Why is the religion better than yours?

[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:52.520]
In my religion's standard of the word.

[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:56.220]
My religion is better than yours.

[02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:01.100]

My religion's better than yours.

[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:42.800]
We were tied in wide our bison getting very lost.

[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:45.520]

My religion better than yours.

[02:45:02.580 --> 02:45:03.820]
Let's do Miami. Hello.

[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:04.500]
Hello, Neil.

[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:05.740]
Yes, sir. How are you, Betty?

[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:06.760]
Very well.

[02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:10.420]
I just wanted to take the time and see if perhaps maybe you'd permit me to speak.

[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:13.420]
I'm a pastor of a local church.

[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:16.840]
And I hear your program on a regular basis.

[02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:17.460]
Yes, sir.

[02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:20.300]
I can't say that I'm critical of your point of view.

[02:45:21.060 --> 02:45:24.420]
The only thing that I don't understand about you is your atheistic...

[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:26.300]
What is it, atheist?

[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:28.260]
I believe you're an atheist, correct?

[02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:29.840]
Yes. God forbid.

[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:32.180]
Meaning that you don't believe in God whatsoever.

[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:32.680]
Of course not.

[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:35.600]
What kind of watch do you wear around your wrist?

[02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:39.260]
What kind of watch do I wear around my lip wrist?

[02:45:39.260 --> 02:45:42.060]
Well, for example, a Rolex watch.

[02:45:42.420 --> 02:45:43.260]
No, I don't wear a Rolex.

[02:45:43.340 --> 02:45:46.660]
Well, okay. Well, let's just say I take a Rolex and I put it in front of you.

[02:45:46.980 --> 02:45:52.180]
And I tell you that that Rolex happened by itself, that it just created itself.

[02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:56.560]
Wouldn't you say that I'm an ignorant person for thinking that that Rolex happened by itself?

[02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:58.400]
Sir, you know something? I wouldn't give a crap.

[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:01.920]
You're not... you don't worry about how this planet came to you.

[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:05.060]
No, I absolutely do not because I know that we don't know the answers.

[02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:08.600]
We don't even know answers to things that happened a few years ago or a few months ago.

[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:11.740]
We don't even know if Monica Lewinsky was even given blow jobs to the president.

[02:46:11.940 --> 02:46:16.100]
And you're trying to give me to believe a bunch of bobbin miceys that were written by primitive people thousands of years ago.

[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:21.180]
See, if I did care about those questions, see long time ago I said to myself, we don't know.

[02:46:21.460 --> 02:46:23.800]
And we're never going to know. And that's the end of it.

[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:28.460]
I'm not going to waste my life listening to a bunch of fairy tales that are being spread by other people for a purpose.

[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:30.480]
For like, take it over your mind and your money.

[02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:32.060]
What happens when we die then?

[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:35.220]
You go right into the ground. Just like, just like, Fido goes into the ground.

[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:39.460]
You go, a dust to dust, etc. and so on. That's it.

[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:42.880]
I mean, are you really afraid of death?

[02:46:43.420 --> 02:46:45.220]
It's not a matter of being afraid of death because...

[02:46:45.860 --> 02:46:48.380]
Sure it is. Listen, religion is about two things.

[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:51.020]
Fear of death and money. That's the only thing that really...

[02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:53.120]
You know what? You are absolutely right.

[02:46:53.900 --> 02:46:57.360]
Religion. You don't need religion. What you need is a relationship with God.

[02:46:57.580 --> 02:47:00.680]
No, but there is no God. There's no such thing as God is religion.

[02:47:00.940 --> 02:47:02.700]
You have to get away from that word.

[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:05.080]
Well, yeah, I'm not going to place them antical games with it.

[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:09.260]
So there is no God. If you believe in a God that the Jews invented or the Goyam invented or the...

[02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:09.880]
Okay, go ahead.

[02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:13.020]
There's been thousands of gods through the years.

[02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:16.440]
Every culture is invented their own gods. The Aztecs with the Sun gods.

[02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:19.880]
Everybody had gods. You know something? It's all just a bunch of double talk.

[02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:24.600]
That's all. But if it helps you to hang on to that, I don't want to deny you that.

[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:28.500]
But I'm certainly not going to be dying an opinion to express it in an opinion.

[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:34.460]
I respect your opinion. And I, like I say, I hear your program and I am critical of your point of use.

[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:37.960]
But now there are certain explanations that are logical. So then there are only two things.

[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:39.100]
Either evolution...

[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:40.940]
Sir, I want to ask you this question. Okay.

[02:47:41.340 --> 02:47:43.760]
This lady, the tour kid out of the car yesterday, all right?

[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:44.900]
Are you listening to me?

[02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:45.460]
Yes, I am.

[02:47:45.580 --> 02:47:49.760]
So what I'm saying is making chemical biological weapons over in Iraq, right?

[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:50.900]
Are you listening to me?

[02:47:51.020 --> 02:47:51.660]
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:56.800]
Okay. We have El Nino, which is causing flooding and all these grotesque things happening and people dying, right?

[02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:57.180]
Right.

[02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:00.360]
Now if God is omnipotent, how come all of this is going on?

[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:01.400]
There's also Satan.

[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:04.080]
Ah, Satan, where did he come from? Who invented him?

[02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:06.820]
Who invented him?

[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:07.820]
But aren't you, sir?

[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:10.920]
Who invented Satan? Who created him?

[02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:12.000]
Well, Satan...

[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.980]
Sir, who would you let me answer you?

[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:15.380]
I'm listening.

[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:17.960]
God created him a perfect angel.

[02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:21.220]
Yeah. See, here we go again. He created him as a perfect angel.

[02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:22.260]
Obviously not.

[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:22.980]
I thought that was...

[02:48:22.980 --> 02:48:25.160]
I thought that was J.T. Snow and then they created him as a giant.

[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:26.140]
He was a perfect angel.

[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:27.340]
Well, how do you explain?

[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:31.200]
See, if something is perfect by definition, it's just like God.

[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:32.680]
He's omnipotent and he's perfect.

[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:34.260]
But he keeps screwing up all the time.

[02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:37.500]
And we have leprosy and we have cancer and we have bumbonic plague.

[02:48:37.820 --> 02:48:40.020]
And we have AIDS and we have all of these other diseases.

[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:42.380]
We got this new disease that we're talking about.

[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:46.440]
Every time you turn around, there's another new disease that affects the brain and eats the brain away.

[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.140]
Every time you turn around, there's another new disease.

[02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:50.620]
And it's Satan.

[02:48:50.860 --> 02:48:52.100]
See, that's a convenient excuse.

[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:54.380]
That's for morons to say stuff like that.

[02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:56.240]
God is great, but Satan.

[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:57.260]
See, if Satan...

[02:48:57.260 --> 02:49:00.160]
If God is omnipotent, all these guys have to do is get rid of Satan.

[02:49:00.340 --> 02:49:00.680]
That's all.

[02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:01.660]
Hey, you're gone.

[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:02.300]
Like that.

[02:49:02.460 --> 02:49:04.160]
Like he snapped his fingers and he created the universe.

[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:05.440]
He also snaps his fingers.

[02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:06.380]
Satan is gone.

[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:07.940]
Let's have peace and tranquility.

[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:09.660]
You live 300 years of peace.

[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:11.020]
We don't have all of these problems.

[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:11.860]
We don't have wars.

[02:49:12.060 --> 02:49:12.680]
Man is perfect.

[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:14.000]
Doesn't have free choice.

[02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:16.040]
But then there won't be anyone to test us.

[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:16.620]
Oh, yeah.

[02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:17.340]
We have to be tested.

[02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:18.660]
Like Abraham, go because you're kids.

[02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:19.640]
I was just kidding.

[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:19.980]
Psych.

[02:49:20.420 --> 02:49:20.540]
Yeah.

[02:49:20.620 --> 02:49:22.420]
Just testing you.

[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:22.420]

[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:24.500]
Just checking out to see what kind of a good you,

[02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:25.360]
you really were, Abraham.

[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:28.440]
And by the way, I wanted to circumcise who you can...

[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:29.000]
Ischmeldrick.

[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:30.060]
Yeah, Ischmeldrick.

[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:31.040]
Ischmeldrick.

[02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:32.760]
Ischmeldrick was circumcised, okay?

[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:33.920]
Ischmeldrick.

[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:36.280]
All of these bubble mice, these my god.

[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:36.880]
It just...

[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:40.100]
It boggles my mind, but you know something I'd always do a lot of time thinking about it,

[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:43.800]
because I realize, especially, the one good thing that's happened to me doing this kind of work,

[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:46.880]
and doing this show every day, is I realize how weak most people are.

[02:49:47.060 --> 02:49:49.840]
Most people are such sheep, like these people we have sitting on hold,

[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:51.820]
and somebody says something while they're on hold,

[02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:53.900]
and if they can hear it, and then we punch them up on the ear,

[02:49:54.060 --> 02:49:56.780]
and they repeat it like a god damn parrot, like a minor bird.

[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:01.280]
Because their minds are so weak, they don't have an original thought in their brain if you could find it.

[02:50:01.660 --> 02:50:02.560]
But thank you for your call, sir.

[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:05.580]
All these religious notes, they're afraid of saying three little words,

[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:06.500]
that make it very easy.

[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:08.200]
And when you start asking all of these questions,

[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:10.500]
for which we don't have any answers, all you have to do is say,

[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:11.060]
I don't know.

[02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:11.700]
There you go.

[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:13.340]
And people can't say that.

[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:14.560]
And never have been able to say that.

[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:16.320]
So, since the beginning recorded time,

[02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:18.260]
everybody says, oh well, how did we get here?

[02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:20.420]
And then, okay, we don't really know, but we'll make up an answer.

[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:23.220]
Instead of just saying, I don't have any freaking idea,

[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:24.420]
let's make up an answer.

[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:25.620]
Let's make up some fairy tales.

[02:50:25.740 --> 02:50:26.520]
Sounds reasonable to me.

[02:50:27.180 --> 02:50:27.740]
And you know something?

[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:28.940]
They could have done a better job.

[02:50:29.140 --> 02:50:32.840]
And they could have made up some, I mean, like the Virgin Mary on the side of a bank building in Pensacola,

[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:34.000]
where they'd, I mean, come on.

[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:35.540]
Well, other cultures did do a better job.

[02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:38.520]
The Virgin Mary on a toteen of pizza at what's your name's house?

[02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:42.300]
Rosie, uh, uh, Rosie Riccardo, whatever her name is, in Hollywood?

[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:42.980]
Lopez.

[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:44.000]
Oh, Rosie Lopez.

[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:45.020]
I forgot all about her.

[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:45.680]
She's small potatoes.

[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:47.020]
Here's the lady in Miami.

[02:50:47.060 --> 02:50:47.380]
Hello.

[02:50:47.380 --> 02:50:47.460]
Hello.

[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:48.780]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:49.480]
Hi, Neal.

[02:50:49.580 --> 02:50:52.520]
I just wanted to say I'm really enjoying your show today, but I had a comment to make.

[02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:52.940]
Okay.

[02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:56.260]
Uh, isn't it true that a homosexuals aren't supposed to believe in guns?

[02:50:56.600 --> 02:50:57.360]
What the hell is that mean?

[02:50:57.740 --> 02:50:59.540]
I'm just asking, is that the reason why you don't believe in guns?

[02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:02.740]
No, it has nothing to do with anybody's sexual orientation or anything like that.

[02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:05.080]
It has to do with not believing in fairy tales.

[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:07.440]
See, here's the thing I don't consider a fairy tale.

[02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:09.340]
Here, here, that's why I said fairy tale.

[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:12.700]
Here's another example of a call, just like the other, the Julio,

[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:13.640]
that called before with his name.

[02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:14.560]
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:15.300]
Same thing.

[02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:15.780]
Yeah.

[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:19.040]
I really enjoy your show, but now you want to take a little shot.

[02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:22.040]
Yeah, well, all you're promoting is negativity on the other hand when God's promoting it.

[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:22.880]
Then let me ask you this.

[02:51:22.980 --> 02:51:24.540]
Why do you listen to the show then?

[02:51:24.840 --> 02:51:26.500]
Because you took three months.

[02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:28.760]
I usually listen to the show, but you know, this time.

[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:30.000]
Because it, because it was?

[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:32.540]
But this time, you know, you really know, let me ask you again.

[02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:33.220]
Why do you listen to the show?

[02:51:33.220 --> 02:51:34.020]
The money is negativity.

[02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:34.780]
Yeah, yeah, okay.

[02:51:34.860 --> 02:51:35.940]
Then go find something positive.

[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:37.520]
Go find yourself a good vibrator.

[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:37.900]
That's real.

[02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:39.240]
And make sure it's on positive.

[02:51:39.780 --> 02:51:42.260]
See, this, you're not fooling anybody, sweetheart.

[02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:44.020]
You're not fooling anybody for a second.

[02:51:44.140 --> 02:51:48.380]
And if somebody says something that makes sense and challenges all this garbage that's in your brain

[02:51:48.380 --> 02:51:50.340]
that you can't get rid of, then right away you have to,

[02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:51.540]
there are, because you're a faggot.

[02:51:51.700 --> 02:51:52.520]
It's because you're this.

[02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:54.480]
It's because you're bald and old and you're Jewish.

[02:51:54.700 --> 02:51:55.520]
Whatever it is.

[02:51:56.040 --> 02:51:57.180]
And she just can't handle it.

[02:51:57.260 --> 02:51:58.060]
She can't deal with it.

[02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:03.560]
Well, sweetheart, if you want to believe that there are the little green men on Mars and on the moon and on the cockamoon,

[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:04.940]
whatever you want, it's a free country.

[02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:07.380]
Go right ahead and just be a bozo of the rest of your life.

[02:52:07.500 --> 02:52:09.300]
Because that's what nothing negative about reality.

[02:52:09.340 --> 02:52:11.100]
Well, it's pretty ugly, but nevertheless,

[02:52:11.100 --> 02:52:14.080]
if you can cope with it, unless you are weakling, in which case you need religion.

[02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:15.140]
And obviously you do.

[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:17.140]
Besides, there are a lot of self-hating religious facts.

[02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:18.940]
Oh, there are a question about that.

[02:52:19.320 --> 02:52:24.760]
That's why the Catholics have that dignity thing so that they can go there and pretend that the church loves them and so on.

[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:28.700]
Even though the church, of course, the Catholic Church is just low, there's nothing but fags in the church.

[02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:31.100]
Just read anything you want about the Vatican.

[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:32.480]
There's no fags in the church.

[02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:34.260]
Like I said, make no mistake about it.

[02:52:34.580 --> 02:52:36.900]
You show me a guy in a dress and I'll show you a faggot.

[02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:38.320]
Or a guy who likes to dress up.

[02:52:38.740 --> 02:52:39.220]
Or both.

[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:41.320]
Wonder if Johnny Bench likes to dress up.

[02:52:50.660 --> 02:52:54.360]
We're down in Jamaica and the KELDA bean.

[02:52:54.720 --> 02:52:58.040]
They got the best work that you've ever seen.

[02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:01.880]
Ask anybody in that table of work.

[02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:05.560]
They tell you this country where the country is good.

[02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:09.240]
Rapslamani has some he wants to sell.

[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:11.300]
And from a mile away, they're going to be the same.

[02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:11.300]

[02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:14.080]
You can detect the smell of smoke.

[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:17.900]
Smoke, gun, smoke, smoke.

[02:53:19.140 --> 02:53:21.580]
He lights up his breath and smoke.

[02:53:23.260 --> 02:53:26.260]
Smoke, gun, smoke, smoke.

[02:53:27.060 --> 02:53:29.100]
Smoke, gun, smoke, smoke.

[02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:32.960]
The gun's a bit good.

[02:53:35.980 --> 02:53:39.460]
You can carry lots of earth in the gun and stack.

[02:53:39.460 --> 02:53:43.360]
Smoke it every day until your lungs turn like.

[02:53:44.180 --> 02:53:47.300]
With all the money that we have made.

[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:51.040]
Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid.

[02:53:51.660 --> 02:53:54.880]
A man again pulled his arm here and say,

[02:53:55.420 --> 02:53:57.920]
Got nothing like this in the US.

[02:53:58.380 --> 02:54:03.280]
They smoke, smoke, gun, smoke, smoke.

[02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:06.960]
They light up the split and talk.

[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:10.800]
They begin to cough and choke.

[02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:14.640]
Smoke, gun, smoke, smoke.

[02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:18.320]
They gun, you're very good.

[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:24.900]
I'm the Delphus on you, our era of stuff, man.

[02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:28.700]
You like to smoke the giant slip whenever you can.

[02:54:29.400 --> 02:54:32.460]
Then we put them in here for miles around.

[02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:36.360]
I'll bite the earth for you by the ounce of nick-pump.

[02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:40.020]
Raster man, say to her, how am I alright?

[02:54:40.820 --> 02:54:44.680]
It can be good tonight and then they smoke.

[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:48.500]
Smoke, gun, smoke, smoke.

[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:52.280]
They light up the split and talk.

[02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:56.080]
Smoke, gun, you're smoke, smoke.

[02:54:57.480 --> 02:54:59.760]
Smoke, gun, smoke, smoke.

[02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:03.860]
They can't be good.

[02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:08.400]
Yeah man.
