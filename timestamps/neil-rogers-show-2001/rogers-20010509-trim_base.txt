[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020]
voice now.

[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.740]
a singer

[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.740]

[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.760]
Soprote

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.760]

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.760]

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.000]
A beer.

[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.800]
A clear tip

[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.220]
beyond the tunnel.

[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.160]
That is the problem.

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.200]
Ghost and Fallen Goal.

[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.120]
Splendid one more time.

[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.400]
This be my trouble.

[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.820]
This be my trouble.

[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.280]
The troopers don't make you gay.

[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.140]
I killed my teacher.

[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.680]
It was a accident.

[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.520]
I bust the cabin today.

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.140]
Yo.

[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760]
Okay, we're right to break into your ass house.

[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000]
I didn't break in.

[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.080]
Thanks for a lock.

[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.100]
Yes.

[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.400]
Did you have a right to do that?

[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.320]
No sir.

[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.980]
And you want us to believe you did it because you were worried that our car was there

[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.760]
and you were afraid that something happened to her?

[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.180]
I didn't know what was wrong.

[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.920]
Her car would get she's hardly ever home with she's hardly not.

[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.160]
She's hardly ever gone without her car.

[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.480]
So anyway, let me ask you this.

[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.160]
Do you feel responsible for that shooting, George?

[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.580]
I do.

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.740]
George is back from Tennessee.

[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.440]
Do you feel it good?

[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.600]
George is responsible.

[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.920]
I loaded the gun for him and everything.

[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.160]
Oh.

[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.100]
Because I don't.

[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.720]
Anybody else in the audience feel responsible for this?

[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.940]
No.

[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.920]
Because Robert Steinback and one of the most pathetic horrendous columns I've ever read in my life,

[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.280]
which I'm going to read the entire thing on the air in a couple of minutes,

[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.080]
writes in the heraldous morning,

[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.540]
Brazil, Trial bears our errors.

[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.760]
We, society, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we did it.

[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.420]
We're supposed to be responsible for it.

[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.020]
Now, court TV has taken a poll as they're showing the a trial that's going on right now.

[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.260]
I don't want to deflect a lot of people because it's on CNN.

[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.140]
It's all over the place.

[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.460]
But it's on court TV, which is much better watch their anyway because they don't interrupt it as many times

[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.460]
for all those stupid commercials like we do.

[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.480]
But anyway, they're taking a poll as the thing is going on, which they've been

[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.400]
televised in the trial from the beginning.

[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.940]
And the question they're asking is do you believe,

[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.340]
his, in the fangirl Brazil is a count of the murder.

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.280]
84% of the people responding say,

[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.420]
Oh, and only 16% say,

[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.780]
Yeah.

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.900]
84 to 16% say absolutely positively.

[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.500]
No.

[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.540]
No, we don't believe them.

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.540]
Let's give you the poll result from yesterday on our show.

[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.540]
Which of these groups most deserves financial operations?

[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.940]
African Americans, this is out of 931 votes.

[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.580]
African Americans, 37.

[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.440]
37.

[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.620]
I mean, not even 4%.

[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.040]
Holocaust survivors, 115, 12.3%.

[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.060]
American engines, now we're talking, 322.

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520]
Say American engines.

[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.280]
Deserve reparations, 34 and a half percent.

[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.100]
Was that a little bit loud?

[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.000]
How about this?

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.840]
How's that better?

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.280]
Okay.

[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.560]
And none of the above, which is what I voted,

[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.380]
nobody deserves no reparations, you know, 456.

[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.480]
48.9%.

[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.140]
There you go.

[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.800]
Almost half of our people got it right.

[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.580]
Excellent.

[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.560]
The idea that we're supposed to do,

[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.980]
and then that whole concept ties right in with Robert Steinbach's column

[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.760]
in the hero this morning.

[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.760]
It's ludicrous.

[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.100]
The idea that we're responsible for stuff that we had nothing to do with,

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.920]
or we're responsible society as a whole,

[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.500]
is responsible for anything.

[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.060]
Because first of all, there is no such thing as society as a whole.

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.440]
And the fact that the kid was 13 years old when he committed the murder,

[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.580]
and that's exactly what it was, not in no accident,

[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.500]
when he committed the murder of his teacher,

[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.340]
you see, we're supposed to feel very bad about that because society made him whatever he was.

[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.760]
We're responsible for it.

[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.240]
Now, if he would have waited five or six years until he was an adult,

[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.040]
then we wouldn't have to feel so bad about it.

[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.920]
And I keep bringing it up to Ted Bundy as an example.

[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.140]
Isn't Ted Bundy a real good example?

[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.000]
I think so.

[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.240]
Before we just, before we eat the whole column,

[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.900]
here's a paragraph from Robert Steinbach's idiotic dangerous column in the hero this morning.

[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.680]
It really is dangerous.

[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.920]
He says, we were told our society was to blame for homelessness, crime,

[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.280]
the untreated mentally ill, the abandoned elderly drug abuse homophobia, and on and on.

[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.140]
And he knows something.

[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.320]
He's talking about America being exhausted by guilt.

[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.100]
But as a society, we're responsible for ignoring these problems.

[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.480]
But as far as the homophobia, let me speak to it personally.

[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.700]
When John Wayne Gacy was a crop haven't killed all those boys and young men,

[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.940]
were there any gay leaders or any other gay people defending John Wayne Gacy?

[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.100]
Oh, not that I ever heard of.

[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.880]
Was I defending him?

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.320]
No.

[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.560]
Anybody defending Jeffrey Dahmer of his barbaric and grotesque acts?

[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.700]
No.

[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.540]
So the idea that there's been racism and homophobia and sexism and all these bigoted things,

[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.860]
that's not debatable.

[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.520]
We all know that.

[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.000]
These are part of society's ills that we try to cure supposedly.

[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.120]
But to try to suggest it because the society's responsible for that,

[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.100]
individuals no longer have to be responsible for their own actions.

[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.480]
And later on in the comedy, you know, we spotted that.

[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.940]
But in a very man-be-pambi way.

[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.060]
But he's a child.

[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.580]
Now, if you try to tell me that a 13-year-old kid doesn't know the difference between right and wrong,

[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.140]
and that all of his classmates, you'll notice if you've been watching the trial,

[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.700]
all of the fancielers' classmates, they're all liars.

[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.760]
The rest of the world is out of step.

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.180]
He's the one that we are supposed to believe.

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.100]
He'd be telling the truth.

[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.600]
And for an honest student, that's interesting that he was about to get an F in English class from

[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.500]
very Bruno, who's the teacher that he shot.

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.060]
And in your entire column here this morning, Robert Steinbeck,

[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.060]
I'm out of the mentioning the name of the teacher.

[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.880]
I don't read a single word, all these paragraphs, which I'm going to read.

[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.440]
I don't read one word in there.

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.240]
Not one.

[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.700]
About the teacher.

[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.900]
And the wife he left behind in the family?

[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.280]
I don't read anything about that.

[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.440]
Right, young dedicated teacher, which is pretty damn hard to find these days.

[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.880]
Yeah.

[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.100]
We're always belly-icking about the school, suck, and we can't find good teachers,

[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.680]
and the pay is too low on all of these things, which are all true.

[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.480]
And there's not one word about that.

[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.880]
See, this is what's wrong with America today.

[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.740]
We're not supposed to be interested in the victims anymore.

[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.040]
Oh, how could we know what's the point of wasting another life?

[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.740]
We had that call a couple days ago.

[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.240]
Yeah, what's the point of wasting another life by putting this to a young man in prison for the rest of his life?

[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.000]
And then my response was, well, how about Ted Bundy?

[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.040]
Then we execute him.

[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.760]
We're not even talking about executing this kid.

[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.520]
That's not going to happen.

[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.940]
How can we waste Timmick Vase life?

[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.440]
How can we next week from today?

[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.600]
May 16th, we're going to be wasting Timmick Vase life.

[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.540]
I mean, he's got that nice orange jumpsuit.

[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.080]
He could be out here in a corner of 441 and I was very rude,

[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.160]
doing the homeless voicing. He's already dressed for it.

[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.660]
He could be raising money for the homeless.

[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.140]
See, like I said, he's got the right outfit.

[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.040]
Why should we waste his life?

[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.320]
Just because he committed those barbaric, rotesque acts and blew up their goddamn building in Oklahoma City.

[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.520]
I mean, Robert Steinback, you are really a fool.

[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.560]
You are pathetic. And you're not fooling anybody.

[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.060]
A fool, don't fool nobody.

[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.960]
Just remember, he heard that first here. Remember that?

[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.040]
Sure, she brighted it down.

[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.220]
I mean, I'm going to read this one.

[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.760]
It's a good thing I don't eat breakfast because I probably peop my guts out.

[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.840]
If I had a big breakfast this morning,

[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.620]
it's not for somebody with a weak stomach because it's so nauseating.

[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.420]
I'm sure there will have a few of you folks out there.

[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.740]
I don't want to say that, you know, of any particular persuasion.

[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.880]
But we'll have a few folks who probably agree with this crap that he wrote in the paper this morning.

[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.240]
Maybe some of you already read it. Be reading it.

[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.460]
And here's our poll question for today, which fits right in.

[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.680]
Fits right in. And I made it simple because Eric is on the road today.

[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.400]
He's doing an eating tour of Florida.

[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.160]
What? What are you laughing about?

[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.800]
He's stopping. No, he's doing it for consumer reports.

[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.860]
He's checking out all the service plasas or restops for the food thing,

[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.520]
Mrs. Fields Cookies and Nathan's, all of those things.

[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.460]
I think he'd be pretty good at that, don't you?

[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.120]
That's what Eric's doing. So he's on the road.

[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.900]
But he is going to be able to put up our poll question.

[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.700]
We said, make it simple.

[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.140]
I said, hey, it's perfect for me. I'm pretty simple.

[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.820]
Here's the poll question today on theoriders.com.

[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.400]
Do you think most Americans take responsibility for their own actions?

[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.160]
Yes or no? Very simple.

[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.000]
Anatized right in with the Nathaniel Brazil shooting of his teacher.

[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.980]
And with all these bleeding hearts and this wacko.

[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.760]
Do you read about this guy who was demonstrating outside the courtroom yesterday?

[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.260]
That they had a drag off? No.

[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.640]
This wacko, this will of anata.

[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.840]
Yeah, he ran inside and disturbed the trial.

[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.580]
Screaming and shouting and carrying on like a, like a banshee.

[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.740]
Like my mother did at the graduation.

[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.540]
Oh, I'm sorry. Your mother did at the graduation.

[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.500]
Birds of Alps.

[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.860]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it.

[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.640]
And happiness is just around the corner.

[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.260]
Well, if you don't want to wait the five days, who cares?

[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.960]
Buy the damn thing off the street. Just buy a lot of handguns.

[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.020]
It's a great alternative to working problems out and could be considered a population control.

[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.280]
Yes, handguns. They just might make your fans.

[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.840]
1014 at 560 WQM. So you've got another appearance at Bill Siles.

[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.760]
Let's start promoting that way ahead of time. Maybe we can get a couple of geeks to show up.

[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.860]
That's not nearly as amazing as the Shell gas station appearance I'm going to be doing this Friday.

[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.860]
All right.

[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.500]
Okay.

[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.400]
Wow. Now what's it going to be free gas or something?

[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.220]
Yes, Miguel. What's the, uh, what's the idea?

[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:57.640]
What's the idea?

[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.700]
We're going to give you some gas.

[00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.340]
Yeah.

[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.080]
And there's nothing in line with the show that we did on Monday.

[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.280]
George is going to be providing with gas, not out of the pump.

[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.800]
But anyway, so it's this Friday?

[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.800]
Yeah, but I don't know which cell, which shell from the 7th to just drive around town to all the shell stations and look for George.

[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.100]
It's a gas. And then of course you'll waste enough gas to have to fill up against probably part of the deal.

[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.540]
Yeah. Anyway, a protester disrupts proceedings of county lifeguard and Perennial protest to inject it himself in a

[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:29.340]
Nathaniel Brazil's first to be murdered trial yesterday morning by loudly assailing a system that's trying the 14 year old boys and adults.

[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.440]
This is wrong. Shouting will Vanetta 45 in front of the jurors before deputies grabbed him and dragged him from the courtroom.

[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.980]
He can't vote. He can't serve out of jury. This is wrong.

[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.460]
He was shouting and screaming before they dragged him out.

[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:48.100]
While some legal experts call the incident unfortunate, they doubted that the outburst would affect the trial and charges that he shot teacher Barry Grunau last year.

[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:57.920]
Kurt Grunau, brother of the slain teacher, was so concerned about the possibility of a mist trial and so discussed it with Vanetta's display that he followed him as deputies led him to the front of the courthouse.

[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.680]
Grunau tried to lunge at Vanetta, what was restrained by deputies and walked away.

[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.340]
What do you like that?

[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.140]
Lifeguard.

[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.600]
Maybe he knows the fishermen.

[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.620]
Oh, that's the possibility. Maybe they can look together. Sounds like a match made in a purgatory.

[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:19.200]
And just like Robert Steinbach, we've got all these activists out there very concerned about this poor little kid who,

[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.320]
been watching his performances last two days to be honest with you. I don't really think all that highly of him.

[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:23.740]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.900]
Not all that bright.

[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.220]
At best.

[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.180]
Although he does play a mean tuba here.

[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:36.380]
But nobody cares about the victims anymore. Nobody gives a crap anymore about people who are victimized about lives that are stuffed out because like I've told you for years,

[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.760]
life in America is as cheap as a guy named Chocolate Malt.

[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.300]
Or, and now, where were you saying you got a good chocolate malt?

[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:41.840]
Sonic.

[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.740]
Good everything.

[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.920]
Yeah. Good golly.

[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.420]
Okay.

[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.380]
So Robert Steinbach, who probably ought to go to Sonic for one last supper before we, you know, cool amounts somewhere.

[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.300]
He, you know, this is a crazy person.

[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.780]
Robert Steinbach, a terrible.

[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.480]
He's written some columns over the years that I've agreed with and I've read those in Yadi Yadi.

[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.460]
And, but every now and then his, his professional darkism comes into play and that's got to be what this is all about.

[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.940]
Because he's not a stupid person.

[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.740]
And I want you all to prepare everybody known as prepared to feel very guilty. Are you ready for that?

[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.600]
Oh good. I want you to feel really responsible just as though somehow you were responsible for preparing to give the kid an English class

[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.480]
and for not letting the girls out of, see, he was actually going to let him come inside and talk to the two girls when he came back.

[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.500]
That wasn't good enough.

[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.940]
He wasn't going to let the girls step outside the classroom to speak to Nathaniel.

[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.560]
So therefore he pointed that gun.

[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.820]
Oh, see it went off.

[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.120]
Now they asked him to demonstrate in court.

[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.640]
They had him holding the gun.

[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.140]
They asked him to demonstrate and by the way the prosecutor is doing a great job.

[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.520]
Ask him to demonstrate how in holding the gun it could go off accidentally.

[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.440]
He couldn't do it.

[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.500]
He gave me every opportunity under the sun.

[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.300]
How does that happen?

[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:47.880]
They show me.

[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.860]
Give us a display.

[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.720]
Could he do it?

[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.040]
No.

[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.340]
No.

[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.300]
Huh.

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.520]
But anyway, so, uh, uh, uh, uh, and get the puke bag ready when you hear this.

[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.080]
Robert Steinbach writes in the hair of this morning, Brazil trial bears our errors.

[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.960]
He says, I haven't been able to shake the feeling while following coverage of 14-year-old Nathaniel Brazil's murder trial.

[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.520]
That society finally is off the hook for what's wrong in society.

[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.420]
Not long ago, society, meaning the people of our communities and nation and our collective attitudes and values,

[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.820]
would have felt compelled to examine its own role in the boy shooting of teacher Barry Gruno.

[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.980]
That's the only thing that mentions the name.

[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.260]
Young Nathaniel did, after all, spring farm arm rits, young Nathaniel.

[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.240]
Now, listen to the adjective, say, young Nathaniel did, after all, spring farm rits.

[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.500]
Don't we have an obligation to examine the reality?

[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.000]
We've created the search of clues to explain why a 13-year-old would react to a minor setback,

[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.640]
being sent home from school for misbehaving, by carrying a loaded gun to school

[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.620]
and pointing at the face of a teacher he admired no longer it seems.

[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.860]
We created this screwed up confused frightened boy, just as surely as we've created

[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.460]
and proudly taken by curious credit for the scientists, entrepreneurs, and artists America's produced.

[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.880]
But we don't want Nathaniel Brazil on our conscience's balance sheets,

[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.140]
so we've cut him loose to bear the murder charge alone.

[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.660]
How cowardly!

[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.100]
When something good arises from our society, we are America, the proud nation of values.

[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.740]
Yet when the same cauldron spews forth something bad, we point in accusing finger with the individual and exonerate ourselves,

[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.600]
saying America had nothing to do with it.

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.300]
I hear so little outrage, despair, or even angst that yet another child faces life in prison.

[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.920]
No political or civic figures have spoken up except those who endorse such barbarity in the name of justice.

[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.420]
They're scarcely in debate at all. The bully pulpit is vacant.

[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.440]
This subtle but relentless philosophical shift away from society bearing any responsibility for its citizens' actions

[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.720]
has intensified during the last quarter century.

[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.840]
As I see it, America has been exhausted by guilt.

[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.400]
The Depression for Society had taken responsibility for poverty and economic injustice,

[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.760]
the civil rights and feminist movements forced society to admit to generations of institutionalized racism and sexism, the list grew.

[00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:01.520]
We were told our society was to blame for homelessness, crime, the untreated mentally ill, the abandoned elderly drug abuse homophobia, and on and on.

[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.540]
America made considerable social reforms in latter part of the 20th century,

[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.560]
but rather than this progress being a source of national pride in morphed into resentment.

[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.380]
Overuse of the guilt card by political liberals opened the door for conservatives to stoke this resentment.

[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:22.640]
Progress by distress segments of society, increasing the was depicted as coming at the expense of more deserving and productive segments.

[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.240]
Criminally inclined kids became the exclusive fault of parents, not society.

[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.780]
I'm not exonerating the individual from self-responsibility for bad behavior, far from it.

[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.700]
A scrapping responsibility to society never removes it from the individual.

[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.460]
Nathaniel, Brazil must be disciplined for his actions, but not as an adult.

[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:47.180]
The reason he's being prosecuted is one is that we are too cowardly to admit that kids are shaped by the world we created.

[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.920]
How do you like that? We're too cowardly.

[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.800]
Now, don't you feel bad? I feel you're right, very guilt.

[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.640]
Don't you feel guilty and responsible for the fact that we've done things that caused him to do this?

[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.200]
In addition, let me say you're full of crap, okay? You're full of Schmidt Roberts signback,

[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:06.220]
because after every one of the kids shootings in the last few years, whether the shootings at Columbine,

[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.780]
whether the kids were black as in this case, or white as in that case, or whatever, after every one of those cases,

[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:16.460]
there's been this long, gnashing and rower, hand-ringing and carrying on, why do kids do this?

[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.840]
And what was in their background that caused them to do it?

[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.560]
And were they abused the children, were their parents unfit?

[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.700]
There has been no shortage, hours and hours and hours of why as a society we've somehow failed,

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:35.560]
which has absolutely nothing to do with just a smoke screen, it's just a cloud, it's just obfuscation is all it is.

[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:43.020]
To try to cover up for the fact that this kid knew exactly what he was doing, that he's the liar that his schoolmates,

[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.460]
all of whom got up under witness stand and very articulately told their story,

[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:52.560]
and how he said he was going to go back and f up the school, because he was pissed off and fired up,

[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:59.320]
because he was caught throwing water balloons in class, and because he wanted his name all over the goddamn newspapers,

[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.140]
and in the media, another one of these deals. Are we responsible for that?

[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:03.400]
No.

[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.500]
Adryl suspended along with Brazil, said they were leaving that afternoon, he said he was going to come back

[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.880]
and shoot the guidance counselor who caught them. Classmate, and of course he wasn't around,

[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.660]
so he shot the English teacher instead. Classmate Michelle, and of course the English teacher was going to give an F, so he deserved it.

[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.640]
Classmate Michelle Kornov, said Brazil warned her that he was going to be all over the news.

[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:32.700]
Brazil said Tuesday, he didn't remember the conversation at the time he said he was mainly mad at himself for doing something that would get him suspended.

[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.520]
He also did not ask you an 18-year-old neighbor for a gun, just after he'd been suspended,

[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:43.000]
Brandon Span testified last week that he bumped into Brazil, and the seventh grader asked him for a gun that he could take back to school.

[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:50.660]
Brazil said it didn't make sense to ask from to ask Span for a gun, he already had one at home, meaning the one he stole from grandma, grandpa.

[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:59.260]
I mean his answers to the questions are so ludicrous, the course they've had a year to cook up this whole deal, him and his lawyers,

[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.220]
and his lawyers told him to do this, and his lawyers told him to do the interviews with the magazines, and to list it all as something you could get,

[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:10.340]
so that people like Robert Steinbeck could write this swill, this garbage, this trash, in a major market newspaper this morning,

[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.500]
about how worse it would work cowardly.

[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.860]
I feel horrible.

[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.440]
And especially those of us who think America is a slaughterhouse, and that all these guns being around her,

[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.180]
and people being irresponsible with guns, how many times have I talked about that? 80 billion times over the years?

[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.540]
But I'm supposed to feel responsible and bad. Well guess what, Robert Steinbeck, I don't feel bad,

[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.600]
because I know the difference between blowing somebody away when I get pissed off.

[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.140]
George's mom would be in a box right now, affording for the fact that he knows the difference between right and wrong,

[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.680]
between blowing somebody away or not every time they get pissed off. In fact it would have been years ago.

[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.220]
Well, it would have been right, but it would have been illegal. Well there you go.

[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.500]
So you see, thank God for George, so he doesn't have to bear responsibility for it anymore than I do.

[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.580]
I wonder how many of you people in the audience feel guilty for Nathaniel Brazil blowing his teacher away.

[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.880]
I'm changing the way I do everything now.

[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.360]
I mean, what craft society did it? This individual didn't do it. I mean talk about contradictions.

[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.820]
And one part of the column is written about society has got to examine itself for attitudes and values in the audio audio.

[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.780]
But the interesting part of it is that the overwhelming majority of kids thank God out there don't take guns to school.

[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.760]
Don't shoot their classmates. Don't shoot their teachers. Don't shoot their friends. Don't eff up the school.

[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.800]
And they're growing up in the same society watching the same TV.

[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.500]
And I should point out by the way that Brazil was also a testify that he had a pretty good home life.

[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.020]
Yeah, he had a good home that he was happy with his mother and his stepfather.

[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.420]
He was angry at his father, but nevertheless he was happy with his mother and stepfather he was living with.

[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.780]
And he was not happy with his home life. That's usually the excuse.

[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.840]
There are no excuses. Don't you understand?

[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.200]
Anybody make an excuse for Ted Bundy? Jeffrey Dahmer? David Berkowitz? John Wayne Gacy?

[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.980]
No. Charles Manson? Richard Speck?

[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.200]
No.

[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.440]
No. Nobody's making excuses.

[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.260]
And I should point out that they still don't really know when the first killing was that Bundy did.

[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.160]
But if you read the book about Bundy, the ones that they do know he was still a teenager when he committed his first murders.

[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.760]
There you go. So how come we executed him?

[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.420]
Wasn't he scared and confused and troubled?

[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.440]
Oh, and that's right. And they lied to him about who his real mother was or something like that.

[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.260]
Remember that? Yeah.

[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.920]
He was evasted, literally.

[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.940]
And now he's dead.

[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.240]
Anybody feel sorry for the fact that he's dead?

[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.600]
No. No. I don't think so except for the bleeding hearts out there who I think that capital punishment is barbaric.

[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.460]
Like I was saying last week till I came back to earth.

[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.860]
No, but you see, because I thought I still lived in Holland when I was saying that.

[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.820]
And then I realized, oh, I live in the US. I better be for capital punishment because this isn't a civilized place like that.

[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.880]
Where people don't want to mind blowing each other away.

[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.160]
We have more murders in one day here than they have in most other countries in a year.

[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.180]
In one day.

[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.960]
In a good weekend here in Miami, we can beat like most of Europe in a whole year.

[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.280]
Except the course for those good religions in the Northern Ireland, things like that that don't count.

[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.180]
Plus they use bombs anyway.

[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.660]
They're more like the Cubans. They use bombs, you know?

[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.740]
La Bomba.

[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.040]
Oh, here's Bobby Shapiro on there.

[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.280]
I wonder what kind of I'm not going to put it on.

[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.800]
I don't want to hear anything he has to say.

[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.140]
Next thing, he'll probably be saying, oh, Jay did it.

[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.880]
In fact, do we know that if OJ was at the school that day, we positive?

[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.100]
No.

[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.280]
Well, there you go. Something to think about.

[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.160]
Maybe Slasher.

[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.140]
Maybe OJ was looking for the killer of her in the colon run that day at the school.

[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.120]
Maybe he put a bug in the fanials here, huh?

[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.620]
I mean, we don't know for sure.

[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.000]
That's my point. I'm not suggesting anything, but we just don't know for sure.

[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.620]
No, he probably has a good alibi.

[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.080]
Maybe he was with Pedro Guerrero that day.

[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.180]
Or maybe he was getting to some kind of a civil disobedience kind of thing out there in the streets with you.

[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.600]
Who knows what the alley was doing and who the hell cares?

[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.260]
But if anybody out there feels any guilt because Robert Steinbach told you to be told

[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.400]
unless that we ought to feel guilty, then I feel for you.

[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.380]
I feel for all of us that we don't have a real newspaper in this town.

[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.440]
They would write, you know, cap columnist who could write more intelligently than that.

[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.120]
26 after 10 at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.500]
If you didn't get a good night's sleep last night, here's the answer for it.

[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.020]
Here's the remedy for a long time to come.

[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.580]
Call dial amactors where he gets super low prices every...

[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.680]
I don't want to mention his name on it.

[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.740]
My post-friend had the accident there and really...

[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.220]
That was funny.

[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.940]
He comes in here yesterday, Hank, and just back from Louisville.

[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.340]
I guess maybe he's still under a lot of stress that he didn't pick the winner anymore than the rest of us did.

[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.860]
And he's telling me before he's sure about the...

[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.920]
Oh, you know, they really got an exciting young team to watch the Marlins.

[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.540]
And I said, you don't understand.

[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.180]
Nobody cares.

[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.120]
You don't get it, Hank.

[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.200]
There is no interest.

[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:37.820]
There is none.

[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.380]
And I explained to him that on Sunday on a beautiful, perfectly sunny day,

[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:47.080]
with no threat of rain, with no great humidity or high temperature, you know, low 80s,

[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.720]
they had 10,000 announced that an actual crowd of 5, 6, 7,000 people there, maybe.

[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.460]
So I'm driving home and Hank is going on about, well, you know, I really...

[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.540]
What a shame would be to lose the day.

[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.280]
See, a lot of you folks, you just did the night.

[00:22:59.380 --> 00:22:59.940]
You don't understand.

[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.260]
I mean, you may have the best rain deer meat in the U.S.,

[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.260]
but, you know, take it to Finland and sell it.

[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.400]
There's no interest in it here.

[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:06.860]
No, seriously.

[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.380]
You may have the best halavab, but taking it to North Pole, they don't like it up there.

[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.860]
You know, you have to take it somewhere where they're interested in it.

[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.360]
There is no interest here.

[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.180]
So Bush and Corroyo now, and the best part of the new deal is...

[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.800]
Yeah, the rumor is the deal is they're going to make us an offer so good

[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.880]
we won't be able to turn it down.

[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.620]
We heard that before.

[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.100]
Yeah.

[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.960]
Corroyo says he hopes to craft a ballot measure.

[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.720]
I love the way...

[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.380]
Hear the way that he's got a craft a ballot measure.

[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.100]
In other words, if you're against the stadium vote maybe,

[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.760]
if you're forward vote, we don't know, and we'll figure out what you really mean.

[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.560]
He hopes to craft a ballot measure that would go before the voters in July.

[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.120]
And Bush said to last Senate President John McCain,

[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.200]
Husker Tom Fini, to make the plan a priority when legislature meets again in January.

[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.600]
January, this is the middle of May.

[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.000]
There even...

[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.280]
There even whispers about maybe like a special session.

[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.660]
Which the governor says is highly unlikely, but don't ever count it out.

[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.680]
Corroyo says the voters would, in essence, be asked all the questions that are pertinent to a new stadium.

[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.960]
It'll be something that will give the marlins the assurance they need to move forward.

[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.140]
Whatever that means.

[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.500]
In July, am I going to be here in July?

[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:16.720]
No.

[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.420]
So don't blame me.

[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740]
I won't be here to lead the ban.

[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.500]
Wagonhamshire George will do his part since he hates ports anyway.

[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.740]
But what a joke.

[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.120]
And I think it's great.

[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.000]
Put it on the ballot.

[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]
Waste, waste, you know, have a special election.

[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.260]
I mean, evidently, the city of Miami that's always under verge of bankruptcy, they have unlimited funds.

[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.620]
All of a sudden, unlimited funds to go and buy the land into all of these other things.

[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.380]
No problem.

[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.620]
They're finding money all over the place.

[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.540]
City in the county.

[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.620]
Same county that can't give textbooks to your kids in school to take home.

[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.680]
Oh, don't get me started on that again, because then Dave Hybel starts picking on me and saying,

[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.940]
oh, there you go again with education.

[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.860]
He was like, so get rid of the marlins.

[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.620]
Won't save the schools.

[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:54.980]
Right.

[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.160]
Well, what a brilliant observation that is.

[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:03.320]
But I'm sure we could probably find something better to spend at $120 million that they wanted from legislature on.

[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:09.180]
Not to mention all the other millions and millions and millions of dollars you're going to be subsidizing all these white elephants with for the next many, many, many years.

[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.880]
Will they ever learn here?

[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.160]
No.

[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.520]
See, because these are people who, they're like our sales department, the marlins, and the politicians who are in bed with them.

[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.840]
They don't know one word.

[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.180]
No.

[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.040]
They don't know that word.

[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.180]
Just like the old Julio Queens.

[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.020]
They don't know that word.

[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.240]
No.

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.180]
They don't know what it means.

[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.320]
They just won't stop.

[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:25.960]
No.

[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.080]
Now, what is that?

[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:27.300]
No.

[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:27.580]
Okay?

[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.160]
No.

[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.120]
Just this one time, okay?

[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:31.400]
No.

[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.620]
They don't get it.

[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.740]
So it doesn't make any difference.

[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.640]
What the public say?

[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.220]
They're going to continue hatching and plotting and planning.

[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:44.540]
And I'm really worried in July if that goes on a ballot because Hank yesterday indicated that what I heard from him tells me again that he's wavering.

[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.100]
He's waffling.

[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.140]
He's waffling.

[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.300]
Now nobody loves hockey more than I do.

[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:49.860]
But you know something.

[00:25:50.040 --> 00:26:01.020]
If they said if they care, if Wayne came on TV and knew today and said, well, we found a legal loophole and were able to break the lease with the Amacarena because we can't find a new buyer for the hockey team.

[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.780]
And we're going to move them to Tennessee.

[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.340]
We're going to help you just in town to give me a like, yeah, like the Knoxville.

[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.460]
That already got Nashville.

[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.160]
We're going to move them to Knoxville, Tennessee, Johnson City, Johnson City.

[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.420]
But Tavy in New York, we're going to move the panthers.

[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.500]
Would I shed any tears?

[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:18.860]
No.

[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.340]
I just don't care anymore.

[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.800]
I don't care to the point where I stop going and I just like with the Marlins, I get my tickets for free.

[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:25.780]
I don't care.

[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:34.060]
I stopped going because not because they were losing, but because it wasn't entertaining because it was depressing because there was nobody there and for good reason there was nobody there.

[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.960]
It was a waste of time.

[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.340]
It's a social club.

[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.680]
And when you dilute something like like I talked about the other day, if Ruth Chris started serving in hamburger.

[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.360]
I think they would lose most of their clientele very fast.

[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.720]
And then if they started serving like really low grade hamburger, I don't think anybody would be going there.

[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.360]
And it's the same thing.

[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.460]
No, yeah, but come back.

[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.600]
Our hamburger is better this way.

[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.260]
Well, too late.

[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.800]
You know, you've already blown it too bad.

[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.600]
We thought other things to do, other things to eat.

[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.320]
And it's the same thing with these sports moguls.

[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.900]
You know, with all these multibillionaires.

[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.340]
You keep watering it down.

[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.380]
You know, we spent out taxpayer dollars.

[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:16.140]
They finagaly come up with some cockamami scheme with bit of these big, gigantic, beautiful palaces.

[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:22.360]
And then if things don't quite go quite your way, you just, you know, you savage, you trash the organization.

[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.880]
You leave us with a shadow of what we had before.

[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.220]
And anybody doesn't believe that if you watch the Buffalo Pittsburgh series, Game 5, Sue Barnes, Gord the winning goal for Buffalo and overtime.

[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.260]
Game 6 last night, Marty Straca, of course, the winning goal and overtime for the penguins.

[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.460]
And who are the names we keep hearing during our game last night?

[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.160]
Straca and Barnes, and there's Rhett Warren or again, and there's Jason Wolley.

[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.640]
Scott Mellon be doing great there in St. Louis.

[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.780]
They went for it in a row from Dallas.

[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.000]
All those guys are still playing.

[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.580]
So if the Panthers disappeared tomorrow, I mean, you know, I'd miss going to some of the games like the two-year Winter Auto plays here.

[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.780]
But other than that, I don't care, really.

[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:58.780]
I don't care anymore.

[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.180]
So don't give me this big song to dance about.

[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.560]
Well, gee, I really like baseball.

[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:09.940]
If they paid me by the pitch, and there was no bigger baseball fan in the world than me when I was growing up as a kid,

[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.460]
and then lasted for many, many, many years, for most of my adult life.

[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.160]
And when they had their last work stop, when they basically slapped the public in the face and said,

[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.720]
oh, we're not even having a world playoff of World Series this year, whatever year that was, 94, whatever it was.

[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.160]
At that point, I said, screw you guys.

[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.780]
And then, of course, when the salary just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and everybody said,

[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.100]
oh, gee, we can't make any money.

[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.560]
And the owners start crying.

[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.540]
But what you're crying about, if you're paying guys $252 million, how do you expect to make any money?

[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.400]
We're not going to subsidize it.

[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.580]
So I just don't have any interest. It's just big business.

[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:51.420]
And all these people are waxing poetic about, oh, well, there's nothing better than taking your kids to a ballgame and having a hot duck.

[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.080]
Well, that's all ancient history now. That's all in the past.

[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.520]
It doesn't exist anymore. It's a figment of your imagination.

[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:07.820]
You're living in a distant past. Now it's just brazen, big business where guys just whore themselves out to the highest bitter.

[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.420]
You got a bunch of mercenaries out there.

[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.900]
And whoever pay them the greatest amount of money, that's where they'll go.

[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.600]
They don't give a flying crap about any of you.

[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.960]
There's no loyalty. There's no allegiance. There's no continuity.

[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.420]
Who the hell's on the team? Who are these guys?

[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.000]
Oh, yeah, but they got a bunch of good young guys.

[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.660]
But who the hell are they? Nobody cares.

[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.320]
So you can give a song and a dance on there, Hank about how you, you know, it would be embarrassing to lose baseball.

[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.200]
Let's come up.

[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.500]
What difference does it make? How many stadiums you build?

[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.260]
The problem isn't the stadium in the first place. Everybody knows that.

[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.540]
There's nothing wrong with that stadium. It's in a perfect location.

[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.220]
You drive and ride off the turnpike.

[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.200]
The problem is that the owner got sucked into a bad deal.

[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.340]
That's the problem you'll bush other than the SNLs.

[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.660]
I don't think the government usually steps in to bail anybody out.

[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.360]
Do they? If you're in private business, are they going to come and do it?

[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.820]
All right, I gotta go again.

[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.580]
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, you can't drive on a clear vote. Come here. Come here. You're gonna fall asleep.

[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.300]
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.220]
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.700]
Do I just put these lines out? Look at this line.

[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.640]
Oh, no, I can't.

[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.240]
Come on, man. Come on.

[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.080]
36.

[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.040]
Come here in the 36. Come on.

[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.560]
Come on. Don't do Coke anymore, man. Come on, man.

[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.860]
I just want to go.

[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.760]
Hey, brother.

[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.320]
Hey, brother.

[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:20.980]
I can't do anything.

[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.740]
We got two straight girls waiting for you.

[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.740]
No, I don't do that anymore.

[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.260]
No, no, no.

[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.060]
We'll just three of us.

[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.720]
It's just three of us. Come on, come on. Come on.

[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.400]
All right, just one.

[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:29.900]
Yeah.

[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.100]
I got one.

[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.260]
Right now.

[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.460]
I'm in the sand, listen.

[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.480]
Coke, brother.

[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:35.820]
Yeah.

[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.480]
Coke, brother.

[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:36.840]
I'm in the sand.

[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.460]
Coke, brother.

[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.300]
Go, brother.

[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.200]
Go, brother.

[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:43.040]
I get in. Come on.

[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.700]
I got a new script yesterday. Come on.

[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.720]
I can't, man.

[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.680]
I got one.

[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.460]
I got one.

[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.660]
I got one.

[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.960]
Go, brother.

[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:55.520]
You ready?

[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.000]
Go, brother.

[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.920]
Go, brother.

[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.020]
Go, brother.

[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:57.640]
Go, brother, go, brother.

[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.320]
Robert Downey Jr.

[00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:58.640]
Robert Downey Jr.

[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.100]
Go, brother.

[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.880]
Because you're only 36.

[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.160]
Robert Downey Jr.

[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:02.420]
What?

[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.440]
That don't you feel guilty about him?

[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.820]
That don't you feel it's a society responsible for his aberrant behavior and his constant

[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.700]
to drug abuse and, uh, etc and be misguided.

[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.280]
That's my fault.

[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:10.660]
Yeah.

[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.400]
Never mad him, but still.

[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.220]
So cut the crap.

[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.020]
By the way, we've had a major change in that Survey on court TV.

[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.460]
Do you, um, believe Brazil is a count of the shooting?

[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:25.900]
Yes, 15% no 85% so he's improved 1% as he goes on 85% no 15% yes is that a good no not too good

[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.320]
Nathaniel maybe he had his tuba there

[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.260]
Huh blow a few notes?

[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.960]
Well, here's the thing about sunny fox and Ron hersy which is interesting in the sunsettles

[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.500]
Not even a least but interesting about the fact that they're not on the urine trance on lame ass comedy routine on MP3

[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.320]
Do you see that they're downloading or even download do we want their stuff?

[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:47.100]
No, this this must be in lieu of time jicker writing a piece about their ratings every time we have a stupendous rating book

[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:53.160]
All of a sudden both Kevin Bastard and Harold and Tom jicca all nobody cares about the radio ratings and they're not writing anything about that

[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.100]
How do you like that? I wonder how castrenoma feels about that

[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.580]
And what is wrong with

[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.520]
So anyway, here's an update from our friend Paul and for Myers. This is the third consecutive today

[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.200]
I thank you profusely's keeping us on top of this story

[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.660]
Merrillville, Indiana, exprinsible and girl found that's the good news the bad news a

[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:21.280]
former back to school principal accused of running off an 11-year-old girl was captured to they by the FBI after the two were found together in a lost Vegas area hotel

[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.020]
Well, at least he took over they could have a good time

[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:32.720]
William a byte 28 was arrested on federal charges of coercing and enticing a minor into sexual acts and transporting a minor across

[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.680]
Day lines for sexual purposes at FBI agent Doug Garrison and Deanapolis

[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:43.240]
Both by the and the girl were safe garrison said he didn't have any other details of the capture in a hotel in Las Vegas

[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:49.260]
Viva Las Vegas and Viva the Baptist Church and all the other Graham to how do you like that?

[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.740]
And the Jews we know I'm about that rabbi up there and where the hell was it somewhere up there and I missed that story

[00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:01.300]
What the rabbi one? No, you didn't a couple weeks ago. Sure. He didn't miss that story. We're here. Oh, I forgot

[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.260]
The rabbi that got canned because they thought he was a molesting boys and

[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.460]
Had a prior thing in St. Louis

[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.340]
I totally forgot that wow. I must have been out or something

[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.760]
No, you were not out just slipped your mind you were too worried about the

[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.940]
Bows on vacation you were too worried about the Palestinian you just killed it to his really kids anyway

[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.360]
You want a body count? Okay, better pardon? Yeah

[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.960]
460 just a sheet count

[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.320]
Anyway, getting back to poor Nate. He's on there right now

[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.740]
There you go he was one of his friends. He's not a friend anymore. You want to know why George? He's not a friend anymore

[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:40.980]
He's still dead

[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.440]
How do you like that? He's not a friend anymore because he died that's the reason and because they put a bullet between his eyes

[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.880]
He's dead. He was one of his friends which contradicts earlier testimony that he told other kids that he'd like him and

[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.940]
Especially when you know he's you're gonna get an F in English and if you've heard his English

[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.820]
I think you can understand why he was gonna get an F in English. Don't you understand?

[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.020]
Yeah, I mean I don't want X no tough questions

[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.380]
But I've been listening to his testimony the last two days and he do not sound like an honor student to me now far

[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:11.120]
Be it for me to judge, you know, he just does not sound like an honor student to me

[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:16.820]
And for whatever the reason was he was gonna get an F in English. Yeah, I guess he ain't gonna get it now

[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:22.980]
He's got an F in life and Robert Steinbeck says that each and every one of you all of us should feel responsible for it

[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.400]
And I am I must be a bad guy and you want to know why because I don't feel even the slightest Iota of

[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:35.460]
Responsibility for Nathaniel Brazil for Lionel Tate the rascal and that girl and killing her and breaking all her bones for the kids out there in

[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.800]
Columbine which I don't even live there. I don't feel responsible for those things

[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.180]
Because I've been saying for years that this is a slaughterhouse in a barbaric place and that guns do

[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:50.060]
People yes they do and that people are gonna own them out of be responsible and make damn sure that little kids any responsible people

[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.460]
We run it around every time they get pissed off killing people with their gun. Yeah, and stuff like that

[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:01.400]
So having attempted to be a voice of reason a voice of sanity and otherwise a country of total insanity

[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.520]
I don't feel like I want to be responsible

[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.760]
Maybe that field makes you feel bad Robert Steinbeck you in the so you

[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:12.360]
In fact, you're responsible for writing crap in what is supposed to be a major market newspaper

[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:19.180]
All over the place. I mean he's all over the map here with this thing and finally at the end of the article if you have a strong stomach and get to the last part

[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.460]
Oh, yeah, well, he must be disciplined for his actions and

[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.840]
Scrubbing responsibility of society never removes it from the individual. Well, so what are you saying?

[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.620]
He's saying both things he wants to have it both way

[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:34.660]
But he's desperately trying to make excuses and uses all those adjectives, you know about poor young Nathaniel

[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.820]
This screwed up confused frightened boy. Did he look confused and frightened to you?

[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.180]
Can feel I watch them right now. You know looks frightened to me looks confused by light. I asked to me looks like a real con artist to me and a liar

[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:55.720]
The way the word yes if he's let out if he's a dangerous killer at 13. Mm-hmm. What are you gonna do by what time he's 20? Yeah?

[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:03.860]
Plus he had this fast nation with guns. He only wanted to be a cop. They want to be a secret service agent to protect protect president

[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.240]
Huh he'd have it right in back in 63 I guess

[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:15.200]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 sit all and also want to correct one of the thing because that'll look out a lot of stuff on my plate

[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.900]
Brian Murray is not the general manager of the Chicago black hawks

[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.500]
About 10 days ago somebody came in here and handed me a thing from the sports department there

[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.380]
Brian Murray had been named a GM in the black hawk. What is that all about?

[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.240]
Mike Smith is still a general manager Brian Sutter is the and I made several comments jokes about that during last 10 days

[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.440]
Which nobody corrected me because nobody out there knows the damn thing about hockey and he didn't get the job

[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:40.560]
He was up for the coach. He was under consideration BM and they said no. We don't want no BM will take BS instead

[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:47.220]
And so it took my good close friend Rimmer last night called me in between that penguin Buffalo game to correct me on that absolutely right Rimmer

[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.480]
And I'm still not buying dinner, but at any rate

[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:58.500]
It's amazing how much misinformation gets on here in this place. Oh, it's astonishing and what's even more astonishing is that nobody out there knows what they're talking about

[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.200]
But hey, it's typical for South Florida isn't it? Oh, right?

[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:08.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line probably a lot of folks watching the trial this morning

[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.380]
I understand that you got my permission. I'm sitting here watching it myself

[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.280]
Here's for my or so. Hey, how you doing? You're pretty good sir

[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:22.400]
The only thing is I this totally this kid's responsibility, but I I just feel sad in the way that this kid has thrown away his life

[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.280]
I mean it's it's it's sad

[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:30.240]
But what about the life of the teacher? Well no, no, no, I understand you I understand that you'll be

[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.240]
He took away somebody else's life right you're right. No, I'm not

[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.460]
Nothing at all. There's nothing in the world worse than you can do

[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:41.220]
But then unless it's multiple lives then taking away somebody else's life. No, I you have no argument

[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.280]
So then why are you concerned that he's throwing away his life? He didn't because if nobody else for you

[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.440]
It's a bad thing. It's just a sad thing. Neil

[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.540]
I'm just a sad thing is just what I don't know

[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.160]
I yeah

[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.980]
That is a sad thing, but to me it's a

[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:58.240]
Zidian Times worst much sadder that the teacher who was a responsible decent person with a wife and family that he's dead

[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.420]
That's much sadder to me. Maybe my priorities are screwed up, but to me that's a lot sadder

[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.500]
What I really called to ask you about was um later this year

[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.420]
I am going to Vegas for the first time. Uh-huh

[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.480]
And I wanted to ask you your opinion of the out ex-caliber hotel

[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.460]
Yeah

[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:17.200]
Yeah, George is sticking his finger down his throat here if you're into going to Disney World and you have like a lot of little punky kids

[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.340]
It's okay, but I wouldn't go there that I heard you know, you don't want to go why would you want to go there?

[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:26.560]
Well, I'm going there because a part of my job. That's like a full thing. We're getting like $480 for five nights, right?

[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.200]
Airfare included from Tampa to I mean you can stay there, but you just don't spend any time in there

[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.600]
I mean, you've got the walk over you can go across to the MGM New York New York the Trappocana and all over the strip

[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.160]
But you don't want to spend any time in there. They're writing the walking distance from there. Yeah

[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.220]
The restaurant suck and you don't want to spend any time in there. I hear the I hear the New York New York's pretty cool

[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.560]
It's it's okay. I like the MGM, which is right across the street

[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.140]
All right, well listen that they'll still think George's punch pack and take care

[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.720]
How do you like that? Does that a great collar one? I

[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.460]
Guess he got blown away. I guess he covered all the bases

[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.440]
Maybe he'll run it in that the Baptist men's urine little girl in the ex-caliber. Yeah from Indiana

[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:11.560]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line George is weeping right now

[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.780]
Why did he weep because we took that call?

[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.660]
And I feel the same yesterday I didn't take too many calls to be honest with it

[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.660]
And I went through a whole tirade about the fact that colors on the talk shows generally suck

[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.000]
Not just on this show in fact the colors on the sports shows are much worse than this

[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.980]
I heard some little hooliocall in Hank yesterday talking about the Kentucky Derby. This kid had no idea what he was talking about

[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:31.940]
none

[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:33.880]
And

[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.060]
That's generally what you hear because it's here. So why should you expect this to be a sports time?

[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.240]
They don't even understand what they're talking about they claim to be big football fans. They don't even understand that

[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.160]
That's their claim to fame. Oh, this is a football town. Okay. What do you say? They do show up in the dolphin games

[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.260]
I'll say that but other than that they know what they're talking about they don't even get it

[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.360]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City. Hello. How you doing now great?

[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.120]
This ain't those sports down. Yeah, the mother's don't draw the

[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:08.000]
That's nobody. Yeah, he took cell phones away from the pants or game nobody would go there right and the dolphins don't

[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.440]
Reason they go there is to get trash and get bombed in the park without pre-earned for the game. Yeah

[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.780]
That's you know, that's what it is. You know, that's that's what you got done here

[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.640]
But you know this guy here he killed he killed the dude

[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.240]
He you know, he took away a family man with two kids and now they got to grow up with a father. Nobody thinks of that

[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.440]
It's an absolute joke

[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.620]
It's got to go to jail for the rest of his life

[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.760]
I mean how come how come the first thing that seems to come out of the mines of people like his last idiot from

[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.320]
Four Myers who finally showed what an idiot he was then the call

[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.400]
But nevertheless the first thing that comes to mind is well

[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.760]
It's so sad that this kid is thrown away his life. Well who forced him to do that? Ted Bundy threw away his life

[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:46.140]
All those other people I mentioned through way their lives nobody forced into a commit no abhorrent acts absolutely

[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:51.560]
Another matter what is ages he pulled out the gun shot them and had killed the guy any any kid that's 13 years old

[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.360]
It doesn't know they in the difference between right and wrong and blowing somebody away. I'm sorry

[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.980]
But we got real problems with that

[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.780]
See the other kid lionel tape. I still think that kid is emotionally disturbed and needs to be like in a some kind of

[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.640]
psychiatric facility for a long long time if not forever because he's dangerous

[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.120]
But this kid's not emotionally disturbed. He was cold and calculating. He planned this whole thing out

[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.240]
He was pissed off and fired up and he told his friends

[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.480]
He was gonna go back and eff up the school and firstly we've got to drive the car through the school and that didn't work out

[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.520]
So he went and got the gun

[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.380]
And then he said he was gonna go and kill the teacher and his name would be all over the media

[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.520]
But now he's in the year later. He's got a whole different story because that that story isn't gonna fly in court

[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.400]
That's not gonna play too well by the jury

[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.100]
So now we got a whole different story that he's they got cooked up for him

[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:41.560]
And amazingly his testimony and everybody's spec conflicts with each and every one of the witnesses all his

[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.320]
classmates all his buddies they got a different story

[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.900]
So like I said the whole world is out of step and good old Nathaniel. He's the only one who's marching to the right drummer

[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.400]
The right tuba player

[00:41:53.440 --> 00:42:04.780]
Here's Miami-B. Here's a mobile and key west. Hello. Hey, yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. There's more to that Baptist principal story than you heard

[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:10.360]
Yeah, it's in the USA today. He had previously arrested for sex for this minor. Oh right

[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:15.600]
And before he got provoked his father was the principal event school Baptist principal

[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:21.160]
He was arrested for selection the oral sex from a undercover male cop

[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:21.600]
Great

[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.340]
Okay, so runs into family of an hour

[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.980]
It's in that order. Don't you feel responsible for that?

[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.180]
Most definitely. Oh, I do too

[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.120]
Well, it's not always great listening to you. Have a good day. Thanks a lot and get a new phone

[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:39.240]
56705 50 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.900]
Oh, but he's a man of the Lord the man of the cloth. Yeah, huh? I was good to have a cloth around just in case

[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.120]
Yeah, bubble would have just had a cloth around

[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.360]
He probably might even still be in there might have got a third term. We might have changed the law just to get him back in there

[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.220]
We like him so much

[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.940]
Although he wasn't quite dumb enough. I guess

[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.420]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.500]
Poor Nate. What are we going to do about poor Nate? Huh?

[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.740]
Now let me say it again except for the one mentioned to be I guess he just had to get the name in there the teacher that he murdered

[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.100]
Robert Steinbeck doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about the consequences of this act

[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:17.820]
And

[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.180]
The fact that here's a you know very

[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.840]
Civilized decent worthwhile person who's you know, I'm sure that intelligent people can do a lot more

[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:29.060]
Looker to things than teaching public school believe me when I tell you that

[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.360]
A lot safer things

[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.740]
Things that were a lot more appreciated in the society that has a priority in all their priorities all screwed up

[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.640]
And doesn't place a high priority in education, but he chose to do that

[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.040]
And he's dead and we'll see him no more

[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.520]
But don't you feel bad for poor Nate or no, I do not no, I don't

[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.480]
And if there was a legal way to fry his ass, I'd be more than delighted to pull the switch does that say?

[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.960]

You're rocking corks. Okay, okay, I get the picture. Hey, piss that meat. There's a smart fellow

[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.220]
And while you're at it, it's a big result too

[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.800]
When having breakfast don't leave out the most important food

[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:13.320]
Meat would remember it incomplete if you leave out the meat meat good. Yes, me good

[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.480]
I go back area of you if you join us like

Your regulation the time to give you for the penguins giving them the opportunity to come back and win this game and extend the series

[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:30.140]
The penguins have won the game here

[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:35.360]
Game overtime is Marty Spocka for the seven game his second overtime

[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.140]
Liter and ladies and gentlemen Elvis has just left the building

[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.500]
It's Marty Spocka once again

[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:47.340]
And I apologize for Eddie Eddie old-check it and carry the weight like a washerwoman there squeaking out

[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:52.800]
That was pretty embarrassing on Fox Sports Eddie. Oh, sorry Eddie, but the controller itself. Okay. What's pretty exciting

[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.080]
5607. Oh any interest here. No, no

[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:56.820]
I

[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:03.200]
Mean the notion that this is a sports town is as laughable as the idea that we're gonna open up a hall of

[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.280]
Us staying in Montpelier for month. That's how ridiculous it is in Johnson City, Tennessee

[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.360]
Five say although George was up there teaching a meadish, which I think is a good start

[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:18.700]
5607. Oh 560 and then made a hasty exit pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.940]
Here's a mobile in ghouls. Hello

[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.140]
Deal. Yes, sir

[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:33.100]
Maybe I can barely hear you sir. You think they'd be making a big deal if this kid wasn't black

[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:39.020]
I beg your pardon. I don't think Robert standback would be

[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:43.680]
Well, okay, and the next thing there's a rumor going out there that the Dell is

[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:51.520]
Okay, great 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T see heard me say something about cheats and I guess you figured compel to call yeah

[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:58.960]
Ah Jesus when he graver what do you want? Well, I wanted to let you know that I call sometimes even after the favors lose

[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.880]
It was a great game last night. Uh-huh

[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.940]
Very juggle. Yeah, it was and I was rooting very hard for the penguins

[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.740]
Stabbers turn out to be a much dirty or more desperate team than I thought they were

[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:15.340]
They have some very good skilled players like Chutan and the Finnegana but very dirty holding and clutching and tackling

[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:19.040]
The penguins won that game in spite of some of the worst officiating I've ever seen in my life

[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.560]
In the first two minutes of the game Cyklkov just about butchered Mary or Lemieux

[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:28.780]
No penalty was called and then you get the varata with that plastic that should at least minimum four-minute penalty gets two minutes

[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:33.900]
So the tables are very lucky that let me say it again should have been at least four you don't have to draw blood for four

[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.980]
But the sabers were very lucky that they were even in that game

[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:44.500]
Well, you know Hachik seemed to keep them in it pretty good and that's that one plus why he must have gone about four hundred miles last night was he

[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.700]
Was he getting the hate on a pro pro like that? Oh?

[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:53.460]
He was all over the place. Yeah, and but that did you see that saved by shidnik? Yeah?

[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.740]
Little fun. No, it's two barns who stopped and I'd shidnik that was two barns

[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.960]
No, it was shidnik now let me say it again was two barns

[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.180]
I saved the one when the net was open there at the end of the second period two barns

[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.860]
Okay, doesn't it doesn't it bring a tear to every real hockey fans?

[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.780]
Every one of the 50 of us to hear in South Florida that to see two barns and Marty Strachio and

[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.520]
Redborne and all these others play so prominently here in the playoffs in Scott Melonby

[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:22.300]
But the organization here continues diluting and diluting in the pro where we have nothing left and the fan base for all of these teams

[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.900]
continues getting smaller and smaller and smaller because you can't put the

[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.260]
Limberger out there on the table and sell it to the shatobrian people are gonna buy it totally totally

[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:34.200]
There's just there's just no one out there of them pop now that just you know keeps it going

[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.740]
Well, he's he and keeping it going. Yeah, there's no interest. Yeah

[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.160]
Good luck to you, Maranay Woody and uh wish wish the leaves luck tonight

[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.440]
He's not listening to a word. I'm saying wish us luck a buffalo about Toronto series and be great

[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.780]
I love a buffalo. Okay, you're gonna haircut. Okay, and say how to fat boy

[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:54.560]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:01.560]
Here's the mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I was listening yesterday to the the live um

[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.480]
The talk of the kid that killed the teacher uh-huh that kid knows exactly what he did and

[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:12.240]
And he killed somebody and he needs to go and serve his time for it. I don't the big controversy is and you don't feel responsible for it

[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.440]
Oh, everybody's responsible for the way this world is nowadays these kids don't know

[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.580]
What's right and wrong, but I mean if you go by that then you never get to anybody in jail

[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.740]
And so you really believe that you are responsible for?

[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:29.100]
Not directly responsible. I the world is responsible. Not me directly responsible. I know is always the world responsible

[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.540]
Uh, no, we've done to a bad choice the words and maybe it's just a

[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.760]
Maybe the way around exactly that somebody somebody else is responsible

[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.780]
And how come all the other kids who are in the same surroundings as he is aren't bringing guns to the school and shooting teachers every day

[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:47.820]
So I guess I guess the one you're saying is right is just he's just a screw up then he did it period

[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.400]
I'm gonna talk about he he went and he caught the gun in front of the

[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:55.140]
The kids and then they're saying that he was gonna take the gun to learn how to shoot it

[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.840]
He already knew how to shoot the gun and put the bullets and all that stuff. It's just the unity did

[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.840]
Yeah, his buddy from South Carolina already taught him how to do the gun and load it in the school, uh-huh

[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.120]
They gotta keep it in the family, I guess

[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.260]
Okay pal have a great day. All right, Ethan

[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.940]
5 6 7 0 5 60 Pog got many open lines here for some bizarre reason

[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:15.760]
Well, they're probably all watching the trial today because said you're certainly probably being more interested

[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:21.920]
Yeah, I already had 65 faxes of this already this fantasy the study says some gays can go straight

[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.420]
That's like saying that some blacks can go white. Oh, look at that the lights are flashing must be an act of God

[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.280]
Uh-huh, as you said that as I said that

[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.400]
Started flickering like my face hope for you. Yeah, you want a wife and a family right

[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:39.860]
Dr. Robert Spitzer a Sir Country Professor at Columbia University in South Carolina who led the study says he can't estimate

[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.200]
What percentage of highly motivated gay people can change their sexual orientation

[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.480]
But it's probably just about as high as the number of people who can change their skin color right

[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:53.960]
So you can you can do your uh Anthony Perkins or whoever else and you can go get married and pretend to be something

[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.200]
All you want to satisfy all these homophobes or just be whatever you are

[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.700]
The choice is yours

[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.800]
But don't waste any more of my fax paper over I already had 30 copies of that and not interested

[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:10.360]
More fairy tales from the right wing from the good religion is like that Baptist minister that I abducted 11-year-old girl and sexually abused her and took her off to Vegas

[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.220]
I guess you could say you took her gamble on what he did and lost

[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:19.580]
Like usually happens in Vegas you take her gamble and lost and have a lovely he had a good time too for a while

[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.160]
Is that line six out again? It's been that way for days now. Yeah line six is out again

[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.680]
I just mentioned that I don't want to ruffle the feathers of engineering department because they're probably busy

[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.780]
Playing P-knuckle

[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.520]
Or maybe getting the cards in there so the guys that working in the all of room across the hall can get there

[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.100]
They're a thing to come in the door there

[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:39.220]
I mentioned that the other day they were standing out there cooling their heels and I luckily for them

[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.640]
Walked out and took a leak and opened the door so they can get in and I heard one scream to the other

[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.960]
T George Corso told me two months ago. He was gonna give us those cards to open the door two months ago

[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.580]
And I made it out of the message. Yeah. No, maybe the message is the George Corso ain't doing anything

[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:57.280]
I think that's a message. Oh, yeah, it's typical. Don't hold your breath guys and plus what are you guys doing in there?

[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.640]
Anyway, oh each other

[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:06.640]
Eight minutes after 11 at 560 WQM this Mother's Day is Sunday, May 13th. There is the other way around Mother's Day is this Sunday

[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.900]
Either way you look at it Sunday, May 13th

[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:13.520]
They after Saturday make mom happy by sending her bear gram gift them to the Vermont bear teddy bear company

[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.540]
It's a fun original way to let mom know she's loved and appreciated your mom wife or grandma will receive a beautiful bear

[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:23.580]
Handcrafted and Vermont and personalized just for her with a candy and card all delivered in colorful gift box

[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:29.820]
Just call a friendly bear counselor one eight hundred eight two nine bear and choose from over a hundred bears like to do it all mom or mama's boy

[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.980]
With a heart-shaped mom tattoo. There's even a pregnancy bear

[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.240]
Taylor a bear to your mom's occupation or hobby with a nurse doctor teacher slut or gardening bear

[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.440]
sending a bear gram is a creative alternative to flowers that your mom will love forever

[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:45.420]
Send a bear to the office while the co-workers can see just how thoughtful you are and you can be a really big shot for a little while

[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:50.440]
It's so your job dad to get mom and present from the kids too and the mother in Cubsett is a really nifty idea

[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.340]
overnight and weekend livery's guaranteed so called it but we got it six o'clock again

[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:58.520]
And I guess a mad dog I heard him belly-hacking about it on a Friday charges a little bit too much of the problem

[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:03.120]
So we have to go low rent district this week because the marlins are on a west coast. So once again at six tonight

[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:09.060]
We got oh god six to nine three hours might as well shut the transmitter off and save the juice

[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:16.000]
Did he say save the juice nine o'clock? He got your uh busy crow and then nine thirty the pregame marlins at the Dodgers

[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.620]
Marlins one last night seven to six. I mentioned that in passing

[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:18.680]
Anything

[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.740]
Any interest no no

[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:27.160]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, no, how you doing? Okay, sir good. I hate to do this to you

[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:31.220]
But it was didn't it not to barns. I mean that really said it was to barns. Oh, excuse them

[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:35.560]
Well, it was it was forty five just happened. Okay. Well, it doesn't really make a difference

[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:41.020]
Second thing was that the Bruins just signed Robbie for Torra because their new head coach. Yeah, and nobody here cares

[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.720]
Maybe I don't know who that is

[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.840]
Okay, so good job with the devil's there Robbie. Oh, sorry. They fired him

[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:53.200]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T. Oh, it's a hockey show today. Is that what it is? Oh, no, I don't think so

[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:58.460]
Let me say it again. This is in the hockey town. It's not a baseball town. It's not a sports town

[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:02.940]
It's a person buggy town always has been always will be it's a banana boat town

[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:08.160]
It's a early bird town. That's it. I mean if you want to be pissed off at me for saying that go ahead and be pissed off

[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.620]
That's the truth. That's not the way I like it. I'm not happy about that, but that's just the way it is

[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.120]
That's what you are

[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:16.920]
Hey

[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.240]
Hit him again beat come on beat

[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:23.960]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T and for Ryzen wireless line

[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.600]
Here's the mobile in North Miami Beach. Hello, Neil. How you doing great? Hey, I watched cash in yesterday

[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.920]
All right for the first time yesterday was pretty interesting. I guess it's got some kind of supernatural thing to it

[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.440]
Well, I had the whole thing is ridiculous. You're right. You kind of are my dreams and gremlins goblins

[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.580]
You remember dark shadows? Yeah, that was great. Yeah, but this is more front than dark shadows

[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:48.660]
Yeah, I may watch it again today too many fighting comments and dark shadows. Hey as far as that Brazil kid

[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.300]
He knew exactly what he was doing. Yes. I don't feel responsible for him

[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:56.000]
He don't and went while that rubber rubber sidebacks gonna be knocking on your door

[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.920]
About three in the morning give you a lecture right to your face mister. Hey since they're gonna have the table set up next week for McVeigh

[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:06.360]
Anyway, yeah, send hate and Nate and send him in line put one under each arm would be good take them all down

[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.660]
Okay, thank you. That's not a bad idea three for one

[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.040]
Oh

[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.280]
5 6 7 0 5 oh you're cruel and barbaric you're heartless. Oh, yeah, I'm heartless, huh

[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:23.820]
Nobody cares about victims like I said that's why we have victims advocacy groups in this country

[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.920]
We shouldn't have to have those things but we do because generally speaking the victims

[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.720]
Yeah, they're not very exciting anymore because they're dead see

[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.780]
So you don't see them being interviewed every five minutes on TV and most most of the time their relatives are grieving too much

[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.640]
They don't want to be bothered

[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.000]
Unless it's Fred Goldman who wants you know to get a TV show because he got a big mustache

[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.220]
Never see Fred Goldman and Lanny McDonnell together. Oh no

[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:53.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.140]
Here's a mobile in Weston. Hello

[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.840]
Hello, how you doing Neil pretty good sir

[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:05.320]
Well, I'm up to the top of you for singing for the sports town, but I have to disagree with you. I don't think it's any different than the other town, you know

[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.040]
Wrong

[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:14.940]
Is that the end of my call? No, but it's just wrong your point is wrong. It's not the end of your call. You say what you want if we can compare to some other places

[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.680]
I mean take a look at your Pittsburgh, England. I mean before Mario

[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:21.820]
Pittsburgh is not a sports town either nobody ever said it was well

[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.300]
I mean how many towns we have to go through before we can compare it as well

[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:28.520]
Well, see that but you'll see well this is what happened with expansion sir when they trouble they got

[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:33.580]
Greene and they wanted to squeeze a hundred million dollars out of franchises and split up the money amongst themselves

[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:39.800]
The fan that's not the fans that you're talking fans, you know, that's that's that's that's that's the business of sports

[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.840]
You know the fear you're you're not letting me finish

[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:49.440]
Okay, go ahead. I'm sorry the point being that they wound up putting major league franchises in the cities that couldn't or wouldn't support them

[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.160]
That's the point and that is the fans

[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:56.080]
Well, I could agree with you there for sure, but you know, you take a look at a place like the air exceeded

[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.840]
They've got mass transportation. They've got population at doubles our size and they can get people to the ball games

[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:04.120]
Even midday midweek. Yeah, what about what about saying Lewis

[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.320]
What about what about what about Detroit?

[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.480]
Are they downtown stadiums?

[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:17.200]
Detroit does they're not they they're not putting anybody in that stadium. They just build them a brand new stadium. They're not throwing flies

[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.920]
Well, we're talking about South Florida, you know, in our sports fans

[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:26.220]
No, you were just talking about New York now, but if I mentioned someplace else that you don't know about and then we're talking about South Florida again

[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.840]
This is not a major league sports sponsor and it never will be it never never ever will be

[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:35.760]
And the idea you can build 50 stadiums. They can be like the Taj Mahal and if there's no interest in

[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.800]
Why would they be going to a stadium in a place that they don't want to go to where they can't get to and have to pay an arm and like the park

[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.900]
Why are they gonna go there when they're not going to the place we got now?

[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:49.380]
So I just I just feel like you don't you don't keep fans of this area

[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.860]
No, no, I just I ask you a question

[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.800]
Why would they be going there at the riverfront?

[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.600]
Why would they go to Miami if they won't go to the county line?

[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:02.200]
Well, I'd have to say that if you can get into a downtown area where you can get people to get out of the office building

[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.620]
Smith Day how many people how many people are gonna leave the office?

[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:11.440]
This isn't Chicago where they have businessmen's ball games. This is Miami. How many people work downtown?

[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.980]
Well, take a look at the sky over there. There's plenty of businesses over there where you've got people

[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:20.200]
Sure, how much time do you spend in downtown Miami?

[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.440]
I spend virtually no time in downtown

[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:26.740]
Okay, good then call me back when you can talk about something you know something about you know

[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:30.380]
It's nothing about St. Louis. You know, it's nothing about Detroit. You know, it's nothing about downtown Miami

[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.520]
But I'm being unfair to our great fans down here

[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:37.680]
Sir, I hate to break the news to you. I've been to Marlon games one of the first two three years

[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:42.600]
We had the team I went to a lot of games. Okay, and I said they were listening to the inane comments of the idiots that were sitting around me

[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:49.220]
I've been to top and probably the more panther games in last since we had the franchise the 99% of you put together, okay?

[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:56.180]
And up until this last season I've been to every panther home game when I was in town every single one up until this last year

[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:03.420]
And why did I stop going because I just lost my interest even though they built it like I could walk really from my house to where the arena isn't be a long walk

[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:05.500]
But I could do it I

[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.820]
Could walk there and back I get free tickets the only thing I pay for is my parking

[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.260]
And I still have no interest in going most of the time

[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.460]
It's lame. It's crap

[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:24.200]
You can't package garbage and try to sell it at stake people aren't gonna keep buying it and you can't keep cranking the price up and up and up and up and

[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:30.700]
And when whining and begging and pleading. Oh, you got to build me a new facility because this one isn't good enough because I can't pay anymore millions

[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.620]
It's it's insanity. It's craziness

[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:39.960]
And especially in a place that's got an excuse for everything why they won't do this why they won't do that

[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.780]
Orders of cloud in this guy. That's a good excuse to nobody going today

[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.880]
This past Sunday was the the most beautiful example I've ever seen

[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:58.320]
So the beach and for a lottery. I'll just jend with people. I mean hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people at a time for the air show

[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:04.600]
And if you if you're into the air show fine. I'm not but if that's your thing fine. It's not a sport

[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.280]
I mean if you want to seem drop in watermelons in the ocean. That's great

[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.520]
Uh, rumor is they won't be doing that again next year they heard my thread about the dark post kitchen out of that

[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:20.120]
Yeah, nothing but charts are there next year if they find out there's watermelons in the ocean all of that can't swim but anyway

[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:21.920]
Watermelons can't

[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.120]
Watermelons can but dark folks can't

[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.400]
Now if the watermelons could float

[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.820]
They could ride them all the way in the part of that BTA program like I said back to Africa right on that watermelon

[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.560]
Just keep the seeds in there to keep it afloat. That's good could lessen for you

[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.760]
But this guy wants to give me a he doesn't know anything about any of these other areas

[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.700]
But he's gonna give me a lesson in a lecture and then he uses Pittsburgh as an example

[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.420]
Piss poor piece of crap sports town

[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.280]
They just built that place on their stadium for the pirates. Are they gonna be following that at all?

[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.460]
Because they they they got a crap team and he won a head good teams

[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.800]
They couldn't fill up probes feel when I had good teams. They couldn't fill up three rivers. They had no attendance

[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:05.580]
The only thing that they go there in Pittsburgh is because the football team. It's a one. It'll just like here

[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:12.000]
It's an industrial town. It's not like a big mega-lop of this there. Pittsburgh and never will be

[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.940]
The working class town. It's a blue collar town

[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.040]
It's not a city where they ought to have a hockey team. They have an NBA team. No, it's not for good reason

[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:25.660]
But you know and just keep watering it down and watering it down

[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:31.220]
Let's have more and more franchises more and more millions and millions and millions use suckers keep paying more and more your tax money

[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.380]
Keep paying more for your tickets and the public is saying. Oh, I don't think so

[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:41.540]
But I'm the bad guy because I'm telling you the truth and some of you sports nerds out there just can't you can't accept it just the way it is

[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.960]
Mobile in four-letter deal hello

[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.260]

[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:08.560]
Going twice. Okay many many open lines five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon

[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.720]
Marbles line they want to talk about in the federal Brazil about the article I read about Robert Steinberg about the marlins about the stadium

[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.620]
They're gonna put through I hook her by crook about the election in July. Oh, but any of these things now

[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.980]
Now they don't want to do it

[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.320]
Here's a mobile and deer field hello, you know you can't even fill up your phone lines

[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.640]
I will get a fill up a damn stadium right as I said that many times. That's right

[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.620]
That doesn't cost them a dime to call and I still can't get to have it as a calls

[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:36.500]
You know the big deal with this town you live that everybody's from somewhere else

[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:42.940]
Everybody's home team is way up north somewhere and they don't give a crap about this town unless it's something to see for free

[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.980]
Like the air show. Yeah, man

[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:48.640]
That's right. The air show the air show was free. I never thought about that good point. Yeah exactly

[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.520]
We yeah

[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.120]
But you know the only actually the only game you'd be like hey for this probably hang up on me

[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:59.380]
But the only games I've ever really wanted to see was you have been back when I was my younger days

[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.460]
Yeah, that was that was about the only thing that was local

[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:07.400]
So why am I gonna hang up on you for saying that? Well, I know you hate it you and with a passion, but you know

[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.440]
I'm broadcast you and baseball for six years

[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:16.080]
Ah, yeah, well, this is before and you know something we had more people coming out for a little of those when they played FSU or Florida

[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.440]
We had more people coming to those games and the marlins good for many of the games now. I do like that

[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.380]
Exactly that mark light field they fill it up over flowing now

[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:26.140]
Yeah, they can fill up the stadium is the same proportion but not these people

[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:32.160]
You know, then it's a tourist app. It'll always be a tourist app. Yeah, I mean look at I used to live at Tampa that Tampa

[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.540]
We used to fill up the stadium there, you know for any oh yeah, they're doing a real good job for baseball not

[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.000]
Uh-huh. Well, I mean I'm talking about the old

[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:48.200]
Sir, let me let me say it again. They are they are drawing flies for baseball in Tampa that franchise that won't be gone before this one

[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.920]
Maybe the NBC need to do something like the XFL with uh, basically. Yeah. Okay. Great

[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:58.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 probably as a matter of fact they probably get the same number of people to watch that as they're getting in the ball parks right now

[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.480]
I'm here in Florida

[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:04.800]
Send number of people to watch the XFL on TV and the same FBI 9-Sign 9 people

[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:11.040]
See I don't know what it is. It's it's like trying to convince people to light like this sun is out there

[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.360]
You know it walk outside. It's blue sky to sun is shining. Oh, that's the sun up there. Oh, no, it's not

[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.660]
No, it's not you're where do you see that? What are you talking about?

[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:25.240]
You have to be deaf dumb blind a total ass fool not to understand that this just ain't gonna fly here

[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.700]
And I have one part of me that hopes that they actually because I don't live in Dave County

[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:34.180]
It's not gonna cost me a dime. I am one part of me that hopes they could do go ahead and put it over on you again

[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.980]
So that people like Hank and some of the other people who keep riding the fence and keep waxing all romantic about oh

[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.140]
I love baseball big stinking deal. It's just they're gonna fly here

[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.860]
I love hockey too. And like I said if they closed down the team tomorrow isn't gonna change my life

[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:55.040]
I'm second-tiered a wasting night after night and watching the same tired old people in their belly

[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.520]
It could about gee who don't even know what the other talking about we got about 50 fans in that place

[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:05.420]
We even understand the game and the rest of them are running their cell phones and they're out there milling around in a hallway with their social club

[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.240]
And you listen to the people behind you talking crap talking about stories about their

[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.540]
fantasies and Vietnam and all just nonsense

[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.640]
And then the stuff that they are talking about that might even relate to the game

[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.860]
They haven't got a China men's chance to have an idea what they're talking about

[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.480]
Hit him again, Pete

[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:24.880]

[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.460]
And there there's a there's a good test for it too anybody

[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.580]
It's ever been to a sporting event in other cities as opposed to being the one here. Ah

[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.020]
Think about that test

[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.640]

[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.260]

So guess what Ralphie becomes a captain

[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.380]
Tony bumps into a hot Mercedes Benz dealer a talk to her mouth

He's office and suddenly has an urge to buy that numerous 80s group and have sex with the salesperson

Here's Miami. Hello

[01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:32.050]
Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing great? I'm a Schwarzer who thinks Nate Brazil should be fried. Yeah, okay?

[01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:37.330]
Okay, but I want to clear up a couple of things about your stereotyping of black people stereotyping black people

[01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:41.070]
First of all, we do not all look for handouts

[01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:44.810]
We do not all speak ebonic. Yeah, when did I say you do?

[01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.770]
Well

[01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:52.710]
No, I'm not going to hear you out of because you're yeah, I'm not going to let you mistake things that I've never said

[01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:57.590]
I've never said that you all do any okay, but we don't all share the same values and my mind. I say that you do

[01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:01.950]
Well, it's you know, it seems like you do if I want to say a type of you

[01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:07.370]
I could say you know you are you a member of man-blook because you're gay you're an old gay guy not this week now

[01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:10.470]
Did I did I ask you if you were a member of a crime?

[01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:14.770]
When you say spot that you know, it doesn't mean black

[01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:18.870]
Yeah, so you know, I'm assuming you you think about all black people

[01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:24.510]
I mean you crop us up into one group as if we're just more well when I speak about all black people by saying what

[01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:27.450]
Well, you like just like you said about the air see

[01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:29.630]
You know, if I water melon. Yeah, stuff like that

[01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:32.310]
What's another? You find that offensive you don't you'll find any humor?

[01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:38.070]
No, I do find watermelons and fried chicken and chill and and I guarantee that there plenty of black folks are over there

[01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:41.750]
At the ocean right now digging a watermelon's up. You know, you're right. You're right. So what's wrong with that?

[01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:45.410]
What's wrong with a few watermelons that but I mean you make it seem like

[01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:49.350]
So I'm gonna be right you say and then black people don't eat watermelon sure we do

[01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.390]
So then how am I wrong?

[01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:56.610]
I cannot speak for all black people and you know you I never met a black person my life who didn't like watermelon

[01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:02.190]
Well, I love you so Neil, but you know a couple of things you say it's love this

[01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:07.810]
And fried chicken do you eat fried chicken churches or bow jangles? I love right churches or bow jangles?

[01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:10.910]
Huh and not Kentucky fried right?

[01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:14.230]
Actually, I do like Kentucky fried. Oh, but you're not black

[01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:18.110]

Do you think that most Americans take responsibility for their own actions?

[01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:30.130]
No 23 and yes, too two people say yeah

[01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:33.310]
Of course, there's no point of having a full question if everybody's gonna answer the same

[01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:38.990]
But we got two people out there say oh yeah most Americans take responsibility for their own action. Yeah, I agree with that

[01:21:55.570 --> 01:21:58.550]
I don't want to read man be pambi. There's nothing wrong with being controversial

[01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:01.390]
But writing this swillety wrote today. This is a garbage

[01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:04.110]
But even when the issue is

[01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.730]
clearly

[01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:07.450]
I hate to say anti black but I will

[01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:10.570]
He still finds on his own behalf

[01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:14.990]
The issue is black. This is a black and white issue here

[01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:20.870]
He always seems to make it that way him and pitch. Yeah, let us another one right

[01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:23.270]
And have a great day

[01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:29.030]
See he doesn't understand it. There's nothing wrong with having somebody writing about something of substance as opposed to a puff column

[01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:33.750]
Which I don't want to be pup columns but at least write something that makes sense see the guys got it like part right

[01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:36.630]
He just didn't the express himself well. No, there's that word again. No

[01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:39.650]
He's all over the place all over the road

[01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:41.630]
Kind of like the music on the coast

[01:22:42.650 --> 01:22:50.370]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line 72 votes not a very good pull question

[01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:52.650]
I apologize, but Eric is busy eating all day today

[01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:55.730]
Although he had to take one day out of his very busy schedule

[01:22:55.730 --> 01:22:59.030]
He had to take a weekday and in order to maintain that gigantic girth of his

[01:22:59.030 --> 01:23:03.010]
He had to go on an eating seminar from a breakfast till late-night snack

[01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:09.050]
And so he we need he took about five minutes out to like flip this thing up on that's it five minutes out to flip it

[01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:14.410]
And then of course, I'll be spending much time eliminating because when you eat non-stop wow

[01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:19.390]
72 votes. Do you think that most Americans take responsibility for their own actions?

[01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:21.930]
77 votes now yes 65

[01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:28.070]
No, what is it? I mean no 65 thank God and yes 12 I want to give you a kiss wow

[01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:36.170]
12 people say yes, they take responsibility for their own actions or maybe what they mean is 12 people in America take responsibility for their actions

[01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:39.050]
That's it. We haven't found those 12 yet, but we're looking for them

[01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:44.010]

The fax me that there's a rumor Stephen King is buying a nine million dollar mansion somewhere by serisota

[01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.790]
Well, why does anybody care do I care about Stephen King where he lives?

Neil yes, sir. I've been sitting here listening to this for a couple of days about the stadium and then hit me like a ton of bricks

[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:26.300]
Really?

[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:31.740]
I think it's a bush ballet between jab and George W and John Henry

[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:32.680]
They're gonna

[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.160]
piss off the people down here. They're gonna say there's not gonna be a stadium

[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:43.420]
John Henry's gonna move the team to watching to the baseball's fair. Heard more from tech George. They're not moving. They're not moving

[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:47.300]
They're not moving to Washington the Orioles won't permit it. We're talking to happen. Oh, I don't know

[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:49.800]
Let me let me say it again, sir

It's not going to happen read my lips. It is not going to happen. Is it gonna happen? No, no

[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:01.720]
5605 I mean talk about convoluted logic somehow now we've got the bush boys and I have no love for either one of

[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:05.420]
As you know, but now the bush boys are responsible that nobody goes to baseball games down here

[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:10.080]
And John Henry made it bad deal with Wayne. I mean you talk about really stretching it

[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:13.540]
Man that thing's gonna break pretty soon pal if you don't stop stretching it

[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:14.160]
God

[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:21.340]
Talk about lack of logic lack of common sense, but he's been thinking about it long and hard and uh, yeah

The good news is somebody sent me my own remote controlled fart machine the bad news is it doesn't have any batteries on it

[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:13.180]
We got a remote controlled fart machine what size batteries? I don't know because it's got a screw a screw down thing

[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:15.340]
Would like a little tiny Phillips head

You got a tiny little Phillips head

[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:22.820]

Then we spent a lot of time on him yesterday trying desperately to get this poor bastard to drive the Miami fanatic

[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:49.700]
Wait for this to these pictures

[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.720]

You know him when I used to do those remotes with Rick Weaver out at the stadium. He would go weaver

[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.800]

[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.660]
He used to do it. You did remotes with Rick Weaver

[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.880]
Remember when Gary Bruce was trying to get me to quit by

Where's he now he is in on a clear street right now

[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.780]
But anyway, he says to say how to do it and there's another page

[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:08.360]
It says if I can ever be of any help by showing up on one of your charity fundraisers

[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.640]
I'd be glad to do so. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, thank you

People are already peeing in their pants that they're not gonna make it back to the first floor and that thing

[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.160]
And they're usually probably right

Oh, this is great. You mean we've got one in the cabinet. We haven't made great use of this

49 well, then you should know because without a detroit the deal was they always used to say that motown was for a black music for white people and that black folks

[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:30.320]
Listened like James Brown and all kinds of other stuff

[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.260]
No, well, I don't know about them, but in Cleveland

[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:36.660]
Did you spend any time in Cleveland as little as possible?

[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:42.080]
Okay, I did want to go to Northfield down in Cleveland. We lost the rancid that was it and I also went to a Browns

[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.800]
The Giants football game in 1960 that was the end of it

[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:50.260]
Well motown used to come to Cleveland a lot after different motown review and stuff. No wonder they wanted a business here

[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.500]
But motown was I sound

[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.160]
It was the sound because door on the

[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.340]
Thing's day and still know the words just being soft

[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.200]
You know and I agree with you all right

[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:05.300]
I feel a lot better knowing that dark folks like motown. It's a lot there that hip-hop crap. I'll tell you that right

[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:11.940]
And definitely child those songs won't last past the year. You won't even know the words. Thank God and and as far as chicken go

[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:19.560]
Which place we like to eat at yeah, it doesn't matter. We just love chicken. We love boiled fried and we even love jerk chicken jerk chicken

[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.640]
Yeah, that's right. So you know, it's no choice of where we go to eat chicken. How about jerk pork?

[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.280]
You could probably get some in this neighborhood. Yeah, we weren't loads of Jamaica

[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.520]
It wouldn't probably get some good jerk chicken for you. Yeah

[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.920]
You know, you put like you put lime juice on it

[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.460]
Well lime juice on jerk chicken. No, it's a seasoning that you buy it's a Jamaican seasoning

[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:41.340]
It would career being seasoned in rubber and you rub it all over the chicken and

[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:49.000]
Picking in the oven and it tastes good, but if you don't know what about watermelon? What about watermelon? Don't you love it on the top of the list?

[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:52.140]
There you go black people should never say that a watermelon

[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:54.740]
Remember that time they ran the ad and and

[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.440]
In the front of the page or something advertisement. They had a black person eating a watermelon

[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:05.500]
I wouldn't have fined by that because I know watermelon when it sees I look for the season every year to begin talking about me a night

[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.540]
Big watermelon. It tastes good

[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:13.260]
And it also comes in handy for a jerk in pork too have a rate they pal five and you have a jerk pork with the watermelon

[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.620]
560 7.05 560.560

[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.660]
on the AT&T

[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:21.660]
And Verizon wireless line this thing is just

[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.460]
astonishing. Oh, yeah

[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:28.380]
Just when you think they're done sometimes it's like a second thing they get a second win

[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:31.660]
Stereo boy too ever

[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.840]
I'm feeling this season

[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.240]
About 14 at 560 wqa.m

[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.340]
Here's a facts and look at this

[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:49.860]
They're all stealing now and you'll never guess what the cast are nobody yesterday morning Monday

[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.900]
We did the farts because we got this great CD

[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:56.560]
But pull my finger so anyway yesterday morning cast are no one doing a fart show

[01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:00.860]
And Dan LaBasterd writes it says I have a feeling he listens to your show

[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.500]
Uh

[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:06.040]
20 questions with Marlon's capture Charles Johnson C.J

[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:13.020]
One from this is from Dan LaBasterd. Oh, you have to have a funny story over the years about someone breaking wind in the batter's box

[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.380]
How do you like that? How Dan LaBasterd is farting in a hero

[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:21.040]
Seeing Neil farts once and all of a sudden they're farting all over town

[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.580]
Just like that

[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:29.860]
525 votes on a pool. Do you think that most Americans take responsibility for their own actions 19 years?

[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:31.120]
No, 106

[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.580]
165 percent say no, and that's the correct answer of course

[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.120]
Here's another fact that says I know you're always wondering if some people are still alive or some have died

[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.380]
This website might help thank you Jonathan and the Gables

[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.740]
Www. Who's alive and who's dead calm?

[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.420]
That's cute

[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:52.180]
What I must cover a lot of territory

[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.720]
Www. Who's alive and who's dead calm?

[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.440]
I

[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.100]
Wonder if our friend is on there

[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.040]
Sonny La Colonna

[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.520]
He's alive

[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:06.740]
They hit him with five pizza pies. They still alive

[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:14.820]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir

[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:23.480]
I'm a big baseball fan and a Marlon's fan and uh, I go to a game very occasionally as the season goes on and it gets hot

[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.320]
And the range become more unpredictable. It'll be less and less

[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:28.360]
But what I don't understand of

[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:32.200]
Doesn't seem to come out. You hear this guy Henry

[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:38.160]
expects me to drive like an hour an hour and a half because I've got to go through the rush hour to get there

[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.660]
And all these complaints and everything some legitimate that these people have

[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:47.880]
Why should I leave my house when I can watch it for here for basically for free and not only that

[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.620]
But I get to see plenty of other baseball games. I mean, you know

[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:56.060]
They're giving it to me for basically free and any fan, you know come come to the hassle

[01:38:56.060 --> 01:39:02.480]
Spend all your money and come here. I don't see your your your your missing the point. He doesn't care where they build it

[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:06.140]
I mean he would have preferred by Centennial Park because he might have actually been successful there

[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.980]
But in his mind anyway

[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:14.500]
But uh, he doesn't care as long as somebody will build it for him. So I understand that but I'm a baseball fan

[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:18.400]
And I don't even support it because of the fact that most of the time during the week

[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.280]
I'm not gonna go period right

[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.740]
I'm gonna watch it here

[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:28.400]
And you know, nobody seems to bring out the fact that you know, maybe a lot of people follow the marlins and watch the games

[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.040]
But they're not gonna go out to the ballpark no matter where he but a lot of people don't watch the marlins and follow the games

[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.360]
Their TV ratings are abysmal. They're minuscule

[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.500]
How many people do you probably would know how many people watch the marlins game on TV?

[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:42.340]
Yeah

[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:45.440]
I have no idea what

[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.360]
More than or in the stadium like that probably yeah, so that you know

[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.420]
It all these games are going corporate. It's like roll that movie rollerball

[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:57.180]
You know, it's it's not about you stay or anything unless it's corporate people

[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.620]
It's about you know TV and pretty soon he'll get smart

[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:03.180]
No start either blacking out games or start sure

[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:06.720]
I'm not gonna make it's I if they blacked out every game is gonna make a bit of difference

[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.400]
You probably right people still wouldn't go out they just start paying more to watch it on satellite if they wanted it and

[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:15.740]
You're you're missing the point most people don't care

[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:20.000]
Don't you get it the number of people are watching you put a phone booth in every room for the Chinese army

[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.220]
Most people don't carry you just can't get that through your mind. That's true. That's the other thing

[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:28.180]
This is not a major league baseball town. It's not a major league anything town

[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:33.620]
It's not I don't know what you're laughing about. It's not the dolphins do that dolphins do well

[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:38.660]
The dolphins is like it's been here for 35 years. Okay. That's the one thing. They go there to tailgate and to get drunk

[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:42.260]
You know, it's a redneck thing. That's why it does well here plus it's only one

[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:47.620]
Right, that's right and it's on and it's only eight times a year. Yeah, so John Henry, you know do it every one

[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:52.740]
It makes a difference to me with no matter what you do. I'm gonna watch baseball either way so it's no skin off my ass

[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:58.020]
Okay, thanks. Thank you. Well, that was good time. You went up beautiful. Wow. Thanks for the good talk up

[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:02.060]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T

[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.340]
And Verizon wireless line

[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:08.600]
Here's for a lot of Dale hello

[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:10.520]
Hello, yes, sir

[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:14.740]
Well, this is a voice in the past. This is a Edward Ali

[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.540]
I was on your show one time with Mabla Muriel hair. Wow

[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:22.440]
It's going back huh? Uh-huh something new

[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.500]
How's she doing by the way? She's still dead. She's still dead. Oh, okay. That's what I'm hearing. There's a door now

[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:28.440]
Um

[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:34.920]
This is I say this is new. Oh, and you know, you know, you also knew about 12 years ago. Uh-huh

[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.800]
And that is uh

[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:42.980]
It's just nobody will touch it great story but nobody will touch it. Yeah, and that is the

[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:48.060]
Uh discovery of the factual nature of existence the factual nature of existence

[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:51.120]
My what does that mean?

[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:58.360]
The scientific discovery of the factual nature of existence the factual nature of existence. Yes, yes indeed

[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.300]
Uh-huh, but the problem is

[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.260]
It messes up everything else, but what is the uh scientific story of the factual uh

[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.320]
Whatever you said, okay

[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.280]
uh quantum physics

[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.560]
bumped into a brick wall

[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:13.980]
before

[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:19.080]
Back in about 1890 uh-huh and uh, so

[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.460]
Come along 50 years later

[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.640]
This engineer from general electric

[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:29.600]
Recognized that he had to have a that there was needed a an uninvasive

[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.360]
Means of approaching fundamental physics

[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.760]
Physics, the level of the cultural and racial structure

[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.480]
So he approached it on the basis of motion

[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:44.520]
So we have a new system and uh it works

[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.740]
It's pushing the notion in the back the pushing the notion in the basket. Yeah

[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:50.940]
and uh

[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:54.820]
Sure, listen, what are you talking about?

[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:59.840]
And well, I wanted you to condense this to something that the average more I can understand like us. What are you talking about?

[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:04.580]
Now nature doesn't care about the average more on it doesn't care about much of anything. Yeah, well

[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:07.300]
But that's what we're talking to you like me. It's more like me

[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:11.920]
So you're gonna have a conversation and it's gonna be meaningful you have to explain it in terms that we can understand

[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:18.160]
Okay, otherwise it just comes across as double talk. Which is what it sounds like to me. All right, the new system shows the new system

[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:24.200]
Yep, that's what this is. Okay, new physics system shows that existence is a continuum

[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:27.100]
based on motion. Yeah

[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.540]
And uh, so it goes on and on there's no beginning

[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:37.220]
There's no creation. Yeah, there's no end point. I love that's nothing new. That's just a concept of infinity. There's nothing new

[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:41.740]
But for this is the first time that there's scientific proof of it. Yeah, this is the thing

[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:46.500]
Yeah, this is something that can't be recruited. Mm-hmm. So

[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:52.760]
Melta media will touch it. No, of course not. It's not good for business. So don't make any waves. Okay. Okay

[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:55.200]
You had a maverick and John by the way

[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.500]
Pardon I say have a rate day five six seven oh five sixty

[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:05.420]
pound five sixty on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. It's undulating. It's it's moving in its rolling and it's uh,

[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:10.600]
ongoing and it's infinite and it's gigantic and vivid massive as required, he would say

[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.940]
Let me make a sense to you what he was just uh, how can I try to come on what

[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:16.900]
five six seven oh five

[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:18.700]
sixty pound five six

[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:22.300]
Six the on and he was on my show years ago. What does that tell you? Yeah

[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.920]
That's the kind of shows I used to and I'm still apologizing for not to the audience to myself

[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:28.380]
I

[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:33.800]
still have some uh, gray matter left up there for those shows. How about holy Joe come on holy Joe holy Joe

[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:39.480]
All those other getch keys I used to put on the air was fun and it's day, you know, it had it they had their moments

[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:44.480]
All the rabbis the rabbi would the jury which there's gun this had all of these things

[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.060]
Speaking of jury which and how's he doing? He died

[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:56.520]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing today? Okay, listen your four questions is very suitable for today's

[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.560]
Topic I think it's gonna be all of the news later on today about this kid on trial

[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.660]
But nobody thinks I want to talk about the kid on trial

[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:08.740]
I read that whole article by Robert Steinbeck that anxious a commentary that he wrote and I had a little bit of the audio from this testimony on here

[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:15.300]
And nobody wants to talk about it. I see that and it's reason is I guess the kids is already proven as point

[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:16.600]
He's he is guilty

[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:20.560]
Also this point is that I was going time while looking to you

[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:24.200]
Before you came on this morning. Yeah, and they did use the

[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:26.740]
Right I heard that on

[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:32.060]
The internet right but if you missed some pieces of it the kid didn't know what he was doing

[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.560]
He did say I pulled the trigger

[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.820]
Right and then when they asked him to show how to demonstrate how to go off accidentally he couldn't do it

[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:44.080]
Exactly, they gave me every chance of that they give me every chance in the world

[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.260]
They put the gun in his hand and how does this thing go off accidentally and he couldn't do it

[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:51.240]

[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:14.900]
I was just would you like it? Oh, what is this all about? Also, I'm not against the new state and provided it's out of John Henry

What that's part of their signature is you know

[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:35.660]
After they do the crime they leave the pits and Lee now come on that's bad

[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:42.340]

uh... how do you regard uh... mike lang is a hot yeah that's it used to be great

[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:44.660]

with fox you know i you talked about last night's game

[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:51.400]
well i know i've heard him on a number of occasions and i mean it puts a lot of

[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:55.320]
still in the center is the body of an in the city stick but mike used to be uh...

[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:58.880]
one of my very favorites but lately he's uh... really split the few notches and last

[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.900]
night at that was watching i didn't think it was blacked out on a big day on the

[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:02.360]
small dish

[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:05.820]
and last night i guess i went into overtime and i have it on a timer

[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:10.620]
uh... the overtime was on and uh... i'm pretty dismayed with his performance last

[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:13.460]
two things he still uh... entertaining but not what he used to be

[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:16.500]

well you're like old wine and he's not okay thanks

[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.460]

of the earth show number one was outdoors number two or no i take that back

[01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:58.600]

go to the beach it was a nice sunny day and you go see a bunch of crap and they put on the show

[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:07.980]
for him even if you're interested it was free even jokas that was over there why

[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:10.980]
because he lives over there he said if i said if you lived out by me would you go

Peter Jennings on Monday night uh-huh about genocide in the Congo

[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:32.240]
in the condos yeah Congo we're we're two militiamen

[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:37.020]
we're swinging a human jump rope at the edge of a bridge about a hundred foot high

[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:41.360]
yeah and swung him over the bridge when he landed in the shallow water

[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:45.940]
he was still alive and the militiamen started shooting at him with uh...

[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.580]
what appeared to be m16 rifle sounds like what we didn't Vietnam dollars civilians

[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:54.260]
i was incredible uh-huh i thought it was a horrible experience

[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:59.600]
being used as a human jump rope being tossed over you know a bridge yeah

[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:03.900]
this this you know something this probably would come handy then too oh jeez

[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:08.880]
just went over the bridge well hey listen you can't blame him can you i probably

[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:14.660]

[01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:47.840]
isn't it my any heavy low rider truck to join the other whoolio I have pages in the back

[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:51.780]
where I carry my cock you can hear a guy like you do

[01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:01.740]
and if my kill one or kill them all depends on it I win or lose

[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:14.000]
when your sublipin and latches then barbaric is the way to be

[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:20.540]
well there's for him well and low and whoolio

[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.600]
whose cock's love pretty good

[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:30.620]
here's the arena you can see the pectorino rules growing stiff as a block of walls

[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:38.080]
we use cock fighting as an elephant to cover what we do inside

[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:41.840]
oh

[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:47.260]
behind the curtain all the macho guys are giving a wink to his bannock brown eyes

[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:59.520]
when your sublipin are rich and latches then barbaric is the way he to be

[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:01.560]
well

[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:02.420]
what

[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:07.720]
great

[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:14.180]
when your sublipin are rich and latches then barbaric is the way to be

[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:18.000]
I know exactly where they had to wait because I've driven on the palm metal to drive right

[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.160]
by there and you know I haven't ever seen the billboard it's one of the factions put all of

[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:24.900]
us as you can't beat our swords I've seen that

[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:29.360]
it's 13 to 1 at 5 60 QM here's a

[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:34.160]
a fact that says you think there's any correlation between bush and chainy taking office

[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:38.680]
and the price of gas possibly reaching two to a three dollars a gallon yeah of course

[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:44.100]
is there any correlation my god if I ask and this is there a correlation between the fact

[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:47.680]
you're getting the soaked in its pouring rain outside you know standing there with your thing on

[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:51.880]
secondly there's nothing that picks me off more than these ignorant jocs pointing

[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:57.120]
to the sky upon catching a football during a basketball or a or ducking a basketball even taking

[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:02.200]
the crap yeah pointing to the sky absolutely correct but I commend the hockey players or two

[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:05.460]
professionals and the difference between the sporting event a place of worship correct

[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.440]
and as far as mining being a sports town question mark with you right to see being a ball

[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:14.940]
being hit or a beach full of bikinis there you go that's what it's fun it's fun and fun do they

[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:21.580]
have majorly sports in Hawaii no that majorly sports in Vegas no no see this is a

[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:27.620]
myth this is a myth not that this would be majorly done any other respect anyway but just assuming

[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:32.800]
it might be yeah politics are corrupt to transportation sucks but just assuming that in all of

[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:37.420]
the respects we were major league which we're not well why do you have to have professional sports

[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:41.280]
what the dolphins were plenty for all of those other years why do we have to have more than that

[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:48.060]
but what's the point doesn't make the more people come here because we have that no no wait tourists

[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:53.560]
go no coming to see ball games and i'm not talking about snowbirds who are here anyway there are

[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:58.220]
captive audience whatever is here that's what they'll do i'm talking about tourists tourists come

[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:03.620]
here for the sun and for uh to get skin cancer stuff like that see naked bodies on the beach now

[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:09.880]
we're talking yeah very good point excellent facts 170 seven votes on our marginal pool of

[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.460]
points today which I get apologized for but we had to keep that simple because Eric is in the

[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:18.660]
eating friends you today and they ran out of food in Orlando huh oh sir if they interfere that

[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:22.480]
that's why he you know he made up that story about coming down here for the seminar i don't believe

[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:27.800]
that for a second they ran out of food is steak and shake crystal yeah all of those places

[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:33.580]
and that's why he had to come down here right in the middle of the week so Eric is out there

[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:37.040]
in the middle of a feeding friends he's probably passed out surrounded by chicken bone somewhere in

[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:41.000]
his car so you have to excuse him so we had to make a very simple poke wasn't that it so we could

[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:47.980]
get it up do you think most Americans take responsibility for their own actions yes 32 no 145

[02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:54.320]
that's the correct answer no otherwise thinking of food yeah how come nobody's called about where

[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.460]
the closest sonic is to us yeah George made a good point about sonic and I think we've had calls

[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:04.600]
about them before I think when we're talking about chocolate malts yeah it was great which I'm not

[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:09.280]
having no chocolate malt because although the last couple days are finally see I don't want to get

[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:12.680]
nothing about the weight again but we just start taking diuretics you only fooling yourself because

[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:19.140]
you're peeing out because no matter what you say water is 75% of your body of your weight

[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:24.420]
so you can fool yourself by like you know peeing up a store by taking diuretics with your very bad

[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:29.920]
for your kidneys I should point out and then you get on the scale hey look at that and of course

[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:33.860]
you don't have as much time to eat anyway because you're busy peeing all day I like yes in

[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:37.660]
Erick's case he could probably you know you could have a sandwich in one hand and

[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:43.500]
the other if you could find it the sandwich that is Eric here's my

[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:49.280]
in the hood I'm getting real good on that you know about a half a half a beat here's a mobile in

[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:55.920]
western hello hello deal yes sir hey how you doing today pretty good great hey about on those same

[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.640]
lines as that Robert Steinbeck I saw an article on slunday about him about those

[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:05.500]
concerts that shot the young black man up on the roof right there's no witnesses or anything

[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:10.160]
at the end of his article he got up there and he said well and now for all you young black people

[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.960]
you know what a police officer says stop stop you know put your arms in the position that they

[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:19.160]
ask you to and everything yeah that's all good and welfare is advice but the thing I always

[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:24.080]
thought was these people don't read the paper well maybe you're not a maybe you're not a

[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:28.940]
reading tone but they don't read how do you know that they don't know black people read the paper

[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:34.200]
how I grew up around the overcommon area yeah they don't know white man who grew up in a bad part

[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:38.280]
of time uh-huh and most of the people never picked up a paper what are you better go go back and

[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.320]
start reading it to them okay I'll use parts is out there when it cops us freeze put your hands

[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:47.320]
up in here freeze and put your hands up in here excellent points sir very good and by the way

[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:53.100]
five six seven oh five sixty pump five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:58.480]
I got news for a sir most of the white people don't read either you'd be appalled to find out

[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:03.980]
when's the last time most of you write a book huh and I'll come in here and read newspaper articles

[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:07.100]
and the only reason I do it is because I know that ninety nine and nine tenths percent of the audience

[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:14.580]
never read it anyway like your Robert Steinback piece this morning oh and I did see the white you

[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:19.340]
were gone I saw the thing on MSNBC the way answer will cause the search for Satan did you see

[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:23.760]
ever see that it's pretty good no because it really rips the hell out of organized religion and talks

[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:28.780]
about you know some interesting stuff like the magi and the fact that they were in all this

[02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:32.980]
hocus focus and demons and stuff and there were the ones who went to visit the baby Jesus in

[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:37.760]
Vettelham and the last read priests and the fact that during those days there were it was a very

[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:42.920]
first battle for the for the faith of the populist out there for the dummies and there were hundreds

[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:46.820]
of competing religions so why not make up a good one and then anybody didn't want to buy it

[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:53.300]
well you made him an offer and refuse yeah and they had a lot of stuff in there about the accursades

[02:05:53.300 --> 02:05:57.580]
in the inquisition and all of these things it was pretty interesting I'm sure the church didn't

[02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:03.060]
like it too much of course they had the Catholic priest on there saying oh yes there is a devil

[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:09.900]
and if you deny him and yada yada yada and on Friday if you would have only been here Friday

[02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:19.020]
if ever a place needed an exorcism this place needed on Friday exactly oh wait a minute

[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:31.520]
Christ can tell you the power of Christ can tell you the power of Christ can tell you

[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:42.860]
the power of Christ can tell you the power of Christ can tell you

[02:06:43.900 --> 02:07:07.500]
the power of Christ can tell you the strength that tell you it is not to worry the power of Christ Spler general

[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:10.300]
okay very good everything ought to be clear now

[02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:13.440]
Coses clear air is not too good to the coast is clear

[02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:18.500]
5 6 7 0 5. Oh the coast is clear over there better tell Bob and Sherlock when you stop by and see

[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:22.280]
After you're thinking of the shell station or before it at the coast. I'll stay and see me no audience

[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:26.660]
I'm way home there. They they blown off the audience somebody was telling me that they really sound like crap

[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:32.440]
I think it was Johnny dark 5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:37.380]
Here's a mobile in North Miami Beach. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir

[02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:43.040]
You know, I was listening on the radio. They were playing some of the testimony from the in a vano Brazil trial

[02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:48.560]
Yes, and I don't know why they say that he's testifying because he's not even talking. It's the Lord doing all the talking

[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:55.400]
He just hits there telling the kid. Okay now you had the safety on right and the kid goes yeah, yeah, you didn't mean to kill anybody right?

[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:58.160]
Yeah, and and you know that it's bad you

[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:03.680]
He has a high-top plenty of it this morning. He talked plenty talked enough to show his true colors

[02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:07.780]
Before what they were from what I heard it was like the Lord was putting the words about the kid was just innocent

[02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:12.720]
Yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, well that that's that's the way jury trials work

[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:18.120]
Well, most of the questions they just wanted yesterday answer every ever seen perimation for quite an hour

[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:19.800]
Live just the yesterday no

[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:26.420]
What did you think of his testimony? Did you think he I think I think I think his credibility on a scale of zero is minus 400

[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:29.260]
And they did they're doing the poll on the court TV

[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:33.640]
How many of you believe his testimony was 85% no and 15% yes

[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.640]
And I'm good for him. No, well do you believe him?

[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:39.740]
No, of course everybody knows he meant to do it. Well, there you go

[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:44.880]
It's ridiculous and I'll ask one more time how come we're still out here and more about the dead teacher

[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:48.900]
Who was a family man and dedicated teacher and a young guy how come we're not here and more about him

[02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:52.300]
They keep talking about wasting a life. There's a life that we wasted. He's not coming back

[02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:58.020]
And that's the problem with prosecuting Mr. juvenile if he was found guilty of the juvenile at 18

[02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:03.500]
We have to let him go. Isn't that nice? You know, what what kind of sentence is that he's gonna go to jail for six years

[02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:06.840]
Yeah, then the next time he gets pissed off for somebody steals his tuba or whatever

[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:10.400]
You know he throws another water balloon and then go out and blow somebody else away

[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:14.260]
I say put him away and let's protect the innocent people and in closing

[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:17.420]
Have you noticed how the calls have gotten better since George came back?

[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:21.100]
Okay, okay, they have wow

[02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:24.740]
I really can't tell do I remember calls from one day to the next no

[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:27.300]
Yeah, Georgia tracks the great colors

[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:30.560]
Well, you do it just that we haven't they haven't gotten in yet

[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:36.480]
It's only been 25 years. We're still waiting for the good colors to start coming in. Uh-huh. You just mark my words

[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:40.140]
I'm telling you got to take 20 30,000 calls then you get a couple of good ones

[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:44.160]
He was okay. It was but in fact they have been okay today so far

[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:47.860]
Not as good as Eddie not that good, but they've been okay

[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:55.140]
560 505 60 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless lime. What are we gonna do about Hank?

[02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:58.740]
Well, he really let me down here. I must have been a tough week in Louisville

[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:02.400]
You know anybody has to spend them any days in Louisville probably is a little bit off their feet anyway

[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:08.880]
But he's that sounded to me like he was really waffling and what are we gonna do and how are we gonna build him a bomb?

[02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:11.640]
Wait, then nobody's gonna go it doesn't make it even. It's where you put it

[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:17.320]
What it looks like what they're doing in there unless it's strippers or something nobody's gonna go fat. So it's not gonna happen

[02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:22.300]
He likes baseball. I like hockey and this town and the support either one of them

[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:27.820]
We both support Pompo no Parc though because it's a fun place to go because they're not asking for you to build them a place

[02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:28.660]
That's right
