[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]
Roger, sheltered, talk to Mia.

[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.300]
Flips, six, six, six, six, six, eight, eight,

[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.200]
or a county, or town, flips,

[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.360]
T.S. Rines and Fireless Customers.

[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.560]
87775, Mia is a toll-free,

[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.540]
plane ticket, and expressed by Neil Rogers.

[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.800]
His guests are called.

[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.340]
Does not reflect those in the recently broadcastroom.

[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.360]
If staff, advertisers, or agencies.

[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.160]
Now, the Neil Rogers show on 560 Q.A.A.

[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.820]
Yes, that often does instant.

[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.360]
Welcome to another edition of this side,

[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.660]
Life with Sportings.

[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.680]
Draced and nasal mist is our guest today.

[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.340]
Yo, Dre, yo, would you have to say about your admirers

[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.960]
who are obsessed and worship you in every way

[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.720]
and base their intellect and entire existence

[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.980]
on your ability to catch a ball?

[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.800]
I don't know what I've been told

[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.920]
but the big-legged woman ain't got no soul.

[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.940]
What should take on over an under and under

[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.540]
the over of the underwear?

[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560]
I don't know what I've been told

[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.080]
but a big-legged woman ain't got no soul.

[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.580]
And what should take on those rumors lying around

[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.940]
that you're articulate enough to replace Michael Jordan

[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.500]
on those NCI spots?

[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.680]
And they say you're getting close to signing that contract.

[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.580]
I don't know what I've been told

[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.900]
but a big-legged woman ain't got no soul.

[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.580]
Tell us more about your charitable work

[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.820]
for underprivileged children helping to improve

[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.260]
their mathematics skills

[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.140]
through showing them how to properly wag crack rock.

[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.320]
I don't know what I've been told

[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.600]
but a big-legged woman ain't got no soul.

[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.640]
We'll be back with more insight, lifeless,

[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.260]
foreign holes.

[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.960]
10-0-2-5-60-WQ, I'm welcome to

[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.640]
whatever this is. You're on a Tuesday?

[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.040]
Well, what a day yesterday.

[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.340]
Yesterday was like a dark,

[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.100]
grotesque black Monday.

[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.340]
The stock market, I'm driving at the track last night

[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.460]
and I'm going east on sunrise Boulevard

[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.940]
and I see a little dog, you know,

[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.320]
cute little dog crossing the street,

[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.880]
bouncing across in the middle of traffic.

[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.820]
And so I slam on a break to make sure

[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.640]
that if it gets anywhere near me, I'm not going to hit it.

[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.020]
And the guy in front of me,

[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.860]
I'll have to assume he didn't see it.

[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.260]
I'll just give him the benefit of the dog.

[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.760]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.100]
But he sure as hell felt it.

[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.720]
Did he stop? No.

[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.100]
I mean, he just

[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.320]
smeared this poor little dog,

[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.060]
just to turn it in the instant road kill.

[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.200]
I swirved around it to make sure I didn't go over it again

[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.280]
but I think it was a little bit too late.

[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.880]
And the full moon,

[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.280]
the old cock and moon is out there.

[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.100]
Just one of those things,

[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.460]
then come in this morning and find out

[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.180]
that our program director is a little girl.

[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.540]
Oh my God.

[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.060]
Oh, I always knew that,

[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.200]
but I mean like a little girl.

[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.920]
Come on, brush up a little bit, Duff.

[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.940]
How did Neil find out about the,

[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.540]
better be better?

[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.260]
See, you can't give me in the dark forever,

[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.120]
no matter what it is, it always gets back to me.

[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.720]
Because everybody in this building is a professional yenta.

[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.980]
And it all filters right back to...

[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.600]
Oh God!

[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.280]
That's right.

[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.580]
And it's not that much of a big deal

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.920]
about the fact that Channel 10 is programming our radio station.

[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.680]
That's okay.

[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.940]
Maybe we should ask them what's the run for the summer.

[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.680]
Yeah, or maybe we should ask them to sell some spots.

[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.080]
Because obviously our sales deprommonate doing it.

[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.400]
Wouldn't you think that we'd have more important things to be worried about

[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.660]
and people like Brian and sales

[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.380]
that have more important things to be concerned about?

[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.060]
Didn't worry about Channel 10 is upset

[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.760]
because we ran a promo about the one I said,

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.660]
something about Dwight Latter-day Eating Ass.

[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.780]
Or whatever the hell was.

[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.060]
They're big on eating ass on Channel 10.

[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.900]
That's all I can tell you.

[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.140]
They're the only states in the history that I know of.

[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.100]
The only TV states in America that's ever run a piece on their newscast

[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.860]
where they were talking about eating ass.

[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.960]
Am I correct about that?

[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.180]
Yes, I think so.

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.580]
Absolutely correct.

[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.620]
So what's wrong with that?

[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.980]
They should start having billboards.

[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.300]
Okay, get a hell of a lot of attention.

[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.660]
They ought to be commended.

[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.720]
Yeah, and they weren't about the fact that we were running promos

[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.660]
in other day parts.

[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.980]
So talking about Channel 10,

[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.660]
eating ass with Dwight Latter-day,

[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.480]
or whatever the hell it was.

[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.960]
And so our little girl program director pulled the promos off here.

[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.480]
We don't care about that.

[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.180]
I'm not going to make a big issue out of that.

[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.000]
Who cares?

[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.920]
Do we care?

[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.280]
No.

[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.900]
Of course not.

[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.660]
Butch up a little bit in their sweetheart.

[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.720]
Who cares?

[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.320]
How did he find out?

[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.220]
Greg, he found out.

[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.920]
He found out.

[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.300]
Greg, he found out all that.

[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.540]
Like I said, I mean, there's no spots out of the log.

[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.140]
We got a guy named Depression going on.

[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.420]
Our sales manager, that bitch he's running around

[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.720]
telling the salespeople that our show,

[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.260]
we have Noah Veil's here on the show.

[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.040]
Hey, listen, no sweat off our ass.

[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.600]
We could pay.

[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.700]
Those people will enjoy this show.

[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.660]
We got good news for it.

[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.380]
No commercials anymore on this program.

[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.320]
There you go.

[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.040]
That's what you've been hoping for.

[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.580]
Sure.

[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.200]
Who don't want all those pain in the ass interruptions anyway?

[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.820]
God.

[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.520]
So a guy packed me a thing yesterday.

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.200]
And I know I get a lot of this stuff on the faxes

[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.340]
and the thing with the stock market.

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.760]
I know.

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.380]
I know.

[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.820]
Not too many people want to hear about it.

[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.420]
It's very depressing.

[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.640]
But I just mentioned this in passing,

[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.760]
especially since I called my close best personal friend,

[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.540]
Mitchel Shes today.

[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.120]
And I remember that I heard all these listed right now.

[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.140]
Here at some of the show yesterday, I'm glad.

[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.160]
I'm glad he heard me rip in the ass because I do it every day

[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.100]
and he deserves it.

[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.680]
So somebody faxes me this thing and it's from the Wall Street Journal.

[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.180]
Raymond James was the top picker of stocks in the fourth quarter.

[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.940]
And it's got a chart here, a 15 brokerage houses.

[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.920]
And it says brokerage houses stock picking prowess.

[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.440]
And it lists them in order of who did the best over the past the last quarter of last year.

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.320]
This is ending December 31st, 2000.

[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.260]
And over the last one year and five years.

[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.280]
Raymond James is the best.

[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.620]
Guess who is by far?

[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.460]
By far the worst.

[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.260]
Over the last quarter, over the last year and last five years.

[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.780]
First union securities.

[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.780]
That sounds like my good close friend, Mitchel.

[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.100]
Yeah.

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.840]
Last quarter down 33.7%.

[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.020]
One year down 38.3%.

[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.540]
Five year performance, 27.4.

[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.380]
The average, the S&P index in the last five years is up up 132%.

[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.520]
And you look at Raymond James in those five years,

[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.920]
they made 176.3% for their clients.

[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.140]
Mirror Lynch, 134%.

[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.920]
Goldman Sachs, 175%.

[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.780]
Morgan Stanley, Dean with 118% and on and on it goes.

[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.840]
The next worst was a Solomon Smith Barney.

[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.980]
Only 62.1% but first union securities, 0.7.4%.

[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.920]
Over five years.

[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.020]
That's squat.

[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.840]
That's direct.

[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.760]
That's cracky.

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.940]
Is what that is.

[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.520]
So thanks again, Rimmer, for hooking me up with the,

[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.820]
oh my god.

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.300]
Oh, and then I got to tell the rumors through about the psychic.

[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.820]
This will show you just how, see I'm not embarrassed.

[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.000]
I mean, there are a lot of you who are stupid.

[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.780]
I'm stupid too.

[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.900]
That's why they love the show.

[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.580]
Because we can all be stupid together.

[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.720]
That's why it works out.

[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.840]
I'm a moron.

[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.560]
I'm like, come to money.

[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.120]
I know nothing.

[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.560]
I make all bad decisions.

[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.040]
And I take, I get hyped into what,

[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.560]
this first union securities in matured by a guy,

[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.740]
who listens to advice from a psychic.

[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.080]
He and his wife are that, after knowing them all these years,

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.060]
I find out yesterday they get on the phone and they talk to psychics.

[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.660]
And Rimmer's wife, Ferrell says to me,

[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.860]
oh Jeff, who's on the phone?

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.660]
He was on the sofa crying.

[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.420]
He was in tears because the psychic really knew his stuff.

[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.960]
He was talking about his father who's been dead for years.

[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.240]
That nobody could possibly know.

[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.100]
Him, you mean it wasn't Cleo?

[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.880]
And you know something?

[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.820]
And I'm thinking to myself,

[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.340]
I'm sitting on my couch and I'm in tears.

[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.020]
And I didn't even talk to the psychic.

[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.120]
Because now I realize that I've been taking financial advice

[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.780]
from crazy people, my good close personal friends,

[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.660]
who are nice people, but a little bit crazy.

[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.200]
And this psychic told her that the,

[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.200]
the Nasdaq's going to go down to 1700 and then it's going to go

[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.280]
where everything's going to start going back up again,

[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.800]
about that, but he, but he, but he, but he, but he, but he, but yeah.

[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.920]
See, I wish they would have told me about the psychic first

[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.840]
because I think he'd have been a lot better for me than the matured.

[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.940]
Yeah.

[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.860]
First union securities, I'm dealing with a bottom feeder here.

[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.480]
I'm on the bottom of the barrel there.

[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.380]
Their best stock pick of the last year was Qualcomm made 15.4%.

[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.980]
Everybody else's got 40%, 48% stocks that went up 50%.

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.920]
Yada, yada, yada.

[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.600]
And every line across, this is from the Wall Street Journal.

[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.160]
This isn't some propaganda that somebody made up there.

[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.220]
It's trying to pedal me something.

[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.880]
How do you like that?

[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.320]
The absolute positive worst, five year performance, 27.4%.

[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.740]
You could do that in money market funds just about.

[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.300]
Five percent a year times five sounds like 25% to me, right?

[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.300]
In money market, but no risk.

[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.460]
None. No risk, no headaches, no diarrhea, no hemorrhoids,

[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.040]
no crazy phone calls, no, you know like that.

[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.100]
See, it's one thing to be a smooth talker and a good,

[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.580]
the BS in our snake oil salesman, but sort of thing.

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.000]
People are looking for results.

[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.380]
People are looking for answers.

[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.740]
People are looking for guidance.

[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.480]
People are looking to be held by the hand by somebody

[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.760]
who knows what they're talking about.

[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.980]
Not just to be sold snake oil and some Arab chic.

[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.280]
On the story on the Arab chic was with the Xerox thing.

[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.680]
He didn't buy a trillion shares.

[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.480]
He bought one share and made a trillion copies on the Xerox machines.

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.940]
No, I just made that up.

[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.280]
In fact, that would have been good because if he would have made that many copies,

[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.900]
it would have helped that Xerox talk go up so he didn't do it.

[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.260]
Yeah, but the psychic said,

[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.980]
yeah, that's going to be our new song now instead of the Gypsy cried by Lucristi,

[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.860]
the psychic said, I can just give Boca Brian to them already.

[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:11.840]
Yeah.

[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.520]
Yeah, Critio, the psychic said,

[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.880]
I can hear you now.

[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.780]
Can you learn it already?

[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.500]
Bye, I, I.

[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:18.960]
Yeah.

[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.080]
Oh my god.

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.760]
I'm surrounded by crazy people.

[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.480]
And more and more, I feel like you know, like sitting in the corner going,

[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.680]
boom, boom, boom, boom, like that.

[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.760]
Just like that, boom, boom, boom, yeah.

[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:33.900]
Wow.

[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.340]
So let's just keep it a secret.

[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.480]
Don't let Neil find out whatever's going on internally here because then he'll go on the

[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.380]
other big mouth and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I like that and channel tends upset because

[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.360]
they're eating ass or whatever.

[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.480]
Go out and sell some spots.

[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.160]
All your sales people and as far as the program direct is concerned,

[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.880]
just keep a lid on it, okay?

[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.120]
Quit being a little girl.

[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.280]
We got enough little girls on the year already.

[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.640]
We got last, last time going to the track.

[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.520]
First I see the dog, it killed her on sunrise, boulevard, then even a worse,

[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.260]
a worse disaster.

[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.900]
I'm hearing at the trio, we got at six o'clock.

[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.100]
We had Clarence Stugots and Mark Eisenberg on there.

[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.400]
Wow.

[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.180]
Bad high school radio.

[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.960]
What is the deal with Stugots?

[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.960]
Has he got naked pictures?

[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.420]
I think he's got naked pictures of Hank and Duff.

[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.000]
Now, seriously, what is that all about?

[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.120]
What is the big tennis with him?

[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.000]
He's a nice guy.

[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.040]
He's a good guy.

[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.300]
I really like weener, but the people who are on the year,

[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.000]
he talks sports.

[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.700]
But the voice, the sound, he's like gruesome sound, he's like Igor.

[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.920]
He's got that sound.

[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:35.560]
I like it.

[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.560]
That's my favorite part about it.

[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.680]
Anyway, so I haven't had to attend at 560 WQM.

[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.660]
It's going to be a great day today.

[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.140]
I'm loose as I made a great comeback at Poppano Park last night.

[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.460]
Oh, there's our little girl program director.

[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.080]
But me the check.

[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.120]
I always like that stuff.

[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.300]
He's the best.

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.660]
He is my favorite little girl.

[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.900]
Thank you so much.

[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:52.940]
Thank you.

[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.560]
Thanks, Mary.

[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.320]
I mean, Duff.

[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:55.720]
Just relax.

[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.200]
Okay.

[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.860]
Who cares if Channel 10 is programming?

[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.160]
That's less work for you and your assistant there.

[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:00.420]
Okay.

[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.500]
Let them program the station.

[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:02.940]
He's laughing.

[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.340]
He's picking on me.

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.500]
He's picking on me.

[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.340]
Look at this.

[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.320]
Here's my talent check.

[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.220]
Came into the unexpected.

[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:08.820]
Okay.

[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.480]
I can leave now.

[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.140]
Now I only need to set up another 40 or 50 of these.

[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.780]
Just like that.

[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.700]
And I make up that money.

[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.200]
That my good friend at first union securities is losing my ass.

[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.440]
By the way, thank you profusely.

[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.540]
Whoever sent me this thing from all of us be journal.

[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.480]
Yesterday I was sitting here.

[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.900]
I never really looked into that closely.

[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.080]
15 firms on there.

[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.040]
And I, of course, am with the worst one in the universe.

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.660]
The one that's performing so poorly

[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.840]
that it's an embarrassment.

[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.560]
It's humiliating.

[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.260]
Yeah.

[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.020]
Rumor must have found,

[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.280]
forget about the fact that Mitch Hersh is neighbor.

[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.140]
Must have found him through that psychic is what happened.

[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:41.380]
Yeah.

[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.300]
That's probably what it was.

[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:43.600]
God.

[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.100]
And wait this vlog is today.

[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.620]
It's a good thing this bonus check came in.

[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.840]
Becoming this talent check because so boy things are going to start getting.

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.860]
It's going to start getting really strange around here.

[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.980]
You think it was strange before?

[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.440]
Now that we're in a goddamn full blown depression

[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.180]
and the world is coming to an end as we knew it.

[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.940]
And Bush, boy, they're off to a good start with us.

[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:01.940]
And the administration, the Navy.

[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.580]
With a submarine and not a little accident over there in Kuwait.

[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:06.680]
Oops.

[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.440]
La Bomba.

[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.020]
Oh, sorry.

[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.240]
We're killing our own people again.

[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:09.860]
Wasn't a target.

[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.860]
And then of course the, you know, the markets wanted.

[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.860]
Boots, boots, boots.

[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.520]
And you got in there now like we're in a free fall.

[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.800]
And they're on there going.

[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.520]
Consideration.

[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.180]
Yeah, like that.

[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.220]
I like that.

[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:18.240]
I like that.

[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.920]
Hey, listen, there's no sense in getting all worked up and who's sweat about it.

[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.440]
I mean, I'm what can you do?

[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.500]
You know, just be philosophical.

[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.300]
Make sure it needs my business, you know.

[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.800]
He needs somebody talking about him on the air.

[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.440]
I like the publicity.

[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.640]
He's a publicity house.

[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.080]
That's a poor question.

[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.060]
Would you rather be a publicity house or a brownie house?

[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.720]
10, 15, at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720]
How'd that pull Kamala yesterday?

[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.580]
Before we get to that, thanks to our friends at Planned Parenthood for this very

[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.280]
a nice award.

[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.200]
The Maggie Media Award.

[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.520]
It's kind of light though, isn't it?

[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:47.920]
It's appropriate.

[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:48.580]
Huh?

[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.380]
Not sure if they wouldn't think it'd be like a little, it's like a paperweight.

[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.540]
Planned Parenthood in recognition of your courage and excellence in covering

[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.520]
reproductive rights, health, care, and critical issues.

[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.200]
The award is the Maggie Media Award March 2001.

[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.820]
Oh!

[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:01.460]
Thanks.

[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.600]
So how was lunch?

[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.220]
It was kind of like the award.

[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:06.860]
Kind of light.

[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:07.600]
Yes.

[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:08.900]
Very light.

[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.780]
Kind of like some of the people in the organization.

[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.060]
Light.

[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.560]
But still.

[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.620]
But it was very nice.

[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.200]
In retrospect, I'm sure it was better than being here.

[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.580]
And the old ladies were oogling the gallon.

[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.280]
We're looking to get a little bit of the older and they're looking at,

[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.560]
touching it, looking at, fondling it.

[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:25.560]
Jones and for it.

[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.260]
I can relate.

[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.040]
So anyway, now he's all right.

[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:29.780]
He's a nice kid.

[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.700]
It's all I can tell you.

[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.600]
Had him in my bedroom.

[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.080]
Anyway, so here's that pull from yesterday.

[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.920]
He once, he was in my bedroom, very pretty.

[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.300]
On my head.

[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.760]
On my car.

[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:37.440]
Oh!

[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.500]
How was it?

[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.320]
1070 votes yesterday.

[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.220]
This is the kind of stuff that gets to the bloodborne.

[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.920]
These usually are very, very lethargic people out there.

[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.620]
This is the kind of pull they like.

[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.160]
They're on it.

[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.280]
Although I hear a lot of these probably were bogus because it just seems like an awful lot of

[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.020]
votes to me for a week.

[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.580]
They pull 1073 and they're still pouring in there.

[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.140]
But not necessarily because when you listen to the choices, you'll know

[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.740]
this is the kind of fodder that they can sink their teeth into here in San Florida.

[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.060]
It's that.

[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.140]
Yeah.

[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.280]
So, and before I give you the results of the poll, let me say this to you.

[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.160]
Because we've done this before, awarded differently.

[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.180]
And also we did it by ethnic background.

[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.320]
And there's a big difference here because a lot of the people, a lot of these so-called

[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.900]
anglos who will voted for the eluding choice here, what the stird is the most about life in San

[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.100]
Florida.

[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.040]
A lot of them really aren't saying what the choice is.

[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.020]
It's not just that they are disturbed by people who won't speak English.

[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.780]
They don't like Hispanics.

[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.060]
They hate them like poison.

[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:41.000]
So you see, that's when they find out that a lot of Hispanics and Cubans also voted

[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.020]
for the same thing, which we've broken that down.

[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.880]
Then it's like they don't know what to do.

[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.440]
They kind of like go like, they don't know what to do.

[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.540]
Which of these disturbs you the most about San Florida?

[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.880]
People who can't or won't speak English.

[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.900]
Out of a thousand and seventy three, four hundred and thirteen, thirty eight point four

[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.220]
percent winning an orange line.

[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.160]
How many people are no speaker in English, baby?

[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.680]
Old people, two hundred and five.

[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.940]
Nineteen point one percent.

[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.360]
That's what I voted for.

[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.440]
Old people.

[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.180]
Nasty, disgusting, miserable, rotten,

[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.720]
toe jam, cheese infested, old people, blue hairs, gray hairs, white hairs.

[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.540]
The last few days I'm telling you, I've been passing people, I do mean passing them with

[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.420]
some desperate to get around them on the road who are definitely dead.

[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.920]
There was a guy on Sunrise over the weekend.

[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.240]
This guy had to be two hundred years old, easy.

[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.140]
And he was moving maybe three miles an hour, but luckily in the white handling.

[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.420]
Nice go on pop, stay in the way.

[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.980]
Stay on the grass will be good.

[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.540]
Stay on the wicked weeds.

[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.440]
And then yesterday I'm getting off the turnpike on the 595 ramp there.

[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.860]
And here's a guy that's got everybody backed up.

[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.820]
I mean he's going maybe 15 miles an hour.

[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.880]
It's one thing to slow down when you're making that big curve.

[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.600]
There I understand, but slowing down like you're in a school zone,

[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.000]
like maybe 10, 15 miles an hour, maybe just a little bit to conservative driving for most of us.

[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.720]
And as I get around him, I take a look at this guy.

[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.420]
He's got like a one of those big wide rimmed hats on.

[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.020]
Had to be at least three hundred years old.

[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.420]
Looks like Methusel is brother-in-law.

[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.400]
I mean I'm glad that we have so many people who live, you know,

[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.300]
the longevity rate is, of course you got to understand when they came here,

[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.400]
most of them were 90 anyway.

[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.780]
So it kind of skews upward.

[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.400]
Some glad for them, but get him off the road.

[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.240]
Get those assholes off the road.

[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.500]
Anyway, or people at 206, the driver's 180 and there's certainly isn't overlap

[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.520]
between those two categories, like some people said.

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.180]
Crafty schools only 161 or 14.9 percent are that bothers them the most.

[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.040]
And crime, now we don't care about that.

[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.300]
114 only.

[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.720]
10.6 percent are most disturbed about the crime here in South Florida.

[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.140]
Nobody to give me a look like that for.

[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.160]
I just thought that would have been much higher.

[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.020]
I certainly care more about the crime than the old people.

[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.660]
It's the last one on the list.

[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.100]
I realize we have a list of five choices.

[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:10.080]
It was way in the rear, way in the middle of the back of the list.

[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.560]
Not even close.

[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.040]
10.6 percent.

[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.500]
As compared to the nearly 40 percent of people are psychotic over the

[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.000]
people who can't or won't speak English.

[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.660]
So people would rather be mugged than here, a foreign language.

[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:26.960]
Yes.

[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.680]
And if they're going to be mugged, they want to be mugged in English, please.

[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.860]
Let's mug them in English.

[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.820]
Look at these phones this morning.

[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.960]
Like I said, pick a good choice not to be in the ass.

[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.020]
The phone is all screwed up.

[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.360]
We have some serious techno phone.

[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.080]
Poor beast.

[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.100]
Beast got a good lunch though.

[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.920]
That's all he cared about.

[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.120]
He got fed nice lunch by a bad over Tony's.

[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.280]
5.670560.

[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.460]
Here's our poll for today since we're doing South Florida stuff.

[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.860]
We ought to do a poll on which is the worst the stock brokerage house,

[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.200]
but I already have the answer for that.

[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.540]
Well, this is just the Knox-Mysakra.

[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.740]
I mean, it's one thing to know that you're stupid and that you're losing your ass,

[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.300]
at least on paper or whatever, and that you're not getting any guidance.

[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.140]
And you're just getting a lot of double-pock and the same old stuff

[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.420]
you can put on a cassette recording.

[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.060]
But then you look at the results here.

[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.140]
You know, people who want the slogan to cliches and double-pock,

[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.380]
they want results, baby.

[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.020]
Am I getting results?

[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.220]
Or am I getting results all right?

[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.580]
I'm taking it right up the old record all the way to my naval.

[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.080]
Here's our survey today.

[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.420]
Which of the areas in South Florida is the most plastic?

[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.740]
And please put the word plastic and capital letters on there.

[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:31.380]
Or plastic.

[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.280]
Plastic.

[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.440]
Not spastic.

[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.280]
Plastic.

[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.880]
Now, I got three choices on here.

[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.040]
I'm sure you can help me out with this.

[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.140]
Coral Springs.

[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.680]
South Beach.

[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.340]
Or coconut grove.

[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.580]
Oh, I know another one.

[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.320]
Coral Gables.

[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.340]
Okay?

[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.640]
We can't have ducks and boats and anything.

[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.940]
A lot of very plastic people there.

[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.820]
If you don't understand the question I need to explain it to you,

[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.720]
then bug off.

[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:56.940]

[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.940]
Don't mess with our poll.

[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.100]
If you don't understand plastic.

[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.140]
Now, that's kind of a tough,

[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.720]
to me, it's a tough choice between the first two.

[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.980]
Coral Springs and South Beach.

[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.000]
Which of these areas in South Florida is the most plastic?

[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.180]
Coral Springs, South Beach, coconut grove,

[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.000]
or Coral Gables?

[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:17.900]
Am I leaving anything out?

[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.440]
I'm thinking.

[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:19.900]
Yeah.

[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.020]
Like western or any places like that?

[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.440]
Western?

[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.880]
Yeah.

[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.320]
I don't know.

[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.080]
Western's newty, but because you can't do anything there.

[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.380]
You can't smoke, you can't scratch your ass, you can't, you know,

[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.020]
can't do anything.

[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.400]
And if you're a guy,

[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.940]
you don't have a lot of blood in there,

[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.040]
because if you're a guy, you can't act like a little girl in western either.

[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.580]
No, they have an ordinance for that.

[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880]
So I keep him out of western.

[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.880]
But not because that you think about all the other,

[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.620]
the 8500 other municipalities we have, like, you know,

[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.680]
like plantation where I live is certainly not plastic.

[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.000]
It's like, I don't know, kind of like non-descript.

[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.980]
Sunrise is not plastic, it's old.

[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.940]
We got a lot of those, tamarax, surfside, old.

[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.580]
How about Boka?

[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.620]
So I don't know that much about Boka.

[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.080]
It's very plastic.

[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.620]
I haven't been in the Boka South Florida.

[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.520]
The Boka South Florida is like Palm Beach,

[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.780]
they have certainly, but I need to draw you a diagram.

[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.780]
The last time I checked Boka is in South Florida.

[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:12.920]
Yeah.

[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.440]
If you're going to put Boka,

[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.640]
yeah, you need to put West Palm Beach.

[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.080]
No.

[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:17.760]
No.

[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.740]
Palm Beach.

[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.880]
What about West Palm?

[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.560]
So you don't run off and about Palm Beach.

[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.220]
West Palm Beach is not.

[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.160]
West Palm Beach is in plastic.

[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.300]
West Palm is like old people in rednecks and shfartses.

[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.800]
There's no, but Palm Beach.

[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.400]
Now, I'm not putting Palm Beach on there.

[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.380]
Because Palm Beach actually has like a lot of very wealthy people.

[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.200]
They may be assholes like, you know,

[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.060]
the Kennedies and SD-Lowter knows people, but.

[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.440]
When I'm not talking, there's a difference.

[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:44.720]
Plastic.

[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.120]
Don't you understand that difference between

[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.760]
Philcy rich,

[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.240]
don't you think they're going to wait with it?

[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.780]
Philcy rich and plastic is a big difference there.

[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.660]
Shombie rich is filthy rich.

[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.640]
Snob's yes, but plastic, no.

[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.260]
You wouldn't say the Kennedies are plastic.

[00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.780]
You'd say that they're spastic,

[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.500]
that they're grotesque and irresponsible,

[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.920]
and a lot more than what everyone else

[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.040]
and rapist, but nevertheless,

[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.100]
you wouldn't drink, but you wouldn't say that they're plastic.

[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:08.500]
No.

[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:08.820]

[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.100]
Because they're a great American family.

[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.020]
The Kennedies.

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.120]
Yeah, Palm Beach.

[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.640]
It's not not on a list here.

[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.500]
So here's the final.

[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.640]
At least I think it's the final.

[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.000]
That's a five-good place is there.

[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.220]
Crossbrings,

[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.100]
Sound Beach,

[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.260]
Coconut Grove,

[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.180]
Crowgables and Mocha.

[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.000]
Yeah.

[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.800]
Pretty good list there if you ask me.

[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.420]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:31.620]
Hello.

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.200]
Mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.440]
They've been there for a long time.

[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.040]
Don't want to speak.

[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:39.440]
Okay.

[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.340]
Give me your chance.

[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.540]
Mobile in Miami.

[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:41.820]
Hello.

[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.540]
How you doing?

[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:42.960]
How you doing?

[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.400]
Okay.

[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.160]
I don't know if you saw 60 minutes,

[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.020]
but they had a story on these brokerage houses.

[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.980]
And most of them are also investment tankers.

[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:51.720]
Yeah.

[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.700]
That's why they're pushing most of these stocks.

[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.400]
Because they have a vested interest in them.

[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.000]
Yeah, I saw that.

[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.920]
I really know that.

[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.520]
None of them will say,

[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.500]
say, on a stock.

[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.800]
The little code word is hold.

[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.380]
When you hear one of them say,

[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.320]
hold on a stock,

[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.760]
you better run,

[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.860]
get your ass and sell it.

[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.200]
Yeah.

[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.240]
Because if they say,

[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:10.560]
hold,

[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.000]
that means that's not going down the tube.

[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.820]
Look at Priceline.com.

[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.700]
Same thing happened with that.

[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.140]
They never said sell on it.

[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:18.400]
Yeah.

[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.560]
They only said hold.

[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.420]
Hold on.

[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:20.720]
And then,

[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.480]
what will hold it?

[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.540]
Really got it.

[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.220]
And uh,

[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.180]
and uh,

[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.460]
pick up a butt too.

[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.500]
Hold, hold, hold.

[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.380]
Take it easy, sir.

[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.520]
Okay. Thanks for the good news.

[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.340]
Anybody know what he said?

[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:29.600]
No.

[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.960]
No, he said they're all bunch of creeps.

[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.620]
I think is what he said.

[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:32.780]
He said that.

[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:34.620]
56070560,

[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.420]
pound 560 on the AT&T

[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.360]
in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.140]
What are we going to do about that Joe Pavey Jr., huh?

[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.200]
On the one hand,

[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.040]
little boy.

[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:43.880]
Nice.

[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:44.480]

[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.700]
We're turning over Japanese returning over Japanese

[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.040]
with the things of

[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.700]
we're turning over Japanese returning over

[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.400]
Japanese with the things of

[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.060]
we're turning over Japanese returning over

[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.820]
Japanese with the things of

[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.100]
being

[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.560]
with changing over Japanese returning over

[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.320]
Japanese with the things of

[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.820]
10.29 at 5.60 we're bombing our own

[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.400]
people over there.

[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.560]
and Kuwait we're doing a hell of a job.

[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.520]
Nice going there, Bushman.

[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:13.760]
Yeah.

[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.980]
Somebody get out a diaphragm and show him where the hell it's at.

[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.520]
So the guy's actually coming tomorrow with a steak and shake food.

[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.820]
So let me forget, I got to bring in those penguin tickets

[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.860]
in that parking pass.

[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.420]
For this guy who's one of our listeners who's just

[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.340]
dying for those panther penguin tickets for Friday night.

[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.640]
So he's bringing a steak and shake for me and George tomorrow.

[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.120]
Here's a mobile implantation.

[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:34.380]
Hello.

[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.360]
Aineah Hayado.

[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:35.940]
OK, sir.

[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.360]
I'm not one of these people who are

[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.980]
offended by bilingualism, but yesterday a very troublesome thing

[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.460]
happened.

[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:42.820]

[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.440]
Mom went to pick up her prescriptions.

[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.880]
You've 82 years old.

[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.280]
Oh my god.

[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.060]
Yeah, right.

[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.880]
All the information on it don't take with water or whatever

[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.800]
it is, all Spanish labels.

[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.180]
My mother's been using this drug for years and years and years.

[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.380]
Where it comes up with this, I have no idea what part of town

[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:01.820]
of this?

[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:02.580]
Pemberpines.

[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.240]
Oh, well, forget about that.

[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.000]
And it's not even a very flat area.

[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.180]
Sure, does Pemberpines?

[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:08.920]
Yeah.

[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:09.960]
It's becoming.

[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:10.860]
It's becoming.

[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.280]
Yeah.

[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.640]
But I mean, that's it's terrifying.

[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.940]
If she wasn't smart enough, it's like, well, why would they do that?

[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.140]
What's the excuse?

[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.740]
They said we made a mistake with sorry.

[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.420]
But I mean, it's just terrifying.

[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.780]
It just doesn't make any sense.

[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.740]
They said we'll say that first option.

[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.960]
Silly stuff.

[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.560]
That can't happen.

[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.340]
Not in America, but again, we don't live in America.

[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.600]
There you go.

[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.000]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.700]
Take two in college in the morning.

[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.300]
How do you like that?

[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.740]
Lose your until we'll never happen again.

[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.440]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.560]
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and provides a wireless line.

[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.000]
See, actually, we can talk about this every day for the next three years, anyway.

[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:49.520]
Sure.

[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.320]
People don't want to speak English.

[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.560]
Everybody's whipped up to a friend.

[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.280]
These are going to change.

[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:53.580]
No.

[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.860]
Can we do anything about?

[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.060]
No.

[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.020]
But they're just very angry about that.

[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.900]
They're just offended by that.

[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.700]
They're psychotic about it.

[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.000]
They don't care about crappy school.

[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.280]
They certainly don't care about crime.

[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.680]
They're just pissed off that you won't speak it to God.

[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.120]
They're in English.

[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.240]
They don't want to pick it upon you.

[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:08.860]
Don't you get it?

[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.440]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:11.800]
Hello?

[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:14.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:16.780]
Hey, Neil.

[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.240]
Good morning.

[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.000]
Good morning.

[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.720]
Here's the story.

[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.540]
I used to live in Miami.

[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.860]
The crime rate used to be much higher.

[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.840]
So maybe people were reflecting on the fact that crime rates not what it used to be.

[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.580]
I had an interesting experience this morning.

[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.640]
I thought I would relate to you.

[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.460]
I only spent a night or two down here a week now.

[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.060]
Thank God.

[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:43.080]
But anyway, I'm in Burger King having a hand-made and cheese croissant which you know

[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:43.320]
about.

[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:49.300]
And these three forces, as you would say, come in behind me.

[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.520]
And they have official looking uniforms on.

[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.760]
I'm wasn't sure exactly what branch of the government they were with.

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:02.000]
But this one big guy asks, when do you start serving whoppers?

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.680]
And he says, the other lady behind the counter says at 10 o'clock.

[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.040]
He says, well, that's 45 minutes.

[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.120]
I'll just wait.

[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.140]
45 minutes for his whopper.

[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.220]
He's on the dole.

[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.380]
Yeah.

[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.440]
Paddle.

[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.520]
And 915 is going to wait 45 minutes for a whopper.

[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:21.900]
Yeah.

[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.020]
Well, let me ask you this.

[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.720]
Why are you concerned about that?

[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.980]
In other words, I'm missing something here.

[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.120]
This seems to me like number one, the heck of a waste of time.

[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.740]
Well, what is his function?

[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.340]
What did he do?

[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.480]
What did it say on the jacks?

[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.700]
It didn't.

[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:41.860]
I mean, his uniform was the other two had like American flags on.

[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.900]
Well, how do you know they were working?

[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.420]
How do you know it was like doing working hours?

[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.200]
Well, their uniforms were fairly crisp.

[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:54.600]
Yeah.

[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.700]
They had starch and then they were...

[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.380]
What is happening?

[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.780]
Maybe they still working like 11 o'clock in the morning.

[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.540]
How do you even know what they do?

[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.580]
Maybe so.

[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.620]
Well, we said they're working.

[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]
I just said the thing like a hell of a waste of time to me.

[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.680]
It's like this call, right?

[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.180]
Can you believe that?

[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.180]
And I mean, this definitely is the most boring place on the face of the earth.

[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.700]
I mean, that's really stretching it.

[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.400]
That this guy is so lifeless that he's worried he's taking note of the fact that they're

[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:21.700]
going to wait.

[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.040]
If they want to wait two hours for a goddamn walk or that's their business, ain't it?

[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.760]
Maybe they're sitting in their...

[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.740]
They're investigating.

[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.800]
Maybe they're like undercover.

[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:29.700]
Maybe they're nuts.

[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.000]
Maybe they're the meat police.

[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:31.520]
Who the hell?

[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.360]
Maybe they're looking for a fruct and mouth, hoof and mouth, mad cow.

[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.340]
Who knows what they're doing?

[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.480]
Get a life and stop being a yento, okay?

[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.600]
He's in the right place.

[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.700]
Jesus Christ.

[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.360]
I mean, man, if I go in a burger king, God forbid because the meat there's like rubber.

[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.420]
But if I did, I'm not going to be sitting there worrying about what they're all everybody

[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.740]
else is doing, timing how long you're sitting and waiting.

[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.840]
What is wrong with some of you people out there beside the fact that you live here?

[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.980]
And this guy's talking about he only is here a couple of days.

[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.540]
Thank God.

[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.280]
Thank the Lord.

[00:27:59.540 --> 00:27:59.820]
Hallelujah.

[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.460]
Thank the Lord for the night time.

[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.240]
We don't have to do one more break this, I guess.

[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.940]
We can like, we don't need to do any breaks.

[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.780]
Let's just skip them.

[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.900]
They're all tradeouts anyway.

[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.040]
And then the water Nazi did threaten to kill those puppies, by the way.

[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.660]
So the fact that she's got her puppy, huh?

[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.000]
That was a true story.

[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:15.900]
I was having to verify.

[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.060]
Oh, don't tell me.

[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:17.860]
Oh, don't tell them.

[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.840]
Oh, how do you find out?

[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.200]
Oh, Greg, it's a story.

[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.480]
It's a city found out.

[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.860]
Seriously, I've never worked in such a juvenile place in all my life.

[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.100]
These people are like a bunch of kindergarten kids here.

[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.240]
Little kids in a sandbox with a pale in shovel.

[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.040]
Oh, Greg, it's a fight.

[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:32.840]
It's a fight.

[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:39.300]
5.670560, 0560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.260]
First union securities.

[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.000]
Nice going, Mitch, right there.

[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.340]
Wait, not just in the bottom of the list, but wait down at the bottom.

[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.380]
I mean, not like even in a ball game, not in the ball game.

[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.880]
Better call that psyche pack where we're getting some new names, OK?

[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.220]
I think you must add a bad connection.

[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.480]
No wonder he's in tears on the sofa.

[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.980]
You want to know why he's in tears on the sofa?

[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:04.940]
Ask Jeez.

[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.260]
He'll tell you.

[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.960]
Here's the mobile in Pember Pine.

[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:08.300]
Hello.

[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.760]
Yeah, sir.

[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:10.400]
It's David.

[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.040]
How are you?

[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.640]
OK, David.

[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.820]
Hey, I just want to let you know.

[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.180]
I've got a notice in the mail that we're renaming Pember Pine

[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.080]
in higherly north.

[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:17.760]
Yeah.

[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.380]
You're moving up, Neil.

[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.360]
Yeah, it's a crazy place.

[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.820]
Nobody speaks English here anymore.

[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.840]
Yeah, it used to be a great place.

[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:27.360]
I don't know.

[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.180]
Pember Pine was never a great place.

[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.480]
I lived in Pember Ponds.

[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840]
It was a great place.

[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.420]
It was OK.

[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.460]
Yeah, it was a very village.

[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:34.860]
You're right.

[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.540]
Huh, yeah.

[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.520]
A lot of old people.

[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.640]
Then when they built cemetery village, lots, lots more old people.

[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.660]
A lot of speed traps, a lot of radar there on Taft and Hyatus.

[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.060]
I'd get that a lot of there if I were you.

[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.580]
I am.

[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.900]
Now we have a language barrier.

[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.880]
OK, good luck, you see.

[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.600]
There you go.

[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.340]
Language barrier.

[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.320]
No say I'll be able to English.

[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:49.640]
I keep.

[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.500]
Bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.700]
They love this.

[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.480]
They can relate to it.

[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.100]
That's their whole life.

[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.440]
It circulates around it.

[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.420]
And you ought to be glad.

[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.360]
You ought to be thankful for those people who are not speaking English.

[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.080]
Because otherwise, just like this guy,

[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.360]
this guy ought to be ecstatic.

[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.280]
The Burger King guy that those as far as he's

[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.100]
more sitting and waiting 45 minutes for a walker.

[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.460]
What else would he be talking about?

[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.160]
What else would he have for a life?

[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.120]
That gave him a whole life there.

[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.780]
The fact that three schwarters who obviously

[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.600]
are on the government door or whatever he said or a dual pineapple,

[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.040]
whatever they're on, they're sitting on it,

[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.540]
they were waiting 45 minutes for their walker.

[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.280]
Oh, that's my paperweight.

[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.620]
That's my plan for a hundred paperweight.

[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.040]
Makes him a good sound if I like that.

[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.840]
I'm going to go down to Power 96 and start banging on the walls

[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.780]
down there with him just to get even with those bastards.

[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:37.800]
Mobile in marathon.

[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.240]
Hello.

[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.180]
Hello.

[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:40.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.740]
How are you?

[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.100]
Happy 25th.

[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.360]
Thanks.

[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.680]
I want to give you the most plastic,

[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.640]
town and South Florida there is.

[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.800]
But you walk a look.

[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.260]
OK.

[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:50.940]
Hillsboro Beach.

[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.920]
It's one mile.

[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.480]
Listen, they got more walls than Hillsboro Beach.

[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:56.940]
Really?

[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.560]
If you have the wrong color color going down A1A,

[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.760]
you can stop in question.

[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.160]
Really?

[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.700]
It's an absolute unbelievable full of new vei rich.

[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.980]
But how many people live in the Hillsboro Beach?

[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:08.320]
About 800?

[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.240]
1800?

[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:10.100]
Yes.

[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.940]
And plus they get snow birds and some of the high rises.

[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.500]
And they're all lost wannabes.

[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.900]
But I think it deserves your consideration.

[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.040]
OK, well put it in a bit.

[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.640]
Put it in a bit.

[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.140]
Thank you.

[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:22.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.620]
Again, get a lot of it.

[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:24.480]
Are we putting it on the list?

[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:24.720]
No.

[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.520]
1800 people is just not enough people.

[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.220]
And do you know anything about Hillsboro Beach?

[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.560]
Nobody knows from Hillsboro Beach.

[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.360]
I mean, there are a lot of people

[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.420]
keep calling about Aventura.

[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:32.480]
No.

[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.180]
We didn't say old.

[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.460]
We said plastic.

[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.560]
Not old.

[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.800]
I know there are plastic people in Aventura.

[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.420]
But when I think of Aventura, I think of old.

[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.720]
I think of the Aventura mall with all due respect.

[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.380]
Oh, gee, Brian and sales got to get up.

[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.820]
So we probably got some clients in there

[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.580]
like our friends in New Balance, which we love.

[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.360]
But I mean, you know, they can't help it.

[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.140]
Boy, our sales department's getting real nervous these days.

[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.460]
I think it's nervous.

[00:31:58.900 --> 00:31:58.900]

[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.740]
I can understand why we got no spots.

[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.560]
And our sales manager, that crazy bitch,

[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.620]
she's running around telling them, oh, there's no avails.

[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:04.860]
Yeah.

[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.180]
OK.

[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.520]
Whatever you say, honey, last she's busy with raw.

[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.200]
And then anybody rhymes with raw.

[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.620]
Yeah, she likes the sound of that.

[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.260]
She likes the big sound.

[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.760]
That sucking sound.

[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.940]
And I guess they do, too.

[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.520]
Yeah, this is quite a place.

[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:18.980]
You know what I say?

[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:19.740]
You know what I say?

[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.160]
I feel different.

[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.760]
I mean, just like the thing with a stock.

[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.320]
I mean, yesterday I called up mature.

[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:25.980]
She was upset.

[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:26.720]
I was upset.

[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.300]
He's pissed off.

[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:27.940]
I'm ripping him on here.

[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.740]
He deserves it.

[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:29.640]
He's clueless.

[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.500]
He's, you know, he's business guy.

[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.620]
He's trying to make a living, OK?

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.200]
He's trying to make a living.

[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.580]
He's killing me.

[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.020]
He's trying to make a living.

[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.060]
So what's the point?

[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.340]
You know, I'll just find somebody else.

[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.060]
Let's switch it over.

[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:43.500]
And that's it.

[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.620]
I gave this guy a year.

[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.800]
He gave me, oh, it's only three months.

[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.580]
It's only six months.

[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.620]
So what's your my life?

[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.680]
I understand that.

[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.680]
Bad timing, OK?

[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.780]
But I'm looking at these statistics here.

[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.240]
And they prove to me beyond a shadow of a pile.

[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.540]
I'll buy a pile.

[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.620]
That you're crap.

[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.760]
Your results are just not what I'd be looking for.

[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:02.560]
So thanks again, Rimmer.

[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.080]
Stick to the hockey, like I said.

[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.160]
Go ask JD some questions.

[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.120]
Maybe he's got the answers.

[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.540]
Here's a mobile on Hollywood.

[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:09.900]
Hello.

[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.160]
Hey, Neil.

[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:11.480]
Good morning.

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:11.860]
How are you?

[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.340]
I'm great.

[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:12.900]
How are you, sir?

[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.040]
Well, I'm pretty good.

[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.680]
That other guy, one of your collars stole my thunder.

[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.540]
But yeah, Pember of Pines is extremely loud now.

[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:19.820]
Right.

[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.420]
That's what I tried to tell that first car.

[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.700]
There's nobody speaks English.

[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.920]
There are any more Pember of Pines?

[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.840]
You go into a publics out there,

[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.060]
and there's a signage and bilingual signage.

[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.980]
And some of the guys don't speak English.

[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:32.480]
Yeah.

[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.900]
Like, by the end of the day.

[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.140]
Why does that bother people?

[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.840]
Well, I don't know.

[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:37.560]
I really don't know.

[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.560]
You wouldn't bother me at all.

[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.380]
I speak Spanish, but I mean.

[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.720]
It only bothers me if I go like to Miami International Airport.

[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.080]
And I go through the thing that they want me to look in my bag.

[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.420]
You know, I have to go through the metal detector.

[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.780]
And they start speaking to me in Spanish first.

[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.380]
I do.

[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.220]
I'm disturbed by that.

[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.560]
That's the only thing I can counter it.

[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.540]
But other than that, I don't really pay any attention.

[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.660]
And in addition to which I live in Broward,

[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.660]
I don't live in Pember of Pines.

[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.060]
And I don't frequent places where they don't speak to me in English.

[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.140]
And if they did that, I would just go someplace else if I was disturbed by it.

[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:10.600]
And then that other guy called about the guys that were ordering a wopper.

[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:11.960]
Yeah.

[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.720]
What's his problem?

[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:13.720]
No life.

[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:14.460]
No life.

[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.720]
He thought about that from yesterday.

[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:17.260]
Yeah.

[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.480]
So I like that.

[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.940]
Thank God he only comes here twice a week.

[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:21.800]
I have no life.

[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:22.920]
That was what he's trying to say.

[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.580]
I have no life.

[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.560]
OK, good luck to that guy.

[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.240]
Have a great day.

[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.200]
Thank you, everybody.

[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.500]
You know, like in Toronto on Young Street, there's...

[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.140]
I don't know if they have those anymore up there.

[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.780]
I hope they do.

[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.620]
The Italian sausage.

[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.860]
They have little stands on there.

[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.740]
Like every other street corner in Young Street, downtown.

[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.720]
There are vendors out there where there are grills and aholdy else.

[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.840]
So Italian sausage and Polish sausage and whatever.

[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.960]
So they're weenies.

[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.340]
And there's one which was always my favorite.

[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.780]
And they happen to be...

[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.420]
They're not Cuban.

[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.340]
They're like some Hispanic I don't know where they're from.

[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:50.920]
I think Argentina.

[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.140]
And they speak English, broken English.

[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.180]
And they're a very nice family.

[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.780]
And they can cook up your sausage or whatever.

[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.300]
You know, much as crossy as whatever they'll speak like English and Spanish.

[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:00.800]
It's fine.

[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.560]
Doesn't bother me.

[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:04.320]
Huh?

[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.920]
I mean, if there were Chinese families speaking in Chinese, I certainly would have some

[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.400]
diffugally.

[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.480]
You know, if there were like a Dutch family speaking in Dutch, I'd say, I'll still believe

[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.360]
Toteens do it in a good way because I know what you're talking about, you know.

[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:20.540]
But it seems to me that just a lot of people down here want to make a big sentence about

[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:20.780]
this.

[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.260]
And they drive on it.

[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.320]
They just...

[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.380]
They live for it.

[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.700]
In fact, that's probably a good idea since we have so much spirit time and it's so boring

[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:29.880]
here.

[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.600]
That should be a new use resolution, even though it's already March, is learn some

[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.540]
foreign language like Swahili anything.

[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.680]
And then just go and speak it everywhere just to piss everybody off.

[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:39.880]
Works like a charm.

[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.960]
Mobile in Miami.

[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.300]
Hello.

[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:44.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:44.720]
Neil.

[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:44.940]
Hi.

[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.260]
How are you doing?

[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.620]
I'm doing well.

[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.880]
I wanted to also put in for adventurer as a plastic place.

[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:52.380]
No.

[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.740]
You know why?

[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.500]
You know why?

[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.120]
I just lived there for a couple years and I found it to be there's more speed traps there

[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.900]
than any other city in South Florida.

[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.060]
I do.

[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.000]
But the speed traps in Pembroke lakes but that doesn't make it a plastic place.

[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.280]
I mean, old Jews is what I have in tourism all about.

[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:07.800]
Old Jews.

[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.240]
Yeah, that's true too.

[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:09.640]
Isn't it?

[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.860]
Yeah, absolutely.

[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.400]
Well, how could old Jews be plastic?

[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.640]
Well, you know, anybody can be plastic, I think.

[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.960]
But I mean, yeah, just more speed traps per square inch there than any other city, I

[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.120]
think.

[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.980]
But also, I wanted to let you know, I worked in Spain for quite a bit of time.

[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.640]
And when I went over there, I hardly spoke any Spanish.

[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.460]
But when I was working there, I had a supervisor.

[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.540]
It followed me around and said to me, you know, speak Spanish only.

[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:38.660]
I'll bless.

[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.580]
But you know, still lament only the whole time.

[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.360]
And you know, here you just don't find anyone pushing anyone to speak English.

[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.420]
So, Fanto italiano.

[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.480]
Yeah.

[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:47.820]
See.

[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.140]
So, I just want to get your comment on that.

[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.120]
And I think they're also building a little tunnel toward Cuba.

[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.460]
I'm fascinated.

[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.980]
I'm delighted by the fact that there's so many people upset over, you know, hearing some

[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.380]
of the language.

[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.520]
I find it amusing.

[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:03.840]
I do.

[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.720]
I find it very amusing.

[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.440]
Yeah.

[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.260]
All right.

[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:06.900]
Well, take care.

[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.920]
And have a great day, pal.

[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.720]
I mean, if they look at, I don't cure languages.

[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.800]
Speak with other why, dear.

[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:12.300]
I don't know.

[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:12.860]
See your laugh.

[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.320]
And that's true.

[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.200]
Like the bag boys in my public, they all speak English.

[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.740]
But if they spoke Spanish, they were speaking like a Greek.

[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.500]
What's all the why, if they look good and they're friendly, hey, you know, just like my

[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.920]
friend Joshua, but it's taken shape.

[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.260]
See now, there you go again.

[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.100]
Why did that guy have to, you know, open up a mouth like that?

[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.160]
I mean, I'm glad he's going to bring us the lunch tomorrow.

[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.820]
But why is he got to like, say these things, you know, make the kid all paranoid and nervous?

[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.040]
Put them on the defensive, put them on guard, answer.

[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.800]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:38.900]
I don't cure inside anyway.

[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.200]
I just do it through the drive through.

[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.460]
I take a peak like in.

[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.400]
And like I said, the other day, like char-hots, another one where it takes a long time because

[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.820]
they cook each one first on a grill.

[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.460]
So of course, there's nobody who looks good at char-hots that I've ever seen.

[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.320]
But steak and shake, and you sit there and it takes a little extra time.

[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.400]
You're looking inside and maybe there's somebody in there like looking at you know, staring

[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:01.180]
at while you're watching the meat cook, watching that meat heat up, you know.

[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.720]
What's wrong with that?

[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.240]
Pound 5, 60.

[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.740]
In fact, all you people with those fast food joints, that's a little tip for you.

[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.900]
Put your good looking people if you have any out there by the drive through window.

[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:14.800]
Front load.

[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:15.540]
Absolutely.

[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.540]
Front loaded, you know.

[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.320]
Squared, squirt.

[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.400]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.780]
Hello.

[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:20.760]
Good morning, now.

[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.300]
Yes sir.

[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:21.680]
How are you doing?

[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.060]
Great.

[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.340]
That guy from my Burger King sounded like he had a way behind him for 45 minutes.

[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.000]
What does he care?

[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.080]
I have no idea.

[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.340]
This guy has got to be, he's probably only here two days a week.

[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.080]
The other five days, he's out searching for a life.

[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.360]
Yeah, hopefully when he eats there, he gets that equal life.

[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.280]
Anyway, so.

[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:37.960]
There you go.

[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.240]
I'm not prejudiced.

[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.720]
I'm married to a Latin girl.

[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.000]

[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.540]
Was brought turns in America.

[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.680]
I'm pure American, whatever you want to call it.

[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.540]
Married to a Latin girl, lover of the married 13 years.

[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:58.800]
The only thing that irritates me is that now they're starting to do all packaging, you

[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.700]
know, side American, the other side Latin.

[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.700]
I mean, if they're going to spend for one country, why don't they print it on like to

[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.920]
top the bottom and print in Chinese?

[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:08.900]
Do you know what I mean?

[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.140]
No.

[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.420]
I mean, why do they have to ban?

[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:17.800]
I mean, you know, most of it has a picture on it anyway, so you should be able to tell

[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.320]
what's in it.

[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.080]
Like I just saw a package of light bulbs.

[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.880]
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.540]
You know, I have the apartment in Amsterdam.

[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.920]
I'm there 15 weeks a year and I have a supermarket about two blocks away, block on a half.

[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:34.060]
And it's a little bit difficult because none of the, almost none of the items in there

[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.260]
have anything in English on them.

[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:35.980]
That's all written and done.

[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:36.220]

[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.140]
Right.

[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.320]
Because they're hungry.

[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.240]
If you hungry, because that's their language.

[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:41.580]
Right.

[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.280]
So most people speaking English, the stuff in there is all written up in Dutch.

[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.040]
So if you buy something, you're not exactly sure what it is.

[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.900]
Maybe you'll take it back to the department and surprise.

[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.160]
It's, you know, you thought you were buying like ground steak and it turns out it's a condom

[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:54.300]
right?

[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.480]
Yeah, that's some saying.

[00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.080]
It's like, yeah, okay, don't turn my mother-law.

[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.100]
She's been here for 35 years.

[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.060]
But you know something.

[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.780]
When I go into the supermarket, they're an Amsterdam.

[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.780]
I know, oh my God, how come it's not here?

[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.260]
It's just, it's not something that affects my life.

[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.940]
It's not something I waste any energy getting aggravated about.

[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.900]
It's a little bit confusing, but you start learning a little bit.

[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.300]
You'll look at, like you said, the picture.

[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.480]
What's a big deal, huh?

[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:19.840]
Correct.

[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:20.240]
Who cares?

[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.160]
Happy 25th anniversary.

[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.440]
This should be our biggest problem.

[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.140]
And thank you so much.

[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.140]
Well, I got some good news for you.

[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.420]
Some great news.

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.760]
The travel channel of all channels.

[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:31.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.260]
Oh, you've already discovered each week.

[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.500]
They've got America's greatest water parks.

[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.020]
Deach week, and then they've got a bathing suit thing.

[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:41.960]
Would you really like it?

[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:42.560]
Yeah.

[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.080]
The travel channel.

[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.960]
What is that on the, do we know on a satellite?

[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.860]
I know what it is on the cable, I'm not on the satellite.

[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:48.900]
Well, I have to dittle around.

[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.740]
It's Judge Watner.

[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.760]
But yeah, I was a good-to-past.

[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.600]
I was a channel server.

[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.560]
Because once in a while the travel channel will have like a real travel show.

[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.460]
Which I'll enjoy watching, if there's anything that's not interesting in place.

[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.940]
And last week or so, I've been discovering.

[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.140]
They had other one channel that's picked up on what we've been talking about for years.

[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.100]
Put some good-looking naked people on there and they will come.

[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.220]
And people will walk on.

[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.620]
There's nothing on right now during the day.

[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.020]
They save all that for the evening.

[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.200]
Oh, evening and weekend?

[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:14.540]
Yeah.

[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.700]
When horny people are home.

[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:15.880]
Right.

[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:16.680]
Great.

[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.700]
I guess we better do a break here.

[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.480]
We don't have a lot of business.

[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.160]
We have a lot of spots.

[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.520]
Most of the spots you'll hear today are tradeouts, by the way, for some of our fine friends.

[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.020]
Who supplies with like free food and meals and services and meal condoms.

[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.060]
This is 5.60 p.m.

[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.100]
You have no penis.

[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.040]
Time I always will remember.

[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.340]
Watching that first day watch episode.

[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:44.620]
All right.

[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.760]
Still running along the beach.

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.200]
We're bouncing up and down together.

[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.840]
About some music.

[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.640]
Or would I like most of all?

[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:03.600]
I like the songs and lots of ones in sync.

[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:07.980]
I like the songs that show me everything.

[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.720]
I like the songs that show I lots of see high.

[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.300]
I like the songs I like the songs.

[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.320]
And the time I learn your song gets so work out.

[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.900]
This got your two cheeks to a bone.

[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:41.260]
Oh yes, I say watch me make cushions up my lever.

[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.560]
More an amen, what a sight to be home.

[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:54.040]
I like the songs and lots of ones in sync.

[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.420]
I like the songs that show me everything.

[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.540]
I like the songs that show I lots of behind.

[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.920]
That's 5.705, 6.53.

[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.720]
Whatever it is, it's almost loving it.

[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:27.060]
I like the songs that show me everything.

[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:27.720]
I like the songs that show me everything.

[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.400]
I like the songs that show me everything.

[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.600]
I like the songs that show me everything.

[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:43.260]
I like the songs that show me everything.

[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.620]
QAing hasn't paid for itself and Shawn Henry and we have, aflame, and all these things.

[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:58.300]
We have a show back on Skylon.

[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:04.240]
75 votes are so far which of these areas of South Road?

[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:05.180]
Perfect.

[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.180]
which Eric has got in bold and underlined and the et cetera.

[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.720]
Plastic. Understand, Plastic? No, come on.

[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.400]
75 votes. South Beach 32, Volca 28.

[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.620]
That's a tough contest. That's Nippin' Tuck knows to knows.

[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.260]
Down the stretch, they come. Here they are. Hit them again, Brad.

[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.800]
A cruel game will six, cross-springs five, cooking to grow four.

[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.660]
I mean, we could put Aventure on there, but what's the point?

[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.920]
Is Aventure gonna... No.

[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.280]
Now, Aventure is old Jews. Old Jews with money, you know, but not Plastic.

[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.540]
Not Plastic. Maybe they're Mizzuz's Plastic on the Dört frame.

[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.260]
South Beach and Volca, that's the battle.

[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.780]
That's, I guess, what you'd expect, wouldn't be.

[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.500]
Although you're the one that put Volca in there. How did I forget about that?

[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.500]
Cross-springs is doing nearly as well as I thought it would. Only five.

[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.360]
Cross-springs has too many other things going for you.

[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:03.980]
You know, the gangs, punks, punks, wild punks, loosen the streets,

[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:11.340]
the fascist principal over there at Teravilla High, all of these things.

[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.520]
Here's at least once upon a time. Maybe the current principal, I don't know who the hell it is.

[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.160]
So you have to qualify that, because then we'll get another phone call.

[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.480]
Oh, they're upset at Teravilla High and Greg will be in water.

[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.920]
How did Neil find out we had to call Greg?

[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.440]
How can you go through it seriously? How can you go through life being such a pussy?

[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.040]
Seriously, he's a good guy. I like him a lot. I really do.

[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.500]
He's such a wimpy guy. He's so wimpy.

[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.180]
You know, just if he grow one little tiny one will be such a good star.

[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:40.920]
You know?

[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.460]
That's why I wanted you to have to write that out. That's great.

[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.480]
George is a genius. We just came up with a new name for our program director.

[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.100]
Muff! Yeah!

[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.860]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.700]
Where's my paper weight? Yeah!

[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.420]
Get off your Muff in this instant.

[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.440]
Yeah, it kind of gives you some of these things like,

[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:10.260]
yeah, Muff, get off this instant. It's interesting.

[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.500]
Muff! Excellent!

[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.940]
See, George is only back one day here and already he's right on top of it.

[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.320]
Who says they want to hear those stupid tapes?

[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.320]
Greg.

[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.540]
Yeah, he's right.

[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.600]
And those ball games too.

[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.380]
Here's the mobile and fort waterdale. Hello.

[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.120]
Sure part of that talent check with George is pretty good.

[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:29.400]
How about you, Martin?

[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.200]
Well, that was pretty quick coming up with the Muff thing there.

[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.760]
Yeah, that was great. That was very good.

[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:34.180]
Yeah.

[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:42.220]
Neil, imagine the time you could have had if you'd just taken a quarter of the money that you lost in the market and had it out in Vegas, just a blow.

[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.180]
Oh, a quarter?

[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:49.980]
I'm going to take in like one eighth of what I'm done right now. If I were to take an 11-10 push set of what I'm done now, I could have had a weekend that would never forget.

[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.260]
I could have gone in and also had a chance to win millions probably.

[00:46:52.780 --> 00:47:01.120]
And I'm a huge nearly and I remember way back when you just were railing against this bank and you wouldn't take who it was, but the initials were F-U.

[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:01.780]
Right.

[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:08.080]
And that was a different experience altogether. That was a car loan I had to first union in North Carolina.

[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:13.200]
And the people out there were so illiterate they couldn't spell us. I mean, they had no idea what they were talking about.

[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.140]
And I had the most gut-wrenching experience I ever had in my life.

[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.920]
Well, it just, you know, it's just normal.

[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:25.820]
They couldn't get my address straightened out to semi-dynam payment book and they were just done or then saw us. And that was our union.

[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.440]
Exactly. Well, I just want to say, Mitchers, keep it up. At this rate, we'll keep you around for another 20 years.

[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:32.740]
Okay. Have a great day, Bill.

[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:37.000]
Yeah. I got one thing I want to say to Mitch and closing, BYE BYE BYE!

[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.960]
Yeah. Just don't make any moves with what I got left. Okay. I'll be in touch.

[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:47.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0.5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless. I mean, this thing is just devastating.

[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.860]
This thing from the Wall Street urinal. I wish somebody would have shown me this a year ago.

[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:58.740]
I mean, it would be like if you had your life savings was just, you know, $10,000 just to pick a number.

[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.400]
And somebody came along and peddled you like a mutual fund and said, oh, this is great.

[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.860]
And we're going to make you a lot of money and you put it in, we're going to return you like $12, $15, $18,000.

[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.260]
I mean, you know, whatever they promised you, 20% a year.

[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:20.140]
And you put your money in there and all of a sudden you noticed the mutual fund was having a tough time and your balance was going down to $10,000, $8,500, $7,000.

[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:26.660]
And then somebody fired, because they do have those, I have a mutual fund magazine I get that shows the ratings of all the mutual funds in the various categories.

[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.840]
And let's say somebody sent you a sheet like this, like I got on the facts yesterday.

[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:35.700]
And let's do the 100 mutual funds in that category or whatever you bought, like European fund or whatever.

[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.860]
International fund, value fund.

[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.660]
And you look for yours and it's like number 100 out of 100.

[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.400]
And you would probably say, oh my god, I'm getting screwed.

[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:54.040]
And I'm looking at this thing right here in front of me and I'm saying to myself, oh, this isn't just bad.

[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.820]
This is humiliating. This is degrading. This is pathetic.

[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:08.280]
This is a performance so unspeakable that it makes you want to play the ID.

[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:14.840]
The Neil Rosers Show on 560 WQAMI, Emmy for Lauderdale.

[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.500]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:32.700]
Hey, hey, hey, please try to forgive me.

[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:39.740]
But there you are in your window.

[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:48.120]
Tell them that they'd be harder.

[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:53.260]
Or then your mountain just made me think more.

[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:59.760]
You can say it's a beeping tom that I've become.

[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:01.800]
I'm afraid you.

[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.520]
Oh yeah, yeah.

[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:07.720]
Looking back, I just dropped my tongue.

[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.600]
When your body comes on, done.

[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.960]
I'm playing with my parts and my damn is the dark.

[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.600]
Oh yes, they're close.

[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:26.180]
Our one great world is all ours.

[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:31.480]
One o'clock at 560 WQAMI got thank-klober show at Fort Lauderdale Stadium this afternoon.

[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.040]
Anybody interested in that? Marlon stuff?

[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:33.520]
Oh, no.

[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.420]
Her cool hotline at 6 o'clock.

[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.780]
Boogster at 7 o'clock tonight could be ripping Hank.

[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.880]
I'm sure Eddie K. Tendletude night.

[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:40.680]
We guys clean.

[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.480]
No games tonight.

[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.260]
Panthers and Edminton Oilers who have won nine in a row.

[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:45.780]
I think it is.

[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.540]
They're out of their smoke in the Oilers.

[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.580]
How does team in league?

[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.700]
So they'll be in town here tomorrow night.

[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.260]
Anybody going to that game?

[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:52.480]
No.

[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.340]
And then that guy's bringing a steak and shake tomorrow.

[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.880]
Boy, I'm really excited about that.

[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:57.460]
I will not be eating the buns.

[00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.080]
I will be eating the chocolate shake however.

[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:00.300]
Huh?

[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.020]
Well, you know, if you're going to eat a cup of high-race, eat something that's good.

[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:03.580]
That tastes good.

[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:03.740]
Right.

[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:04.520]
I ordered one.

[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.220]
Not a bun.

[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.680]
Buns are like kaka, you know?

[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.400]
All depending on who's the buns we're talking about.

[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.600]
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the AT&T Inforizon Wireless Line.

[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.900]
Lots of open lines here right now which is a very perplexing thing to me.

[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.040]
And I highly tell it, highly rated sure like this when we have so many different things going on here today.

[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.340]
So many.

[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.640]
And of course the thing about the people of what's big English.

[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.420]
I know you don't want to call a talk about that because you don't going to ridicule and be little you and you're right.

[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.460]
That's why we put it on the polar and the surveys you can do it anonymously

[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.260]
and express your frustration and anger in the bigotry.

[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.820]
Here's a cutlerage, hello.

[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.340]
Hello Neil.

[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:44.860]
Yes sir.

[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.580]
I just wanted to say thanks.

[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.020]
I listen to you show on the internet.

[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.820]
I don't get it down here in a cutlerage.

[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.740]
Oh, I don't think there are too many people getting it down there.

[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.300]
Yeah, nothing many people speak of English here.

[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.120]
And they show either right.

[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.200]
I just wanted to say thanks for playing up the good show and not giving in to the math I think.

[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.540]
And as opposed to how it's turned show which they do this on the way to work your show is 10 times better.

[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:08.220]
Okay.

[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:09.100]
All right.

[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:09.840]
And have a great day.

[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:10.540]
All right, bye bye.

[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:14.380]
Well he's making 100 times more money, but this shows 10 times better.

[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.380]
So it evens itself on.

[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.600]
I'm sure he's not worried about his stock broker.

[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.660]
Oh jeez, this thing is upside down.

[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.680]
You know, Bokeh would be nice if he would mark on a CD.

[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.100]
Well that's right, these are the ones that he couldn't sell.

[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.100]
567-0560, 05-560 on a AT&T.

[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.140]
And for Ryan's Marlotton, 106 votes.

[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.720]
South Beach 48, Bokeh 39.

[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.480]
Those are the only two that's a runaway.

[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.760]
I mean Hillsboro Beach wasn't going to get any votes or Palm Beach.

[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:40.580]
But these two, they're in a runaway and that's the two horse race.

[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.600]
Lady Mobile in North Miami, hello.

[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:45.520]
Hello.

[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:46.400]
Yes ma'am.

[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.340]
Hi Mew.

[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:47.920]
How are you?

[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.040]
I'm fine.

[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.920]
Oh, I want to vote South Beach.

[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.140]
Yeah.

[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.480]
For the most plastic.

[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:54.140]
Uh huh.

[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.960]
But there's a lot of gays down there too, so you got to consider that also.

[00:52:58.580 --> 00:52:59.780]
Most plastic fags, yeah.

[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.380]
And they go snuff your ass if you walk down there too.

[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.300]
They're going to slap my ass, I don't think so.

[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.220]
Maybe they're going to slap your ass but not mine.

[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.540]
Now you're right, they're probably more likely to slap mine.

[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:11.940]
You'd be right.

[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.320]
Happy 25th anniversary.

[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.020]
Nice we dart.

[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.260]
Happy 20th anniversary.

[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:16.260]

[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:16.780]
Have a happy.

[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:17.600]
You too.

[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.560]
Happy eyes of March.

[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.280]
So that's just a couple days that we got happy St. Patis Day coming too.

[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.940]
That's all those fags up there, March and that parade and piss off those Irish and New York

[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.280]
those bigoted crusty, ugly Irishmen, huh?

[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.880]
They are ugly, boy, the Irish.

[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.900]
What is that?

[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:30.840]
What is that all about?

[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.720]
Is that all that booze?

[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.120]
That British Isles thing.

[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.780]
Ah, there's some good looking brits, believe me.

[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:36.700]
It's totally smile.

[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:37.440]
No.

[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.260]
Yeah, well, there's actually some brits with teeth that I know that's amazing.

[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:43.280]
And then they turn 12.

[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.420]
Now seriously, there are a few good looking British guys.

[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:47.460]
Not too many though, you're right.

[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.460]
They're just, oh, what is it?

[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.220]
That whole British Isles thing and wails and Scotland and they're just something about them, huh?

[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.220]
Our ancestors.

[00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:02.240]
Thank the Lord that we got that mixture in over here that we got a whole bunch of other geeks over here to kind of like inbreed with them.

[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.560]
Because otherwise we, the whole country, we had that 250 million grotesque, ugly, uh, yeah, uh,

[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:12.380]
smarmy people with bad breath and bad teeth and pasty complexion.

[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:19.100]
No, and you know that skin, you know the kind of skin it's like, um, probably like booge has, you know what it's orange here.

[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.700]
I don't want to start picking on boo, but he picks on Hank all the time.

[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:22.480]
So let's pick on boo.

[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:30.120]
No, not just model, but like skin that feels like, um, paste, you know, like onion skin.

[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.180]
It's just real thin.

[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.380]
No, no, you don't know what I'm talking about.

[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.580]
So you haven't touched as much skin as you think you have.

[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.320]
Not guys.

[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.480]
Well, there you go.

[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.760]
How do I describe it?

[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:45.120]
You know, guys with orange hair and I can't those, like, what do you call like freckles on the arms?

[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:51.140]
Like, no, not moves, but like freckled, uh, modeled freckled, uh, and it's their skin is like, uh, ah!

[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.260]
How many of my penis people use this no one to touch them, you know?

[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:56.920]
No, so what's wrong with that?

[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.540]
Oh, and I got to tell you this.

[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:02.220]
This, uh, I know it's getting close to lunch.

[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.040]
You will, you will, you will hold on tight when I tell you this.

[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.940]
So with the track last night, I'm losing my ass.

[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.060]
Made a great comeback though.

[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.140]
Wondup losing $2.50.

[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.020]
It's the happiest loss.

[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.560]
Oh, seriously, I mean, I was losing my ass.

[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:16.900]
Thanks Kevin Wallace.

[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.580]
I'll even say thanks to Terry Kuhr, which I don't say that very often, but nice going to Terry.

[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.380]
I hit a couple of races in Northfield down.

[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.700]
I mean, drivers that haven't been born yet, I was cashed.

[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.940]
All of a sudden I just got hot there.

[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:31.420]
So anyway, we're sitting there, Derek, in the fat rich in myself.

[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.840]
But you just have a great time up there.

[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.260]
In fact, you know, if they ever close down Pompadopark, I will leave.

[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.320]
I hope they keep it open another three and a half years at least, because if they close that place down, I'm leaving.

[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.120]
That's it for me.

[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:50.560]
So fat rich, uh, decides it's time to go visit the magic room, do whatever, whatever bodily punk needs to do to get rid of the 80 pounds of food.

[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.340]
He ate last night.

[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:54.420]
He comes back and sits down, opposite me there at our table.

[00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:02.640]
And I can't help but notice that he is not zip back up his big pantalooning, you know.

[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:10.060]
Now ordinarily, like I'm an ordinary guy that way, like, you know, 180 or even 200 pounds, it would be, you know, just to be as open zipper and you'd say,

[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.140]
you didn't zip up your pant and they were like, oh, you know, like that.

[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:17.620]
But here are these six stomachs protruding out.

[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:23.480]
I wish I could describe it to you know, because I got to know what I snapped and just the zipper was open.

[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.380]
No, all the way open.

[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:26.840]
All the way open.

[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:26.920]
All the way open.

[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:27.260]

[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:27.380]
All the way open.

[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:27.380]

[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:27.840]
All the way open.

[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:27.840]

[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:28.100]
All the way open.

[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:28.100]

[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:28.200]
All the way open.

[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:28.540]

[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:28.540]

[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:29.200]

[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:29.200]

[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.500]
And I was not going to say this enormous, perfect.

[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:35.220]
This enormous, group cluster of puppets is protruding out.

[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.960]
I said rich, you got, oh, yeah, thanks.

[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.840]
And you know, it wasn't a pretty sight.

[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.060]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:42.360]
Hello.

[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:43.700]
Neil.

[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:48.880]
Yes, the JFK murder conspiracy book by the CIA guy.

[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:51.160]
Did I drop out first week?

[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.080]
Yes, sir. Thank you.

[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.500]
Have you had a chance to look at it?

[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:54.160]
No, no.

[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.480]
I'll read it on the plane, like, going vacation.

[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.280]
Well, great. I'll look forward to hearing your comment on it.

[00:56:59.460 --> 00:56:59.680]
Okay.

[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:00.760]
Good day.

[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.740]
Thank you. Good day.

[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:02.620]
Thanks, Chris.

[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.580]
See, the name was Chris.

[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:03.980]
What do I remember?

[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:04.420]
I got to.

[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:10.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless.

[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.520]
This is good. This format.

[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.860]
I don't like having to take all those interruptions.

[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.900]
In fact, we're going to start doing commercial free here on QAM.

[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.740]
Or their mufflights are not.

[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.960]
So how many breaks does that work, too?

[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:21.360]
None.

[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.100]
No. None.

[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.280]
We're not doing any more breaks.

[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:26.740]
We're not doing any more spots.

[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.000]
Just to piss off the water, Nazi.

[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.760]
She got something there, giving me a song to dance with that little dog.

[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:32.880]
You know, that was terrible.

[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:34.000]
Like, I hit the dog last night.

[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.240]
I don't know if it was a guy or woman.

[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.580]
And like I said, I'll give him the benefit of that.

[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.040]
But they knew they must have only hit something.

[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.320]
Because I mean, it was, it was, ah, right in front of me, too.

[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.660]
And I don't want to get making it too graphic.

[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:47.580]
It was even more disgusting than Fat Rich's property.

[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.700]
The car has, the dog is, you know, they missed.

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.140]
You know, and the car is just smashed to hell out of this thing.

[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.980]
And now I'm avoiding it.

[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:59.220]
And of course, it's hitting the street.

[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.420]
It's hitting somebody's boulevard.

[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.420]
And I'm seeing this.

[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.780]
I'm seeing it die in front of me.

[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.520]
I'm saying I'm seeing the look on the face

[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.960]
and the whole mangled mess in front of me.

[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:07.500]
They're on the street.

[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.340]
I had one of those.

[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:11.880]
On a four lane.

[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.180]
The dog is crossing.

[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.800]
And by the way, the guy, the person who hit it never stopped.

[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:16.840]
Never slowed down everything.

[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:20.720]
And play, you know, you can tell in the road if you hit like a paper bag

[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.060]
or if you hit like, you know, a tree limb or something.

[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.340]
But a dog, you know, anything that was moving, you certainly would know.

[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.800]
Never slowed down, never tapped the brake.

[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.060]
Just kept right on going.

[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.140]
They're going to speed off because they don't want the owner to come out.

[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.960]
And then it wasn't a stray or something.

[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:36.840]
This was somebody's pet.

[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.800]
Oh yeah, believe me.

[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:39.620]
A cute little dog.

[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:40.540]
I guess it's pretty in Spanish.

[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.240]
And one second, it's bouncing across.

[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.440]
You know what that happy look like?

[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.360]
They're like little puppies at bouncing across the street.

[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:49.200]
You know, and like one second.

[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:50.000]
Uh-oh.

[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:51.500]
Uh-oh.

[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:52.740]
Uh-oh.

[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:54.720]
And you know what I want to ask?

[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:56.560]
As a dog lover.

[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.980]
And I know it's a waste of time because I can't change people.

[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.120]
Why do you let your dogs run loose?

[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:04.300]
Are you crazy people?

[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.440]
Irresponsible.

[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.900]
Crazy obnoxious.

[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:08.180]
I hate you like poison.

[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.280]
You people who let your schmuck in dogs run loose.

[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:12.760]
I can't stand it.

[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:15.820]
Because you know what?

[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.820]
The dogs that run loose, just like they said in Faso, are the dead dogs.

[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:20.340]
That's right.

[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:21.900]
Isn't it also illegal?

[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:22.660]
Yes.

[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:24.060]
Yes.

[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.620]
Highly illegal.

[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.760]
And of course out there, further west by where I live,

[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.060]
which is not that many blocks west from where this happened.

[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.000]
But you know, like I said, they think they're out in the country

[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.040]
and they got their chickens and their peacocks and their horses.

[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.300]
You know, that's fine.

[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:42.560]
And of course you never saw anybody walk a cat on a leash.

[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:43.440]
And you want to know why?

[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.900]
Because even the people that have cats don't deny it.

[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.840]
But I'm telling you right now, because I know this for a fact.

[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.420]
Even the people that have a cat.

[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:57.440]
In the back of their mind, there's part of them that knows that if their cat is running around and got run over like what I saw yesterday with the dog,

[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.260]
they say, I'll give you one out of shame, you know.

[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.520]
Too bad.

[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.580]
What's for dinner?

[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.580]
But a dog.

[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.900]
You see, you have a different feeling for a dog, hopefully.

[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.620]
So why are you assholes out there letting your dogs run loose?

[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.400]
They are around those people up.

[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.580]
Not the dogs, the owners.

[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.060]
They're around their ass up.

[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.580]
And put them in the pond for about a week.

[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.780]
You know, put them behind bars in the pond.

[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.800]
Throw maybe a little bogey bowl once in a while.

[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.900]
Let them do all their business right on the ground.

[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.120]
You know, kick up their feet to kind of like cover it up with dirt.

[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.420]
Stuff like that.

[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.120]
I hate you people that let your goddamn dogs run loose.

[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:41.060]
Because like I said, the dogs that run loose are the dead dogs.

[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.320]
The dogs that get hit and killed on sunrise, freaking boulevard.

[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:50.200]
Or the dog that got killed by me in plantations several years ago when I lived over on the cul-de-sac that other let bound mint in the guy head.

[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.280]
Dead it and crapped it.

[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.800]
Squashed like a, of course, a mint pin with like, you know, that one way to maybe eight pounds at that point.

[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.600]
You don't let your dogs run loose.

[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.920]
You assholes you.

[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.440]
Almost of course they're very annoying and bark too much.

[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 1.

[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.920]
That's something to think about.

[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.100]
Hey, tiny.

[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.500]
Want to go for a ride on sunrise?

[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, auto-AT&T.

[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:18.520]
And for what?

[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.120]
Hey, tiny.

[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.580]
How about if I rolled down that window over there?

[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.220]
One look outside.

[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:21.580]
Oh!

[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.560]
Tiny didn't lean too far, did he?

[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:25.320]
Uh-oh.

[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:27.760]
Where we gone?

[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.560]
Here's a mobile in Papano.

[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:29.820]
Hello.

[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:30.980]
Hey, Neil.

[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:31.400]
How you doing?

[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.000]
Pretty good, sir.

[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.400]
I cast my vote for South Beach.

[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.080]
South Beach is the winner so far.

[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.380]
It's pulling away as a matter of fact.

[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:42.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and for rides on wireless line.

[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.320]
131 votes so far.

[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.320]
South Beach 63, Boca 48, Coyle Geobles 9,

[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.600]
Corspring 7, Cokin' and Gro 4.

[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:55.140]
Nobody comes close to South Beach or Boca Raton.

[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.940]
They're like in a class...

[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.380]
...by the club.

[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.280]
Two part of the great facts is in the history of this program

[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.200]
from Morris Cullen, who lives on Bayview Drive in Miami.

[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.520]
Dear Mr. Rogers, I'm a 90-year-old Jew.

[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:10.980]
Oh!

[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.660]
And one of the groups that you love to make fun of.

[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:19.080]
I drive a Lincoln town car and I stay in the left lane when I drive since I have my

[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.220]
Estinian Gravice and only see out of one eye.

[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.420]
It gets better.

[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.600]
Maybe I do have some body odor and have a hard time doing daily chores.

[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.600]
I guess when you get all these things happen.

[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.680]
I'm upset that a guy your age will be at old Jew in about 20 years as no respect for a lifestyle.

[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.640]
We try our best inside our old body that has a hard time to work.

[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.700]
Do you want us to kill ourselves to make you happy?

[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.540]
I've made good investments in my lifetime and live very well and have no family.

[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:03.860]
I've made a provision in my will that my lawyer, who is 40 years old, must fulfill in order to receive a $50,000

[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:08.320]
reward. I'll leave him if he fulfills my wish that I've made after listening to you for the past 20 years.

[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.820]
He's been listening to me for 20 years since he was only 70.

[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.300]
In the year 2025, he must find you.

[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.280]
If it takes going to Amsterdam, then he must go.

[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.340]
I've left him an additional expense account for travel.

[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:25.600]
When he finds you, if you're still alive, he must go up to you and say that Morris Cohn thinks you're an old Jewish part

[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.660]
and what are you doing still living? Why don't you kill yourself?

[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:32.260]
At this point, I'll finally be able to rest in peace and get even with you even though it took nearly 20 years.

[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.480]
I guess that the greatest facts in the history of this program, it deserves to be framed.

[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.580]
I'll be waiting for him, Morris. I want to be there with the camcorder.

[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:46.360]
Won't that be great? Now, how about the near 25-25 with Zager and Evans and Schwartz? And Morris will be good too.

[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.860]
This is 560-Q-A-L.

[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.600]
I don't have a clue.

[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.120]
It's a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget.

[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.640]
I throw a darts and a reward to come up with a number of protects reliefs.

[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.400]
In my plan, no one will get relief.

[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.700]
For lower income families, you'll never get ahead.

[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.760]
And this president doesn't care and won't pay.

[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.740]
My attitude is government should stand in the way of families achieving their dreams together.

[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.480]
We will do so.

[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.140]
I hope you'll join me in standing firmly.

[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:19.520]

[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:22.660]
Unrestrain.

[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.300]
Some say might be too big.

[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.760]
Others say it's too small.

[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.520]
I respectfully disagree.

[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.360]
This is just right.

[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:50.960]
Kind of like the porch.

[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:53.560]
It's 1118 at 560, WQ-A-L.

[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.000]
I'm 560-Q-A-L.

[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.960]
I'm 560 on the 18-T and 4-E.

[01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.980]
NHL trading deadline today.

[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:00.500]
Any interest?

[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:00.900]
No.

[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.260]
I mentioned that in the past yesterday and we had a photo call.

[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.260]
I'm talking about hockey.

[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:09.540]
Not only do we have any hockey fans here, but they hate it.

[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:10.540]
They hate it.

[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.880]
They despise it.

[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.840]
Except the guy that wants those tickets and is bringing a stake in shake tomorrow.

[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.340]
My friend Josh, here's a Fort Myers.

[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:18.720]
Hello.

[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.080]
Hey, Niel.

[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:20.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.500]
It's surprising that you were talking about the subject guy who was wanting to talk about it.

[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.000]
What is that?

[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:35.340]
Well, the other day I was driving and a dog pulled out or he ran in front of me and I'd break.

[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:35.960]
Yeah.

[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.820]
And pick up trucks slammed right in the back end of me.

[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.060]
Oh, man, it's a matter.

[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.420]
What about the dog?

[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.320]
Oh, he got hit.

[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.600]
The dog also got hit on top of all of this?

[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:47.880]
Yeah.

[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:48.680]
And got killed?

[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.380]
No, his hip was pretty bad.

[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.380]
I looked around for the.

[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.000]
There was nothing I could do.

[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.180]
But...

[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.960]
Well, how do you know his hip was really bad then?

[01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:58.660]
What does that mean?

[01:05:58.700 --> 01:05:59.320]
Because he was working.

[01:05:59.760 --> 01:05:59.920]
Yeah.

[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.920]
He limped away is what you're saying?

[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.620]
No, he laid there and he was a mess.

[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:10.080]
His hip, I didn't kill him, but I don't want to talk about this.

[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.080]
Oh, wait a minute, you didn't kill him, but...

[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.860]
But I hit his hip.

[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.700]
You hit his hip and he was a mess and he was laying there and then what happened?

[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:18.340]
Did somebody come and take him to the vet?

[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:19.160]
No.

[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.400]
Road kill.

[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:23.280]
I'm lefty.

[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:25.440]
Oh, man, I don't want to talk about this.

[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:25.860]
No, okay.

[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.540]
He had a dream.

[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.140]
Guy and four Myers had a dream that he got a rear-ended.

[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:33.640]
Back on.

[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.240]
I don't think the dog had anything to do with it.

[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:40.240]
560, 560, 05, 560 on the AT&T and four irons and one of those lines.

[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.400]
We understand that you have some serious mental problems over there, sir.

[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.600]
We've been in four Myers.

[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:45.100]
We understand.

[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.040]
We can relate to it.

[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.940]
What's that other place where they are?

[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.460]
We're living through there.

[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.460]
All of those places.

[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.200]
Port Charlotte.

[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:54.740]
Wow.

[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.680]
The West Coast of Florida.

[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.400]
That is a place.

[01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.920]
It is a place.

[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.180]
It is a space.

[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.700]
Pick up trucks.

[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.880]
Really, on the usual, I would get in the rear-ended by a pickup truck, too.

[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.080]
Even if that story would have been true.

[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.860]
560, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.320]
Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.360]
158 votes on our plastic contest here today.

[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:23.140]
Which of these parts of South Florida, which town, which city, which berg is the most plastic?

[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.240]
South beat 78.

[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.340]
Boca 56.

[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.480]
Gables 11.

[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.440]
Cross Springs 8.

[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.400]
The Grove only 5.

[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.380]
See the Grove years ago.

[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:37.780]
But now there are so many schwarzes, even though they keep them all on the other side of the railroad tracks here.

[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.340]
That would be a good survey.

[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.120]
We'll take one day.

[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.000]
Which city in the South Florida is the most eerie atric?

[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.740]
That would be tough.

[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.920]
Once upon a time, I knew Beach could have one hands down.

[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:50.520]
Not anymore.

[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.780]
And that's until those plastic punks invaded South Beach.

[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.620]
Now it's not like, you know, Helen Dale, Sunrise, Tamarack, Surfside.

[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.000]
Avatar.

[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:00.700]
Oi!

[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.360]
See, the Avatar's not plastic.

[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:02.880]
It's old.

[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.480]
It's old Jews with a lot of money.

[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.680]
You better know your old Jews, mister, because you sure don't.

[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.740]

[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:04.800]
uh... morning yes sir yeah i was just mentioning the other day robert deval i could watch him act all day

[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:10.000]
and all night i mean that even in bad movies that he's done he is just he's unbelievable i never

[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.620]
saw that movie where he played the preacher the apostle unbelievable performance he wrote it you

[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:19.180]
know he couldn't get that movie done really and because it was it was kind of controversial in

[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:25.640]
terms of the way it portrayed religion exactly and uh and the huckster nature of it and and you

[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:30.820]
know he exposed the whole thing of it but his acting and it was just absolutely unbelievable that

[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:34.960]
you know poor christian to work the biggest hucksters stockbrokers are religion peddlers

[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:39.420]
the big of that i was wondering you know i would hope michael's like annoyed you because he

[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:43.700]
he was actually saying i need to make a living you know like quick read no he didn't say that but i

[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:48.000]
could tell the side of his voice that he was really was really wounded and hurt and irritated like

[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.740]
uh... you know i mean here we are four hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a whole later give her

[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:55.480]
take whatever the whole is at this point and he acts like uh jeez you know you're up in the

[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:59.680]
you know he didn't really say that but i i could tell we can only and and you know that's the

[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:04.120]
see here's the guy he took a chance you know he was told right up front if he's going to take my

[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:07.700]
money i'm on the air i'm one of those guys with a big mouth right if you do me a good job i'll

[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:11.680]
sing your praises from now really at the time but if you do a bad job if things go south and

[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.600]
whatever the hell happened uh i'm going to rip you an ass and i do i rip them every single day and

[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.020]
deserve it least so i haven't said anything that's untrue i've given my honest a normalization of

[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:24.660]
what he's done with so far i see nothing but disaster anybody who's been a professional salesman

[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:28.040]
that the prestige accounts are always wonderful to have because you can post your name on them

[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:32.420]
when you when things go right right things go wrong that's right you sometimes that sometimes you

[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:36.440]
look at it and you say oh my gosh i can make so much but you have to you know they always talk

[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.260]
about wearing the risk and wearing the benefit well as a salesperson you have to weigh that risk

[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:44.960]
as well because if you screw up yeah that's your name and you know you can walk back into that

[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:49.460]
place but say you know so i'm here for for me to call him as i've done many times the last few

[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:53.140]
months in here to say well you know i'm not happy either i'm not happy and like i told him a

[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:56.880]
few days ago i really don't care whether you're happy it's my money not yours in other words

[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:00.640]
i'm the client he's the one that's supposed to be the big shot i don't care whether he's happy

[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.980]
he's supposed to be considered whether i'm happy and guess what i ain't

[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:06.960]
the audible thing would have been for him to come in and say you know i can't really maybe

[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.040]
i just have to write personal maybe this isn't the right time or whatever but i've never he's

[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.380]
never said that you see that and and i understand there's an ego driven aspect behind it where you

[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:20.180]
don't want to admit you know if you're good but you can only imagine my amazement where i'm saving

[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:24.180]
a single take home of me when i look at this uh... treatment of all three children i look at first

[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:29.580]
union securities and i look at their miserable horror or i just wrote test performance

[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:33.460]
compared to every single one of the all these other people which means that he might be in a bad

[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:38.100]
place to the people about him given him we've got no i don't think so okay look at the

[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:44.680]
plastic places what about parkland now is it big enough parkland yeah i highly that there how could

[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:50.920]
that be plastic that's the yahu no i know other people that are there and it's kind of like

[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:56.780]
it's taken call springs to trying to take a call springs to even a more elite stature so

[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:01.660]
you know i'm wondering if i don't know you know you think the yahu but again you know if it's

[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:09.080]
rich riley let's face it yahu not to you never call him plastic redneck yahu right wing but

[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.920]
term that plastic but that the law on the whole springs i got to be honest with the

[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.440]
corals brings i uh... i don't like

[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:22.300]
i don't like i mean you know it's glitzy and it's uh... new and it's uh... upscale but there's

[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:26.080]
just i've never looked at this i've been about corals brings that i have a step

[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:29.460]
where wise definitely live there i don't like it well you know in west i look at

[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:32.440]
the rest and you know i move relook at it and you're right and admittedly it's

[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.480]
somewhat fascist in the way the funniest thing is the property management people

[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:37.600]
there's one guy who's like the property management not to you

[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.140]
let's put the note in your door that your mailbox needs to be painted or you need to be

[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.920]
steamed cleaned or you need to check your lawn because it's not brought green enough for whatever

[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:51.100]
but he's got a absolutely two pack a day habitual smoking problem okay and now that

[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:56.400]
they're going with the outlaw of smoking out here and i just see him whenever he gets outside

[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:01.440]
of the confines of west and he's smoking him three at a time yeah that's yeah you know and so he's

[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.960]
doing that oh there's a big election here west i say and oh that's right the election today

[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.020]
everybody go out there and vote all tenia you don't yeah i'm glad you mentioned that

[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:12.540]
because i keep forgetting to talk about this the last several days at least by me around plantation

[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:17.740]
i see these silly people on street corners and they've got the signs of the names of the candidates

[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:21.680]
and i have already turned up my voter registration code i wouldn't waste my time anyway voting in

[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:26.780]
you know and plantation election vocals election but they're and they're waving and nobody has

[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:31.320]
paying the attention to them i mean nobody i'm thinking to myself what are you assholes doing

[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.200]
out here on the street corner what do you think you're going to get out of it yeah what kind of

[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:40.320]
experience is this way you've been there waving and they're like they're all and i'm taking what nobody

[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.620]
you can tell nobody is paying the slightest bit of attention to them well here in west and i was

[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.320]
looking at all the names and being Jewish myself i just saying you know it looks to me it's either

[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.500]
six or half time and we get one Jew or another regardless of what's going on so there you go the same

[01:24:52.500 --> 01:25:01.020]
deal so good day and good day your caller about johnny ola is wrong now see this this fact she didn't

[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:04.040]
understand what he was saying it was played by dominant uh...

[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.740]
chian asi who also plays uncle jr. m. is a plan us that's what it says here why you give me a look

[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.480]
because of what you said the guy got the statement wrong

[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:16.520]
yeah now he didn't say that the guy who just croaked a play to me said that that was the

[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.340]
character that uh...

[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.300]
dominant quizz plan

[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.600]
dominant pavia

[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:27.980]
five six seven o five sixty let's see that this uh... story starts with my thirty year old wives partial

[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:32.260]
discrimal it was about four months after the operation chief on herself going about fifteen to twenty

[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:36.240]
miles an hour down our street on her way home just as she was about to pull in a rock while there

[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.560]
was being chased by another dog ran from behind my park jeep

[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:44.900]
my wife break quickly yet still hit the dog this is a dog that we like a lot and in a limp

[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:47.540]
away yelping my wife got out to try and help it

[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:51.500]
after her walking it back to the neighbors how she was greeted at the door by the wife of the

[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:55.600]
dogs owner the look on the wife's face was classic and read you hurt my dog

[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:00.620]
everyone was upset we had to run the dog to a vet that kept the dog for three days in charge seven

[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.840]
hundred bucks the good news is the dog is fine here's the problem

[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:09.860]
we split the bill and there's the weeks passed afterwards we regretted doing so we've learned our

[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.440]
lesson dog owners who let their dogs run free are responsible for the dogs getting hit

[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.200]
and if someone doesn't care don't be surprised when you told your dog was hit and killed by a car

[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:24.160]
p.s thankfully my wife's back was only sore for a few days in the sudden trauma but the point

[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.620]
is not only are they endangering their dogs life they're endangering the lives of others as well

[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:34.440]
sincerely Cuban rafter how do you like that yeah you people out there that are letting your dogs

[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.880]
run loose you're pushing off the rest of us too that just i mean i already had a horrible crap

[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.180]
as day yesterday right up until i've pointed about a quarter of those six but then i haven't

[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:48.600]

mobile in four-lawterdale hello hey Neil yes sir you know i'm great anyway uh interesting thing about

[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:41.760]
two years ago i was reading the Wall Street Journal right and they were interviewing a Warren Buffett

[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:47.140]
and they asked Warren Buffett how much you think these internet stocks are worth

[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:54.280]
so a NASDAQ and he said well if i was a college professor i would ask my graduating class one

[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.880]
question yeah final exam what our internet stocks were and they go what would be the answer

[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:05.600]
he said well they put anything down but i don't know i failed yeah and i'd listen to that advice

[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.560]
and my friend said uh if you're only making twenty if you're not making twenty five percent of

[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:16.880]
you on your money uh your loser yeah and i stayed with the blue chip stuff and uh you know i'm

[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:23.260]

okay let me say it again investing has nothing to do with the stock market let me say it again very

[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:11.800]
very clearly very carefully very loudly very articulately investing means putting it in something

[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:16.840]
that is guaranteed that's an investment putting it in the bank at two percent putting it in

[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:21.100]
money market at five percent putting it at cd six and a half seven seven and a half percent

[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:26.040]
whatever i didn't get putting in something that they fixed guaranteed rate cannot lose

[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:31.840]

a companion that's fine i can understand that i will not chastise you for it that's great

[01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:00.520]
all the little dog would be i see all our dog requires a lot more work cats are like a independent

[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:04.460]
you put the litter box out there if you don't care that it stinks up your whole apartment or whatever

[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:12.160]
but cats are you know relatively self-sufficient they got bad diarrhea in the litter box you know

[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:18.860]
if they puke their guts out in the litter box but anybody besides old ladies who has a cat i have

[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:22.980]
to raise like all my eyebrows when i hear about that because i i wonder about people like that

[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:32.820]
i wonder if moth has a cat you think you thing moth has a kitty cat

[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:44.540]
9 minutes after noon at 5 60 wk wqa m i think we already know the answer that don't we

[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:50.080]
Oh, oh, God.

[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.440]
See, you started this.

[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:53.900]
You started it.

[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:54.940]
Don't know what you're talking about.

[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.620]
Yeah, you started this whole muff business.

[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.320]
It's really heavy.

[01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.060]
I've got a word for that.

[01:47:58.300 --> 01:47:58.840]
Don't pay to.

[01:47:59.000 --> 01:47:59.160]
Yeah.

[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:00.340]
Terrible.

[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:02.720]
Here's a mobile and call spring.

[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.080]
Hello.

[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:04.600]
Yeah, okay, so.

[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:05.120]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:06.180]
Yes, it is.

[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:09.240]
I'm going to make your merger rumor with Gear Access Point.

[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:09.640]
Yeah.

[01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.900]
Gear Ox with where it's at.

[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:13.380]
Yeah.

[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:16.200]
Yeah, they're going to create a organ copier.

[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:16.760]
Uh-huh.

[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:18.460]
But hopefully.

[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:19.540]
Maybe they can help you out.

[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:20.440]
Obviously, you need it.

[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:22.900]
Pretty bad material.

[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:24.060]
I think the other guy was right.

[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:26.220]
Yeah, that's talked about doing the music stuff again.

[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:27.600]
I think your rights are they're out of material.

[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:28.360]
We're pretty weak.

[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:32.080]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:34.180]
And Verizon Wireless Line attached.

[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:34.980]
We don't have that in there.

[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:37.040]
Do we have that Morton down in the junior pit?

[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:38.180]
Which one?

[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:38.840]
Which CD?

[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:39.840]
What do you mean which one?

[01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:43.500]
The one that's on what about best of CDs?

[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:45.800]
What's it sound like?

[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.360]
Sounds like some little kid screaming in your mouth.

[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:50.060]
Oh, that's right.

[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:52.800]
Young Mortoni or something like that.

[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:53.640]
Is that what it is?

[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:54.820]
I'll find something like that.

[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.380]
Morton Downey Jr.'s dead.

[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:56.940]
Boy!

[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:58.440]
Where'd you find that out?

[01:48:58.940 --> 01:48:59.580]
Couple colors.

[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:00.580]
Oh, boy.

[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.000]
Probably all that smoking didn't help you.

[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:05.760]
Oh, see those people in the West and they may have the right idea.

[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:06.680]
No smoking or cigarette.

[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:09.260]
Probably God punishing them for all those real estate scams that he pulled.

[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:11.280]
No, I think probably for all those bad TV shows.

[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:14.620]
That could be it.

[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:16.680]
Wasn't that show.

[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:17.340]
Wasn't he down here?

[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.480]
He was down here, I thought.

[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:19.080]
I thought, I was down here.

[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.960]
You're trying to recreate the event something, you know.

[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.580]
Trying to become another Jackie Mason.

[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:26.220]
Oh.

[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:27.020]
Well, he did.

[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:28.880]
But anyway, Morton Downey Jr.'s dead.

[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.140]
So that's either good news or bad news whether you liked him or not.

[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:33.720]
Or maybe in different news depending on whether you didn't even know who the hell he was.

[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.480]
Which is possible.

[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:43.040]
16,000 open lines on the board here and we're having ourselves a pretty damn good day today considering 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:46.820]
Pound 5 60 on the AT&T InfoWisement Wireless Line.

[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.800]
The outer town line is open now that we're off the earth this hour and four miles.

[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:52.380]
Maybe it's people from some like real place can call them on that thing.

[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:56.100]
877-785-6345.

[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.140]
North Miami, hello.

[01:49:59.480 --> 01:49:59.880]
Hey, Dale.

[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:00.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:01.800]
Yeah, he was down here for a while.

[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:02.280]
Yeah.

[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.480]
All the crap find its way down here eventually.

[01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:04.980]
Uh-huh.

[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:05.540]
Anyway.

[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:07.200]
You know, I've got here.

[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:12.660]
You know, you were mentioning the other day North Miami Beach and how it's changed for the worst.

[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:13.940]
Remember?

[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:14.360]
Yeah.

[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:15.880]
You know, and I've changed for the worst.

[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:16.560]
Of course.

[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:18.580]
Jesus God, it's the end of the world.

[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:19.540]
The end of the world, right?

[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:21.700]
I'm stuck here working here all the time, right?

[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:23.600]
And you're talking about dogs.

[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:27.080]
The people here, I have to go to the neighbor, it's on my way to work.

[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:31.140]
The people here keep dogs and they're fun lawn as a lawn system.

[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:37.240]
They're just sitting there, you know, day to day in the seat and the cold is disgusting.

[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:44.140]
I can't tell you how many dogs I've rescued from the street that have escaped with, uh, not off ropes and collars.

[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:49.900]
You know, just, you know, you brought up the subject, I'm just telling you.

[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:58.380]
Well, I mean, if it's very easy to say, you know, if you're going to have a pet be responsible, but the problem is, as I say, if you're going to have kids be responsible and people aren't even responsible about that.

[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:58.760]
Exactly.

[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.160]
How would we expect them to be responsible about having a dog?

[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:07.260]
Well, if human life is, you know, like these assholes with their pit bulls, you know, that are out there busy killing kids all the time.

[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:07.700]
Right.

[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.020]
It's a pathetic situation.

[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:16.040]
You know, I have one of the dogs I own is from the street, the most wonderful dog I've ever had in my life.

[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:20.920]
And it's, you know, it's, it just breaks my heart because, you know, you see them either killed.

[01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:26.720]
And then he tops it off the, you know, it was the top of the cake because today there's a dead pig on the side of the road.

[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:27.280]
Really?

[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:27.580]
Yeah.

[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:30.020]
Oh my God. I guess Rosie won't be on today.

[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:33.460]
I mean, that's, but that shows you what the influence of an neighborhood is like.

[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:34.400]
What can you imagine this?

[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.120]
A dead pig on the side of the road.

[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:39.800]
A dead miniature black pig, you know, like a little hot belly pig.

[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:40.340]
Huh.

[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:43.980]
Probably ready for a temptation island part two.

[01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:44.420]
Right.

[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:45.540]
Okay. Thanks for the good.

[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:46.420]
Thanks. Thanks.

[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:47.460]
Or that's your fiber.

[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:48.860]
One of those bogus awful shows.

[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:49.160]
Yeah.

[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:51.000]
One of those pseudo reality shows.

[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.120]
How is the pool coming?

[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.240]
And 369 votes.

[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.700]
Which of these areas in South Florida is most plastic?

[01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:57.340]
Strictly a tour.

[01:51:57.500 --> 01:51:58.260]
It's a one horse race.

[01:51:58.260 --> 01:51:59.660]
Really. South Beach is pulling away.

[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:00.420]
137.

[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.420]
Bogus given it a battle.

[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:08.160]
90, uh, six, crawlgable 16, crawl springs 13, and the grove only, uh, seven.

[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.780]
Hey kids, Saturday mornings right after P.W. Irvin.

[01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:14.840]
Don't miss the tiny terror of television talk.

[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.020]
Today we're talking about parents who selflessed grandma's house.

[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.200]
And I'm sick of it.

[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:24.620]
Come on.

[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:27.480]
It's the Junior Morton Downey show.

[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:32.340]
So, Granny, where those cookies are on us, me, huh?

[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.220]
Well, more to the end.

[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:35.800]
I didn't have time.

[01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:39.060]
Oh, these have time for my cooking.

[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:42.000]
Look how you're way into the sand.

[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:46.300]
But you had plenty of time to tie your hair blue, didn't you?

[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:47.160]
Huh?

[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:50.580]
He's challenge. He's immature.

[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:52.620]
He's spoiled, Raton.

[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:53.780]
He's now more.

[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:54.980]
Who knows your father?

[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:57.080]
I think you should apologize to your grandma.

[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:01.040]
Oh, now get a load of this pillow and cooking, Zimbrow with.

[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:03.180]
Zimbing, dad, zipping.

[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:05.000]
You want to get out of here?

[01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:06.440]
You want to get out of here?

[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:07.820]
You want to get out of here?

[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:08.000]
You want to get out of here?

[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.820]
Well, the tempered kids from talk show host you want to spank.

[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.600]
And don't try to tell me off too often.

[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:17.500]
You want to be sucking on my task of fire?

[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:19.980]
All stuff I am talking about is what?

[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.560]
Because this is America.

[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.940]
And talk for the pollution.

[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:25.540]
Filthy, comies, flag.

[01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:27.720]
All stuff is much about what?

[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:30.720]
Yes, he really sucks.

[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:31.540]
What?

[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:34.000]
Please, Junior, Morton Downey.

[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.400]
Well, they won't be sucking anymore, he's dead.

[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:39.940]
Morton Downey, Junior, dead.

[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.320]
From 19 to 560, WQA, you know, the person on TV that irritates me more than anybody,

[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.840]
not Jerry Springer, like a lot of you might be thinking.

[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:50.800]
Not $170 like most of you are thinking.

[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:53.280]
No, not Ron Pupio.

[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.740]
The person who I find the most offensive of anybody on television I did,

[01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:01.300]
and the whole stick, the whole ambiance just makes me want to scream.

[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.000]
I'm one of your favorite channels, even though you don't watch the programs.

[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:05.980]
You only watch one show.

[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:08.160]
On the food channel.

[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:08.700]
Emerald.

[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:09.440]
Emerald.

[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.100]
Very good.

[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:17.480]
I'm not nearly as much disturbed by him as I am by the people in that audience and by the reaction.

[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.760]
I mean, he's just a turd is what he is.

[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:24.860]
You know, just a crude, and then somebody get all upset because he's not from New York,

[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:26.260]
he's from somewhere in New England or what?

[01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:28.920]
Well, I don't know where he's from, hunger.

[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:33.880]
But I mean, anything that anybody might have ever found disturbing about the Northeast

[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:36.740]
is all wrapped up in one tummy package and that's Emerald.

[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.100]
You can smell the essence of all the way over here.

[01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:42.460]
And I do like some of the shows on food channel because I'm like you,

[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:43.860]
which only watch the Iron Chair for Jeff.

[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.460]
No interest in.

[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:48.060]
I do enjoy watching like Malt from Mario or is it multi-mario?

[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:49.340]
Whatever that spot we have said.

[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.800]
But every time you turn on a food channel and you're desperately channel surfing,

[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:55.420]
he's on there.

[01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:02.120]
Live, he's dead, he's in between, he's a lukewarm, he's a medium rare Emerald.

[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:04.680]
Within seconds, I want to kill him.

[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:06.760]
See, this is the new deal on television.

[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:09.060]
And I noticed that CNN, which is just desperate.

[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.060]
See, they've got like four people on all day.

[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:18.180]
They've got Abraham Brown and Roger Cossack and Wolf Blitzkrieg and the Kingmice.

[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:20.560]
They're, uh, him and that's it.

[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:24.640]
And in around the newscast, they've got, and also a Bill Press and the guy with a vote tie

[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.320]
that's right wing panzy.

[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:27.560]
And that's it.

[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:29.460]
Everyone over and over again.

[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.900]
If a little bit is good, then tons of the same crap is better.

[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:33.720]
That's TV now.

[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.540]
The essence of Emerald.

[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:41.940]
Fam, fam, fam, and the audience is like an affronty like, he must be putting something in the brownies, you know?

[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.480]
He must be spiking it with something really good.

[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.640]
Because that audience is forming it to mouth.

[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.680]
He could be boiling the goddamn egg.

[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.640]
He could be boiling water to make pasta.

[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:55.040]
And the audience, ah, ah, they're like hysterical, they're rabid.

[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:00.600]
All about, ah, it's about luck is what it's about.

[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:02.960]
I was going to say showmanship because he's not even a good showman.

[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:04.100]
He's just a crap.

[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.120]
He's just a crude, and those people know something about making a meal,

[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:09.560]
about the, like, a boiling an egg.

[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:11.940]
They say he couldn't cook his weight of a paper sack.

[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:13.920]
How do you like that?

[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:18.900]
Don Courier.

[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:25.040]
560, 0560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:26.740]
Chris Boring.

[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.500]
Here's Crippercity. Hello?

[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:31.420]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:35.480]
Do you want to okay, ah, well, to stop off Morton Downey?

[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:35.760]
Yeah.

[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:36.300]
I'm going to love this.

[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:37.720]
Jody Jameson.

[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:39.940]
Uh, where, now where did you get that?

[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:42.020]
I've got a list online.

[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:43.440]
Oh, you've got a list online.

[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.540]
Great. He's got a list of harness drivers on there.

[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:46.000]
Okay.

[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:47.860]
Rayn Plain Jr.

[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:50.080]
Well, you know, Morton Downey, he did.

[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:51.400]
Let's see, a number of perfect...

[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:52.040]
Landy Waples.

[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:53.440]
Business man, a father.

[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:54.660]
A radio offer.

[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:57.440]
Yeah, you got all the flamboyant downdrivers on there.

[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:58.380]
Get that off of there.

[01:56:58.460 --> 01:56:58.980]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:01.400]
Singer, songwriter, and guitarist.

[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.560]
You're going to love this meal.

[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:07.000]
You can pose such surf rock songs as Pipeline.

[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.780]
He's on your other standy park camera, huh?

[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:09.340]
Huh?

[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:10.120]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:12.140]
Pipeline and wipe out your eyes.

[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:12.820]
Mark Miggins.

[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:13.980]
Yeah.

[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:15.980]
I've got to always love being abused by you, Neil.

[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:17.780]
I'm not paying any attention because I'm talking to you.

[01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:18.080]
I know.

[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:20.540]
Well, because if I needed to manage...

[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:23.140]
George went on the computer and he filed a list of harness racing drivers

[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:24.580]
and I was spewing out names here.

[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:25.920]
How about Carl Jameson?

[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:27.560]
How about Kelly Shepherd?

[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.200]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:31.240]
Uh, the voting going on?

[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:32.240]
Voting for what?

[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:34.220]
Uh, you know, all the towns with their voting.

[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:38.440]
Right after you said it sucks, you shouldn't do it, whatever, you know, all ten people.

[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:40.920]
I decided to become one of the ten in Cooper City.

[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:41.300]
Yeah.

[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:44.320]
Go in there, the ballot has one thing on it.

[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:46.040]
Two people, one thing.

[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:47.900]
How much money did that cost the city?

[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.680]
I have no idea, but at least they're doing something constructive over there.

[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:51.020]
That's good.

[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:51.940]
Cooper City.

[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.660]
One damn kind of a marginal, kind of a marginal place.

[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:56.760]
Wouldn't you agree Cooper City?

[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:59.780]
It's like between Hollywood and Pembroke Lakes and this...

[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:01.220]
It's not where there's really no such place.

[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:02.300]
It's like that farm...

[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.780]
You know what it really is?

[01:58:03.860 --> 01:58:04.660]
It's the farm store.

[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.320]
There on the corner of Stirling and whatever that is, Palmer Farm Store.

[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:09.480]
That's Cooper City.

[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:10.140]
Yeah.

[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:11.920]
Not so much anymore.

[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:12.880]
And Cooper City High.

[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.820]
Cooper City High, where the best grass is bought.

[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:17.860]
That's right, a lot of nice white kids are too.

[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:21.860]
Well, they're not so white as you think, Neil.

[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:22.520]
Not anymore?

[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:24.860]
No, there's still physically white.

[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:26.080]
I just don't act white.

[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:26.320]
Oh.

[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:29.680]
You can't get past Jewish gangster.

[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:30.420]
Uh-huh.

[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:31.840]
The worst, the worst.

[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:34.480]
Okay, well whatever you said it was great and have a great day.

[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.300]
Fight me, bye-bye.

[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:38.540]
So now you've got this list.

[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:39.640]
What is this?

[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:44.180]
It's the USTA top 20 drivers by Wins as of 3301.

[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:47.100]
Jody Jamison is on that list?

[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:48.560]
Yeah, number 19.

[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:49.600]
No.

[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.220]
You could knock myself out.

[01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:52.520]
I bet your Randy Wapels is on there.

[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:53.220]
How many seven wins?

[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:55.040]
How many Randy Wapels got?

[01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:57.140]
94.

[01:58:57.580 --> 01:58:57.820]
Uh-huh.

[01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:58.220]
Number six.

[01:58:58.260 --> 01:58:59.280]
No, don't tell me any other names.

[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.520]
Actually, I print this or I would.

[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:01.880]
Let me connect it to you.

[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:02.520]
Let me guess the name.

[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:04.020]
Kevin Wallace is certainly on there.

[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:07.280]
No.

[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:09.440]
It's not alphabetical so I have to actually read.

[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:09.880]
No.

[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:10.020]

[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:11.740]
Kevin Wallace is not on that list.

[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:14.420]
Kevin, by the way, is on the verge of a 6000 career win.

[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:16.520]
Nice go, Kevin Wallace, baby.

[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:17.580]
He's our man.

[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:18.220]
He's our hero.

[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:19.160]
Kevin Wallace is God.

[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.860]
I said that at Pompadopark years ago.

[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:22.760]
This man's talking harness racing drivers.

[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:23.900]
God, David, is he crazy?

[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:25.060]
No, I'm having a good time.

[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:26.100]
And even George is getting into it.

[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:27.860]
So who's number one with 165 wins?

[01:59:28.740 --> 01:59:29.080]
165.

[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.260]
How about Tony Morgan?

[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:32.100]
Dave Polone.

[01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:32.900]
Nope.

[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:34.000]
Dave Polone's not on the list.

[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:36.320]
Number 18 with 77.

[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:39.480]
165 wins, Walter Case.

[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.420]
No, Walter's in second place with 148.

[01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:42.980]
Yeah.

[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:47.120]
Somebody has 165 wins.

[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:48.940]
Now, what does it do?

[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:49.860]
You just have a name in a number.

[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:50.740]
Doesn't say where they are.

[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:51.200]
Anything else?

[01:59:51.660 --> 01:59:51.820]
No.

[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.460]
Name in a number in one of the initials.

[01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:55.020]
Who?

[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:56.020]
The initials.

[01:59:57.620 --> 01:59:58.860]
First name initials.

[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.280]
S.

[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.260]
Stand Major.

[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:04.060]
Close.

[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:06.360]
You got an-

[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.260]
First two initials.

[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:08.880]
Steve.

[02:00:10.140 --> 02:00:10.320]
Close.

[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:11.800]
Not exactly a Steve.

[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:12.480]
Stefan Bouchard.

[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:12.860]
Yes.

[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:15.680]
Stefan Bouchard has got 175 wins.

[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.180]
He used to drive-

[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:18.580]
He used to drive down here, Pompadopark.

[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:19.200]
How do you like that?

[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:20.440]
Stefan Bouchard, that frog.

[02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:21.660]
Wow.

[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:24.340]
Driving at Yantrie's, those donkey races.

[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:25.700]
See, that was pretty good, huh?

[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:27.360]
Now, bad.

[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:27.900]
Yeah.

[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:30.620]
Now, how many of the other top ones that I give you right there?

[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:31.440]
How about Cat Man's?

[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.740]
You see on the list, how about Lucoulette?

[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:34.700]
Cat Man's, these numbers seven with 93 wins.

[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:35.340]
And Lucoulette?

[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:40.360]
Or you, E-L-E-T-T-E right after him, number eight with 90?

[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:40.940]
There you go.

[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:42.380]
See, does this man know his craft?

[02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:42.740]
Yeah.

[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:44.960]
I know it, baby.

[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:46.100]
And here's Comedale.

[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:46.980]
I would never have found it.

[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:47.440]
Oh.

[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.420]
How about Michelle Ashan's?

[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:52.120]
Michael Chans.

[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:53.400]
Not on there?

[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:55.940]
No.

[02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:56.720]
George Brennan?

[02:00:57.340 --> 02:00:57.740]
No.

[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:58.480]
No.

[02:00:58.960 --> 02:00:59.120]
No?

[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:00.120]
Huh.

[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:01.140]
Howard Pocca?

[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.000]
No.

[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:03.320]
No.

[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:07.120]
26th afternoon at 560 WDQA MF-I-

[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:07.680]
F-O-S.

[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.400]
F-O-S.

[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:10.180]
Oh, there's the board.

[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:11.460]
Not on there at the second.

[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:14.080]
Bobby Hall, race at Maris Kuhl.

[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:16.100]
George Gimblerson, you mean this?

[02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.220]
I'm not gonna hit him, Toddler.

[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.400]
Like, go on my pants.

[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:22.020]
George Gimblerson, I'm gonna down there, Miguel.

[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.780]
And the late Joe Flynn.

[02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:27.300]
They're all back in the United States, maybe.

[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:27.860]
It's good.

[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:28.560]
What is the crew?

[02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:29.820]
Take a look at it.

[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:30.480]
How many of that?

[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:31.580]
I can think of Ivan Glob.

[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:32.160]
Who is it?

[02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:32.740]
That's it.

[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:33.540]
Make it just a two-year-old.

[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:34.280]
We don't have time.

[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:36.860]
What was that?

[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:39.320]
Everybody on deck.

[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:42.620]
Hold it, Kyle.

[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:44.040]
Listen to all that.

[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:44.680]
Hey, Jeff.

[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:46.180]
Man, here we come.

[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:47.580]
You know now.

[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:48.280]
Half minute.

[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:49.040]
Looks like you.

[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:50.780]
We have a Japanese station both you have.

[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:52.480]
You're relieved that don't you?

[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:54.020]
Yeah, but I'm very tired, Kyle.

[02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:58.240]
But you're through this time of the day.

[02:01:58.680 --> 02:01:59.680]
I'm very, very glad you're here.

[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.780]
And you thought it was just an old TV show.

[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.840]
Laugh a lot with the United States Navy.

[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.120]
And the rest of the Bush administration.

[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:10.940]
Meet Green, you this Friday.

[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:12.640]
In the White House Freefield.

[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:15.060]
Yeah, there are a bundle of laughs, man.

[02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:17.100]
12, 30, 5, 60, WDQM.

[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:18.720]
So we talked just a few harness racing names.

[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:20.380]
And right away most of the lines were opened up again.

[02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:23.120]
Now, gee, say you folks out there, you just,

[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.040]
I don't know what it is about this town.

[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:27.720]
They're so intractable and they moveable.

[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:29.020]
Even George is getting into it now.

[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:30.300]
He don't know who any of these people are.

[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.300]
But it's just, you know, something and I'm practicing to be an old fart.

[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:34.760]
Exactly.

[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.060]
It's something different.

[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:38.420]
He can go get his program and sit up there.

[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:41.040]
And like we did on Saturday, we do a double header.

[02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:42.280]
Sock up a free meal.

[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:43.440]
As soon as I talk about it.

[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:44.720]
I think Fat Stogie up there.

[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:45.860]
Get a free meal at the track.

[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:47.140]
I think you got the right idea.

[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:47.840]
Get that out there.

[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:49.060]
You got an edit split layer cake.

[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:49.460]
Put it here.

[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:50.060]
Good stuff too.

[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:50.860]
Oh, god.

[02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:51.900]
Why am I eating that?

[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:55.440]
They have an edit split layer cake with cream or other with strawberries.

[02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:59.160]
Not if I thought I'm thinking of following Fat Rich around while he does the tout rounds.

[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:00.560]
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:02.260]
Learn how it's done.

[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:03.820]
16,000 open lines here.

[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:07.460]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:09.140]
And Verizon wireless line.

[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.640]
Oh, this is going to be a four-letter deal.

[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:11.860]
Hello.

[02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:13.060]
Meal?

[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:13.580]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.140]
Second time caller.

[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:15.680]
Okay.

[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:16.360]
How are you?

[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:20.140]
You were talking about Emerald being from Weir Boston.

[02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:21.400]
That's what they tell us, yes.

[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:22.560]
He's from Providence.

[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:23.800]
Oh, that's even worse.

[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:24.740]
Yeah, I know it is.

[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:32.400]
You know that the second worst talk show person on television, literally the worst.

[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:32.900]
Yes.

[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.400]
Larry King.

[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:35.160]
Yeah.

[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:36.820]
Worst.

[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:39.380]
The best ass talker though.

[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:41.200]
The best ass liquor.

[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:42.220]
Yeah, really.

[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:44.660]
He never met a cheeky wooden liquor.

[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:46.340]
It's a bad ass liquor.

[02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:46.960]
How we got there?

[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:47.480]
Sure.

[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:48.460]
Really.

[02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:49.400]
And he's still doing it.

[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:50.300]
I can believe.

[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:52.020]
Even if Hitler on there, he'd be kissing his ass.

[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:52.660]
I can believe.

[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:52.960]
Right.

[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:55.180]
Does he know everybody that he says he knows?

[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.380]
He's the biggest name dropper since what's his name?

[02:03:58.400 --> 02:03:58.960]
Hey, stupid.

[02:03:59.120 --> 02:03:59.240]
Right.

[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:00.120]
Since God.

[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:00.760]
Exactly.

[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:01.940]
Okay, I have a rate, sir.

[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:02.660]
Wow.

[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.800]
5, we've got 8 million open lines here.

[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:07.640]
Look at that.

[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:08.600]
Elmer Conrad.

[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:11.800]
No, you won't find him on there.

[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:12.680]
Oh, he had a whole dead.

[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:13.780]
Hold on, dead.

[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:16.320]
Your friend Chris Christoffer's under whatever the whole thing.

[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:16.840]
He's off a room.

[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:18.320]
He's on the list of top earners.

[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:19.660]
Oh, earnings.

[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.320]
Number six is a matter of fact.

[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:23.100]
Connoct.

[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:25.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:26.060]
David Wall.

[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:30.180]
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:31.800]
Mickey McNichol.

[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:33.140]
Here's Bokeh.

[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:33.340]
Hello.

[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.060]
Hey, I'm Neil.

[02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:35.660]
Yes, sir.

[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:38.740]
I'm this friend, you've I was about 10 miles from Young,

[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.060]
because Ray's like Joe Schwind.

[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:40.520]
Yes.

[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.960]
I bet Ray Jean.

[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:43.840]
Daniel.

[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:44.740]
Yeah.

[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:45.460]
You on there?

[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:46.400]
He's a man.

[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:47.540]
A man caught mine out the tower.

[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:49.100]
Ray Jean is still driving.

[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.060]
Yeah.

[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:50.480]
Yeah.

[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:52.680]
Case is still driving, no?

[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:54.620]
Yeah, he's still driving Northfield in Cleveland.

[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:56.180]
That's about the only place it'll take him.

[02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:59.360]
Well, the case on the Cockroach, they bet him down through.

[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:00.420]
It's right.

[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:01.580]
Two to four hours.

[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:04.980]
I have to confess, you know, it was a two to five hours of the

[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:05.280]
life.

[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.860]
But everybody was calling him begging for your forgiveness.

[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:10.480]
And I couldn't get through.

[02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:14.020]
I want to beg for your forgiveness, because I was one of the guys

[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:19.040]
listening to Rush back at days of the political insanity.

[02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:19.460]
Boy.

[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:21.460]
Yeah, you're forgiven my son.

[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:22.280]
Don't ever do it again.

[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:23.000]
Don't do it again.

[02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:23.380]
Oh, God.

[02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:23.860]
Love you.

[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:24.600]
Okay, I'll pray for you.

[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:27.060]
56670560.

[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:29.560]
See, and don't be a dillard or my one at Fat-ass limboa,

[02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:30.600]
because you want to hear the same year.

[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:31.760]
You had your full of that.

[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:33.000]
You got your man in there now.

[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:34.800]
He's just as dumb as he was before the election.

[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:37.060]
And we're dropping bombs out of all people over there and

[02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:37.740]
God damn Kuwait.

[02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:40.080]
And you know, it's the same old crap, no matter who it is.

[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:42.680]
So let's get out of important stuff like, you know,

[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.380]
like somebody.

[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:47.000]
Joe Mars Jr.

[02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:50.000]
56670560.

[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:51.000]
Palm 560.

[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:52.260]
I like Charles Beaver.

[02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:57.560]
I could come up with names so obscure that he would have people out there.

[02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:59.040]
What are these people talking about?

[02:05:59.320 --> 02:05:59.640]
What is it?

[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:03.540]
So guess who the top earner will do salt.

[02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:03.780]
Who?

[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:04.400]
I beg your pardon.

[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:06.820]
The top earner.

[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:07.840]
Top earner what?

[02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:10.000]
Top money winning earners so far this year.

[02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:12.500]
As of 31301.

[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:13.340]
This year.

[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:14.980]
I guess Dave Palone.

[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:16.400]
No.

[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:18.260]
Is he on the top hand?

[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:21.740]
No, he's none of the list.

[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:22.060]
Really?

[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:22.880]
Are you spelling that?

[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:24.460]
Dave Palone.

[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:25.100]
P.L.

[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:27.480]
I mean, how hard is it to spell Dave Palone?

[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:28.600]
Like Marone.

[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:29.380]
Marone.

[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:30.140]
Jimmy Marone.

[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:30.760]
No.

[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:31.240]
No.

[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:33.840]
If I already mentioned the name.

[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:35.020]
I think maybe.

[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:37.460]
There are a lot of people with this particular last name.

[02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:39.180]
Whole family.

[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:40.640]
Yeah.

[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.920]
On the other list there are at least four entries with the same last name.

[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:44.320]
Yeah.

[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:45.840]
That's your hint.

[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:47.760]
I haven't got any idea.

[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:48.500]
Big name down here.

[02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:50.100]
A lot of people with that name down here.

[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:51.000]
It's not a little bit.

[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:51.560]
Richie Silverman.

[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:51.840]
No.

[02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:53.820]
Jack Moise.

[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:54.240]
No.

[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:56.280]
Come on, let's go.

[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.980]
What is the first name?

[02:06:58.300 --> 02:06:58.320]
What's the first name?

[02:06:58.480 --> 02:06:59.140]
The first name.

[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:00.100]
In Kendall.

[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:01.460]
What is the first name?

[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:02.200]
Sunset.

[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:02.840]
David.

[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:04.100]
David.

[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:06.140]
David.

[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:06.520]

[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:08.180]
This is middle initial.

[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:09.660]
Miller.

[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:10.240]
Yes.

[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:10.840]
David Miller.

[02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:11.940]
Really?

[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:12.620]
Are you kidding me?

[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:13.520]
Boy, came out of the...

[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:14.640]
Oh, you came out of Pittsburgh.

[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:16.320]
Whether the middle-anthes is doing great.

[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:17.040]
Hey, David.

[02:07:17.240 --> 02:07:19.260]
Purple and white are his colors, by the way, just mention that.

[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:20.960]
Here is the bokeh.

[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:21.200]
Hello.

[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:23.440]
Bokeh.

[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:24.020]
Nail.

[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:24.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:25.440]
How are you doing?

[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:26.200]
Pretty damn good.

[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:28.660]
Yeah, well, the stock market is still on me.

[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.860]
Why are we in the dumps?

[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:31.100]
Yeah.

[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:34.480]
I was wondering maybe we could just play some happy music.

[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:37.840]
Make everybody happy, like some tarantella or something.

[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:38.180]
You know?

[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:42.480]
That is not bad luck from the Godfather.

[02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:43.800]
Remember that in the beginning when they have the wedding?

[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:44.940]
That is not bad luck.

[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:45.760]
Remember that?

[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:46.300]
Yeah.

[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:47.820]
Everybody happy, definitely.

[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:48.840]
Everybody, yeah.

[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:51.240]
Everybody happy when you play that kind of music.

[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:51.640]
That's right.

[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:52.220]
Let's do it.

[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:53.860]
I'll find it for you.

[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:54.460]
I have a goal.

[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:55.200]
And the music too.

[02:07:55.380 --> 02:07:55.700]
Don't forget.

[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:56.200]
Leave the gun.

[02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:56.840]
Bring the canoli.

[02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:57.700]
There you go.

[02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:57.960]
Okay.

[02:07:58.860 --> 02:07:59.560]
Bring the Hometaus.

[02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:00.440]
Oh, I guess what?

[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:03.680]
That smucked Scott from that place where Iowa makes the difference.

[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:05.440]
He was in here this morning.

[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.960]
I think he walked taking a crap or something.

[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:08.280]
That's the home of the way.

[02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:09.500]
He was in here.

[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:12.040]
And talking about, oh gee, I have a funny mention.

[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:13.240]
My name is about the Hometaus.

[02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:14.180]
Did he bring us any Hometaus?

[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:14.380]
Oh.

[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:16.760]
And I took your message about the bakery up there.

[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:17.480]
We should thank them.

[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:18.120]
But I, yeah.

[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:19.040]
What was the name for?

[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:19.900]
Sweet things.

[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:22.020]
Sweet things in the fountains.

[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:27.280]
When I got home Friday, there was a frantic message from George that they had called and they had a whole tray of Hometaus and waiting for me.

[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:28.620]
And did I go there and know?

[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:32.920]
Because if I would have got in the train, I would have taken the home and eaten it all weekend and gained five pounds.

[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.120]
So I appreciated it very much.

[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:35.460]
I'm sure they were delicious and great.

[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:37.620]
But we didn't get any Hometaus and that's okay.

[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:42.780]
You know, when the money hit fall and you understand it, we accept the fact that we're no longer invincible.

[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:43.740]
No, not one.

[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:45.160]
Not one Hometaus this year.

[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:45.580]
Not one.

[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:49.500]
I mean, Dave Halverstam said over those old Goyishy triangles.

[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:50.740]
And Dave's a good guy.

[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:52.960]
But, you know, let somebody else eat that stuff.

[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:53.840]
Dreck it.

[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.720]
Well, let's have Dreck eat it.

[02:08:56.580 --> 02:08:57.240]
He eats it.

[02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:01.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:03.440]
And provides a wireless line.

[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.360]
What about race time?

[02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:08.000]
Here's a mobile and book.

[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:08.320]
Hello.

[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:11.840]
Neil, two interesting unrelated things.

[02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:12.900]
What about Don McElmer?

[02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:13.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:22.480]
First of all, regarding Larry King, the other day on some cheesy CMDC financial thing, they were talking about the demise of CNN.

[02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:24.060]
And then they'll do it for us.

[02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:24.360]
Yeah.

[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:27.440]
And they've made specific reference to the statutes.

[02:09:27.670 --> 02:09:31.330]
A lot of the staff in Atlanta hate Larry King.

[02:09:32.090 --> 02:09:37.450]
And they're a pretty part of the demise to Larry King's shenanigans.

[02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:38.030]
Yeah.

[02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:42.530]
And this is one of the regular financial circles considering it.

[02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:43.050]
Much of question.

[02:09:44.330 --> 02:09:45.150]
Much of question.

[02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.490]
Yeah.

[02:09:45.710 --> 02:09:46.510]
Second thing is.

[02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:48.350]
And then now he's got eight days a week.

[02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:49.410]
That's my favorite part of it.

[02:09:49.450 --> 02:09:50.790]
There's so desperate to put on something.

[02:09:51.050 --> 02:09:54.810]
Even though his demographics are older than dirt, they got Larry King on like nine days a week.

[02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:55.390]
Much of question.

[02:09:56.010 --> 02:10:06.270]
The second thing is we're a bunch of strange Catholics here in my family, but my daughter goes to a Jewish school and made excellent home induction the other day.

[02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.490]
Really?

[02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:08.630]
Absolutely wonderful.

[02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:09.350]
Harold Fisher.

[02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:11.070]
I'd never had it before.

[02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.430]
Yeah.

[02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:12.690]
And it was very good.

[02:10:13.110 --> 02:10:14.390]
Well, we should add her bring it by.

[02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:15.330]
Okay.

[02:10:15.450 --> 02:10:16.690]
Well, the novel right for next year.

[02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:16.970]
Okay.

[02:10:17.110 --> 02:10:20.730]
If he's only five, so you know, we're right for next year when she's six and old enough to go out of the house.

[02:10:20.850 --> 02:10:21.390]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:22.210]
We'll do five.

[02:10:22.210 --> 02:10:22.290]
Five.

[02:10:22.290 --> 02:10:22.910]
Well, I mean, five, five is a.

[02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:28.270]
On that other home in Tasha that showed up from our good friend Dave Halvers, yeah.

[02:10:28.930 --> 02:10:29.590]
And he's sugar free.

[02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:32.050]
Stuff that I took home.

[02:10:32.190 --> 02:10:33.190]
Oh, no, sugar free.

[02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:33.670]
Yeah.

[02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:34.350]
Oh, no.

[02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:37.010]
Oh, I didn't need enough of it to get that fall out of it.

[02:10:37.050 --> 02:10:37.530]
It was so.

[02:10:38.710 --> 02:10:39.270]
Not good.

[02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:40.110]
Bad.

[02:10:40.590 --> 02:10:41.130]
Really, really.

[02:10:41.130 --> 02:10:41.810]
I said, direct.

[02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:43.410]
I said it was direct and live up to his name.

[02:10:43.730 --> 02:10:44.290]
Sandra Fisher.

[02:10:45.790 --> 02:10:46.530]
21-2.

[02:10:47.190 --> 02:10:49.110]
You see you're looking for these names on that list.

[02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:50.790]
They will not be on that one dead people.

[02:10:51.010 --> 02:10:53.270]
No, not dead necessarily, but old time.

[02:10:53.630 --> 02:10:55.450]
Give us that good old time religion, baby.

[02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:56.130]
That's right.

[02:10:56.950 --> 02:11:00.030]
Well, you'll be happy to know your friend, Luke Wallet, that you mentioned earlier is second

[02:11:00.030 --> 02:11:00.830]
place on the earnings.

[02:11:01.170 --> 02:11:01.450]
Really?

[02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:02.150]
Yes.

[02:11:02.210 --> 02:11:03.010]
He's very good.

[02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:04.530]
No unit in half.

[02:11:05.610 --> 02:11:06.370]
He's very good.

[02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:07.810]
He's also Canadian, eh?

[02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:10.550]
21-4-1 at 560 WQM.

[02:11:10.710 --> 02:11:11.070]
All right.

[02:11:11.170 --> 02:11:12.110]
This is G Gordon Litty.

[02:11:12.110 --> 02:11:14.690]
And they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:25.770]
Run along to the gate square.

[02:11:25.930 --> 02:11:28.090]
Dan's got a great big zipper in the back of the fence.

[02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:29.990]
Can't off the horse at the old barn door.

[02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:32.050]
Got a family burn around on the right and on the horn.

[02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:37.990]
Looking style folks are dancing all around.

[02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:39.950]
There goes Johnny and his mother's hat down.

[02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:41.870]
All the man left and all the man right.

[02:11:42.230 --> 02:11:43.550]
All the man needs a little bit of fun.

[02:11:48.690 --> 02:11:50.810]
Give your partner a silly smirk.

[02:11:51.110 --> 02:11:52.710]
All doing hand for a big circle jerk.

[02:11:53.210 --> 02:11:54.710]
Volunteers all raise your hand.

[02:11:54.970 --> 02:11:56.690]
Who's going to be the next pivot man?

[02:12:01.570 --> 02:12:03.550]
Invite your partner home for a drink.

[02:12:03.870 --> 02:12:07.430]
Lift your lips and give him a wink with a great big smile and a great thick nod.

[02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:09.550]
Let him know your gerbos be called.

[02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:12.890]
17-1 at 560 WQM.

[02:12:12.970 --> 02:12:15.850]
We got Hank Gorber coming up from for Lauderdale Stadium today.

[02:12:16.030 --> 02:12:16.930]
The Marlins.

[02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:18.330]
Remember the Marlins?

[02:12:18.610 --> 02:12:19.770]
They're going to be a booth.

[02:12:20.110 --> 02:12:20.530]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:12:21.710 --> 02:12:22.850]
What race are they driving in?

[02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:28.110]
560-7-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:33.370]
Nick Selvey.

[02:12:34.670 --> 02:12:36.390]
Okay, here's a mobile and bokeh.

[02:12:36.430 --> 02:12:36.630]
Hello.

[02:12:37.170 --> 02:12:37.910]
Neil God.

[02:12:38.170 --> 02:12:38.590]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:39.290]
How are you?

[02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:39.850]
Pretty good.

[02:12:40.090 --> 02:12:40.970]
A couple things.

[02:12:40.970 --> 02:12:42.050]
One as far as your pole.

[02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:44.890]
Nick Selvey wants to go over horse at Pomp and a part called the Consulieri.

[02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.290]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:45.830]
I'm sorry.

[02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:46.330]
Go ahead.

[02:12:46.350 --> 02:12:48.970]
The most plastic eff in place in the world is bokeh.

[02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:53.670]
Well, it's not doing it's in second place, but it's not catching up with South Beach.

[02:12:53.850 --> 02:12:55.290]
South Beach seems to be in the league by itself.

[02:12:55.690 --> 02:12:56.290]
Well, that's too bad.

[02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:58.770]
Secondly, irresponsible pet or animal owners.

[02:12:58.890 --> 02:12:59.230]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:59.230 --> 02:13:07.390]
I was driving a 95 last summer and I hit a bull that had gotten loose from a farmer that allowed his bull to just roam free.

[02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:08.330]
You hit a bull, huh?

[02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:09.030]
Yes.

[02:13:09.330 --> 02:13:09.630]
Wow.

[02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:11.170]
Actually destroyed the van.

[02:13:11.290 --> 02:13:12.310]
It was pretty bad.

[02:13:12.590 --> 02:13:13.410]
What happened to the bull?

[02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:14.450]
Oh, it killed it.

[02:13:14.730 --> 02:13:14.930]
Really?

[02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.590]
Yes.

[02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:18.250]
Not to like 100 feet into the median.

[02:13:18.450 --> 02:13:18.770]
Wow.

[02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:21.470]
I just didn't get to keep the stake in sports.

[02:13:21.610 --> 02:13:22.830]
How much did it have to have a collision, huh?

[02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.490]
Yeah, it was.

[02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:24.370]
Wasn't pretty.

[02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:25.090]
Third thing.

[02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:26.750]
Did the pandas pick up Valley Burian?

[02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.790]
I didn't.

[02:13:27.250 --> 02:13:29.130]
I haven't heard one word about anything.

[02:13:29.770 --> 02:13:30.090]
Ridiculous.

[02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:31.810]
At least my devils go out and get a good gold tender.

[02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:33.110]
Nobody did not.

[02:13:34.050 --> 02:13:36.170]
Do you think the geezer has a backup?

[02:13:37.130 --> 02:13:39.170]
Geezer is fine as a backup.

[02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:40.910]
Geezer for the playoffs, man.

[02:13:41.050 --> 02:13:42.810]
You're thinking of that one year, you're thinking of that one.

[02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:43.250]
I had the backup.

[02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:44.190]
He is cool.

[02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:47.130]
Yeah, he's better than Chris Terrero, you're right.

[02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:49.790]
And by the way, if Ken Maldon's listening to Terrero, he's not Terrero.

[02:13:49.890 --> 02:13:50.450]
Come on, Ken.

[02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:51.630]
Have a rate, Dave Pal.

[02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:51.950]
Good luck.

[02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:53.050]
Okay, you'll need it.

[02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:54.050]
Another guy on the ice team.

[02:13:54.050 --> 02:13:56.590]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, you know we've heard nothing about.

[02:13:56.650 --> 02:13:57.490]
We got the trading deadline.

[02:13:57.730 --> 02:14:01.490]
You would think of course that our sports people will be running here since this is the hockey

[02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:02.670]
maven here sitting in here.

[02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:06.070]
The hockey harness racing and home all maven sitting here, the 3-H club.

[02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:07.810]
That they'd be running here.

[02:14:07.950 --> 02:14:09.010]
What's ESPN?

[02:14:09.230 --> 02:14:09.990]
I know what the numbers are.

[02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:10.630]
206.

[02:14:12.370 --> 02:14:13.650]
207 is ESPN news.

[02:14:14.050 --> 02:14:15.070]
I guess I'll have to put it on there.

[02:14:15.130 --> 02:14:16.370]
They'll have the stuff go right on there.

[02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:18.050]
They're certainly going to be some deals today.

[02:14:19.130 --> 02:14:21.290]
Erics over there in St. Louis sticking his nose in there.

[02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:25.330]
Well, I, you know, he makes me sick, big Eric.

[02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:27.370]
Yeah, well maybe I'll play there.

[02:14:27.490 --> 02:14:28.130]
Maybe I won't.

[02:14:28.150 --> 02:14:29.470]
Maybe daddy will say it's okay.

[02:14:29.730 --> 02:14:31.050]
Maybe I'll get another head ache.

[02:14:31.210 --> 02:14:32.030]
You got to go away, Eric.

[02:14:32.150 --> 02:14:32.850]
Just don't go to Toronto.

[02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:34.350]
Just don't go home.

[02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:35.610]
Maybe, maybe stay out of there.

[02:14:37.130 --> 02:14:38.830]
We got him watching there with the custom.

[02:14:38.970 --> 02:14:40.290]
Just to make sure that you can't get in.

[02:14:41.370 --> 02:14:45.010]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:47.070]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:14:48.490 --> 02:14:49.090]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:49.450]
Hello.

[02:14:49.450 --> 02:14:52.550]
Yeah, I think the pastor's just signed Patti Repone.

[02:14:52.970 --> 02:14:53.890]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:14:54.170 --> 02:14:54.810]
Patti Repone.

[02:14:55.090 --> 02:14:56.890]
Hey, Neil, how about Louis Repone?

[02:14:57.110 --> 02:14:57.650]
Yes, dad.

[02:14:57.650 --> 02:14:59.450]
Patti Repone drove it, popping O Park.

[02:15:00.070 --> 02:15:02.850]
Do you remember a Jewish kid who used to drive down here?

[02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.610]
I don't know, I had them.

[02:15:03.850 --> 02:15:04.930]
The name was Heim and Becker.

[02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:05.510]
Sure.

[02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:07.210]
He was from New England.

[02:15:07.490 --> 02:15:08.250]
Is he still around?

[02:15:08.530 --> 02:15:09.090]
No, I don't know.

[02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:10.590]
He used to wear black and white.

[02:15:10.590 --> 02:15:11.170]
Oh, no, I don't know.

[02:15:11.290 --> 02:15:14.330]
He was around taking a beck with you know, the beck with drivers from New England.

[02:15:14.590 --> 02:15:15.930]
I'm a becker, but I do remember the name.

[02:15:15.930 --> 02:15:17.830]
I'm a he used to wear black and white.

[02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:22.310]
He used to have two big Jewish stars on each side of his helmet.

[02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:24.590]
Oh, I just wonder what that is.

[02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:25.950]
You have no such warner, I'll tell you that.

[02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.590]
Yeah.

[02:15:27.010 --> 02:15:28.330]
How about Herman Halkeema?

[02:15:28.650 --> 02:15:29.990]
Oh, Herman Hillkema.

[02:15:30.370 --> 02:15:31.290]
Very good.

[02:15:31.650 --> 02:15:31.890]
Yes.

[02:15:32.050 --> 02:15:33.210]
And Billy and Billy Rieger.

[02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:34.510]
And Cecil Champion.

[02:15:34.710 --> 02:15:36.110]
All right, now we're cooking.

[02:15:36.290 --> 02:15:37.750]
Now we're talking meadows.

[02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.790]
We're talking Pittsburgh.

[02:15:39.170 --> 02:15:39.610]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:40.210]
Okay.

[02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.590]
Thanks, Neil.

[02:15:41.690 --> 02:15:42.810]
Watch out for Dave Palombe.

[02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:43.650]
And Dean Zames.

[02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:45.050]
Watch out for Greg Wright Jr.

[02:15:46.050 --> 02:15:47.070]
And Tommy Buter.

[02:15:47.210 --> 02:15:47.990]
And Brian Sears.

[02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:48.830]
Okay, say goodbye.

[02:15:50.230 --> 02:15:51.530]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:52.850]
Come on, 5, 60.

[02:15:53.550 --> 02:15:54.170]
See, you know what?

[02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:57.550]
This is so great because there are like maybe five of us down here.

[02:15:57.790 --> 02:15:59.070]
There really is only thing about it, you know.

[02:15:59.630 --> 02:16:01.670]
And then there's Wally Hennessey who thinks you know something about it.

[02:16:01.670 --> 02:16:02.890]
Hey, Wally, you're a dangerous baby.

[02:16:04.250 --> 02:16:05.250]
She's one thing about Wally.

[02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:05.970]
He's always dangerous.

[02:16:06.170 --> 02:16:07.450]
He's dangerous when he wants to be.

[02:16:07.690 --> 02:16:09.110]
And he's dangerous when he doesn't want to be.

[02:16:09.310 --> 02:16:09.770]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:16:11.130 --> 02:16:12.590]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:16:12.590 --> 02:16:15.350]
And then there's a 50-pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:16:15.370 --> 02:16:16.090]
How's it going, A?

[02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:18.050]

[02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:20.130]
Mobile and Jupiter, hello.

[02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:20.730]
Hey, Neil.

[02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:21.330]
How you doing?

[02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:25.650]
Been in the North Miami Fire Station for 19 years.

[02:16:26.850 --> 02:16:30.390]
My best friend that was there when I got there turned me on to you.

[02:16:30.490 --> 02:16:32.350]
And we've been listening to you since then.

[02:16:32.710 --> 02:16:33.210]
All right.

[02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:35.390]
Congratulations.

[02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:36.210]
Thank you.

[02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:38.510]
I hope I'm out of town before you leave.

[02:16:38.930 --> 02:16:39.230]
Me too.

[02:16:40.350 --> 02:16:41.690]
Hey, anyway, speaking of Larry.

[02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:43.150]
I'm whipping around the channels.

[02:16:43.430 --> 02:16:44.050]
I'm just kidding.

[02:16:44.490 --> 02:16:46.490]
Going into the 10 o'clock hour.

[02:16:46.590 --> 02:16:47.030]
Why, who's that?

[02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:48.050]
Was he sucking last night?

[02:16:48.210 --> 02:16:49.550]
Well, I didn't watch the show.

[02:16:49.750 --> 02:16:53.770]
I just, I went to CNN about 30 seconds before Larry went off.

[02:16:54.810 --> 02:17:02.090]
And he is touting, get on the internet and vote for how you feel about his show.

[02:17:02.510 --> 02:17:02.730]
Really?

[02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:03.370]
Yeah.

[02:17:03.610 --> 02:17:08.710]
And when you mentioned, the only reason I called was because the other guy was talking about how bad it was

[02:17:08.710 --> 02:17:10.410]
and CNN was going down the tubes.

[02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:17.210]
He was touting to get on the internet and vote on what you think of his show.

[02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:22.350]
So apparently there must be a question there about how bad he's dragging down the ratings.

[02:17:22.590 --> 02:17:23.070]
What's your question?

[02:17:23.410 --> 02:17:24.030]
Yeah, all right.

[02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:24.910]
What's your question?

[02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:26.170]
Maybe he'll congratulations.

[02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:28.530]
Maybe I'll say that maybe his tongue is where now.

[02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:30.710]
Maybe it's turned out as Shula there from all that I can.

[02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:31.730]
I can't watch him.

[02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.530]
The worst.

[02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:33.290]
I can't do it.

[02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:37.570]
But you know something, I do confess though that in channel surfing, is that time that I

[02:17:37.570 --> 02:17:37.630]
was going to be on the internet.

[02:17:37.630 --> 02:17:37.630]

[02:17:37.630 --> 02:17:37.630]

[02:17:37.630 --> 02:17:38.490]
And then the American phone is usually pretty desperate.

[02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:40.070]
I'll look to see who he's got on.

[02:17:40.090 --> 02:17:41.830]
Yeah, yo, yeah, yeah.

[02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:42.170]
Yeah.

[02:17:42.810 --> 02:17:45.050]
He has the child killers on or something, really.

[02:17:45.050 --> 02:17:46.470]
He was kissing their ass too.

[02:17:46.670 --> 02:17:54.790]
Yeah, I went by at 9 o'clock and I went by her all day when that was it and I did something else.

[02:17:55.710 --> 02:17:55.990]

[02:22:42.650 --> 02:22:48.150]
Two years ago. Yeah, and I took a cat home from an animal clinic that I worked at. He was a blood donor there

[02:22:49.370 --> 02:22:53.070]
And he's the best cat or the best pet that I've ever had

[02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:57.890]
Seriously, those knock things over he's not you know, you can go away for a couple days

[02:22:57.890 --> 02:22:59.850]

And it cracked in my arms and that was the end of my yeah

[02:23:29.330 --> 02:23:33.370]
That was the end of my love affair with cats. I mean, you know, I thought this is a pretty shmitty experience

Here's a mobile implantation. Hello. Hi, Uncle Leo. How are you?

[02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:11.710]
Pretty good. I hate cats too. Good. Just want to let you know what your fellow broadcasters pass away

[02:25:11.710 --> 02:25:16.170]
Morton Downey Jr. Yeah, we already had that on about 45 minutes ago sir. Oh, sorry about that

[02:25:16.170 --> 02:25:19.630]
He's not one of my fellow broadcasters. I mean if you want to call him a broadcaster

He was a pitchman a uh Hux der A what everyone kind of junk TV. Yeah

All right, thanks for making me smile. Okay. Have a great day sir and say hi to Mort

[02:25:33.890 --> 02:25:37.510]
I didn't have lung cancer. I believe he was a heavy to it. He was a chain smoker

[02:25:38.290 --> 02:25:40.090]
That was the best that one could say about it

[02:25:40.090 --> 02:25:43.090]
So there's a message for all your kids out there don't be smoking. Oh chains, baby

[02:25:43.530 --> 02:25:47.350]
Because you'll wind up dead someday. Of course, even if you don't smoke him you'll wind up dead anyway

[02:25:47.350 --> 02:25:48.970]
So that's the way it works, you know

[02:26:15.610 --> 02:26:16.990]
I want to kill myself

[02:26:17.730 --> 02:26:23.090]
Profit the 7560 WQ and the weather it's not just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon

[02:26:24.210 --> 02:26:31.690]
New on PBS from the creators of temptation island. It's no temptation island. Here I am bring on the page

[02:26:34.830 --> 02:26:39.990]
Wait a minute Metro's the old title is this kind of a cruel joke?

[02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:42.030]
It's a foaming bone deer idiot or anything you want

[02:26:42.850 --> 02:26:43.250]
Oh

[02:26:47.230 --> 02:26:48.710]
No temptation island

[02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:54.170]
You've got a problem young man somebody just shoot me on PBS

[02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:59.550]
One o'clock at five sixty WQ. I'm happy to be to a boy. This year a lot better day in yesterday

[02:26:59.550 --> 02:27:04.710]
How's that market coming? Oh sets and walks in this ESPN the new stuff. They got no information. They suck

[02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:12.010]
Let's see 355 looks like CMBC to me here on the directory 3170 and that's actually about 32 points

[02:27:12.010 --> 02:27:16.030]
Not spectacular not gonna make a big comeback today, but a little something

[02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:20.710]
You know we got three hours to go just hang on hang on to a little something. I always try it

[02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:23.470]
Now is done 81, but you know

[02:27:23.970 --> 02:27:25.850]
Then it'll teach you to be buying a GE stuff

[02:27:25.850 --> 02:27:32.010]
And you notice the people on CMBC are having a Schmidt they have it a hemorrhage over the fact that GE took that gigantic dump and lost like

[02:27:32.010 --> 02:27:38.530]
$75 trillion in value in one day yesterday too bad. That's your parent company too bad. You guys are gonna shut your ass down. Yeah

[02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:44.730]
GE they had a better idea Ronald Reagan knew what it was, but he forgot it they keep going and asking hey Ronnie

[02:27:44.730 --> 02:27:46.750]
What was that better idea? Yeah

[02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:54.110]
Poor Ronnie. Here's a lady in high alia. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, ma'am. Um, I love you two pieces

[02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:58.650]
But today I'm in the role of defender. I was so glad to hear that gentleman call about cat

[02:27:58.650 --> 02:28:02.450]
Not defender of cats. Oh, absolutely. I'll put a cat. Oh, no. Yes

[02:28:02.970 --> 02:28:05.090]
Dogs and cats all our life and I think that

[02:28:05.770 --> 02:28:07.550]
men like dogs mostly because

[02:28:08.410 --> 02:28:09.190]
They're slavery

[02:28:10.450 --> 02:28:16.450]
Because why the dogs are slavery. Well, what does that mean? They're slavery because they're friendly and they're obedient and they're not

[02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:22.170]
You're getting independent obnoxious like cats. Well cats. I think it takes the man with a lot more

[02:28:23.850 --> 02:28:27.370]
self-control and he doesn't need that kind of

[02:28:28.650 --> 02:28:32.230]
Slavery shouldn't have seen his life doesn't need any attention. I don't know what that means slavery

[02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:35.750]
This is I have I have two dogs that I haven't since they were eight weeks old and they're not

[02:28:36.390 --> 02:28:38.730]
Slavery when you come to the door do they run over there and

[02:28:39.530 --> 02:28:42.250]
They bark and scream because they're happy to see me. Yeah

[02:28:42.910 --> 02:28:48.010]
Well cats don't do that tomorrow because cats don't give a crap about you. That's right. Yeah, they want you

[02:28:48.010 --> 02:28:52.510]
It is true. It's not true. They couldn't care less about you as long as somebody there to do whatever

[02:28:52.510 --> 02:28:54.330]
They need to feed them. They couldn't care if you're

[02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:55.730]
Hurrogon

[02:28:56.350 --> 02:28:59.690]
A dog is affectionate a dog who loves you a dog is your best in fact

[02:28:59.690 --> 02:29:03.390]
I was gonna write a book. It's gonna be called my best friends have four legs

[02:29:04.730 --> 02:29:08.110]
Sounds like a winner. Yeah, let me tell you that great is that great name for a book?

[02:29:08.390 --> 02:29:13.090]
Yes, my husband had never had cats in his life and we brought a cat and after we got married

[02:29:13.090 --> 02:29:16.230]
Yeah, and he was quite ill one day and

[02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:19.890]
He really didn't have much use for the cat. I pretty much took care of him

[02:29:20.730 --> 02:29:23.710]
Probably allergic to cats. No, no, no, no

[02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:29.130]
And we only had one cat at the time and this cat came up and just laid her head on him and he said it's like she knows

[02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:30.810]
And she would not leave him

[02:29:30.810 --> 02:29:32.890]
She knows that he was sick

[02:29:33.970 --> 02:29:37.870]
Well, let me let me ask you this do you know that uh certain dog especially little dogs

[02:29:37.870 --> 02:29:39.890]
You know that they have healing power and their tongues

[02:29:39.890 --> 02:29:44.410]
If you have a cut on your photo on your hand that little dog will like look it

[02:29:44.410 --> 02:29:47.970]
If there's like any little area where you have like a nicked huh?

[02:29:47.970 --> 02:29:52.590]
I'm not familiar with that. Right, his antiseptic in his saliva and he will look at and heal it

[02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:58.310]
I have a healing dog. Oh, so they're useful too. Yeah, that's why this one. Well, more or something wrong with that? No

[02:29:59.010 --> 02:30:01.990]
I've always had like German Shepherd and St. Bernard's

[02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:07.170]
Yeah, in fact, I'm glad I'm glad you used that word because useful as a dog is useful and a cat is useless

[02:30:07.170 --> 02:30:11.690]
And that's the distinction. No cats are affectionate. Well, they are

[02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:16.530]
I mean rub it up against your leg is not my idea of affection unless Miguel came in here and did it

[02:30:16.530 --> 02:30:21.530]
I mean I don't I don't get that when we call them they know their names and they come over and

[02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:24.630]
Sometimes they don't feel like being petted and and they let you know

[02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:26.210]
By what

[02:30:27.070 --> 02:30:30.710]
Like they just ignore you. Yeah, like they they can take their claws and like that

[02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:33.210]
Well, only if you keys them to the ball

[02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:39.810]
But normally they don't scratch or anything unless you do something like pick them up upside down and uh-huh

[02:30:39.810 --> 02:30:43.590]
You know, this is what we're all about. Although I always thought that it was a good idea to have a cat that wasn't

[02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:47.370]
Declod, you know to kind of keep my little dog in line over the years. That would have been a good idea

[02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:49.910]
Straighten his ass out in the hurry

[02:30:51.090 --> 02:30:54.470]
Probably would have too. Yeah. Okay. Well, listen. I'm glad you're happy with your cats

[02:30:54.470 --> 02:30:56.950]
And I'm very happy with my dogs and like those on okay

[02:30:56.950 --> 02:31:00.150]
I also want to defend Irish. If I had a chance to run over a cat believe me

[02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:02.730]
I got a very fast curve but I'm sorry

[02:31:02.730 --> 02:31:04.410]
Please I

[02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:06.730]
Want to defend Irishman also oh?

[02:31:07.210 --> 02:31:08.870]
Because you took a couple shots at them

[02:31:10.290 --> 02:31:13.390]
Irishmen are really nice guys. I've never dated anyone who was not Irish

[02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:14.330]
Well, pasties though

[02:31:15.610 --> 02:31:21.870]
My husband's not he's Irish. He's not pasties. No, thank God for that. How can she compare if she's never dated anything but

[02:31:22.390 --> 02:31:28.430]
Yeah, that's true. Have you ever dated like a Chinese guy? No, oh the Chinese people I have very like very smooth skin

[02:31:30.650 --> 02:31:33.630]
No, I just think I never saw a Chinese person

[02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:37.270]
Well, let me see. I just mentioned that something to think about for a while, you know

[02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:40.250]
I like what I have oh good excellent Irishman are poetic

[02:31:41.010 --> 02:31:43.010]
They're mystical right drunk

[02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:45.450]
No, not that is yeah

[02:31:46.510 --> 02:31:49.230]
occasionally uh-huh and eat a lot of potatoes

[02:31:50.130 --> 02:31:56.110]
No, not not mine. Oh good. Well, you must have the good one. I've got the good one. Excellent. Okay. Have a great taste. We'd art

[02:31:57.090 --> 02:32:00.190]
She's got a cat and an Irish husband. I hate the Irish. Now what can I say?

[02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:06.230]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T. I always just had a power

[02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:08.970]
A little surgeon here the TV went off

[02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:16.530]
Thank God the phones didn't go out that would have been really bad TV went off though. Oh, I sure hope my TV. I broke the TV's broke. I'm going home

[02:32:17.770 --> 02:32:19.530]
Let's see. Oh, no, they just came back

[02:32:20.290 --> 02:32:22.590]
Look at that searching for satellite signal

[02:32:23.690 --> 02:32:28.890]
There it is. Thank God. Wow man. Do we have like an electrical fart in here or what?

[02:32:30.330 --> 02:32:33.170]
I told it there's something there's something in the air

[02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:36.450]
That's what ThunderClaven Newman said these line on the we're getting out of our system now

[02:32:36.450 --> 02:32:41.050]
I don't want to start like some philosopher now or some guru or psychic or something like that

[02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:45.810]
Because I have rumor on the phone there this afternoon. He'll be sitting on the sofa in tears

[02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:51.990]
Talking to the annealed a psychic when I heard that yesterday. I just I wanted to I wanted to sit down and cry

[02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:59.250]
I'm taking financial advice from people who are hooked up with some psychic freak and with a shika vera be there with a Xerox stock

[02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:02.830]
That's me. Call me a schmuck. I'll answer. That's my name

[02:33:03.810 --> 02:33:08.570]
North Miami Beach hello. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How are you today sir? This is El Shmucco

[02:33:11.250 --> 02:33:12.130]
Neil I

[02:33:12.590 --> 02:33:17.130]
I'm the guy that called you about the gun show the other day when we're talking about guns. Yeah, brother was

[02:33:17.130 --> 02:33:19.730]
Brother I'm talking about in Tallahassee

[02:33:19.730 --> 02:33:24.610]
He heard you on the internet. He said you forgot to tell him a couple a little

[02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:31.370]
Of the other things that happen at that they do that they do with gun shows one of them is they tell all about sir

[02:33:31.370 --> 02:33:35.830]
Come down take it slow you a little ahead of yourself. Yes. Yes. A lot of time. I know

[02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:43.970]
There's such thing there's a thing such as that's called a wallet gun and if somebody I used to have one. Oh, yeah

[02:33:43.970 --> 02:33:48.870]
They're great. Yeah, they're very hard to get and I was wondering I sent you some

[02:33:49.470 --> 02:33:50.790]
Some stickers that

[02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:54.910]
You could peel off and put on your car that were shaped like those

[02:33:54.910 --> 02:34:00.090]
You mean the one that says choose your words carefully anything you say maybe throw back in your face with the vicious sarcasm

[02:34:00.090 --> 02:34:04.950]
No, what would Jesus do probably kick your ass in the knock of your brusquies in front of the tube

[02:34:04.950 --> 02:34:06.930]
Oh, somebody said we

[02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:15.230]
Oh, each of them one said Neil God in the center of the fish one said Gfilta and the center of the fish and the other one said darwin

[02:34:15.230 --> 02:34:18.410]
I thought maybe you would like to know I guess you never got them

[02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:22.990]
If you like you mean sometime back you sent those. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Those are great. I did get them. I love them

[02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:27.690]
Okay, I'll make another set if you'd like I sure would and okay, you can send some good filter fish

[02:34:27.690 --> 02:34:29.030]
I like that all right and

[02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:33.890]
Another thing that my brother told me you said when when I

[02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:36.650]
interviewing our potential

[02:34:37.310 --> 02:34:42.910]
People to work for the state red flags will pop up a date from time to time and some of the things are

[02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:46.950]
You're supposed to be ever ever so careful if a

[02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:54.630]
For guy who's applying for the police position was at one time a security guard because they're very dangerous people

[02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:56.790]
Okay, they give themselves to emotion

[02:34:56.790 --> 02:35:01.850]
They probably scramble legs for their half and more dangerous than the security guards of maybe the postman

[02:35:01.850 --> 02:35:06.490]
Okay, listen have it right there. Let me go. Bye. Thanks. Okay. How about B Farber

[02:35:07.350 --> 02:35:11.870]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:16.470]
How about Charlie Farber? Can he drive on? No, no

[02:35:17.350 --> 02:35:18.930]
Here's the mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[02:35:19.470 --> 02:35:22.290]
Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing great?

[02:35:22.290 --> 02:35:27.770]
I want to talk to you about that dog's an ecstatic effect of the tongue. Yeah. Does that work on him?

[02:35:28.250 --> 02:35:30.430]
Works on your back. Don't matter. Frank. Yeah

[02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:34.870]
Rectum is better if lyric king is available night. Maybe your dog can do you?

[02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:37.970]
Thanks, sir. Okay. Good luck. Yeah. What do you think?

[02:35:39.090 --> 02:35:44.970]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Well, that's right

[02:35:44.970 --> 02:35:51.070]
This is another one of these hours with no spots good very few. Oh, no, we were limiting the spots too many interruptions

[02:35:51.070 --> 02:35:53.470]
Audience don't want all those interruptions. They want to be entertained

[02:35:54.210 --> 02:35:58.670]
So that's the new abesley way here. We're just done up to and then we can look at all the heavy baggage we're here

[02:35:59.170 --> 02:36:02.030]
You're rid of most of that damn pain in the ass sales department. God

[02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:04.930]
What about your losers get that to direct out the door

[02:36:05.730 --> 02:36:08.170]
Yeah, if you're not going to have any spots where you need sales people for

[02:36:08.650 --> 02:36:11.430]
And then of course there'll be no payroll because there will be no payroll checks

[02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:13.410]
Because there'll be no revenue

[02:36:16.170 --> 02:36:21.050]
5 6 7 0 5 6 and there won't be any phone story about breaking because we can't afford to pay the phone bill anyway

[02:36:21.450 --> 02:36:24.370]
So you have to worry about fixing the phone hole. Yeah, see y'all

[02:36:24.370 --> 02:36:29.630]
This is what happens when you have no spots. You don't have to worry about all these complicated things

[02:36:30.430 --> 02:36:34.070]
And if we can then we'll just take up a collection to pay the electric bill to keep us on here every month

[02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:39.190]
Yeah, and then maybe like a real company to come in here and buy the radio station that sounds excellent

[02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:42.830]
And maybe pay me off. That was real good. Oh, no, you don't want that

[02:36:43.650 --> 02:36:47.490]
You know something. I just saw that Justin Tinkerbell on there again on the whatever I'm watching here

[02:36:47.490 --> 02:36:51.630]
If you really think that she's doing that come on you don't really believe that doing no

[02:36:51.630 --> 02:36:58.170]
Give me oh and there was a blonde on it. I remember the travel channel I was talking about uh-huh her name was Chris something

[02:36:58.170 --> 02:36:59.450]
I mean not that she's a celebrity

[02:37:00.290 --> 02:37:06.870]
A young blonde in a bathing suit. I swear to God she made Britney Spears look like what my dog leaves in the backyard every month

[02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:13.390]
I'm not exaggerating. She would make every man in the world forget about Britney in a heartbeat a heartbeat. I'm serious

[02:37:14.530 --> 02:37:18.710]
blonde young about like early 20s. I swear to you and and this is the story

[02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:21.590]
This is what TV needs to discover God bless the travel channel

[02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:25.070]
Thank God that and thank God buddy bud soldered to somebody with some taste

[02:37:26.070 --> 02:37:28.630]
Yeah, he bought that one day and soldered about a week later, you know

[02:37:29.550 --> 02:37:32.990]
That's the government for and guess who the new chairman of the FCC is have you noticed that

[02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:39.050]
No, I didn't know well. Let me give you a couple of clues. He's skin is a little on the dark side

[02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:42.850]
And his daddy is the secretary of state

[02:37:44.830 --> 02:37:46.730]
Really and his last name is

Speaking of harness racing what a great segway to our pop it up our spot

[02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:12.830]
We got racing for your simul casting every day seven days a week

[02:40:12.830 --> 02:40:15.210]
I think it's really great on the third floor for the simul casting

[02:40:15.570 --> 02:40:19.630]
You go up there and you get you a little seat or maybe you'll want those seats by the the ornable personal TV

[02:40:20.390 --> 02:40:25.350]
And you can sit there and bet on high-lie and harness racing and throw by racing and just plunge your plunge your brains on

[02:40:25.350 --> 02:40:28.970]
Then maybe have a little snack a little bit of dinner and at night time make a double header out of it

[02:40:28.970 --> 02:40:30.770]
Monday Wednesday Friday and Saturday like we did

[02:40:30.770 --> 02:40:37.030]

Remember at Yonkins, you know, you don't need to say get well with Bell right he was a catch driver actually

[02:42:13.730 --> 02:42:15.010]

Or is this man got a vast knowledge this meal?

[02:42:36.450 --> 02:42:38.810]
See there's this very disturbing to me that in my advanced day

[02:42:38.810 --> 02:42:43.710]
Remember all of these things and important stuff. I I haven't got a freaking clue like Madbox says I

[02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:46.130]
I haven't got a clue. I don't

[02:42:46.530 --> 02:42:50.410]
Ask me my phone number. I don't know but all this stuff, you know from a hundred years ago

[02:42:50.410 --> 02:42:54.370]
I can tell you a chapter in verse. I can tell you what time they went the quarter to half mile three quarters

[02:42:54.370 --> 02:42:56.690]
I can tell you how many lengths they were ahead by the top of the stretch

[02:42:59.450 --> 02:43:01.350]
Here's call springs. Hello

[02:43:01.350 --> 02:43:02.690]
Yeah, sir

[02:43:03.430 --> 02:43:05.530]
I didn't hit through a backwards race wait

[02:43:05.530 --> 02:43:09.250]
That's your warna and we're gonna let them okay. Great. Thank you. All right now

[02:43:09.250 --> 02:43:14.450]
Let's start talking some important stuff. Okay, because we wind up actually discussing this we won't have anybody left by the time

[02:43:14.450 --> 02:43:16.270]
Hank comes on at two o'clock

[02:43:17.650 --> 02:43:22.070]
Something he would resent Billy but that was and then Hank can share with you his knowledge about harness racing

[02:43:22.890 --> 02:43:29.950]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 does he have any no pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line see for me

[02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:34.630]
I like action lag on the track. I don't want to sit there like the third breath you sit there for a half an hour between

[02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:38.230]
Races there wasn't a goddamn thing go it on there's no horses warming up

[02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:42.270]
There's no nothing they got a few bogus a workout in the guy damn racing form

[02:43:42.270 --> 02:43:47.050]
Which maybe they're right and maybe they're wrong and maybe it was the right horse and maybe it wasn't and you wait for half an hour

[02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:50.370]
And they stick him in the goddamn gate and they run for like three quarters of a mile

[02:43:50.370 --> 02:43:53.950]
Maybe maybe a mile if you're lucky and then I said for another half an hour

[02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:58.150]
I mean go into the third words. I got to be honest with it is so

[02:43:59.050 --> 02:44:00.050]
Boeing it's like

[02:44:00.750 --> 02:44:05.270]
Watching paint dry. It's like listening to somebody discuss watching paint dry

[02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:08.830]
That's how boring going to Thurbera racing is so when people ask me like my friend

[02:44:09.350 --> 02:44:14.410]

Or maybe Gary Puckett and you and Gap well they tried Gary Puckett that didn't work

[02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:26.970]
So we're waiting for the miracle okay Joe good guy Joe. Thanks for everything but bye-bye

[02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:28.490]

[02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:14.070]
Cats and dogs is fine. Okay, I just thought he's the little harness racing assholes calling them with these names from 100 years ago

[02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:15.390]
But we won't have any audience left

[02:45:15.390 --> 02:45:18.350]

Love to say that, but I did have this one cat who was very unusual. No, he got to the point

[02:45:34.990 --> 02:45:38.190]
He used to watch me go to that but I need to take a leak and

[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:44.650]
After a while he started using the bathroom itself. I didn't teach him that's right. No now. I'm serious. No

[02:45:44.650 --> 02:45:47.190]
I'm telling you my daughter didn't believe it to she

[02:45:47.810 --> 02:45:50.790]
After he came off a weekend with her mom as you know daddy

[02:45:51.210 --> 02:45:56.430]
There's body thing in the closet. I told you this was a cat. I cat. Yes, Neil. I swear

[02:45:56.430 --> 02:46:01.150]
So this is a body smart to know blondes smart of the cat. How does it can't be in a toilet?

[02:46:01.930 --> 02:46:04.870]
So Neil just thought this this cat will do a lot of the thing

[02:46:05.410 --> 02:46:05.790]
And

[02:46:06.690 --> 02:46:10.030]
And the the cat was really smart. Yeah, I sure hope they never fell in

[02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:14.230]
No, I said you flush it for but here's some serious. That's a situation

[02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:17.010]
When my daughter wants to was there a mom on the weekend

I figured I could easily the toilet seat up now I had to leave the toilet seat down again for the damn cat. Yeah

[02:46:22.030 --> 02:46:26.090]
But the dog in the cat got along great the dog's on the floor. He was a cat

[02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:30.230]
She could the cat use something into the you laundry baths and I think and the

[02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:53.470]

[02:49:00.270 --> 02:49:00.590]
Hello

[02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:06.470]
That's good. That's great

[02:49:07.350 --> 02:49:10.210]
Some somebody playing back a tape or I'd like to like the in fact

[02:49:10.210 --> 02:49:13.330]
I think that the recorder was in the toilet speaking of having the lid down

[02:49:13.330 --> 02:49:17.370]
Yeah, at least pull the lid up. Okay, if you're gonna play tapes in the toilet and put them on the phone

[02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:23.690]
Really good stuff. Oh, that's right. We don't have to um this is excellent. This is out to what we do in true breaks this hour

[02:49:24.590 --> 02:49:28.850]
Yeah, sure there's no stress. Yeah, and you know, I don't see one of the things if I have one failing

[02:49:28.850 --> 02:49:29.970]
I talk too fast

[02:49:29.970 --> 02:49:35.150]
Why do I talk too fast all the time like I'm rushed because I'm rushed because if I didn't talk too fast

[02:49:35.150 --> 02:49:39.970]
We wouldn't have any goddamn show here since screw I decided we're on like 80 minutes of spots an hour

[02:49:39.970 --> 02:49:41.750]
But now we don't have any spots

[02:49:42.490 --> 02:49:43.950]
Because we're in a goddamn depression

[02:49:44.930 --> 02:49:48.590]
So pretty soon we won't have any money and they won't be able to pay book of Ryan at all

[02:49:48.590 --> 02:49:52.690]
Not that we paid him anytime recently. They haven't paid him in three months. You want to know why did they have the money?

[02:49:52.690 --> 02:49:54.730]
Of course not they haven't got any money

[02:49:55.690 --> 02:50:00.550]
Book of Ryan hasn't gotten paid in three months. What are we gonna do about that? He's gonna stand hold not on us

[02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:05.770]
And I record that funny guy stuff that he records and then that one guy that hates him like poison won't have anything to bitch

[02:50:05.770 --> 02:50:09.830]
And belly ache about you see it's like a chain reaction. It's like a fat stomato effect here

[02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.950]
Yeah

[02:50:12.350 --> 02:50:13.970]

Yeah, okay.

[02:55:59.250 --> 02:56:00.430]
Okay, one call after that.

[02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:01.610]
Here's the mobile and Delray.

[02:56:01.770 --> 02:56:01.950]

Hey, no.

[02:56:03.490 --> 02:56:03.830]
Yes, sir.

[02:56:05.190 --> 02:56:08.730]
I was in the fire, John, about 75 over the weekend.

[02:56:09.530 --> 02:56:13.970]
And it's something that I've seen before, a dog running loose in the back of a pickup truck.

[02:56:14.170 --> 02:56:14.610]
Oh, I hate it.

[02:56:14.770 --> 02:56:15.430]
I can't stand it.

[02:56:15.570 --> 02:56:16.170]
I hate those people.

[02:56:16.190 --> 02:56:17.690]
Those people ought to be shot with their own shotgun.

[02:56:18.190 --> 02:56:21.790]
Well, the worst part, I have my cousin riding and my grandmother on the back seat.

[02:56:22.510 --> 02:56:25.510]
But I thought we were gonna get it left because it's young for me.

[02:56:25.790 --> 02:56:27.770]
Okay, well listen, I haven't had the experience.

[02:56:27.970 --> 02:56:30.750]
I had some mystical thing on your phone because it's crept out.

[02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.730]
But I have a nice life.

[02:56:31.730 --> 02:56:34.950]
Okay, five, six, seven, oh five, six, eight, let's get this thing started again here.

[02:56:35.270 --> 02:56:36.290]
We got 25 minutes to go.

[02:56:36.370 --> 02:56:36.790]
Can we do it?

[02:56:36.790 --> 02:56:36.930]
No.

[02:56:37.450 --> 02:56:38.510]
And see, they're excusing me.

[02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:40.590]
Well, you're talking all those silly buggy horse names.

[02:56:40.830 --> 02:56:41.270]
Well, you know what?

[02:56:41.310 --> 02:56:41.650]
Too bad.

[02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:42.810]
It's pretty goddamn entertaining.

[02:56:43.810 --> 02:56:44.450]
You're entied.

[02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:49.630]
It's the most entertaining thing going on in this town right now by far, by a million miles,

[02:56:49.870 --> 02:56:52.550]
by a country trillion miles, make no mistake about it.

[02:56:52.610 --> 02:56:52.830]
Okay.

[02:56:53.270 --> 02:56:54.670]
Just ask me, I'll be telling you.

[02:56:55.190 --> 02:56:56.570]
Even the smarts you're going to with.

[02:56:58.670 --> 02:57:00.330]
Here's a call in Bokeh.

[02:57:00.430 --> 02:57:00.550]
Hello.

[02:57:03.050 --> 02:57:03.770]
Yes, sir.

[02:57:04.310 --> 02:57:08.150]
Ah, was listening to your show today must be nothing happening out there.

[02:57:08.410 --> 02:57:08.650]
Yeah.

[02:57:09.030 --> 02:57:14.250]
I was wondering with you any comments about Riley sending the two boys home that showed up.

[02:57:14.370 --> 02:57:17.570]
This isn't this isn't this isn't the sports you're we don't talk about the NBA.

[02:57:18.810 --> 02:57:20.090]
Well, I thought it was entertainment.

[02:57:20.090 --> 02:57:21.430]
I didn't know it was sports.

[02:57:21.850 --> 02:57:22.730]
Uh, but he.

[02:57:22.990 --> 02:57:24.390]
No, no, it is not entertainment.

[02:57:24.670 --> 02:57:25.970]
That's why nobody goes to see it.

[02:57:25.970 --> 02:57:27.250]
That's right exactly.

[02:57:27.470 --> 02:57:27.830]
Oh, okay.

[02:57:27.870 --> 02:57:28.230]
Thank you.

[02:57:28.410 --> 02:57:28.510]
No.

[02:57:28.730 --> 02:57:31.730]
Call up one of the sports that shows I heard I'm talking about that this morning.

[02:57:31.870 --> 02:57:34.550]
I'm sure that the rest of the day they'll be talking about that some too.

[02:57:35.270 --> 02:57:37.390]
Nobody here cares about that about sports or ball.

[02:57:37.470 --> 02:57:37.730]
Okay.

[02:57:37.930 --> 02:57:38.530]
What freak ball?

[02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:40.030]
We don't care about it.

[02:57:40.090 --> 02:57:40.450]
It's crap.

[02:57:41.330 --> 02:57:43.690]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the house are survey coming.

[02:57:43.910 --> 02:57:50.550]
Which of these areas in South Florida is the most plastic, plastic underlined in italics in dark blacks picking the smarts?

[02:57:51.370 --> 02:57:55.710]
The answer is South Beach 187 out of 182 votes.

[02:57:55.710 --> 02:57:59.590]
So far 187 almost 50%.

[02:58:00.430 --> 02:58:04.070]
Bokas the only contender 140 36.6%.

[02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:09.230]
Way back to the gables with 24 call springs with 22 and coconut grow has a measly.

[02:58:09.290 --> 02:58:10.010]
Yeah, votes.

[02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:12.150]
How do you like that?

[02:58:12.690 --> 02:58:14.310]
So it's strictly a two house race.

[02:58:14.670 --> 02:58:18.270]
South Beach and Boka and the South Beach teams the winning hands down your pants.

[02:58:18.710 --> 02:58:23.370]
All you steroid induced the phonies with a lot of jewelry and a lot of whatever.

[02:58:24.610 --> 02:58:26.050]
Any street people are on South Beach?

[02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.290]
No.

[02:58:26.470 --> 02:58:27.050]
Two or three.

[02:58:29.210 --> 02:58:29.990]
The girls name.

[02:58:30.030 --> 02:58:35.530]
Oh, and there was a thing in the yesterday's paper that I forgot to mention about the bloom is off the rose or maybe it's in this morning's paper.

[02:58:35.970 --> 02:58:38.010]
And that South Beach a lot of the kids are not going to the clubs.

[02:58:38.290 --> 02:58:42.290]
Since they kept all the young people the 18 to 21 year old were off the beach made a nice move there.

[02:58:42.670 --> 02:58:48.150]
See when you have young people from 18 on up, it gives the impression that this is a happening trendy hot place.

[02:58:48.430 --> 02:58:51.270]
And when they start making all these restrictions, well guess what?

[02:58:51.270 --> 02:58:55.810]
Then the people start going what they want to feel less restricted like right across the bay there in New Miami.

[02:58:56.190 --> 02:59:00.470]
Where does all kinds of clubs that are open like to will be hours in the morning and more and more of the young people are going to.

[02:59:01.470 --> 02:59:10.190]
And of course when you read that article and you stop to think of it, be precautions of that because South Beach basically is based on being the trendy spot where you do understand what trendy means.

[02:59:10.490 --> 02:59:21.170]
Trendy means like temporary as in right now all the plastic, all the movie stars, all the celebrities, all the wannabes, all the people that are running around from one of these clubs to another making sure that everybody sees them.

[02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:25.470]
Well guess what Miami beat today and someplace else tomorrow.

[02:59:26.650 --> 02:59:31.150]
So what's going to happen when the bloom is off the rose and all those clubs are closed.

[02:59:31.950 --> 02:59:34.830]
All the old people move back and everybody starts getting the hose.

[02:59:35.050 --> 02:59:37.910]
I mean, all the people into our from the same.

[02:59:38.570 --> 02:59:40.010]
See you're not your steven on my good material.

[02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:41.530]
Steven on my from those.

[02:59:41.650 --> 02:59:41.990]
What did you say?

[02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:42.470]
Hose.

[02:59:44.050 --> 02:59:44.930]
So anyway.

[02:59:47.590 --> 02:59:52.470]
And seriously, then they're going to say, well you know that Barbara Kappett, man, maybe she didn't have yellow teeth after all.

[02:59:53.050 --> 02:59:55.130]
Maybe she was wrong about Virginia Beach.

[02:59:55.370 --> 02:59:57.130]
Don't need gamble or whatever the hell she was saying.

[02:59:57.410 --> 03:00:03.290]
And all we need is our Ducco because once all of that plastic crap fades away down there, then what are we going to do?

[03:00:03.630 --> 03:00:08.010]
Then they'll all go over wherever else, whatever it becomes hot next and you know how the fags are.

[03:00:08.190 --> 03:00:09.590]
We go for the game.

[03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:10.730]
We borrow less about five weeks.

[03:00:10.890 --> 03:00:13.450]
You know, that's it because then we get tired of it.

[03:00:13.610 --> 03:00:15.350]
We have about RC Farsi trendy, you know.

[03:00:16.690 --> 03:00:17.950]
So then what will it be down there?

[03:00:19.590 --> 03:00:19.950]
Retires.

[03:00:20.350 --> 03:00:22.630]
Yeah, then we'll bring the old we'll bring the old Cubans down there.

[03:00:23.130 --> 03:00:24.730]
We'll bring the old green tooth people down there.

[03:00:25.390 --> 03:00:27.950]
Put back up South Beach to the dog, the kennel club back down there.

[03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:28.690]
Turf pub.

[03:00:30.250 --> 03:00:31.230]
Domino park east.

[03:00:31.410 --> 03:00:31.630]
Yeah.

[03:00:32.250 --> 03:00:32.850]
Fats domino.

[03:00:33.150 --> 03:00:34.990]
We're in a Fats domino with the dog track down there.

[03:00:35.090 --> 03:00:36.130]
Doesn't Miami Beach kennel club?

[03:00:37.310 --> 03:00:38.510]
Oh, no, Schwarzenegger's a lot.

[03:00:38.510 --> 03:00:38.930]
I'm sorry.

[03:00:39.130 --> 03:00:41.310]
Robert play some of his music on the PA anyway.

[03:00:42.430 --> 03:00:43.630]
Play some Pat Blun records.

[03:00:43.810 --> 03:00:44.270]
He was on Dot.

[03:00:45.690 --> 03:00:47.790]
Yeah, see, how do you see Bob Poker-Blime right in this morning?

[03:00:48.050 --> 03:00:48.830]
Very snazzy.

[03:00:48.930 --> 03:00:50.770]
Instead of the stupid many of this, he was bringing in.

[03:00:50.910 --> 03:00:56.650]
He's pressing his own CDs and he's got the Dot labor on there, which I bet your Pat Blun is jealous about that.

[03:00:56.830 --> 03:00:59.210]
And Billy Vaughan too, as in Taylor Long's Libby Moon.

[03:01:00.250 --> 03:01:01.010]
Well, I'll tell you.

[03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:01.470]
My memories.

[03:01:01.630 --> 03:01:06.530]
I'll tell you yesterday, maybe it was the episode we'll see in that dog get off right in front of me there on Sunrise Boulevard,

[03:01:06.530 --> 03:01:07.990]
which that was a terrible thing.

[03:01:08.370 --> 03:01:10.590]
Maybe it was making that big comeback at the track last night.

[03:01:11.210 --> 03:01:14.970]
Maybe it was losing those billions of dollars on the market in paper, of course, on the yesterday.

[03:01:16.030 --> 03:01:16.730]
Whatever it was.

[03:01:16.990 --> 03:01:20.350]
Maybe it was hearing that story about the rumors in the psychic and Jeff Cwang on the couch.

[03:01:23.190 --> 03:01:24.490]
Yeah, ask Gives.

[03:01:24.670 --> 03:01:24.850]
Why?

[03:01:30.390 --> 03:01:35.710]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on EAT and T and Verizon wireless line.

[03:01:37.470 --> 03:01:38.550]
How about Merritt Dokey?

[03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:42.150]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[03:01:42.310 --> 03:01:42.410]
Hello.

[03:01:42.970 --> 03:01:43.530]
Mr. Rogers.

[03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:44.530]
Tony Voice.

[03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:45.530]
That's not a phone.

[03:01:45.550 --> 03:01:46.250]
Is this real voice?

[03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:46.590]
Okay.

[03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:47.950]
Yeah, I'll send you to New York.

[03:01:48.210 --> 03:01:48.770]
You're from New York?

[03:01:48.930 --> 03:01:49.830]
Yeah, I just came down.

[03:01:50.170 --> 03:01:50.330]
Yeah.

[03:01:50.590 --> 03:01:51.670]
And, um, Tony Voice.

[03:01:52.050 --> 03:01:52.530]
Yeah, I was wonderful.

[03:01:52.530 --> 03:01:53.870]
Definitely a phoney voice.

[03:01:53.950 --> 03:01:54.350]
It's not.

[03:01:54.630 --> 03:01:55.190]
It's a phoney voice.

[03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:56.770]
I wonder if I give you a big kiss, though.

[03:01:57.090 --> 03:01:57.390]
Oh, what?

[03:01:57.690 --> 03:01:57.910]
I will.

[03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.890]
Yeah, kiss this.

[03:01:59.410 --> 03:01:59.970]
Phoney voice.

[03:02:01.090 --> 03:02:01.910]
Here's Coral Gables.

[03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:02.230]
Hello.

[03:02:02.730 --> 03:02:03.270]
Oh, great.

[03:02:03.370 --> 03:02:04.050]
I got to follow that.

[03:02:04.230 --> 03:02:04.430]
Yeah.

[03:02:04.810 --> 03:02:05.130]
Terrific.

[03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:06.950]
We like to make it easy for you.

[03:02:07.450 --> 03:02:07.770]
Oh, yeah.

[03:02:08.010 --> 03:02:15.130]
Hey, listen, I will quickly, um, not, why don't you add your intervals about the, um, Marlin's not choosing Boston's in your park to pick their, uh...

[03:02:15.130 --> 03:02:15.330]
Oh, yeah.

[03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:16.690]
I had a lot to do with that, yeah.

[03:02:17.050 --> 03:02:18.030]
Well, I guess you helped a little bit.

[03:02:18.050 --> 03:02:18.610]
No, I did not.

[03:02:18.830 --> 03:02:21.070]
No, I had no, I had no, I had no attention to me.

[03:02:21.070 --> 03:02:21.550]
Okay.

[03:02:21.550 --> 03:02:22.210]
Okay, no problem.

[03:02:22.490 --> 03:02:32.510]
Listen, but, uh, our mayor, uh, Crazy Joe says he wants to move up this game, boulevard, two, um, 200 feet or something to the east of the Bay or something like that, for the new city and park west.

[03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.810]
Yeah.

[03:02:32.810 --> 03:02:34.750]
I've got a bit of a specific for Crazy Joe there.

[03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:39.970]
How about, if they take Miami, Banana Land County and move it where it should belong, that's not even out of stock.

[03:02:40.110 --> 03:02:40.750]
What do you think about that?

[03:02:40.810 --> 03:02:41.210]
Okay, great.

[03:02:41.310 --> 03:02:42.050]
Have a nice day, pal.

[03:02:42.670 --> 03:02:44.010]
We've had a real good show here today.

[03:02:44.010 --> 03:02:44.810]
We're having a lot of fun.

[03:02:44.930 --> 03:02:45.690]
Just keep it in light.

[03:02:45.870 --> 03:02:47.350]
Not getting all whipped up into a friend.

[03:02:47.370 --> 03:02:48.830]
You were the same old, tired, bullcrap.

[03:02:48.830 --> 03:02:53.330]
See, I hate to break the news to you, sir, but a lot of us who live down here, we're tired of all that old crap.

[03:02:53.550 --> 03:02:54.430]
You know, we're tired of it.

[03:02:54.510 --> 03:02:58.150]
We don't care anymore about Crazy Joe and about Mayor Penga, Pakenia.

[03:02:58.550 --> 03:03:00.130]
And, uh, we, you know, enough of that already.

[03:03:00.290 --> 03:03:03.290]
If you want to do it around and dick with that the rest of your life, be my guest, you know.

[03:03:04.030 --> 03:03:05.510]
We're, we're, we're going to enjoy life.

[03:03:06.210 --> 03:03:07.930]
Nobody cares about this garbage.

[03:03:08.530 --> 03:03:11.830]
About this, and this, this just repetitious swirl, you know.

[03:03:12.470 --> 03:03:14.890]
Narotic repetition, that's what this time, yeah, feeds on.

[03:03:15.290 --> 03:03:16.110]
They're yanking it.

[03:03:17.330 --> 03:03:18.390]
What, what am I smelling?

[03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:21.690]
Did he put my nail polish in there again or something?

[03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:24.010]
Burped, a kind of burped that I don't even know that.

[03:03:24.470 --> 03:03:25.210]
What, what is that?

[03:03:25.410 --> 03:03:26.730]
He's like putting it all his hair.

[03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.870]

[03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.950]

[03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:28.610]
I'll be moving on his head or something like that.

[03:03:29.290 --> 03:03:30.770]
I think it's the grop, though, that you smell.

[03:03:31.110 --> 03:03:32.830]
He actually groped like that?

[03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:34.670]
No, not like that.

[03:03:35.090 --> 03:03:38.630]
Oh, there's something in here that stinks like, uh, wow.

[03:03:38.910 --> 03:03:41.330]
Like maybe Todd Dreck is back in the building because it smells like Dreck.

[03:03:42.170 --> 03:03:44.110]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, now I want to see him.

[03:03:44.130 --> 03:03:44.890]
Why does it say Baltimore?

[03:03:44.890 --> 03:03:45.470]
There's another one here again.

[03:03:45.490 --> 03:03:46.470]
We don't have one.

[03:03:46.470 --> 03:03:47.830]
I want another fake call from Baltimore.

[03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.250]
Hello.

[03:03:48.490 --> 03:03:49.850]
No, not a fake call, though.

[03:03:50.130 --> 03:03:52.090]
How do we have two calls in one day from Baltimore?

[03:03:52.350 --> 03:03:53.370]
No, I didn't hear the other one.

[03:03:53.690 --> 03:03:55.810]
No, actually, here's a double whammy.

[03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.190]
Okay.

[03:03:56.190 --> 03:03:57.690]
Groping Cleveland, move to four of Myers.

[03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:58.370]
How's that one?

[03:03:58.610 --> 03:03:59.050]
You did what?

[03:03:59.290 --> 03:04:01.130]
I'm groping Cleveland, move to four of Myers.

[03:04:01.490 --> 03:04:01.710]
Yeah.

[03:04:01.850 --> 03:04:02.730]
That's a double whammy, though.

[03:04:02.910 --> 03:04:04.430]
Why does it say Baltimore here?

[03:04:04.650 --> 03:04:06.610]
Because I just moved out of four of Myers back to Baltimore.

[03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:07.190]
All right.

[03:04:07.850 --> 03:04:08.210]
Congratulations.

[03:04:08.610 --> 03:04:09.230]
You're right in the rounds.

[03:04:09.430 --> 03:04:10.390]
What goes around comes around.

[03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:14.230]
The only thing we do miss about South Florida's year show, I mean.

[03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:17.590]
You're not missing that much anyway, because four Myers has cut it down to two hours of

[03:04:17.590 --> 03:04:19.970]
day anyway, and they're looking for other crap to put on there.

[03:04:20.170 --> 03:04:23.230]
If they can sell a dollar or a holler, they take us off, hang off, whatever.

[03:04:23.710 --> 03:04:24.890]
So you're not going to hear it there anyway.

[03:04:25.230 --> 03:04:26.730]
Yeah, I heard that guy call about syndication.

[03:04:26.830 --> 03:04:27.570]
Hey, you got the internet.

[03:04:27.870 --> 03:04:28.550]
Two to the end, listen.

[03:04:28.690 --> 03:04:29.070]
That's right.

[03:04:29.350 --> 03:04:30.070]
You have one of the few.

[03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:33.370]
You have one of the few internet sites you can actually listen to for more than 30 seconds

[03:04:33.370 --> 03:04:35.270]
before the signal completely goes away.

[03:04:35.410 --> 03:04:35.590]
Really?

[03:04:35.910 --> 03:04:36.550]
So congratulations.

[03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:37.750]
How does this sound on the internet?

[03:04:37.990 --> 03:04:38.130]
Okay.

[03:04:38.330 --> 03:04:39.050]
Actually, sounds fine.

[03:04:39.250 --> 03:04:39.430]
Good.

[03:04:39.430 --> 03:04:40.670]
Four hours a day right here.

[03:04:40.870 --> 03:04:41.910]
Too bad there's not ratings, right?

[03:04:41.910 --> 03:04:42.710]
Nice one.

[03:04:43.470 --> 03:04:45.210]
Hey, we live in the old enough church bush.

[03:04:45.370 --> 03:04:45.930]
Okay, thanks.

[03:04:48.090 --> 03:04:49.050]
5, 6, 7, 0.

[03:04:49.150 --> 03:04:52.550]
It smells like some kind of disinfectant or something in here.

[03:04:52.930 --> 03:04:54.370]
Or maybe they're putting poison to the vent.

[03:04:54.510 --> 03:04:55.950]
Maybe muffled, put them up to it.

[03:04:56.670 --> 03:04:59.530]
Maybe muffs got the bomb, or maybe it's just removed.

[03:05:00.350 --> 03:05:01.290]
It smells like booze.

[03:05:02.490 --> 03:05:04.050]
It smells like Bob Ramuth.

[03:05:04.290 --> 03:05:07.430]
Bob Ramuth, by the way, says, thanks for those great little burgers, Pete.

[03:05:09.630 --> 03:05:10.850]
144-560-QIM.

[03:05:10.850 --> 03:05:11.290]
That's a good one.

[03:05:11.290 --> 03:05:12.670]
I'm glad you're blessed, that's beautiful.

[03:05:13.130 --> 03:05:15.050]
Here with me up into the morning.

[03:05:15.410 --> 03:05:16.070]
It's your life.

[03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:18.730]
And then I cut my deep ear inside.

[03:05:19.890 --> 03:05:21.670]
Where are my stenchels?

[03:05:22.110 --> 03:05:23.410]
I'm looking on the bone out.

[03:05:23.810 --> 03:05:25.930]
It's the way up by my diorama.

[03:05:26.610 --> 03:05:28.510]
I mean, carefully place it.

[03:05:28.990 --> 03:05:30.250]
My throat is in the back.

[03:05:30.970 --> 03:05:32.590]
It makes me all different.

[03:05:33.270 --> 03:05:35.790]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:35.930 --> 03:05:36.310]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:36.830 --> 03:05:38.630]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:39.070 --> 03:05:39.390]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:40.030 --> 03:05:40.450]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:40.690 --> 03:05:40.830]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.830]

[03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.830]

[03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.830]

[03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.830]

[03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.830]

[03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.830]

[03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:46.310]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:46.310 --> 03:05:46.550]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:48.890 --> 03:05:49.930]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:53.250 --> 03:05:53.690]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:54.290 --> 03:05:55.710]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:56.310 --> 03:05:57.130]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:57.730 --> 03:05:58.170]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:58.170 --> 03:05:58.210]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:59.190]
It's the way up here.

[03:05:59.710 --> 03:06:01.150]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:02.130 --> 03:06:02.750]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:03.130 --> 03:06:04.750]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:05.090 --> 03:06:05.170]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:05.710 --> 03:06:05.850]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:05.850 --> 03:06:05.850]

[03:06:05.850 --> 03:06:06.230]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.390]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:06.950]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:06.950 --> 03:06:07.130]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.190]

[03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.390]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:07.510 --> 03:06:07.690]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:07.770 --> 03:06:08.190]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:09.090 --> 03:06:10.810]
It's the way up here.

[03:06:10.810 --> 03:06:11.570]
Yeah, we know.

[03:06:11.850 --> 03:06:13.310]
148 is 560 WQ.

[03:06:13.310 --> 03:06:14.570]
I'm happy Tuesday to you.

[03:06:15.050 --> 03:06:15.390]
I'm happy Tuesday to you.

[03:06:15.390 --> 03:06:16.410]
Well, I just, I don't know what it is.

[03:06:16.510 --> 03:06:17.130]
Maybe it's only me.

[03:06:17.290 --> 03:06:17.310]
Maybe it's only me.

[03:06:17.310 --> 03:06:17.990]
Call me crazy.

[03:06:18.250 --> 03:06:18.410]
Call me crazy.

[03:06:18.430 --> 03:06:20.630]
But I just have this feeling that the human race has turned

[03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:21.190]
the corner there.

[03:06:21.310 --> 03:06:22.210]
I feel like something gigantic.

[03:06:22.210 --> 03:06:22.350]
I feel like something gigantic.

[03:06:22.850 --> 03:06:25.290]
Maybe the BN that I'm trying to was still off till two o'clock.

[03:06:26.430 --> 03:06:27.090]
Maybe the BN that I'm trying to was still off till two o'clock.

[03:06:27.090 --> 03:06:27.850]
Maybe the BN that I'm trying to was still off till two o'clock.

[03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:31.090]
Maybe the BN that I'm trying to was still off till two o'clock.

[03:06:31.570 --> 03:06:40.790]
Maybe the BN that I'm trying to was still off till two o'clock.

[03:06:41.650 --> 03:06:42.930]
I smell a tiny food.

[03:06:43.070 --> 03:06:44.030]
Believe me, I know my sauce.

[03:06:44.470 --> 03:06:45.670]
Now, what does that ponytail wanted?

[03:06:45.890 --> 03:06:46.010]
What?

[03:06:48.330 --> 03:06:52.370]
You have to be able spots are being taped today as we speak.

[03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.790]
Right.

[03:06:53.230 --> 03:06:55.990]
And he wanted you to make a cameo so that your beautiful pose

[03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.830]
could be on the spot.

[03:06:57.250 --> 03:06:58.230]
Like it was the last time.

[03:06:58.570 --> 03:06:58.750]
Yeah.

[03:06:59.010 --> 03:07:01.710]
Which, of course, they taped during an appearance, which made a lot of sense.

[03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.610]
I'll think about it.

[03:07:02.710 --> 03:07:04.070]
Is Tana gonna be naked in the shower there?

[03:07:04.110 --> 03:07:04.650]
I'll think about it.

[03:07:04.690 --> 03:07:05.030]
What is it?

[03:07:06.570 --> 03:07:09.190]
See, look, do I have a nose for food?

[03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:10.410]
And you wonder why I'm fat?

[03:07:11.710 --> 03:07:12.530]
No, I don't want it.

[03:07:12.630 --> 03:07:16.370]
From the moment that that stuff arrived out there, I said I stared like,

[03:07:16.510 --> 03:07:18.730]
because we're yards away from wherever that is.

[03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.650]
And plus we're inside.

[03:07:19.650 --> 03:07:23.730]
I'm inside like in a closed studio with another studio where they're,

[03:07:23.890 --> 03:07:25.210]
ah, I can't believe it.

[03:07:25.430 --> 03:07:26.330]
I just can't believe it.

[03:07:26.730 --> 03:07:28.530]
But I can smell all the way from out there to here.

[03:07:28.730 --> 03:07:30.710]
Of course, actually, what happened is it's really coming through the vents,

[03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:31.390]
not through the doors.

[03:07:32.210 --> 03:07:33.230]
Oh, it smells really good.

[03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:36.410]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[03:07:36.910 --> 03:07:37.290]
Hey, Neil.

[03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.950]
Yes, sir.

[03:07:37.950 --> 03:07:40.610]
Hey, on the subject of the dogs and cats and all that.

[03:07:40.770 --> 03:07:40.910]
Yeah.

[03:07:41.070 --> 03:07:46.090]
I just wanted to let you know I have a female black lab with six confirmed kills

[03:07:46.090 --> 03:07:48.350]
within the confines of her own yards.

[03:07:48.350 --> 03:07:49.710]
You was not running loose.

[03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:53.890]
And, ah, that dog ever had.

[03:07:54.350 --> 03:07:54.550]
Yeah.

[03:07:55.950 --> 03:07:56.770]
Thanks a lot, Neil.

[03:07:57.010 --> 03:07:57.270]
Okay.

[03:07:58.210 --> 03:07:58.890]
What do you say?

[03:07:59.950 --> 03:08:03.650]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[03:08:03.930 --> 03:08:05.330]
And for eyes on wireless line.

[03:08:06.510 --> 03:08:09.150]
You know, after I have this gigantic bowel movement at two o'clock,

[03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:10.070]
I'm really going to feel good.

[03:08:10.190 --> 03:08:14.370]
No, that's just like it's like getting the last vestiges of something evil out of your system.

[03:08:15.170 --> 03:08:17.370]
Like Sigourney Weaver, you know, an alien.

[03:08:18.750 --> 03:08:20.830]
Something horrendous is going to come popping out, I think.

[03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:23.510]
Yeah.

[03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:27.790]
Maybe it's going to be like many muffs.

[03:08:28.930 --> 03:08:30.730]
Here's a mobile in Cooper City. Hello.

[03:08:31.210 --> 03:08:32.250]
Hey, Neil. How's it going?

[03:08:32.350 --> 03:08:32.610]
Okay.

[03:08:33.270 --> 03:08:34.530]
Happy blood anniversary.

[03:08:34.770 --> 03:08:35.070]
Thanks.

[03:08:35.070 --> 03:08:37.650]
And, ah, real quick, a cat story.

[03:08:37.970 --> 03:08:39.690]
I've done a dog personal in my life.

[03:08:39.890 --> 03:08:43.490]
And, ah, you know, my wife brings home this cat one day.

[03:08:43.730 --> 03:08:43.770]
Oh.

[03:08:43.770 --> 03:08:45.910]
And I don't know anything about this animal.

[03:08:46.390 --> 03:08:46.590]
Right.

[03:08:47.090 --> 03:08:50.050]
So, you know, one day, this cat's rubbing against my leg.

[03:08:50.050 --> 03:08:52.710]
And, you know, my wife's gone, oh, you know, look what the cat's doing.

[03:08:52.910 --> 03:08:55.410]
So, next, you know, it's biting a hunk out of my leg.

[03:08:55.830 --> 03:08:56.770]
I'm going to lie to do that.

[03:08:56.890 --> 03:08:57.690]
Because, oh, it's hungry.

[03:08:57.870 --> 03:08:58.590]
You didn't feed it fast enough.

[03:08:58.590 --> 03:08:59.490]
It was biting a hunk?

[03:08:59.830 --> 03:09:00.770]
Yeah, it was biting a hunk.

[03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.430]
I've done it.

[03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:04.390]
So then the next morning, it's, ah, licking my hand.

[03:09:04.390 --> 03:09:06.590]
And then my wife's gone, oh, look, it's licking your hand.

[03:09:06.690 --> 03:09:07.910]
And again, bites my hand.

[03:09:07.970 --> 03:09:08.890]
I go, why do you do that?

[03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:11.050]
Because, well, I'm not going to bite into a dirty hand.

[03:09:11.130 --> 03:09:11.330]
Yeah.

[03:09:11.690 --> 03:09:13.090]
Because you're not feeding it fast enough.

[03:09:13.390 --> 03:09:15.050]
You know, you know what else does that?

[03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:16.770]
No, not to interrupt.

[03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:18.170]
But, ah, brudes do that, too.

[03:09:18.250 --> 03:09:19.510]
Like, if you get a parrot or a perky,

[03:09:19.810 --> 03:09:20.430]
don't do that, too.

[03:09:20.490 --> 03:09:20.990]
That bites you.

[03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.710]
Ah.

[03:09:22.450 --> 03:09:25.270]
So, you know, if I go to the fire station one day,

[03:09:25.570 --> 03:09:27.270]
and there's two little kittens there,

[03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:29.890]
and a fireman are feeding it, and all that, and it's cold out.

[03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:32.670]
And, the next morning, you know, I get a sun-my-carn,

[03:09:32.670 --> 03:09:35.110]
and I take her up the bed, and I'm like, what the hell was that?

[03:09:35.830 --> 03:09:38.350]
So, next thing you know, I'm not thinking anything of it.

[03:09:38.470 --> 03:09:40.930]
And the guys are running out, and next thing you know,

[03:09:41.010 --> 03:09:42.850]
there's a big kitten underneath where I had my cat.

[03:09:42.850 --> 03:09:43.950]
It was an ad ashamed.

[03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:46.090]
Oh, what a bad break.

[03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:48.570]
So, the worst thing I did, I said, oh, well, the only thing,

[03:09:48.730 --> 03:09:50.590]
you know, they say, you know, they say, you don't have a good cat,

[03:09:50.790 --> 03:09:51.210]
they're dead cat.

[03:09:51.430 --> 03:09:52.510]
You guys have a cockney sense.

[03:09:52.930 --> 03:09:56.210]
I guess the message there is payback is a bitch, huh?

[03:09:56.390 --> 03:09:56.650]
Ah.

[03:09:57.170 --> 03:09:58.170]
All right, now have a good day.

[03:09:58.310 --> 03:09:58.790]
Okay, thanks.

[03:09:58.930 --> 03:10:00.390]
I guess my fault will be biting you no more.

[03:10:01.050 --> 03:10:03.470]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60.

[03:10:03.670 --> 03:10:04.990]
What? Now, what exactly is out there?

[03:10:05.010 --> 03:10:08.550]
Because it smells just, I mean overpowering, overpowering.

[03:10:09.450 --> 03:10:10.070]
What is it?

[03:10:10.230 --> 03:10:10.990]
Pasta and sausage.

[03:10:11.610 --> 03:10:12.450]
Pasta and sausage?

[03:10:13.890 --> 03:10:14.590]
Who's there for?

[03:10:14.850 --> 03:10:16.050]
I was probably for a hank in the crowd.

[03:10:16.250 --> 03:10:17.210]
Well, a hank's not here today.

[03:10:17.850 --> 03:10:18.810]
They probably ordered it.

[03:10:19.250 --> 03:10:19.730]
Who's there?

[03:10:20.270 --> 03:10:21.990]
They, the, the people.

[03:10:22.190 --> 03:10:22.430]
Our co multim..

[03:10:22.430 --> 03:10:23.190]
oppositioners?

[03:10:23.630 --> 03:10:25.390]
The, the little boy coider we got.

[03:10:25.490 --> 03:10:27.810]
Like, stugots and marquison burgundy, those guys.

[03:10:27.810 --> 03:10:27.910]
yes.

[03:10:29.350 --> 03:10:30.230]
chicken spaghetti.

[03:10:30.810 --> 03:10:31.530]
chicken spaghetti?

[03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.850]
good stuff.

[03:10:33.050 --> 03:10:35.650]
see we're teaching he's learned how to get the free food nice going.

[03:10:36.770 --> 03:10:37.290]
now what is your name?

[03:10:37.450 --> 03:10:37.670]
Clinton.

[03:10:38.390 --> 03:10:38.510]
what?

[03:10:38.790 --> 03:10:38.990]
Clinton.

[03:10:39.650 --> 03:10:39.890]
Curtis.

[03:10:40.590 --> 03:10:41.030]
Curtis?

[03:10:41.530 --> 03:10:42.070]
who's Clinton?

[03:10:43.450 --> 03:10:44.150]
former president?

[03:10:44.310 --> 03:10:44.490]
Clinton.

[03:10:45.090 --> 03:10:46.790]
no what I don't know I guess.

[03:10:46.990 --> 03:10:49.790]
I think that all these why can't you ever call anybody by the real name?

[03:10:50.110 --> 03:10:50.690]
here's Clinton.

[03:10:51.170 --> 03:10:51.690]

[03:10:51.970 --> 03:10:54.570]

I've never seen anybody see he doesn't have a complexion for that much sun when
