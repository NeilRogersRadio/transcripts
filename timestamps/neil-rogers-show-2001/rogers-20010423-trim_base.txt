[00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.040]
Why?

[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:02.940]
165.

[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.080]
And guess what?

[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.820]
He is with daddy.

[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.040]
He's not eating any happy meals, which is probably, he's going to live a hell of a lot longer

[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.680]
because of that.

[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.500]
Am I right?

[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.720]
Sure.

[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.080]
Sure.

[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.600]
No happy meals, no make death for Iliam.

[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.820]
Oh, speaking of great food, we're getting Ruth Chris for lunch today.

[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.440]
Let's hear it.

[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.400]
That's why I came in.

[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.180]
I don't know about George, but that's why I came in today.

[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.520]
We're getting Ruth Chris for lunch.

[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.840]
All in tomorrow, I'm going to bring in...

[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.160]
You better listen to me very carefully now.

[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.860]
I'm going to bring in and I tell you right now.

[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.560]
We know how I'm always talking about Atkins as the only way for me to combat diabetes

[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.880]
and blood sugar, but I can't do it because it's too hard to stay on and I have my sweet

[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.200]
tooth and make all these excuses.

[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.380]
One of his books, it's the one about longevity.

[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.340]
I can't think of them.

[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.100]
I'll bring it into tomorrow.

[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.100]
I should have brought it in this morning.

[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.380]
And he writes the reasons about you shouldn't be eating refined carbohydrates.

[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.200]
What sugar does inside your body?

[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.880]
There are these things in called AGEs.

[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.200]
Ages.

[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.600]
And what they do is says, what they do inside your body when you eat sugar, it's like

[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600]
when you brown meat, it does the same thing to the inside of your body.

[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.540]
You're nodding your head.

[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.260]
Are you familiar with that?

[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.960]
I've heard the principle.

[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.500]
You're going to get burning yourself up.

[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.780]
Yeah.

[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.420]
Don't get burnt up about it, but...

[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.880]
And if I'm going to bring that in, I'm going to paste that on my refrigerator door.

[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.180]
And since I read that, I read that I think Saturday morning.

[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.120]
I was going back over some of that book.

[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.740]
I was looking for some other information.

[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.160]
And I read about that.

[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.540]
Have I had any sugar since then?

[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.660]
No.

[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.420]
Any craddle?

[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.740]
No.

[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.640]
All these people, when they study the people that lives with you like 120, and they ask

[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.260]
them what they do, it's all low-cal, low-car.

[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.800]
Low-car.

[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.080]
When you eat them they refine carbohydrates, those are the Doritos and sugar windows, canibors.

[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.400]
You're frying your guts.

[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.980]
They did experiments with rats.

[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.340]
You're browning your meat.

[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.400]
How do you like that?

[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.320]
And those really crappy donuts ahead this morning.

[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.020]
Why did I eat that?

[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.500]
I mean, it's one thing to beat your meat, but don't heat your meat.

[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.980]
Okay?

[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.100]
Don't brown your meat.

[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.360]
I'm going to bring that into our read it on a year and people are going, ah, I...

[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.380]
They're going to be throwing your Snickers bars in the toilet.

[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.000]
Or something that looks like a Snickers bar.

[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.360]

[00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.900]
Here we are.

[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.800]
I knew that was a mint chocolate.

[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.440]
I said, how did you go from the kids on you?

[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.220]
Pen 13 to 560 W.C.

[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.160]
I just did something that's going to add years to my life, you know what it is.

[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.520]
I took the sports section of the hero and I taped it over the bottom part of the TV set.

[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.320]
I could have taped anything.

[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.400]
I mean, just happened to be handy.

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.580]
I'm not going to be looking at it again.

[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.860]
And so if anybody comes in here, wonders why the sports section of the hero is taped

[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.500]
to the screen on my TV set.

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.020]
It's covering up the park.

[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.060]
Because I want to watch CNN.

[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.100]
I thought I wanted to watch it, but I want to have it on.

[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.860]
In case something Earth-shaking happens, like if they have another...

[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.460]
The Peruvians go nuts again and shoot down some plane with some board of game Christians on it.

[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.480]
Or anything that would need to be known here since it's our only contact with the outside world.

[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.360]
So I want to have CNN going on there or whatever.

[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.440]
The RMS and BC.

[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.240]
But they all have that crawl on the bottom and since the market is tanking again today, I don't want to see it.

[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.240]
I mean, seeing it isn't going to change anything.

[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.520]
There's nothing I can do about it.

[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.580]
And psychologically, it's much more beneficial to me not to see it.

[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.520]
So that's a good idea for all your people out there.

[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.040]
It's taped something like some black crape would be good.

[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.200]
Across the bottom of your TV screen.

[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.920]
So they don't have to see that obnoxious crawl, which they feel compelled to put on there.

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.120]
So they can ruin your day.

[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.220]
Because like Mitch Herse says, the market tanks a lot.

[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.840]
And it's tanking again today.

[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.260]
Here's a mobile in Bokeh, hello.

[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.720]
Hi, Neil. How you doing today?

[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.340]
Okay, sir.

[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.280]
I hope you think they eat my bounce back tonight.

[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.760]
I really don't know and don't care.

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.600]
Oh, I, well, okay.

[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.780]
Oh, do I think they heat my bounce back tonight?

[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600]
Do I give one flying crap about the heat?

[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.640]
No, no.

[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.180]
Here's a mobile in Daniel.

[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.900]

[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.340]
Oh, okay, we're off and running again just like last Thursday and Friday.

[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.000]
Pick it up.

[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.200]
Even with the weekend in between.

[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.200]
We're right off where we left off last weekend.

[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.640]
Huh?

[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.080]
And do I think they eat it?

[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.620]
By the way, for that guy and anybody else like him, our poll on over the weekend,

[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.620]
how interested are you in the NFL draft?

[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.040]
We had a tremendous response 1170 votes of which 264 31.1% said,

[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.120]
if I hear the word draft again, I'll puke.

[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.640]
Some of interest at 321 27.4%, not at all 319 27.2%.

[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.620]
Interested a lot in the draft 166, only 14.1%.

[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.780]
Lifeless people out there who got sucked in by milk hyper and ESPN and all of a sudden felt that this was something very important.

[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.340]
Was it important?

[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.600]
No.

[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.440]
Was it a big happening?

[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.680]
No.

[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.980]
No.

[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.200]
But it's just like the thing with the story about that cutting guy and like the alien business.

[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.740]
The media sucks them in and they say, oh, yeah, you're right.

[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.800]
This is very important.

[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.600]
Let's have a big party.

[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.500]
Come on.

[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.740]
Party.

[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.860]
Yeah.

[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.380]
Yeah, what's life without a draft party?

[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.580]
Great article in the sunset all the day.

[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.560]
You know, I'm about one step away from just not taking any calls on the show anymore.

[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.060]
You know, I really am.

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.700]
I mean, we're all in long for weeks and all of a sudden last Thursday and Friday.

[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.820]
I wasn't even going to mention it because I figured, well, I have a weekend sober up and recuperate, you know.

[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.820]
I know the sublime Thursday and Friday.

[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.080]
It's like all crazy day.

[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.500]
Everybody in their brother on the phone is nutty than a fruit cake.

[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.620]
And we start off this morning and the first guy wants to know,

[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.920]
do I think they need to have a chance to bounce back tonight as if I give some flying crab eyes if this is a

[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.160]
sport.

[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.120]
Was it a sports show?

[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.580]
No.

[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.860]
As if I care about some seven foot tall sports is who cares?

[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.740]
And then we have the same morons, you know, that we picked off left off with last Thursday and Friday.

[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.100]
And you want to know why?

[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.620]
Because basically it doesn't make any difference how many days go by.

[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.380]
It's like when I went away for the summer last year for two and a half months.

[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.920]
And I came back to they have anything else to talk about?

[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.440]
Was it any different than it was before?

[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.720]
No.

[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.940]
It's the start floor of the main man.

[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.960]
You people have nothing to talk about.

[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.160]
You have nothing to say about anything.

[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.780]
Here's Miami Lakes.

[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.040]
Hello.

[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.300]
Hey, near the morning.

[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.820]
No, I don't know if you are aware of us.

[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.620]
So I'm all short draining for oil.

[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.900]
Meaning what?

[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.940]
Well, that the president approved the oil company to start offshore trading.

[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.280]
Yes.

[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.740]
Of course.

[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.820]
And by the governor of Florida.

[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.140]
No.

[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.120]
How about the draft?

[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.760]
How was the draft?

[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.240]
You like it?

[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.920]
See what I mean?

[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.060]
How about the heat?

[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.820]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.920]
They're going to wait tonight.

[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.320]
You know that?

[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.660]
Yeah.

[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.400]
And then we're going to make it all the way.

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.120]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.200]
And the super bowl too.

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.080]
We're going to win the super bowl.

[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.500]
Okay, good.

[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.120]
I think you belong at the bowl.

[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.680]
Yeah.

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.880]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.200]
Hello.

[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.580]
Yeah.

[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.360]
Good morning, Nail.

[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.840]
That sounds like you're really frosted about this type of phone.

[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.740]
That kid could be that's been taking pleasure.

[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.800]
Yeah.

[00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.840]
No, not.

[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.680]
Well, you know, it's just I get tired of hearing that the same old complaining

[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.840]
stop taking calls if you're not happy.

[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:07.360]
Yeah.

[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.620]
Monday, man, you're really setting a lousy tone for everyone out here.

[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.400]
Oh, I'm setting a lousy tone.

[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.680]
Yeah.

[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.120]
You are.

[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.840]
I'm setting a lousy tone.

[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.220]
And what are you doing?

[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.340]
I've tried to tune in to have a nice day because normally you're very pleasant.

[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.600]
I'm very, and it's very helpful.

[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.660]
Let me ask you something.

[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.760]
When I punched up the first line on the phone was I on pleasant.

[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.720]
I didn't say you were but I felt as change very, very quickly.

[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.460]
My what has your tone.

[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.740]
My tone has changed.

[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.320]
That's right.

[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.280]
And what about your tone?

[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.620]
Well, because you've frosted my ass.

[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.360]
What do you expect?

[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.160]
Well, that's good.

[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.500]
That's what I'm here for is the frost.

[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.340]
You're freaking ass in the bird hates your guts.

[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.660]
Yeah.

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.960]
Okay.

[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.300]
Yeah, rest in peace.

[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.280]
He's dead and he still hates my guts.

[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:51.960]
How do you like that?

[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.800]
The bird hates my guts.

[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.520]
Are you ready for that?

[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.180]
He died.

[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.100]
Yeah, he died.

[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.940]
There's the early bird and then there's the dead bird.

[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.520]
Oh, yeah, just I'm telling you it just continues.

[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.360]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.560]
See, that's a substitute for everything to say.

[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.760]
Is that whole song of dance that little dog and pony show he just put on first there?

[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:17.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.640]
That was beautiful.

[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.500]
And if you let him go long enough there, it comes out just like the, uh,

[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.980]
I've got a spec that called before that, uh,

[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.760]
pretending to talk about drilling off door and it starts in with his little routine.

[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.080]
It's like everything else that comes through this, that passes through this place.

[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.560]
Like I said on Friday, eventually they'll do their best to destroy it.

[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.500]
Don't make any difference to me like I told you before.

[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.580]
I'm not going anywhere.

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.720]
I get paid one way or the other.

[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.300]
So you can either play the game and have something to say humorous, intelligent,

[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.700]
amusing or just be a bunch of assholes makes no difference to me.

[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.860]
And it doesn't frost my ass.

[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.780]
I really, because I've got 25 years of it.

[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.940]
Whether it's the old people factored done, I had a blue lips factored done.

[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.220]
Or whether it's a bunch of young punks like that little spectre called before or

[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.200]
anybody in between it makes no difference.

[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.840]
Because one thing I've discovered here is generally speaking,

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.200]
they're pretty much all the same.

[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:12.940]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.880]
Yeah, like that.

[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.560]
Kind of like that.

[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.060]
Here's Cooper City.

[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:18.380]
Hello.

[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.620]
Oh,

[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.580]
we got lunch coming from Earth present noon.

[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.880]
You are just keep that in mind.

[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.120]
Oh, I haven't forgotten it.

[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.440]
That's why we can't do this really pleasant now by comparison.

[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.000]
That's right.

[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.700]
Just you could have been here instead.

[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.760]
Here's a mobile in fourth order today.

[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:38.940]
Hello.

[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.420]
You know, my kid, my kid 16 years old, he likes to show.

[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.920]
And I like to show.

[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.860]
I mean, I'm the one who turned it on.

[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.960]
Yeah, you're more on wood.

[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.980]
You're still an asshole.

[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.300]
Well, nice.

[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.240]
But you're welcome.

[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.640]
5 6 7 0 5 16.

[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.620]
They're all out there, each and every one of them.

[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.780]
I think I'm on the verge of a record today.

[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.980]
No, no, no, I'm just today, but Thursday Friday and today I think we were.

[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.920]
It's like a new streak.

[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.080]
We have a new kind of streak going now.

[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.340]
And what I see, I couldn't give in that pool that I was going to do for three days.

[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.840]
I might not even do it now because I'm so impressed by this.

[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.020]
I'm so just being used by this.

[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.240]
Just off the wall out of nowhere when you least expected like they like like.

[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.400]
Like we were talking about the pent up selling on the Wall Street with the excuse

[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.300]
for the market on Friday.

[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.520]
Pent up selling or some way to put some pent up buying myself.

[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.880]
And this is pent up for something.

[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:32.760]
Yeah.

[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.500]
Pent up.

[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.880]
Like you said.

[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.780]
Here's my me legs.

[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.040]
Hello.

[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.140]
Did you understand it?

[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.000]
My any heat.

[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:46.380]
Yeah.

[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.880]
Oh, my knee.

[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:47.280]
Yeah.

[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:47.800]
Oh, good.

[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.980]
Your ears are better than mine.

[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.100]
Here's my me Beach.

[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.340]
Hello.

[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.380]
How many do you go?

[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.780]
You're right.

[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:54.600]
That was blind.

[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.040]
Mike Jr.

[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.720]
I don't think that was the real thing.

[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.280]
Was that the real one?

[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.200]
No, there could have been.

[00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.380]
I don't know blind.

[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.580]
Mike don't call him blind.

[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.620]
Mike that was blind.

[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.480]
Mike as he keeps bumping into the phone.

[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.160]
This is because it's becoming like a SNM exercise for me now.

[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.800]
Here's my any hello morning.

[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.140]
Neil.

[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.000]
I am going to talk about a sporting event, but I hope it's something that you're.

[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.040]
You're a little bit more tolerant with.

[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.360]
I hope it's not the Marlins because they had another 5,000 people there for that game last night,

[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.020]
which your proves to me they need that new stadium.

[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.160]
Yeah, right.

[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.480]
No, not the my ones.

[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.860]
I happen to see up at Pompo no Park on Thursday night and.

[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.880]
Then I was not Pompo no Park on Thursday night.

[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.100]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:40.860]
Wednesday.

[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.740]
Wednesday night.

[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.780]
Tonight that's right.

[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:50.960]
And my question for you is I go to Pompo no Park and it's a beautiful place and we sit in the clubhouse and you watch the races and whatnot.

[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.720]
I love the third bridge though and I don't.

[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.040]
Highly well, I know you go.

[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:04.160]
But what's the matter with highly how come it is the biggest dump that I have a racetrack that I've ever seen and are they going to stop racing there?

[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.700]
Do I know if they're going to stop racing there?

[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.460]
They're getting like 2500 people a day.

[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.240]
So it's I don't know how long it can continue.

[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.800]
Why is it a dump because John Brunetti made it into a dump?

[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.340]
That's why.

[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.000]
Are you there?

[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.580]
And he's gone.

[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.020]
Okay.

[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.640]
Another great conversation.

[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.440]
560 7 0 5 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.620]
So I may have to track out Wednesday and why is higherly a such a dump?

[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.700]
Are you following that?

[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:31.940]
No.

[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.420]
No.

[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.180]
Because John Brunetti have made it into a toilet and keeps whining and moaning just like John Henry.

[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.540]
Want somebody to do something for him?

[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.180]
Maybe if you wouldn't made it into a toilet, John, maybe more people would be coming out there.

[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.220]
John Brunetti that is.

[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.220]
Here's a model in Miami Beach. Hello.

[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.360]
Hello, Neil.

[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.000]
Good morning.

[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.140]
Let's get the hell out of here.

[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.440]
The sun is out and answer that man.

[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.340]
Everybody's shitting outside having a BHA.

[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.060]
Are you through there?

[00:12:59.340 --> 00:12:59.480]
Yeah.

[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.400]
Okay.

[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.940]
What's happening?

[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.560]
Well, why everybody should crank you?

[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.000]
What's going on?

[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.920]
I have no idea.

[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.720]
I'm going to go to the O560, Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:08.600]
Thomas.

[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.140]
Here's a model in Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.420]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:13.800]
Okay.

[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.540]
You got any tickets for the gas box?

[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.040]
Yeah, I got tickets for you.

[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.680]
You're going to stick them?

[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.540]
Yeah, I got any tickets to see and it's like a bunch of little children.

[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.640]
And once the first one comes, then it's a cascade of lunacy, a cascade of idiots.

[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.860]
This is South Koreans doing what they do.

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.660]
What it was called doing what comes naturally.

[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.200]
Doing what they do best, being morons, assholes, etc.

[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.600]
They just, they, it's been pent up for so long and it hits like a flood now.

[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.920]
You know, it's like what's happened in the Mississippi.

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.060]
It's just like they're the damn opened.

[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.000]
The Dijk burst.

[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.980]
If I can say that, can I say Dijk?

[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.220]
No.

[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.060]
And it's just all like flowing forth.

[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.240]
26 after 10 at 560 WQM on a good night's sleep tonight.

[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.100]
These are just a few of the reasons why in a national survey, dial a mattress outscored every company with a customer satisfaction,

[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.620]
reading a better than 99 percent.

[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.020]
M-30-MAT-T-R-E-S.

[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.300]
Okay, I want to have a way from lunch time for Bruce Chris.

[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.420]
That's all we're here for today.

[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.880]
Great article by, actually it's yeah, an op-ed piece by Richard A. Busmeier in the Sunsettilus morning.

[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.960]
author is a resident of Book of Retone as all it says.

[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.200]
It says, atheist just want freedom from religion.

[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.080]
What a great art.

[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.220]
I might read it a little bit later, but why should we spoil the rule that the people are on now?

[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.100]
Why should we do that?

[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.660]
I didn't realize they actually had it in them for like a third day in a row.

[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:23.980]
Did you?

[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.520]
I couldn't imagine after a weekend in between, but they're miserable and frustrated because they're here.

[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.560]
And because everybody's bailed out Easter's gone, Paisasa's gone.

[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.680]
The demarcation point in the calendar is come and now all of them are left behind just here.

[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.960]
And we're here with them.

[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.280]
That's the sad part, not for long though.

[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.900]
Let's see today is what April 20th.

[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.800]
I'm thinking let's see June like the am.

[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.140]
They're two months from today, maybe.

[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.320]
Bye bye bye for a long time.

[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.880]
560, 7.0560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.240]
Greenpeace had some very huge peaceful demonstrations in Quebec over the weekend.

[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.300]
Did the media show those?

[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:05.600]
No.

[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.420]
No, they're too busy showing 100 demonstrators.

[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.240]
They were going nuts going ape shot.

[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.840]
And the people on CNN are like, myron candell.

[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.960]
Well, maybe we're guilty.

[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.800]
You know, we shouldn't be showing all the few small demonstrations.

[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.160]
And we're probably being guilty of it right now or the guilty here.

[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.180]
And then they're doing it.

[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.740]
They just they can't control themselves.

[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.780]
It's like these callers. They can't control themselves.

[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.180]
They can't stop. It's pet up and they have to let it out.

[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.980]
You know, it's what they are.

[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.060]
Here's homestead. Hello.

[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.680]
Yeah, hello.

[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.540]
They carry around a large bag of it.

[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.540]
Yeah, for that purpose.

[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:40.960]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.780]
And they figure out how it ain't nobody knows the difference anyway in your case.

[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.100]
560, 7.0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.220]
Oh, probably a same, you know, shade.

[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.400]
Same.

[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.900]
You maybe his name is even you for all we know.

[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.880]
Maybe he knows he away from the track.

[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.300]
Here's Evan.

[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:04.840]
Sure. Hello.

[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.080]
Evan sure.

[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.780]
Couldn't hang on to it.

[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.560]
Couldn't squeeze it out.

[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.440]
Mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.660]
Mobile in Miami.

[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.880]
Hello. Yes, sir.

[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:22.980]
I know.

[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.100]
Yeah, yeah. Hello.

[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.200]
Yes. Hello.

[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.120]
Mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.360]
Yes.

[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.540]
Now we're either in Miami. Hello.

[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.720]
Yes, me. Yes, you.

[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.680]
Oh, good.

[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.440]
I miss the Roger.

[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.800]
I'll see you answer that. Yes.

[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.060]
First time college.

[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:54.560]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:55.740]
This.

[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.020]
College.

[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.920]
Yeah, sure.

[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.500]
Like a show.

[00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.020]
Huh?

[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.320]
And.

[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.860]
But I do out on the radio.

[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.200]
My out of what we would do out there.

[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:04.700]
I know.

[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:06.920]
So.

[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.100]
I gotta say that much.

[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.680]
Okay.

[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.960]
Okay, thank you.

[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.340]
So I can.

[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.880]
Okay.

[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.780]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.620]
And you're all right today.

[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.020]
Okay.

[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.940]
I promise an intelligent comment.

[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.420]
Yes.

[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.220]
Believe it or not coming from Miami.

[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:26.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.780]
I think it's because I'm crossing the day

[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.800]
browered line right now.

[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.620]
Anyway, I don't know if you're aware of this or not.

[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.660]
And this is this is actually something serious.

[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.880]
Um, you know that, um, if something is done to you by

[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.620]
somebody in the county of of of a date or actually at the Florida statute,

[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.520]
that the most that you can sue somebody that's an accounting employee,

[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.160]
the most that you can sue is $100,000.

[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.000]
I'm talking about something with your limit like what?

[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.740]
I like to take a cop runs a red light and I hit you.

[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.160]
Yeah.

[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.240]
Uh, it's total, you know, and you've got you can't walk for the rest of your life

[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:04.560]
for you.

[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.180]
You can't do whatever.

[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:05.780]
Yeah.

[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.000]
Isn't that pathetic?

[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.480]
Hello.

[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.020]
How much?

[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:11.980]
No.

[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.880]
You don't think it's pathetic?

[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.360]
Yes.

[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.300]
I think it's extremely.

[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.840]
Why did it, did it, did it, did it copy you?

[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.620]
Well, my parents, yeah.

[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:21.320]
Yeah.

[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.120]
And, uh, you know, I mean, the trial's coming up that I got to tell you.

[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.180]
It's, uh, a bit of a serious thing.

[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.360]
And, um, you know, I don't know if everyone now if there's aware of that or not,

[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.240]
is to the fact that what the liability is.

[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.660]
But, uh, I got to tell you it's, uh, it's really a pathetic thing.

[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.900]
I think it's pathetic.

[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.420]
And, um, you know, this is one of the only, only states in the court said it was pathetic too.

[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.360]
Sorry.

[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.780]
You're saying it's pathetic.

[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.540]
Well, the court said it's pathetic and it definitely is pathetic.

[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.020]
Because you're just those pathetic.

[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:52.440]
Yeah.

[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.260]
Anyway, I, I, I just wanted to throw it out there because, you know, a lot of,

[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.100]
you got to try to keep your people informed.

[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:00.880]
Okay.

[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.920]
And the fact is that, uh, you know, we got to, we got to band together here and try to get some time.

[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.300]
Okay.

[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.460]
Let's, let's band together.

[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.480]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:12.880]
Okay.

[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.640]
See, I'm starting to enjoy it now.

[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.600]
I'm starting to really, really get into it.

[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.040]
Yeah.

[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.780]
I've switched gears here.

[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.460]
I've moved from Schindler's list to this.

[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.000]
Which I don't know what the word is for this, but I don't think whatever it is,

[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.240]
we can't probably say it on a year.

[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:27.540]
Can we?

[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:27.720]
No.

[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.000]
No.

[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.820]
This is great.

[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.400]
Uh, or it's either greater.

[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.120]
It's pathetic.

[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.080]
I don't know if I'm going to do that poll because if we do the poll, it's going to change the whole show.

[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.800]
I was going to ask who your favorite all-time TV celebrity is.

[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.540]
And I was going to do that for three days.

[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.220]
That's a tough one.

[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.520]
It's like when we heard the music thing.

[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.120]
It would be, it would be, it would be a little bit, you're gay, but it's gone, uh, pathetic.

[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:50.720]
Yeah.

[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.320]
It's good.

[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.320]
It's good.

[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.100]
By every now and then we have to like, uh, comments are said every few years we have to have.

[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.240]
What was the word to use, you know?

[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.240]
What?

[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.040]
In the Godfather, as many of you said, every few years there has to be a war for, uh, like a cleansing.

[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:05.660]
A house cleaning.

[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.060]
Oh yeah.

[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.860]
No, that's the way there was a word to use for it.

[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.600]
But that's what we're doing.

[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.580]
Like a cathartic experience.

[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.240]
Which kind of, uh, blood.

[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:12.460]
It's a bad blood.

[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.420]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.880]
It's not kind of sounds like pathetic.

[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.000]
A cathartic pathetic.

[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.460]
Like, find your guts.

[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.060]
When I'm sure that you're reading, that's probably what they're upset about.

[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.080]
Wait till I bring nothing in there tomorrow, read it on the air.

[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.140]
Oh yeah, that's just propaganda from that Skackens guy.

[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.660]
Okay, hey, do what you want.

[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.260]
Go ahead and fire your intestines.

[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:28.900]
Be my guest.

[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.860]
On a slow cook.

[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.100]
Here's Hollywood.

[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.500]
Hello.

[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.840]
How you doing today, Neil?

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.120]
Great.

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.380]
I'm down here visiting for Orlando, Florida.

[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.740]
You're contemporary.

[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:39.920]
You can fill up.

[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.060]
Uh, uh, uh, what is it?

[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.620]
I listed your contemporary Jim Phillips of Toronto, Orlando.

[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.840]
He's not much in temporary.

[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.000]
He's not your contemporary.

[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:49.260]
No.

[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.640]
He's a guy in a radio.

[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.520]
Yeah.

[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.540]
He said, uh, he said, I told him I was coming down there to visit the eldest.

[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.000]
Uh-huh.

[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.580]
And he said I should give you a stock tip.

[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.080]
He said, tell him about El Paso gas.

[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.120]
Yeah.

[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.120]
It's real cute.

[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:05.860]
Later.

[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:06.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.200]
Oh, boy.

[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.760]
That figure has come from Orlando, then.

[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.000]
El Paso gas.

[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.920]
That's pretty funny, pal.

[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.320]
It's not like something Jim Phillips would say.

[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.340]
Tell him about El Paso gas.

[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:16.760]
Woo!

[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.140]
Heavy.

[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.100]
Duty.

[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.640]
You see, one good thing, we can feel a little bit better about ourselves because we always

[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.980]
got Orlando and Tampa to look at it.

[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.740]
You know what I mean?

[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.320]
Uh-huh.

[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.800]
Here's a mobile and Davie.

[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.040]
Hello.

[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:31.940]
Hey, Neil.

[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:32.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.940]
Don't worry about them calling you old, Maricone and all that.

[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.540]
I know our problems here in South Florida is Maricone.

[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.160]
Yeah.

[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.800]
We got bigger problems.

[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.740]
Gotta get out of this place.

[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.860]
Everybody hates everybody.

[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:45.680]
The blacks.

[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.200]
The Jews.

[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.020]
Everybody hates everybody in this place.

[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:48.360]
Really?

[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.100]
Yeah.

[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:49.800]
It's unbelievable.

[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.500]
And you know, if it's under the table, everybody says they're not prejudiced and everybody is.

[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.660]
No, it's not under the table.

[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.060]
Some places are under the table.

[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.040]
Here it's out in the open.

[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.360]
You know, it's right out there.

[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:06.300]
Friends that pretend to be, you know, politically correct and I know how they truly are.

[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.220]
So, you know, let's stop, uh, let's stop hitting each other around here and, uh,

[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.860]
and like the Godfather said, you know, may your first child do masculine to child.

[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:24.420]
Oh, I'm so glad I had that sports section taped across the front of the TV for the day.

[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.940]
No matter what these people are doing, I feel better already.

[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:27.600]
I do.

[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.400]
You gotta come in here and take a sports radio five, 16QA-S.

[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.600]
This is CBS.

[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.340]
This old man, Dick J.B.

[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.200]
He had an CEO fastie, had a heart attack, had a whack, got him a full tone.

[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.360]
Next time he's not coming home.

[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.000]
Yo.

[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.280]
Is it like that?

[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.880]
Oh, no, no.

[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.120]
It's not with the President.

[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:51.680]

[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.100]
This man went, his name's Bush.

[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.060]
He's a hemorrhoid in the Tush.

[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.000]
We picked a guy who would die, so we'd be alone.

[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.080]
There's nothing in his empty toes.

[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.260]
Yeah.

[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:06.860]
Yeah.

[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.400]
17QA-Live at a 560 W.D.F.

[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.920]
I got a hang from a Shula State 2-2-A-Plock Mad Dog marriage coming up tonight.

[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.300]
Yeah.

[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.680]
6 o'clock to 930 because the ball games out there are in the West in Arizona.

[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.380]
Boys, 10,000 people.

[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.940]
This seems to be the average these days.

[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.880]
All right, Marlon's at the, is 10,000 that says in the box square,

[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.980]
and it which means it really is like 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 people in a ballpark?

[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.320]
That proves to me he needs a new facility.

[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.540]
Does that prove it to you that there's tremendous interest here?

[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.280]
They just don't want to go to that awful location.

[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.620]
They're right down the street from us here.

[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.240]
Who don't want to go down the street from us here?

[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.460]
I don't blame you.

[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.420]
But if they can go to downtown Miami and get backed up in like 3 and a half hours of traffic jam

[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.900]
and pay 20 bucks for parking, that ought to do it.

[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:48.260]

[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.760]
So go ahead and build them the stadium.

[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.200]
Come on.

[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.700]
You made a bad deal.

[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.260]
Baile them out.

[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.800]
So we've got that ball game stuff.

[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.300]
Marlon's in the diamond box all starts with the crow, the crow at 6,000, what is it?

[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.800]
830.

[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.140]
And then they can't etiquette real relate after all these things.

[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.620]
See, the thing with all the commercial plugs in there, what it does is it

[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.120]
it lends the effect of not wanting to read, you know what I'm saying?

[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.020]
It's just too long.

[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.680]
It takes up too much valuable time from all these good calls.

[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.220]
Right.

[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.860]
And we don't have time for that.

[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:17.280]
Oh.

[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.080]
Here's South Miami.

[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:20.420]
Hello.

[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.000]
South Miami.

[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.020]
Is gone?

[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.180]
Oh no.

[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:26.560]
Here's Miami.

[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:26.880]
Hello.

[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:28.660]
Miami.

[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:29.880]
Hello.

[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:30.460]
Yes sir.

[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.740]
Hello, I'm Rebecca.

[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.360]
Listener.

[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:32.720]
Yes.

[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.060]
The reason I'm calling I'd like to know if I could get the number that you have

[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.320]
and tied for the mortgage company with 3.9 percent.

[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.800]
I know that's a weird request, but it's possible.

[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:44.520]
Sure.

[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.340]
One second.

[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.800]
Okay, here we go.

[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.320]
Yeah.

[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.720]
It's a 1-800.

[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.560]
Yeah.

[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:54.540]
940.

[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.440]
Yeah.

[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.940]
53-63.

[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.840]
Okay, thank you.

[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.560]
And I think you show a great keep up the good words.

[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.340]
Thank you so much.

[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:01.660]
You bet.

[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.640]
How do you like that?

[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.120]
I'm putting that away now.

[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.340]
I don't want to let that lead around.

[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.340]
560-505-60.

[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.280]
I'm 560 on the AT&T in Horizon Wireless Line for whatever you're a little heart wide.

[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.920]
I'm not going to do the poll till a second hour.

[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.900]
Because I don't want to cut their water off this hour.

[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:18.440]
No.

[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:18.680]
No.

[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.820]
They're on a roll.

[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.140]
Oh, wait, if they have a lady on there, let's get her on right away.

[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.200]
It's even like a real...

[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.340]
Here's a lady mobile in somewhere.

[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:25.660]
Hello.

[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.080]
Hello.

[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.480]
Hello.

[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.280]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.580]
Oh, hey, Neil, ask for me Mr. Conversation on this.

[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.420]
Do you watch that show time so clear as well?

[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.280]
No, I don't.

[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.700]
Oh, it's awesome.

[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.780]
I keep trying to find somebody that's been watching it so we can talk about it.

[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.120]
No.

[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:43.900]
Okay, thanks.

[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:44.600]
Okay.

[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.360]
Bye.

[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:45.900]
Bye, bye.

[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:46.760]
No.

[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.800]
I don't watch the clear as well.

[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.500]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pounds.

[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.520]
That's for straight people who think that they're going to learn something about Gaze by watching shows like that.

[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.240]
Just like Ellen.

[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.760]
Do I know any woman like Ellen?

[00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.020]
No.

[00:26:59.740 --> 00:26:59.980]
No.

[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.180]
No.

[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.220]
God forbid.

[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.480]
But I'm glad you're enjoying it.

[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.260]
All the people on there are ugly from the promos that I've seen.

[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:08.820]
Here's Miami.

[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.140]
Hello.

[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.340]
Neil, how you doing, buddy?

[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:10.800]
All right.

[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.940]
Do you watch America depressing last night?

[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.440]
Did I watch what?

[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:16.940]
America undercover.

[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:17.880]
No.

[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.220]
There's no hope for it now.

[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:20.980]
What was that?

[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:30.340]
It's about this guy that meld and just that he just married into these women that had little girls.

[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.740]
And just I made molested them their whole lives.

[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.960]
I mean, went from one family to the next.

[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.380]
I mean, is out in California.

[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.860]
I believe George saw it.

[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:41.440]
Yup.

[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.460]
Yeah, he saw it.

[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.920]
Yeah, but yeah, I'm from Alabama.

[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:44.940]
I thought it might be.

[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.080]
Well, how do you know George saw it?

[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.080]
I talked to him.

[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.100]
Oh, I see.

[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.960]
I thought maybe he had a psychic vibration.

[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:50.600]
No.

[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.240]
No vibrations, yeah.

[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.820]
But if you get a chance, you need to try to watch maybe five minutes.

[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.100]
No, it's not too depressing.

[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.880]
After the Benny Hint thing, I wasted my time with that and I spent a lot of time on a show.

[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.300]
And most of these people didn't watch and they want to talk about it.

[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.840]
So I'm not going to get sucked in with that again.

[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.140]
And I'll take your word for it.

[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.360]
Well, that's why I said America depressing because there's no hope.

[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.620]
I'm going to get my passport.

[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.240]
All right.

[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:13.880]
All right, buddy.

[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:14.600]
I'll see you on the plane.

[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.480]
All right, bye.

[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.800]
Oh, so look at this.

[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.520]
We had about what?

[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.660]
Must have an hour of internet service today and now the thing is out, which is going to make

[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.080]
it very difficult for me to do that pool thing today because that thing just keeps popping

[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.500]
up again to one that says, oh, out of this space.

[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.940]
This is a different one now, out of this space.

[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.180]
I'll be damned.

[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.160]
You better get your right together in here.

[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.000]
Bob Ramuth, I'll tell you that.

[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.640]
He's an asshole.

[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:44.580]
We just have all kinds of problems just maintaining like, you know, from day to day.

[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.520]
And of course, but we can't keep the internet thing going here without all kinds of little

[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.940]
things popping up there all over the place.

[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.380]
Little zits on the screen.

[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.000]
Hate that.

[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.660]
1216 votes on that pull over the weekend.

[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.240]
How interested are you in the NFL draft?

[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.420]
And 86% of the audience were not interested a lot.

[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.440]
That's an interesting way of putting it, okay?

[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:04.700]
Yeah.

[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.780]
86% were not interested like a whole lot in the NFL draft.

[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.780]
Thank God.

[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.480]
That's a good sign.

[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.620]
It calls out a very good sign.

[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.000]
But at least the pool is a good sign.

[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:13.720]
You want to know why?

[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.060]
Because most of the people who vote on the pool are not the ones who call.

[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.620]
Most of the people who are in the listing audience are not the ones who call.

[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:25.360]
The ones who call are, well, here's a Delray Beach.

[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:25.580]

[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.780]
Hey, Neil.

[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:27.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.760]
How much are you pulling out of the good?

[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.380]
Yeah.

[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.400]
Maybe if you got the 20 pounds of count crap, buddy, I'm not forget I understand what you were saying.

[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.800]
Which probably wouldn't be a good idea.

[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.400]
5.670560.560 on the AT&T.

[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.800]
And if you're right, it's a wireless line.

[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.960]
I think we've hit the jackpot this last few days.

[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.140]
Here's a mobile and four-letter dial.

[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.360]
Hello?

[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.840]
Hey, hi, Neil.

[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.220]
How are you doing?

[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:50.540]
Okay.

[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.920]
I just wanted to say that the 3.9%.

[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.600]
I call those people and they did a great job for me.

[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.040]
Good.

[00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.540]
They should talk about a lot of people.

[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.580]
It's a really good spot for yours.

[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.360]
And also, I wanted to see that Benny Hinton.

[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.340]
I don't know how, how is it that right heart that got in Germany makes money?

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.780]
I know how Benny Hinton makes money.

[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.840]
But how is it that right heart makes money?

[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.500]
Is it he charged people in Africa to go watching heal people?

[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.560]
Hey, then Africaners got some cash.

[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:19.680]
Yeah.

[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.160]
I just didn't see Holly.

[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.020]
Well, maybe he's just taking their first born and selling into auction or something.

[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.380]
Who knows?

[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.820]
Believe me, he's making the big bucks.

[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:28.820]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.040]
He doesn't, he doesn't.

[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:30.180]

[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:30.380]
He doesn't.

[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.040]
You see, he had a half a million Africaners there in Nicaragua.

[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:33.880]
Yeah.

[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.500]
I saw that.

[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.040]
Half a million.

[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.260]
So the fuck a piece, half a million dollars.

[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:37.760]
That's not bad.

[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.120]
Yeah.

[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.480]
Oh, pretty cool.

[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.240]
All right, just wanna let you know that.

[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.900]
Okay, thanks.

[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:42.600]
Thank you.

[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.920]
560-560-0.560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.660]
Here's Coral Gable, hello.

[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.820]
I've been listening to the show lately.

[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.880]
Now that it's the last week and today and uh...

[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.040]
You can do topics like Gregor used to do.

[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.260]
Because those were some good shows.

[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.220]
I think you're pardoned?

[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.820]
Gregor used to do topics and uh...

[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.300]
And those were some good shows.

[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.040]
I missed Gregor.

[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.640]
Oh, Gregor, yeah.

[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.080]
Topics like what?

[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.960]
Eating a feces?

[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.260]
It was better than your craft.

[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:10.980]
Yeah, okay, great.

[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.500]
Thank you.

[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.020]
He likes Gregor's craft.

[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.440]
Well, Gregor's gone, okay?

[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:14.660]
Yeah.

[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.120]
He's long gone.

[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.860]
That's too bad because he was so much better.

[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.120]
Yeah, he was so much better.

[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.620]
It's too bad.

[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.240]
And of course it's interesting because you're still listening

[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.340]
over here and that is shame.

[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.220]
And I'm sure that when Gregor was uh...

[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.820]
And I was not in the air when Gregor was on.

[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.940]
That's why he was listening to Gregor.

[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.460]
He was the one.

[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.960]
Him and those women from the uh...

[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.540]
What's that uh...

[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.120]
Where they give the awards out every year, you know?

[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.860]
Got the award for the best feces taught.

[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.700]
Feces of the Species Award.

[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.880]
567-0560.

[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.800]
Well, he liked the Schwarzenegger's lesson, okay?

[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:43.180]
I don't.

[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.720]
567-0560.

[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.380]
Pound 567-0560 on the AT&T

[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.640]
and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.760]
There's another one.

[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.840]
So I'm lucky to have ten pounds of a crowd dung in his mouth.

[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:51.920]
Here's West Palm.

[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.280]
Hello.

[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.760]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.340]
Okay, sir.

[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.240]
I'm about to take a trip to South America.

[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.260]
I was born in Venezuela.

[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.360]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.000]
You know, when I go over there, you know, I've lived here all my life.

[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.500]
My family is usually like, you know, they want to know how it is over here, you know,

[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.240]
because they don't have anything over there.

[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.140]
Their poor is hell.

[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.180]
You know, they don't forget about having a car or...

[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.300]
Yeah.

[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.500]
You know, running...

[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.160]
Okay, good.

[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.920]
567-0560.

[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.820]
Pound 567-0560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.720]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:25.080]
Hello.

[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.580]
Good evening.

[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:27.960]
Good evening, yes.

[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.340]
Hey, whatever.

[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.200]
Hey, I don't know.

[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.620]
I know your views on like, Napster stuff.

[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.380]
I don't know if you're familiar with...

[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.240]
There's a new server out there called Navigator.

[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:39.980]
Yeah.

[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.100]
I don't know if you're familiar with that or not, but...

[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.760]
I'll never ever be able to shut that down.

[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.420]
I don't know why people just don't go to that.

[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.060]
I'm worried about Napster.

[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.380]
Navigator is new?

[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.620]
Yeah, it's a new server.

[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.620]
It's supported by a bunch of...

[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.800]
You know, like from England and just all over the world.

[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.160]
Where they can't get into shutting down.

[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.100]
Anything that's supported here in the United States can be able to shut it down.

[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:09.800]
Stuff like that.

[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.840]
Stuff that's oversteed.

[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.880]
That would be all to get rid of it.

[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.120]
Yeah.

[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.700]
And I mean, there's some stuff on there that's from Napster,

[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.320]
but those will be shut down.

[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.120]
But there's a lot of things...

[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.620]
Like what?

[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.880]
You talking about music again?

[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.240]
I love it.

[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.920]
So in other words, you try to get...

[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.820]
It's okay to like steal music without anybody...

[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.640]
No, I might say it still.

[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.700]
I'm just saying, going there and you'll find the thought of it.

[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.820]
If you like it enough, then you can be able to go by it.

[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.840]
I mean, I don't support it in a way that go out there and try to restart it or try to...

[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.040]
Right.

[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.100]
You know, grab it for free.

[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.120]
I'm not in a freebie world though.

[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.920]
Well, most of the people who are in Napster are, you know, not your people.

[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.220]
They're in the freebie world.

[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.580]
Yeah, I mean, I just...

[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:49.900]
I just...

[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:50.820]
I like to go on there.

[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.700]
And I'm not saying I don't like to listen to it all.

[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.020]
But I mean, I'll stay up there a lot.

[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.380]
It's very difficult for some of these folks to understand,

[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.660]
but that is that there's no money to be made in making music

[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.980]
that people aren't going to be making music anymore.

[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.900]
Oh, what a concept, huh?

[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:05.720]

[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.360]
No, you're wrong, you'll stay up.

[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.240]
We wanted for free.

[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.780]
Okay, well, go get it for free.

[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.700]
Most of you couldn't get it... get it paying for it.

[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:13.840]
And the music either.

[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.960]
5607-0560, £560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Live.

[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:19.780]
Yeah, but it's there.

[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.240]
Okay, well, get it wide, you can't grab it.

[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.240]
Here's a mobile and a four-letter deal.

[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:25.440]
Hello.

[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.180]
Hey, Ney, how you doing, buddy?

[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:27.680]
Great.

[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.040]
Let's talk some real sports, man.

[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.360]
How about those Maple Leafs?

[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:31.680]
Yeah.

[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.760]
They're playing great, man.

[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.220]
I just want to talk a little bit about a couple of weeks ago,

[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.860]
right after the regular season, and that Ottawa Paracame on

[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.440]
and they were interviewing me, so, well,

[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.180]
you guys have been trying to, and, uh, Paracame,

[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.600]
what do you say to that each as well,

[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.300]
the team that we dominate all year,

[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.600]
and so should be the first to work.

[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.920]
I hate to break the news, too, but that's old news, though, too.

[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.480]
That's, uh, how come nobody's calling you,

[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.200]
talking about Buffalo Blown, I was really eight,

[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.420]
nothing in winning that series, huh?

[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.660]
Or about all the other great teams.

[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.140]
See, the Ottawa Leafs series, as I had last I recall,

[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.120]
and did many, many days ago, didn't it?

[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.420]
Yeah, but I couldn't get three to last week, dude.

[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.180]
And I'm a big league fan, man.

[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:07.320]
Yeah.

[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.580]
The big league fan, just just get through it, too.

[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.520]
Yeah, I don't talk about it, you really don't need it,

[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.460]
you really feel me real good, too.

[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.380]
And I, well, I still like the Leafs all the way.

[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.680]
Okay, good luck to you, sir.

[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.280]
Good luck to us.

[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.160]
Go Leafs, go.

[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.580]
Were you going all the way?

[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:21.960]
No.

[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.820]
560, 7.0560, 0.560.

[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.240]
Honestly, I'm going to use the negative approach,

[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.480]
like, I could have with the Ottawa series

[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.660]
when I said we wouldn't win one game.

[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.740]
Least have no chance against New Jersey, doing no.

[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.040]
You're a no.

[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.560]
Use that approach, and then, of course,

[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.860]
if something good happens, then you're pleasantly surprised.

[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.080]
As opposed to the people that talk a big game,

[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.220]
and then when nothing happens, then they let the, you know,

[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.060]
with egg under a push.

[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.100]
That's a real good lesson for all your kids out there.

[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.020]
Just to expect the least, and, uh, if anything good happens,

[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.320]
then you grab it, squeeze it.

[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.540]
560, 560, 0.560, only 18 and T,

[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.720]
and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.440]
Big.

[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.820]
Here's a good tip.

[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.820]
Said my broker.

[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.180]
Yeah, the market.

[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.660]
It's valid and sound.

[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.460]
Just in there's more.

[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.460]
Recovery's calling.

[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.920]
In time, your stocks will rebound.

[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.020]
But they're free.

[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.940]
All in all.

[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.960]
Free.

[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.160]
All in all.

[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:27.220]

[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:27.660]
All in all.

[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:29.520]
Free.

[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:30.700]
All in all.

[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:30.700]

[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.380]
All in all.

[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.240]
I found the free.

[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.400]
All in all.

[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.360]
Free.

[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.460]
All in all.

[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.680]
Youngest guys.

[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.060]
Free.

[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.860]
All in all.

[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.600]
There's a long day.

[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.900]
I'll be on Wall Street.

[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.360]
Watch stocks go.

[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.260]
Close to up there.

[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.220]
Go with these kids.

[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.160]
As a hit bottom.

[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.900]
But just wait now.

[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.720]
It's almost there.

[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.480]
Yeah, they're free.

[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.580]
All in all.

[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:09.580]
Free.

[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.340]
All in all.

[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:11.340]

[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.240]
All in all.

[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.180]
Free.

[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.920]
All in all.

[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:17.700]

[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.960]
All in all.

[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:20.880]
Free.

[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.520]
All in all.

[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:22.700]
Free.

[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:23.680]
All in all.

[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:23.680]

[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.620]
All in all.

[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.900]
Whatever they're doing, they're doing it down my watch.

[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.960]
Because I got my newspaper just plastered over the bottom of my TVs.

[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:32.560]
Is it right in there?

[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.320]
No, I have to say it.

[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.320]
I feel much better about it.

[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:34.320]

[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.660]
You'll love it at a clock at 5.60 WDQYM.

[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.960]
And you know something that first hour is very instrumental in maybe helping the show.

[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.760]
You want to know why?

[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.220]
Because summer replacement might go away for the whole summer.

[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:45.900]
How about Greg?

[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:46.680]
Yeah.

[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.200]
We can probably dig him up somewhere.

[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.320]
He's probably not working.

[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.020]
Maybe not in radio.

[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:52.560]
They're amazing.

[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.360]
All these people that they thought were so great like Karen Kaye.

[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.540]
And what was the one that people thought they were great?

[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.280]
Water Sable.

[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.520]
She said she had a great tidal lips.

[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.460]
And just like you're in summer, she's got a great ass.

[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.620]
Remember that line?

[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.100]
Yeah.

[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.720]
Now, it's Steve Nichol said, taste like a penny to me.

[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.820]
And then we got the...

[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.100]
What's your...

[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.320]
I can never think of her name.

[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.120]
The one that's out there in Portland, Cedrican, you're sure?

[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.120]
17,500 little 10 watt stations.

[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.460]
The one that lasted five minutes in the afternoon, then I had the big...

[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:22.780]
Got canned.

[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:25.820]
Well, let's see.

[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.960]
The one before...

[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.600]
The goddess.

[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.160]
Before the goddess was Ed Till.

[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.440]
And before Ed Till.

[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:35.800]
What's her name?

[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.220]
That was on stupid talk and after Flizz Wild.

[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.480]
Oh, yes.

[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.160]
Oh, he's...

[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.780]
The goddess has forgotten now.

[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.720]
Well, it's very very wild about Liz.

[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.620]
Well, it's what I'm saying.

[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.180]
All of these great stars that they put on the orders, Mike Church.

[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.520]
Look at the list we could make.

[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:51.420]
Scoot?

[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.320]
Don't forget the scoop.

[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.460]
Don't forget the poop.

[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.240]
Scoop.

[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:55.520]
Yeah.

[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.400]
Oh yeah, never really good.

[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.540]
How about that joy of Reynolds?

[00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.400]
Can we bring him back?

[00:38:59.520 --> 00:38:59.880]
What are you saying?

[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.920]
Oh, he was the best.

[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.520]
He would talk to the guy with the eyes for hours, you know?

[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.580]
All the other people you won't talk to because you're a prick.

[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.280]
But he was a good guy, Joey.

[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.120]
Yeah.

[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.560]
He has them in the studio.

[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.480]
Polluting Earth.

[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.320]
In fact, that's probably where the corporate disease started.

[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.180]
Or he asked me.

[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.280]
So our survey that we're going to take...

[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.620]
Well, do the same thing we do with the music and that is we'll take one from each day,

[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.840]
whoever is the highest one, and carry it over for three days until we find out.

[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.100]
And the reason that I was inspired to do this, I was watching another one

[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.620]
of those MSNBC things yesterday.

[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.120]
What was it about?

[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.020]
I wasn't really watching it because I've seen it 20 times.

[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.720]
I mentioned this a couple weeks ago, the Brady Bunch.

[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.800]
But I was channel surfing and there was Florence Henderson.

[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.180]
And she was saying, oh, I think that most of our audience were hoping that there was something sexual

[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.220]
between me and whatever, or was the kid that played the oldest son on that show.

[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.100]
Whatever his name was.

[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:49.740]

[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.300]
Greg.

[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:50.440]

[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:50.760]
Yeah.

[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.600]
And she was saying, I thought, you know, I always like Florence Henderson.

[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.020]
She's a cool lady, Florence Henderson.

[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:57.800]
Right?

[00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.960]
Never stole his freight train.

[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.480]
Maybe he's a little bit too much western world.

[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.160]
And I'm not saying I would vote for Florence Henderson.

[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:03.660]
What I...

[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:03.800]
No.

[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.800]
Like last week we were talking about Elizabeth Montgomery and Barbara Eden.

[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.460]
So, who was your favorite all-time TV celebrity?

[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.280]
It could be based on whether they were funny, whether they were entertaining.

[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.960]
Maybe you were, I had the hot sport.

[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.000]
Well, for whatever reason.

[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.500]
Talk showers, sit-com actor.

[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.020]
Anything.

[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.100]
Show host, game show host.

[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.360]
Anything.

[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:23.780]
We're not...

[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.200]
Now look, I know Bulk of Brian will be upset, but we're not putting Dorothy Kylgale on the list.

[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:27.960]
Now.

[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.560]
Or Wink Martin Dale.

[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.700]
Anybody, your favorite?

[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:34.820]
I know it covers a lot of ground.

[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.480]
That's why it's going to take three days for a weiner.

[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.460]
Now, here's my short list that I got here, which I'm sure you want to be with most of them, because, you know, you won't be my time.

[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.760]
Well, some of them could be.

[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.000]
So, this covers a lot of territory.

[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.800]
This covers 50 years, generally speaking.

[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:49.500]
How about the music thing?

[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.840]
They covered almost 50 years.

[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.240]
Broadcast TV or cable?

[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.600]
Your favorite all-time TV celebrity, okay?

[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.540]
It didn't say cable, satellite dish, pop-up toaster, whoever it is, okay?

[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.680]
Jesus Christ.

[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.000]
Oh, Jesus Christ, is he on the list?

[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.940]
I got Barbara Eden.

[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.580]
Now, of course, we'll be adding names to the list.

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.700]
We can do like we did with the music.

[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.680]
Maybe 25, each day, 30, whatever, whatever Eric can handle.

[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.360]
Barbara Eden.

[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.280]
Elizabeth Montgomery.

[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.360]
Lucy of Ball.

[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.100]
Huh?

[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.340]
Don't Lucy have to be on the list.

[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:21.900]
You bet.

[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.120]
I love Lucy.

[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.720]
Jackie Gleason.

[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.220]
How come nobody down here ever talks about Jackie Gleason anymore?

[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.880]
He put this down on the map, and then some people came in here and destroyed it.

[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.380]
Johnny Carson.

[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.860]
Not that I would vote for Johnny Carson.

[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:36.940]
David Letterman.

[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.500]
Florence Henderson.

[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.960]
Only because of that thing I saw yesterday.

[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.620]
David Cassidy.

[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.280]
The reason I put him on air is because they had a thing just before that about the Partridge family.

[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.940]
And I was thinking about the guy with the eyes.

[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.980]
Oh, he's very David Cassidy intensive and in all of you.

[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.240]
And so was I when that show was on.

[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.560]
And then there were a lot of guys that were very Susan Day intensive.

[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.580]
Am I correct?

[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.180]
Yeah, sure.

[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:02.960]
But I was before your time.

[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.480]
I was little.

[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.500]
So was David.

[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.380]
William Conrad.

[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.260]
Now, see, you wouldn't agree with that because you didn't like cops, you was, but right.

[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:11.940]
I'm canon.

[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.480]
William Conrad was great.

[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.600]
He might even get my vote.

[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.300]
I'm not sure yet.

[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.020]
Telly Sivallis, you wouldn't like that because it was another.

[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.240]
I see I got a look.

[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.280]
You ought to see the look I got.

[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.280]
How could you not love co-jacks?

[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:22.920]
Huh?

[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.600]
What a sucker you are.

[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.760]
You had a style about him, but still.

[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680]
It was a comp show.

[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.260]
I'm not asking you.

[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:31.800]
I'm asking you.

[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:31.840]
I'm asking you.

[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.180]
We're making the list of people.

[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.420]
Not just your taste or my taste.

[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.140]
Am I voting for Telly Sivallis?

[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:37.380]
No.

[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:37.780]

[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.000]
Jack Par.

[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.160]
Wait before your time.

[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.320]
Jack Par was great.

[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.300]
And kind of a neurotic way.

[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.300]
I saw some shows about him.

[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.320]
And Jack Par was to late night TV with Judy Garland was to music.

[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.340]
Great but neurotic.

[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:52.840]
Very good.

[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.340]
Steve Allen.

[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.120]
Rest in peace.

[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.500]
So that's my short list.

[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.160]
I'm sure I mean, you know, we can put 50,000 people on there.

[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.460]
How about the elephant boy from Buster Brown show?

[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.080]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:08.460]
Hello.

[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.040]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:10.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.340]
Well, first time call long time listener.

[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:13.900]
Okay.

[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.800]
And I was born Catholic all my life.

[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.400]
I'm so sorry.

[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:28.920]
I married my wife and, you know, her proposal, a bishop and her aunt's, you know, she directs the nuns and everything.

[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:39.060]
It's funny the way that I've gone to see the way the religion and the way church is gone and all I really want is just money and money and money.

[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:49.340]
And I don't really, you know, give anything but the point is I saw this penny in thing and how they just, you know, just make so much money off of these people that are just dying.

[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.300]
It's all a thing, man.

[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.400]
It's all, it's all a business.

[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.540]
Yes, that's some are bigger and more successful than others.

[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.280]
It's all a business.

[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:55.600]
It's all a big bunch of crap.

[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.740]
I mean, why do they do this?

[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.680]
I mean, it's not a lot of money.

[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.820]
Why just got you telling you because it's a business.

[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.340]
And it's a, of course, you know, tax deductible.

[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:04.880]
Right.

[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.100]
A tax deductible racket.

[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:06.760]
You got it.

[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.020]
There you go, you know.

[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.300]
So, exactly like your jealous and so am I.

[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.460]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.760]
I work in banking, so I know.

[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:14.680]
There you go.

[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.600]
I'll pray for your pal.

[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.440]
I'll take care.

[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.140]
God bless you.

[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:17.980]
God bless you.

[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:20.580]
56670560.

[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.820]
You have to have lots of more nominations for a list here.

[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.900]
They are your favorite all-time TV personality based on talent, humor.

[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.500]
Maybe they were hot.

[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.200]
Huh?

[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.700]
So you can't, you can't come up with an answer, can you?

[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.840]
No, I can think up a lot of names, but you.

[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.800]
It's hard nobody to fill the piece.

[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.700]
Same with the ones on your.

[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.380]
Same with the music.

[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:41.840]
Right.

[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.960]
It was hard to pick just one.

[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.360]
I mean, I could just start rattling off names, but.

[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.420]
Menaasha's school neck.

[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.040]
Okay.

[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.340]
Walter's play, Zach.

[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.060]
Moms made with Connry.

[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.460]
See, I finally saw Moms Maybe.

[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.320]
He's like a, uh, am I any ginkgold?

[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:56.100]
Red Fox.

[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.300]
Freddie Prince.

[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:57.840]
Red Fox.

[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.680]
Red Fox is not going to be on the list.

[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.580]
Are you out of your mind?

[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.540]
But he's funny.

[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:03.600]
Red Skeleton.

[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:04.720]
Okay.

[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.680]
God bless.

[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:06.700]
God bless.

[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:07.880]
Captain Kangaroo.

[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:08.840]
Captain Kangaroo.

[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:09.720]
Bob Keeshaan.

[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:11.920]
Keeshaan.

[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.020]
He was the first Keeshaan wanting before Keeshaan John.

[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:15.360]
Yeah.

[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.360]
Bob Keeshaan.

[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.980]
Hey, how you doing, little Keeshaan?

[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.900]
What are we going to do about those illiterate spook names, man?

[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.600]
Well, that's for another day.

[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.240]
So you see this list is like almost endless.

[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.660]
This is a great one.

[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.060]
And the good part of it is we killed the other hour first

[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.520]
before we even got started doing this.

[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.580]
See, there's a method to my madness.

[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.220]
Oh, right.

[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.000]
So Greg was going to be on it new, while we're eating lunch.

[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.480]
Well, those great topics about eating the meafesis of the species.

[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.880]
Now, you don't have to say I see Eric's working on this list already.

[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.840]
He's just dittling around with it.

[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.520]
Don't even start thinking about it yet, because we're going to do like 25 or 30 minimum each day.

[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.000]
And then whoever's the highest on each table, get carried on.

[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.340]
And I, the good news is, Roy Robinson won't be on the list.

[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.220]
How about Rick Nelson?

[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:02.440]
Huh?

[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.980]
Well, I'm loaded with my asking you for.

[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.240]
Okay, but what the hell do you know?

[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.220]
Tonk, don't know about the most fossils.

[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.500]
He's dead.

[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:13.540]
Ozzie's dead.

[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.620]
And didn't Harriet die here while ago?

[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.220]
Did he?

[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.020]
Harriet, didn't she?

[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:20.900]
Didn't it?

[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:21.620]
He died.

[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.920]
Nine minutes after 11 at 5.60 W.D. Kim.

[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.280]
I think David Nelson is still alive.

[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.160]
Right, David, David Nelson.

[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:27.900]
He's still alive.

[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:28.440]
Thank God.

[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.500]
God with two first names.

[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.540]
Hey, if your carpets look like hell, what are you going to do about it?

[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.840]
What you can call up by the exorcist?

[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.840]
Maybe they can come in and try and get the stains out.

[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.740]
But the people who can really do the job for our dry concepts.

[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.040]
They've been doing it in town for well over 20 years.

[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.760]
In fact, it seems like longer than that, because I know I've been using it in my house for about 20 years now.

[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.620]
Because I wouldn't think I'd use it in anybody else.

[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.280]
And why should you?

[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.420]
Nobody does it better.

[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.500]
Nobody gives you a written guarantee price before they start.

[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.440]
And nobody else dry clean the...

[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.040]
This is any of them, right?

[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.780]
But, you know, he went through it.

[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.460]
And I like bridges.

[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.120]
He's a good guy.

[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.440]
He's one of those, you know, Notre Dame's things.

[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:01.460]
And those shows.

[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.820]
And those shows that million earthen...

[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.900]
But, you know, something he deserves.

[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:05.760]
He's paid his dues.

[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.260]
You know, he's got two crappy shows.

[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.120]
He's got Regis live without Kathy Lee, which everybody's happy.

[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:10.600]
He's gone.

[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.760]
And then that million earth thing, which, you know, it is what it is.

[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.060]
But he deserves it.

[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.180]
I mean, at least it's not some schmuck that fell into a bucket of crap.

[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.300]
You, we like your Regis.

[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.900]
Okay, your show sucks, but we like you.

[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.100]
That's interesting.

[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:23.880]
It's kind of like here.

[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.560]
They like me, but there is it the other way around.

[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.240]
They like the show.

[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:26.860]
They hate me.

[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.340]
Barbara Eden, Elizabeth.

[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.920]
This is just the beginning of the list.

[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.020]
Believe me.

[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.120]
Bob Barker, got to be on there.

[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.900]
I mean, tooth of consequences.

[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.060]
Anybody remember that show?

[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:37.300]
No.

[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.460]
Besides me and Bokobryne.

[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.040]
Do you remember that?

[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.220]
What?

[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.160]
Truth of consequences?

[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:41.740]
Yeah, sure.

[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:42.240]
You do?

[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:44.460]
Vagely.

[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:45.120]
No, okay.

[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.200]
Regis Filman.

[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:52.120]
Barbara Eden, Elizabeth Montgomery, Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, Johnny Carson, David Letterman,

[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.260]
Florence Henderson, David Cassidy.

[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.660]
I guess that we put David Cassidy on the list.

[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.340]
We should put, what's your name?

[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.060]
That's I just mentioned.

[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:01.180]
What's your name?

[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:02.600]
From the partridge of the day.

[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.120]
Susan Day.

[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.400]
I still say she was upset because he had better hurt and shooted.

[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:13.440]
William Conrad, with Telly Savales, Jack Parsteev Allen, Susan Day.

[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.720]
Susan Day doesn't belong on the list.

[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:17.780]
Whatever.

[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.300]
So get three votes.

[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:20.040]
Yeah.

[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.600]
Scratch out Susan Day.

[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:22.840]
Carol O'Connor.

[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.720]
Oh, I love Carol O'Connor.

[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:26.520]
God.

[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.060]
How about me, Ted?

[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:29.480]
No.

[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.300]
How about George Jefferson?

[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:34.580]
Okay.

[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.820]
But nobody knows who he is.

[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:36.660]
That's why he's broke.

[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.980]
Shaw Sherman Hemsley.

[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:39.800]
George Jefferson.

[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:40.760]
He needed a bet.

[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.240]
Well, see, we'll do that another time about TV shows.

[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.540]
We'll do that like next week.

[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:46.820]
Yeah.

[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.860]
I think every Monday we ought to be doing stuff like this.

[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.800]
But not in the first hour.

[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.800]
We'll do the first hour like we did today, you know?

[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.180]
Yeah, in fact, that's a good idea.

[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.320]
Every Monday, the first hour can be a moron hour.

[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.140]
End of an hour.

[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.200]
Yeah, end of an hour.

[00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.740]
Big blueberry, end of an hour on the radio.

[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.580]
Carol O'Connor.

[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.220]
Okay, well, we'll let them fill in some others.

[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:06.560]
Okay?

[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.480]
Just make them feel like they know something.

[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.100]
See, maybe they didn't take I knew my music,

[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.360]
but I know my TV, Mr. Rottel, do that.

[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.000]
Because I've been watching a TV.

[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.540]
How about Buffalo Bob Smith?

[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:16.840]
How about him?

[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.080]
Woody Graver just called up and voted for Howdy Duty.

[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.060]
Well, guess what, Woody?

[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.220]
He got it.

[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.460]
And Howdy Duty and Buffalo Bob are both dead.

[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.060]
What about Clare Bell?

[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.480]
What about David Nallan?

[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:30.700]
Huh?

[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.720]
You know, you're, that's right, one, eight, Buffalo Bob.

[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:34.900]
Okay.

[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.000]
You never saw Howdy Duty?

[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.100]
I just saw a little clip every once in a while.

[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.780]
You never saw Howdy Duty?

[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.420]
Oh my God!

[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.160]
Here's a person who never saw Howdy Duty.

[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.320]
There are many, many of us.

[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.360]
But I bet you've seen Doody.

[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.640]
You ever looking at Bull and say Howdy?

[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.380]
Here's a curl gable, hello.

[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.620]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.940]
After your flesh and thought it was all gone.

[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.180]
Oh, Howdy, yes sir.

[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.340]
Oh, he's been a floor attendant and fan as well.

[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.260]
Don't you just love her?

[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.620]
I do, but I have to join George on the list of people

[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.500]
who've never seen The Howdy Duty show.

[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.920]
And really never felt like I was missing anything either.

[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:08.360]
You didn't.

[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.980]
But you didn't see how they say everything has its time,

[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:12.900]
you know, time and place.

[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.280]
And now looking back, it would be considered very, very camp.

[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.540]
But because it was the early days of television,

[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.000]
whatever was on was great.

[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:20.580]
You know what I mean?

[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.620]
Like Mr. Ed.

[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:22.800]
Mr. Ed was not.

[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.180]
Hello.

[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.680]
Yeah, all right.

[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.120]
I'll tell you something.

[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.480]
I was listening and I came up with a few names.

[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.420]
Of course, Big Bird comes to mind.

[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:32.420]
Alan Alda.

[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.060]
Tom Selleck, Michael J. Fox.

[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.280]
Some of the people, you know, she was a two day,

[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.080]
or Susan Day, whatever it was.

[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.680]
Who did LA Law as well?

[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.800]
Oh, okay, Susan Day.

[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:41.820]
I should've got to be on there.

[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.000]
I mean, if we can put Dave Daniel.

[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.020]
But I don't know how popular she was, but she did LA Law.

[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.740]
I mean, there are a lot of young guys that used to watch

[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.560]
the Partridge family for her Susan Day.

[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.060]
They used to sit real close to the TV.

[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.940]
And then the young girls and some of the rest of us

[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.100]
would watch for David Cassett.

[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.880]
Listen, I called up because that first hour was so terminal

[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.560]
and then you got one hockey call and I said,

[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.720]
okay, if he's not going to cut off the hockey calls,

[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.400]
then I'll go ahead and start.

[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.200]
Well, why would I do that?

[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.780]
Well, you know, sometimes you're feeling it as though this crowd

[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.620]
doesn't want to listen to hockey, but I'll tell you something.

[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.500]
We've much rather listened to hockey talk,

[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.280]
and then listen to these Jack Assulios call up every single morning.

[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.020]
Yeah, the Jack Assulio is a really destroyed this town, you know.

[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:14.960]
There you go.

[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.140]
I would say, thinking, you know, the first round of the playoffs

[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.880]
has really been all about the gold-tending

[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.220]
and arch-reservate just hung in there from strong.

[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.000]
Oh, man, was he unbelievable?

[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.740]
Even a game yesterday, which is the final score was five to one,

[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.460]
but I'm telling you, he made about a half dozen saves

[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.000]
in that game.

[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.040]
He elected which I have never seen.

[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.100]
I mean, just incredible.

[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.120]
And he noticed something I wished at Bobby Clark

[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.080]
to get run out of town on a rail in Philadelphia.

[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:36.960]
Yeah, that's great.

[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.500]
I'm telling you, every time I close scored again,

[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.420]
I would squeeze myself, I would sort of say.

[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.120]
If anybody deserves to take the bread of the blame for it, it's him.

[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:44.440]
Yeah.

[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.660]
He did nothing to bring in gold-tending over the life of the player.

[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.520]
He's one of the most evil people.

[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.360]
Forget about sports.

[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:52.380]
He's just one of the most evil people on the face of the earth as Bobby Clark.

[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:52.960]
What an ego.

[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:53.460]
Yeah.

[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.660]
So that was too bad because he said,

[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.300]
nothing to help the game, Mahaki, to keep a superstar like him.

[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.800]
And they had over 18,000 at the biggest crowd ever in Carolina yesterday.

[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:02.180]
Yeah.

[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.340]
And it goes to Shorya front running phonies, aren't just here in South Florida.

[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:05.980]
Yeah.

[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:07.360]
Yeah.

[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.240]
And the other thing is the court side.

[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.380]
They don't have flies there.

[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.120]
I've been a little surprised to see how really,

[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.140]
actually Buffalo has looked, despite not having Michael Pecker all year early,

[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.100]
because I thought that kid had really come into his own the last two years.

[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:20.340]
Yeah.

[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.640]
And it's too bad because that's a good thing.

[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.360]
They got a really like their team a lot.

[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:28.060]
But right now what I'm hoping for is I'm hoping that Tai Domey

[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.340]
absolutely levels scotch.

[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.720]
Yeah, it's not going to be Tai Domey.

[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:32.720]
Tai Domey comes up to his waist.

[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:35.240]
It'll be Shane Corson, the one that's going to beat the crap out of him.

[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.260]
I certainly hope so.

[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:36.640]
Me too.

[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.780]
All right, have a great round.

[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:38.660]
Thanks, take care.

[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.920]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, you know what?

[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.140]
The bad news is this thing.

[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.580]
I think this thing is screwed up again now.

[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.380]
I'm walking out.

[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.820]
I mean, you know, I'm here again for an hour, 20 minutes.

[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.280]
And now when we're following, it's a long way before we get this thing

[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.480]
on to pull anyway, you know what I'm saying?

[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.420]
That's probably just as well.

[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.400]
But our internet connection keeps crapping out.

[00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.380]
It's crapping out.

[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.560]
Come on, let's get with it.

[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.380]
How many weeks has it been already, Bob LaRouf?

[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:04.020]
Let's get the show on the road here.

[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:04.280]
Okay.

[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.120]
This is a goddamn radio station.

[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.960]
Not something here that's like it's your convenience.

[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.460]
When you get good in goddamn radio, then we can do our stuff here.

[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.040]
You idiot.

[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.160]
You simple to you, a quizzling.

[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:14.480]
God.

[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.280]
He's the bane of our existence as Bob Freakin' Vermouth.

[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.260]
Can't complain about his engineering work,

[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.960]
because we don't really see much of it, if any.

[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.940]
All the facts is they're going to start coming in now.

[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.600]
Carol Burnett, she must be on the list.

[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.520]
You won't get my vote.

[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.280]
She's okay.

[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:31.160]
Huh?

[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:32.020]
She's all right.

[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.260]
And we're not putting Rosie O'Donnell on her.

[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:35.780]
You know something?

[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:41.000]
That would be, we'll do that one day, a list of people who make you physically ill

[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.180]
when you see them on your TV.

[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.000]
And she is one of them.

[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:43.960]
I'm not exaggerating.

[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.020]
I can't look at her.

[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.000]
I mean, you know, I've seen other fat dikes in what they are,

[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.540]
but there's just something about her.

[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:55.000]
She's just, she's so grotesque and just so disc, the whole, her whole stick.

[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:58.260]
You just want to stick it somewhere, like of her ass.

[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.000]
I mean, she makes me nauseous.

[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.180]
You're not all broken up that her adoption didn't work out with the troubled child.

[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:03.820]
Oh.

[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.340]
You're not bummed that she got the paper cut that she got.

[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:09.660]
Oh.

[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.540]
Yeah, I'm upset that it was almost.

[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.400]
The woman who played an answer is the rumbred fox.

[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.520]
I don't remember that.

[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:21.540]
I remember Freddie Prince.

[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.760]
Freddie Prince was not at your.

[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.520]
What show was he on?

[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:25.880]
Chico in the man.

[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:26.860]
Chico in the man.

[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.820]
Who was not at your with him?

[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.680]
Wasn't that Fred Rott?

[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:31.080]
Old guy.

[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:31.320]
No.

[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:31.440]
Oh.

[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.220]
You're thinking of Stanford and Son.

[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.780]
Oh, Santa, yeah, I don't remember.

[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.440]
Those just were my, how about John Schneider, your favorite?

[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.520]
See, right away he gets all nervous because I said that.

[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:43.820]
I would have liked that job.

[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.140]
All I said a few weeks ago was that I thought John Schneider was a great looking guy.

[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.400]
Once upon a time, he was.

[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:49.980]
I take your word.

[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:50.760]
No, you don't think.

[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.660]
Oh, it looked like a goober to me.

[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.000]
You know, see, that's what you said.

[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:54.280]
He didn't look like no good.

[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:54.800]
I'm sorry.

[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.800]
It was because he was on that show.

[00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:57.820]
You find it look like a glow.

[00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:58.560]
There you go.

[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.840]
He played Michael Landon.

[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:00.940]
How about Michael Landon?

[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.140]
Okay, he deserves to be on there.

[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:04.540]
Does he?

[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.180]
Four major shows.

[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:07.480]
Okay.

[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.700]
That's the least we can do for Michael.

[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.240]
He died?

[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:10.700]
Yeah.

[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.980]
Nice Jewish boy like that.

[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.200]
And isn't it interesting that most of the people on this one not most?

[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:16.860]
A lot of them are dead.

[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:17.860]
A little bit of my comrade's dead.

[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.240]
Lucille Balfe, Jackie Gleason.

[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.760]
William Conrad, Kelly Sivalas.

[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.520]
Jack, Jack Parsdale, live, any?

[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.340]
I don't know.

[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.300]
You know something I don't know.

[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:29.920]
Hey, he must be still alive.

[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:30.840]
Steve Allen's dead.

[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.540]
Um, then Michael Landon is dead.

[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.000]
The great people are the dead people.

[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:39.860]
And here's the cast of the Jefferson's.

[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.680]
Well, if we can't put the whole cast on there, but I do agree that was probably one of the best shows in history.

[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.760]
It's by the way time, jica says.

[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.540]
I keep mentioning that every time I mention the Jefferson's because he's got a bug up his ass about it about how it was so racist.

[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:50.460]
Fuck you Tom.

[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:50.840]
Okay.

[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.140]
We like your Tom, but sometime you're full of crap and that's one of them.

[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:57.460]
Jerry Seinfeld.

[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.460]
Well, now I'll put them on there only because they'll get a lot of votes.

[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:05.080]
I'll say and make no other comment that I watch that show that I like that show.

[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:05.980]
Do I like him?

[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:06.380]
No.

[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:07.920]
Post-Ur trial for anti-Semitism.

[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.260]
That's the way I look at him.

[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.740]
Post-Ur trial for anti-Semitism.

[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.540]
Is Jerry Seinfeld?

[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.080]
He is just such a, oh, uh, Ted Danson.

[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:17.840]
Is he going on a list?

[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.020]
No.

[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.320]
Bill Cosby's got to be on the list.

[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:20.960]
There's another one.

[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:22.760]
No, another one.

[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.480]
I don't get it.

[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.300]
I don't understand it.

[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.640]
Bill Cosby will be on the list.

[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:27.920]
Jay Leno.

[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:28.720]
Yeah, Jay Leno.

[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.400]
Put them on the list with all his chins.

[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:31.520]
There's a pretty good list there.

[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.540]
Keenan Ivory Wands.

[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.760]
Yeah, before you watch those dedicated boxing, you'll be with the big fights.

[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.780]
You have to watch the Wands.

[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.620]
Isn't that your favorite?

[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.420]
Tim Conway, you want to put him on the list?

[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:42.640]
No.

[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:43.980]
No, he's, he got no shot.

[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.720]
See, where are we going to start putting the minor people from the famous shows on?

[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.580]
You can't do that.

[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:53.340]
Who'd like to be putting all the people from the Steve a Louis Nye, you know, in Tom Post and Don Nots?

[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.040]
Huh?

[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.440]
Oh, how about Andy Griffith?

[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.060]
How about it, yeah.

[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.340]
You get a lot of votes in this crowd.

[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:00.140]
Yeah, Andy Griffith.

[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.940]
He's my favorite Andy Griffith.

[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.260]
What's that awful, where he plays the lawyer?

[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.340]
That's Matt Locke.

[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.140]
Matt Locke.

[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.100]
Oh my God.

[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.820]
I thought he used to play third base for the Cubs.

[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.120]
Matt Locke.

[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:15.540]
Yeah, he's a, he's a, a hillbilly detective for Graham.

[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:16.020]
Matt Locke.

[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:16.820]
We can do hillbilly's.

[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:17.940]
Jim neighbors.

[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:18.800]
Who's there?

[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:19.220]
No.

[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:19.820]
Okay.

[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:21.680]
Who would put Jim neighbors on the list?

[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:22.220]
Shazam.

[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:23.520]
No, I don't think so.

[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.200]
Who's the guy that used to do those awful promos on Channel 7 years ago?

[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:28.840]
Is it Bill Ross?

[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.320]
You see, now that's not before your time, but you just have forgotten about it.

[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:33.840]
Probably.

[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.040]
Barnaby Jones always gets his name in there.

[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:37.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.560]
You know the ones I'm talking about.

[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:38.780]

[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:39.640]
Cornball.

[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:45.080]
Before Channel 7 finally got independent and became a wacko station instead of making all that money.

[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.100]
Buddy Epsen speaking about it to be Jones.

[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:47.960]
Buddy Epsen.

[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.720]
There's another one my favorite.

[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:50.440]
Buddy Epsen.

[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.060]
Barnaby Jones always gets his man.

[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:54.400]
Hey, Jeddaya.

[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.040]
Did you know anybody named Jeddaya?

[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:57.820]
Not here.

[00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:59.080]
I'm Jeddaya and over here.

[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.060]
I know guy named Buster.

[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.080]
Really?

[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:03.860]
He built our house.

[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:04.940]
I know a dog named Buster.

[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.080]
He's day two.

[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.300]
You remember Buster?

[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:07.900]
He died.

[00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:08.700]
He died too.

[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.280]
567-0560-550-18 and T.O.

[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.060]
This is going to be great.

[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.480]
Now, I don't want to do too many here.

[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.200]
How many can we do each day?

[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:17.660]
50?

[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.260]
No limit.

[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.260]
Yeah, 50 sounds good.

[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.000]
But then they're going to have to go scrolling through there.

[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:22.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.780]
And then they're going to have to pick it up.

[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.280]
Yeah, kill some good time for them.

[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.220]
Keep mouth to streets.

[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:26.980]
Keep mouth to trouble.

[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.320]
Good for this crowd.

[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.980]
25 after 11 at 5.60-00.

[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:33.040]
By the way, speak it up.

[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:33.580]
He died.

[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:38.540]
When somebody dies, you know, those flowers for funerals can be really expensive, George.

[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:42.380]
So next time somebody you know dies, call our friends at Flower Depot.

[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.560]
And call them ahead of time.

[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.160]
So you won't have to like rush it last second.

[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.200]
I didn't know.

[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.900]
2000 roses for only 49.95.

[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:49.380]
That's right.

[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:53.200]
They'll deliver two dozen in the oral choice of color and nephaz with babies, breath greens

[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:58.220]
in a card for any occasion, whether it's an anniversary of birthday, a funeral, a bar mitzvah,

[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.200]
just for the hell of it.

[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:05.480]
Whatever the reason is, no ripoffs, no surprises, and even on the holidays, they don't raise the price to gouge your ass.

[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:05.880]
That's right.

[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.960]
Only 49.95 for 2000 quality roses all the time, all year round.

[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.920]
And they deliver seven days a wicked Flower Depot.

[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.080]
I think anybody there right might, even the dead would love quality roses from Flower Depot,

[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.120]
wouldn't the dead love them?

[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.120]
And the living to, of course.

[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:21.540]
And it's not too early to order from Flower Depot for Mother's Day as well.

[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:24.400]
And of course, they specialize in weddings also.

[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:30.020]
Meet with Flower Depot for no obligation consultation whenever you need flowers because Flower Depot very seriously does it all.

[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.420]
Call them today at 954-327-19221.

[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:36.180]
954-327-19221.

[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.960]
Mention me, Roger Schoen, get you 10% off your order.

[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.940]
Flower Depot, they've been delivering quality roses in town since 1987.

[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.860]
With the seven-day week delivery, they never close.

[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.340]
Don't forget Flower Depot is floored in the night show.

[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.380]
She's talking about picky Lawrence.

[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.360]
So she had red hair and they were like hawkers.

[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.820]
Hey, you hawkers.

[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:56.600]
How about William Shatter?

[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:57.700]
Yeah, he belongs on the list.

[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.680]
Sure, several shows.

[00:59:59.060 --> 00:59:59.940]
And how about Dick Clark?

[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.120]
Gotta put Dick on the list.

[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:01.520]
Absolutely.

[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.000]
Because I would say that's my favorite show.

[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.160]
I watched it again yesterday.

[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.300]
$100,000 a pair of mint or 25.

[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.380]
And how about Bill Cullen?

[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.160]
Dead.

[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:13.960]
No, I'm serious.

[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:15.240]
But I mean, most of the game shows.

[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:15.760]
He died.

[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.580]
And he's dead too.

[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.500]
And he did not have a wooden leg he had polio when he was a child.

[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.260]
Yeah, Bill Cullen.

[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.760]
Because he was on so damn many quag-

[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.540]
And a lot of good ones too.

[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.860]
And don't put Jack Berry on there.

[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.120]
Okay, we're not putting Jack Berry on there.

[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:29.320]
No.

[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.440]
Let him rest in peace.

[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.220]
You know, Jack Berry?

[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:31.760]
He died.

[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.280]
Also.

[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.120]
Yeah, Bill Cullen.

[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.480]
$56,705,60 pound.

[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.860]
And don't go to vote on these yet.

[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.760]
Because once we get the list of the compiled for today,

[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.980]
then we'll have them all up on there.

[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.240]
You follow what I'm saying?

[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.380]
And then the winner from today comes back tomorrow against another rub bunch.

[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.140]
We can continue this for like 50 years.

[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:49.460]
Can we?

[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.860]
And then we'll go back to the music thing.

[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.480]
Who's your favorite dead ball player?

[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:53.900]
Come on.

[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.460]
How about Ian Slaughter?

[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:55.960]
Is he dead?

[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:58.640]
Here's for a lottery.

[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:58.960]
Hello.

[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.180]
You don't have to do a deal.

[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:00.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.740]
How about Audrey Meadows?

[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.260]
Yeah.

[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.520]
And one, I know he's got to have a computer in the house.

[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.580]
I'm going to vote for Jack Berry.

[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:08.520]
Yeah, he's on there.

[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.400]
All right, Hank.

[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.340]
Have a good day.

[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.260]
Okay, see you, Joe.

[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.720]
Did he call me Hank?

[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:14.460]
Uh-huh.

[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.840]
$56,705,60 pound.

[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.160]
$56,708 TNT and Verizon Wireless Law.

[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.280]
How about the Jane Meadows?

[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:20.540]
No.

[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.940]
How about racing at the Meadows?

[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.180]
How about Roger Houston?

[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.320]
How about Doug Snyder?

[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:32.860]
Here's the Hollywood.

[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:33.200]
Hello.

[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.220]
Hey, how you doing there?

[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.740]
Then Charlie North Jr., yes, sir?

[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.900]
I got two best elections.

[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:37.280]
Okay.

[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.900]
One, the Beaver.

[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.160]
Yeah.

[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.220]
And also Larry Hagman.

[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.480]
Well, who would now...

[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.800]
Yeah, Larry Hagman's got to be on there.

[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.100]
Who would you put on there for him to leave it to Beaver?

[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:47.700]
The Beaver.

[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:48.420]
The Beaver?

[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:49.840]
Jerry Mathers.

[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:50.720]
Jerry Mathers.

[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.780]
George is giving me a whimsical look.

[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.160]
Well, it'd be hard to pick just one.

[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:54.960]
How about Tony Down?

[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:55.920]
That's true.

[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.640]
How about Hugh Beaumont?

[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.660]
How about Hugh Beaumont?

[01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.940]
How about Barbara Billingsley?

[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.680]
You know Hugh Beaumont?

[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:01.140]
You're right.

[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:01.940]
He's dead, too.

[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.220]
Doesn't she speak jazz?

[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.800]
Yeah, she speaks good jazz.

[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.640]
That Barbara Billingsley.

[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.320]
Okay, thanks, pal.

[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.520]
What about the office of the...

[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.400]
You go again down?

[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.120]
No, no.

[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.160]
You don't like those people.

[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.280]
Larry Hagman's got to be on there just for a Jeannie alone.

[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.560]
And Dallas?

[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.340]
Take care of me, though.

[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.940]
How about Mary Martin, if we put him on there?

[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:21.880]
Now, she's dead, too.

[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.180]
She was on TV, Mary Freakin Martin.

[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:25.640]
How about Edwin?

[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.960]
Now, we don't have enough old folks out there to put Edwin on it.

[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:29.480]
He was great.

[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.340]
Edwin was great.

[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:31.560]
He was funny.

[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.200]
And George, you even know who Edwin was?

[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.420]
I saw those old clips.

[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.360]
I go to length to see the stuff.

[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.380]
Edwin really hard to read.

[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:37.960]

[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.840]
I'm putting them on, am I?

[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:41.460]
No.

[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:44.340]
I'm thinking about it.

[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560]
This list is too big.

[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.460]
We'll put like 50 a day on there.

[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.900]
Minimum, because we've already got like 6,000 here today.

[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.100]
So who did we decide from the beaver?

[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.220]
Not Jerry Madness.

[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.940]
People aren't going to say I'd say Tony Dow.

[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.820]
He used to wear a wood.

[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.000]
Pencil thin belts.

[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.540]
You would say Tony Dow.

[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.320]
I was sure I would.

[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.960]
That's why I liked it until I loved Tony Dow.

[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.220]
You have those...

[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.460]
Are you listening to me?

[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.240]
I've heard that before.

[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:07.820]
I'd be full thin.

[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.380]
Pencil thin plastic belts.

[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:09.820]
Yes.

[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.800]
And I had one, too, as a matter of fact, when I was a punk.

[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.620]
Like last year.

[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.000]
No, Tony Dow.

[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:16.800]
He's going on there.

[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.160]
Not Barbara Billings-Lier.

[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:18.960]
You bull-mod.

[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:19.680]
You bull-mod.

[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:20.440]
I'm dead.

[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.860]
Like I said, you can't start putting out not all the minor characters from all those shows on there.

[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.180]
We're going to have like everybody from the goddamn Brady bunch.

[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.160]
How about the...

[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.140]
What's your name?

[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.000]
The planet of the name?

[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.140]
The planet of the name?

[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.120]
Alice. What was her name?

[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.700]
You know who I'm talking about.

[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:35.040]

[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.140]
No way we're putting Alice on.

[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.320]
Let's go get the tacos to my put Alice on there.

[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.800]
For the most supercellaneous self-hating queen, we'll put her on there.

[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.380]
Yeah, I understand.

[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.320]
This is an impossible task here.

[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.760]
We have to do this for at least like the next 20, 30 years.

[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.200]
Here's South Miami.

[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:53.560]
Hello.

[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:54.720]
Hey, Neil.

[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.340]
Yeah, that's funny.

[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.900]
You were just saying about like secondary characters.

[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.520]
Sam the butcher from the Brady bunch was also...

[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.140]
Gomer Pile.

[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.580]
Andy Griffith.

[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.000]
Uh-huh.

[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.220]
And, uh, I don't know.

[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.760]
He's been at...oh, all of the family.

[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:11.900]
What are you really?

[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.100]
What are you playing all of the family?

[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.040]
Like in the later ones, they're really bad when he played like Archie's buddy or something in the bar.

[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.540]
I don't know.

[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.180]
Anyway, why would you say about Barbara Eden and Jacqueline Smith?

[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.380]
Those are two examples of women who...

[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.040]
They have no sex appeal to heterosexual.

[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.200]
I think they're just like...

[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.360]
Barbara Eden doesn't...

[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.200]
Excuse me?

[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:31.880]
None.

[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.040]
Also, this is a kind of weird...

[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.300]
Well, how can you say that?

[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.280]
That heterosexual calling.

[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.600]
Barbara Eden was very, very cute.

[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.380]
So, Jacqueline Smith for that man.

[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.380]
And Dan Jacqueline Smith?

[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:44.820]
No, no, no real sex appeal.

[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.260]
But what about David Janssen?

[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.020]
Did he have sex appeal?

[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:49.760]
No.

[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.120]
Oh.

[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:50.680]
No, not really.

[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.540]
But he was a good character.

[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.260]
He's a good character.

[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.460]
Hey, David Janssen was good.

[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.280]
He was in the Fugina.

[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.160]
Yep.

[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.700]
And, uh, Harry...oh.

[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:57.620]
Harry?

[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.560]
Oh, and you know what?

[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.180]
How about Hawaii Fives?

[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.600]
How about Jack Lourd?

[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:03.940]
Jack...yeah.

[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:04.940]
Jack Lourd.

[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.300]
Um, okay.

[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.960]
What other kind of weird character who was in a bad show going on Pile, but Sergeant Carter?

[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.000]
Frank Sutton, he was a good character.

[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.180]
Have you played that character good?

[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.540]
He was no Jack Lourd Smith though.

[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.200]
That's true.

[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:16.600]
Okay.

[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.400]
One last thing.

[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.400]
Flare Bell, the clown.

[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.680]
Woods, Bob Keeson.

[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.280]
That was Captain Kangaroo.

[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:21.780]
He was?

[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:22.720]
Same guy.

[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.880]
Bob Keeson played Clare Bell?

[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:25.440]
Yes, he did.

[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.820]
Oh, my, to this day I never, never knew that.

[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.480]
Oh, my God, it was Barzini all along.

[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:29.980]
Yes, then.

[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.760]
Don't forget, boy, the Barbara Howard McNair.

[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.120]
Okay.

[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:32.480]
That would be character.

[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.020]
Okay, thanks.

[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:33.980]
Did you know that?

[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:34.740]
No, I did not.

[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.960]
Bob Keeson played Clare Bell.

[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:38.880]
Of course, I've never seen that.

[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.620]
Of course, you never saw it.

[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.140]
Oh, you've seen the clips and you know, Princess Summerfall, Winter Spring?

[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:43.500]
No.

[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.580]
And Dayton Allen?

[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:47.640]
Why not?

[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:47.960]
You remember the clips?

[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.300]
Yeah, he's actually Dayton Allen.

[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:49.520]

[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.380]
You didn't know who that was.

[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.460]
Dayton Allen was very funny.

[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.800]
I'm sure Bocabrine is rolling on the floor.

[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.240]
He is.

[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.140]
He's squeezing the Dorothy Cook Allen blow up doll right now.

[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.980]
Oh, there's another guy named Bug that I missed.

[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.280]
By the way, Barbara Eden.

[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:05.000]
That was a very provocative comment.

[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.660]
This gentleman just made us say that like a real heterosexual to me,

[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.080]
but never do her right now.

[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.200]
Hey, not all heterosexuals have good taste.

[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.480]
Just like not all homosexuals have good taste.

[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.880]
And not all the numbers in between have good taste.

[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:16.340]
Thank God.

[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.080]
But anyway.

[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:18.500]
No, seriously.

[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.840]
I mean, Barbara, how could anybody say that?

[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.220]
I just got through talking about her last week.

[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.220]
I just saw that piece on MSNBC about Barbara Eden.

[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.800]
It was one of my favorite people in the world.

[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.980]
I wouldn't say she's my favorite TV person of all time,

[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.800]
but she's here on My List to top-end.

[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.480]
In addition to which being...

[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.460]
And see, we're not just talking about which show did you like,

[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:44.940]
but who did you like most as a person, either sexually or just because they were a neat person, you know?

[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:46.020]
Like Dick Clark.

[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.840]
I don't like Dick Clark.

[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.400]
How about Skipper Chuck?

[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:52.860]
For all the locals.

[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.960]
You didn't grow up.

[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.580]
You're right. He was pretty sexy. You're right.

[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.660]
I'm not putting Skipper Chuck on there.

[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.460]
Then we're going to have to put Ralph Rennick on there.

[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:04.420]
Why not?

[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.240]
How about Ann Bishop?

[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.260]
How about Dwight Lauderdale for eating ass?

[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:08.760]
Huh?

[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.340]
Dwight, there was an award.

[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.100]
That's right. How many other news anchors have ever had the balls to say eating ass?

[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.460]
Or be associated with eating ass on a market in this town?

[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.040]
Anybody? No, only Dwight.

[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.420]
And that cross-eyed bitch, Kristy Krueger.

[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.760]
But that's a separate category for a separate day.

[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.780]
Okay, just don't give them all a mixed up here.

[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.060]
Skipper Chuck.

[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.420]
I just want to do like those restaurants here, Prima.

[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.680]
So the ones where all the people have their teeth fizzy in a glass.

[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.800]
Just the sound of that when you're sitting there eating your liver.

[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.340]
Which at least liver, you can like gum.

[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.400]
If it's cooked or right.

[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.680]
22 before 22 till no.

[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.620]
No, speaking of that, we got slugs coming from Earth.

[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.280]
Chris, it knows.

[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.380]
Life is worth living now.

[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.400]
See, maybe nostalgia is great.

[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.420]
Even though it's bullcrap.

[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.100]
And I admit that it's bullcrap, but it's a great escape.

[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.520]
Because it makes you feel that then was so much better than now.

[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.380]
It's not, maybe it was.

[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.220]
Maybe then sucked.

[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.560]
But nostalgia is tremendous.

[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.580]
Because you feel like, oh yeah, back when that was on, that was great.

[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.140]
Fight back what, how do you do that was on?

[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.660]
And I used to go down the street because we didn't have our first TV yet.

[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.780]
And when I was like five years old.

[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.560]
Or however, now I must have been eight years old.

[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.060]
And the little girl down the street her parents had about the only TV in the neighborhood.

[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:32.360]
And for your four of us kids would go down the street and we'd watch how he do the every afternoon on that TV set.

[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.360]
Now weren't those days great?

[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.280]
No, they sucked.

[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.000]
You know, they sucked.

[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.560]
No microwave ovens?

[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:40.680]
Yeah, no cell phone.

[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.240]
This weekend, dreamworks picture presents a timeless love story.

[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:57.540]
Between the two richest, shallowest actors in Hollywood, Julie Roberts, and Brad Pitt star in the Mexican.

[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.180]
Julia, you want to kill me taco?

[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.760]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.960]
Julia, you want to kill me, Jimmy Changas?

[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:11.420]
The Mexican.

[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.960]
And coming soon from dreamworks, the Chinaman.

[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.040]
And I know I'm native American.

[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:19.960]
I own and the Frenchman.

[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:21.820]
We, heavy that fuel.

[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.360]
16-till-known at 560 WDQM.

[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.940]
Here's one that says what do you think about putting Tim Kamoy on the list?

[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:27.200]
No.

[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.340]
I already had that suggestion.

[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.900]
Tim Kamoy is not going on the list.

[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:30.900]
Minor.

[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.700]
How about Arty?

[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.480]
What's his name?

[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.640]
What was his name? Arty, Chacanson?

[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:37.440]
No.

[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:43.420]
So here's somebody who says here is the list, underlining the like several squiggles there.

[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.160]
Look at those squiggles.

[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.380]
Look a little like Greg's not there.

[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:45.520]

[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.360]
Only this is a written far much to intelligently do have been written by Greg.

[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.320]
Christy McNichol.

[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.280]
What do you think about him?

[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:53.780]
I mean her.

[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.600]
Christy McNichol.

[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.880]
And remember Christy McNichol's brother?

[01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:58.780]
I'm sure you don't.

[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.040]
Jamie McNichol, I do.

[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.840]
Gary, do one of them go to be on the list?

[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:03.140]
No.

[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.380]
Then we got a Chinaman's chance.

[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.580]
So I mean, let's look.

[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.780]
We could put 50,000 Ames on the list and do this for the next 20 years.

[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.880]
And then we'd be out of business here.

[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.680]
But I think generally speaking, oh.

[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:18.820]
I generally speak and we got a limited to people who have a chance.

[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:19.760]
Who got a shot?

[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:20.960]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.840]
Christy McNichol is not going to win.

[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:23.960]
Can't the court?

[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.180]
What was the name of the show?

[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.140]
He was on the cap show.

[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:27.800]
Can't the court?

[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:28.680]
The rookies?

[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:29.880]
No, he was on the choice.

[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:30.860]
No, he was on the choice.

[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:31.700]
Adam 12.

[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:31.760]
Adam 12.

[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.160]
Very good.

[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.860]
Who was on the rookies?

[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:35.820]
Michael Lompkeen.

[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.740]
What about the Schwarz Center?

[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.700]
There are some Schwarzs.

[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:39.040]
I don't know.

[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.640]
Are there any of them going on there?

[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:40.840]
No.

[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:41.940]
How about Jean Raveron?

[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:43.040]
How about him?

[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.060]
Why not?

[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.560]
We have a bit about him.

[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:47.700]
Thank you, Blondes, aren't there?

[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:48.300]
Yes.

[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:49.920]

[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.340]
In fact, I saw that last night on a game show channel.

[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.100]
Play, play.

[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.340]
Jean Raveron, play, play.

[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.980]
Yeah, a lot of dead game show hosts.

[01:10:59.180 --> 01:10:59.380]
He died?

[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.000]
Yeah, let's put Jean Raveron on.

[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:01.820]
What the hell?

[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.020]
Make Boca Brian happy.

[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.260]
Now, we're not putting John Charles daily on here, okay?

[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.060]
Or Gary Moore.

[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.620]
Although interestingly, if you were really a TV buffing his older brother,

[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.440]
as I am, here's a very more probably should be honest,

[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.120]
because he was on for a long, long time.

[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.480]
On the other was the Gary Moore show.

[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.460]
There was, I've got a secret.

[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.520]
There was a whole, he would, Gary Moore was a, uh, thing.

[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:22.320]
He was an icon.

[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.020]
He was a pioneer.

[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.660]
How about David Gerwin?

[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:27.180]
No.

[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.100]
How about those people?

[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.180]
How about Walter Conkite?

[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:33.600]
Chad Huntly?

[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:34.360]
They're not going to weigh you.

[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:34.940]
Chad Huntly?

[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.600]
David Brinkley?

[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:38.040]
Peter Jennings.

[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.300]
Staying rather?

[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.160]
Campbell Hall?

[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.140]
Oh, it's just good to see you out.

[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.420]
Let's see, Jean Raveron Tony Dows.

[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.460]
He Tony Dows is the long, I've listened to spite of your inappropriate comments,

[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.960]
which were very accurate, by the way.

[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.760]
Okay, so I had the hotspot Tony Dows, big deal.

[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.600]
And he wasn't that great either to be honest with him.

[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.340]
But, you know, he was, there was something there.

[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.020]
How about Junior on the life of Riley?

[01:11:58.420 --> 01:11:59.300]
How about William Bendix?

[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:00.840]
He said.

[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:02.940]
He died?

[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:03.720]
No long time.

[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.500]
By the way, Orlando says that the guy was full of crap,

[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.720]
who was disembarking in Jack or Smith.

[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.340]
We don't need him to tell us.

[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.580]
You can close the door now, okay?

[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.320]
You can close the door.

[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.280]
I'll just, you know, uh, I said, Jar,

[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.020]
did we get Dick Van Dyke on there yet?

[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.140]
We got Dick Clark.

[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:20.900]
Mary Tyler Moore.

[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.000]
Oh, Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke.

[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.560]
Mary Tyler Moore.

[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.240]
She's got to be on her.

[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:26.980]
She does nothing for me.

[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.040]
She leaves me limp and Dick Van Dyke.

[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:33.720]
Oh, it's a Gail Gordon.

[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.560]
Remember Gail Gordon?

[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:35.460]
No.

[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:40.320]
He was on, um, with, uh, I mean, I know who it is.

[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.720]
Well, he was a character actor.

[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.200]
He was on, uh, Armist Brooks.

[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:45.980]
Huh?

[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.000]
You, you, you probably don't remember.

[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.380]
I'm Gary Coleman, as you go back.

[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:49.720]
No.

[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.240]
I'll put any medgets on the list, okay?

[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.320]
If we put medgets on the list, we'll put Timmy from a passions on here, okay?

[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.240]
How about Timmy?

[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.160]
Milton Burle, I did put on for Milfy Honor.

[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.260]
How come he got for the money?

[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.700]
Morton Downey Jr.

[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.080]
He got it.

[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:02.860]
Yeah, but he's still not gonna.

[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:03.680]
Joe Flynn?

[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:04.440]
Who?

[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:05.440]
Exactly.

[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.560]
Who the hell is Joe Flynn?

[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.600]
How about Phil's Honor here?

[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.720]
He was up to high in here.

[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:13.980]
Huh?

[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:15.800]
Okay.

[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:16.700]
Okay, trend setting.

[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.480]
There may be a hundred people on each day, you know what?

[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.200]
Can we, is it physically possible to do that?

[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.700]
We put a thousand on here.

[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.480]
Oh, like I said, maybe we'll do a hundred out of it.

[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.140]
For Eric.

[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.600]
How about jumping Jack O'Brien?

[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.820]
Hey, this will keep you busy instead of eating Eric.

[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.700]
Jumping Jack O'Brien?

[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.380]
Who is that?

[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:34.740]
Another local.

[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:36.080]
Okay.

[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.000]
She's having to have the music set.

[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.100]
Also from the Stuck Theater.

[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.580]
Kill it.

[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.380]
How about the Ferro Fosette is on here?

[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.280]
She was big in her day.

[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.280]
What did you give me such a half-assed day?

[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.020]
I wasn't just so tired of her.

[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.420]
Oh, crazy, yeah.

[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.700]
I know it wasn't so crazy about her the first time around.

[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:16.660]
Yeah, she had those nipples.

[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.540]
How about Linda Carter?

[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.060]
What are you saying?

[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:18.320]
No.

[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.340]
Jim Carrey in living color?

[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:20.700]
No.

[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.500]
And then here's a good one.

[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:24.180]
The host, they don't even know the name.

[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.500]
The host from Survivor.

[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.020]
I'm Jeff, anal probes.

[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:28.360]
Yeah.

[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.020]
No thanks.

[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.540]
So we got quite a list of all of them here.

[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.920]
Your favorite 400,000 people from TV.

[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:36.960]
How about Gettie Hayes?

[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.300]
How about Hoppe Long Cassidy?

[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.120]
How about Hoppe On This?

[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.660]
How about, uh, yeah, how about some of those old cowboy shows?

[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.300]
Wild Bill Hickock.

[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.860]
How about, I got one, George.

[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.300]
Alfred Hitchcock.

[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:49.820]
Huh?

[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.160]
There is a good one.

[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:53.400]
Alfred?

[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:55.060]
And guess what?

[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.340]
He died?

[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:56.880]
Yeah.

[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.640]
Probably too much fat.

[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.680]
5607-0560-0.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:07.440]
I think we've undertaken this far transcends the music thing, you know?

[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.720]
This goes way above and beyond that.

[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.120]
Here's the lady in Margate.

[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:12.440]
Hello.

[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.380]
Hi, Neil.

[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:13.960]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.920]
What's this thing about the Loan Ranger?

[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.540]
Was that Jay Silverhill?

[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.720]
No, Jay Silverhill played Tonto.

[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.080]
Okay, okay.

[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:21.580]
He did.

[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:27.340]
The Loan Ranger was, uh, uh, uh, waste beaver played him on the radio.

[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.500]
What the hell was the name of the guy to play the Loan Ranger?

[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.280]
Clay, uh, Clay, uh, Clay Faroe.

[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.000]
Clayton Moore, very good.

[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:36.500]
Yeah, but he's not going on.

[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.980]
How about Hoppe Long Cassidy?

[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.980]
Remember, uh, Death Valley Days in the Old Ranger.

[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:42.820]
I remember that.

[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:43.560]
You remember that?

[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:43.880]
Sure.

[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:44.580]
That's great.

[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.220]
But my favorite show was...

[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:49.020]
Death, you know, who used to be the announcer on Death Valley Days?

[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.180]
Was Ronald Reagan?

[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:51.760]
Ronald Reagan.

[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.060]
Right.

[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.240]
And he was on GE Theatre, too.

[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.120]
In fact, he used to be, uh, what the hell was Burracso?

[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.140]
He used to be one of the sponsors.

[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.060]
I remember like, was it...

[01:15:59.060 --> 01:15:59.060]

[01:15:59.180 --> 01:15:59.420]
Yeah.

[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:00.260]
Uh-huh.

[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.260]
20-mule team Burracso.

[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.280]
20-mule team, yeah.

[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:09.680]
My favorite show was always the Honeymooner's segment of the Jackie Gleason Show.

[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:10.200]
Uh-huh.

[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.080]
And my aunt knew him personally because she worked in Sheraton, Tenig, in Albany,

[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.260]
and he used to stay there.

[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.840]
And she called him Butterball.

[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:17.480]
Uh-huh.

[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.420]
And I just love that segment of the show.

[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.200]
You know, when he, uh, when he was alive, I guess, it was certainly not when he was dead.

[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.180]
He didn't go to the track.

[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:26.640]
But he was when he was living down here.

[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.460]
He used to go to a Pompeydo Park quite often.

[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.020]
And he would sit in the clubhouse and they had a table right up against the window.

[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.860]
And for, you know, first row into the dining room.

[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.220]
And they had him like sheltered off.

[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.800]
He didn't want anybody anywhere near him.

[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:41.820]
And he was, what, what he was entitled to, you know, but he was very, you know.

[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:42.580]
John, so...

[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:42.740]
Yeah.

[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.000]
What about the pool?

[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:44.900]
He played pool.

[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:45.820]
Well.

[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:46.460]
Did he?

[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.580]
And he did, didn't he?

[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:50.660]
I'm sure he never spent any time in the pool.

[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.200]
Yeah, the pool, not the pool.

[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.380]
I still love it.

[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.280]
I have the tapes and I watch them once more.

[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.300]
You know who I left off this list?

[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.300]
How could I sit Caesar?

[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.540]
Ah, sit Caesar.

[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:03.220]
Yeah.

[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.740]
And imaging calc, oh yeah.

[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.180]
Yeah.

[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.860]
Oh, we should go on and on.

[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.220]
Yeah, all of us old folgis.

[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.760]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.380]
Okay, now.

[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:10.740]
Bye-bye.

[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.240]
Yeah, sit Caesar is on the list.

[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:13.580]
Ain't too ruthless.

[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.880]
560-0560, pound 560.

[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.360]
Caesar is starting to get in the show is all confused.

[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:20.320]
Who is on which show?

[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.440]
Steve Allen show, the head of the best of Don Nots,

[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:27.320]
Palm Poston, Louis Nye, Dayton Allen.

[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.640]
See, I keep mentioning Dayton Allen.

[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.900]
I support him, that I'm messing with.

[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:30.760]
You're the one who that is.

[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.840]
I mean, we don't even know Clara Bell.

[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.100]
How could you know TV?

[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:36.360]
Sorry.

[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.140]
You should be.

[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.700]
I'd watch it if they had it on somewhere.

[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.460]
Now, what's the question that he had?

[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:43.240]
And he goes back that far.

[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.200]
How do I wear that question?

[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.300]
Who is your all-time favorite TV celebrity?

[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:48.060]
How about Foster Hewitt?

[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.360]
Here's a Madison Wisconsin.

[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:50.760]
Hello.

[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:55.180]
I need my pick would be James Darner.

[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.440]
Mm-hmm.

[01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.900]
Rockford Files, Rick.

[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:00.540]
Yeah.

[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.160]
Is he still alive?

[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:03.180]
Sure is.

[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.120]
Boy, it could fool me.

[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.740]
He looks like the walking.

[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:07.960]
Yeah, he's got to be on here.

[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:08.920]
He was sure on a lot of shows.

[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:09.540]
Yep.

[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.140]
Okay.

[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.240]
Nice talking to you.

[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:11.640]
Thanks.

[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:12.280]
Bye-bye.

[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.720]
Call them all the way from Madison, Wisconsin to suggest James Gardner.

[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.220]
I'm so sorry.

[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.400]
I'm so glad that they did.

[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.560]
Now, he's got to be on here.

[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.360]
He's got a lot of shows.

[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:23.040]
You're going to put the bands of people on there, Lauren Green?

[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.400]
Lauren was on a lot of shows also.

[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:26.920]
Like what?

[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.060]
Name one of his show, Be Saddle, and Gargolactica.

[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:31.080]
Oh, that show was on three weeks.

[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:31.960]
You know who was on that show?

[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:32.580]
Rick Springfield.

[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.020]
Yeah.

[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.080]
Can we put Rick Springfield on this?

[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:37.080]
He was on General Hospital.

[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.000]
Can we put him on the list?

[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:38.260]
No.

[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:38.760]
Come on.

[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.540]
I want him on the list.

[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.740]
He's on my list.

[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.040]
Huh?

[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.620]
Now look, I mean, I know you know like his music, but you got to admit once upon a time he

[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:47.360]
looked human.

[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.520]
As long as he didn't speak.

[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.640]
How about Richard Simmons?

[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.640]
Speaking of, I'm thinking of, how about John Stamos?

[01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:58.120]
Blacky from General Hospital.

[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.080]
What's the show, what's the show he's on now?

[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:02.660]
And he still looks the same now as he did then.

[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.740]
He's on some shows in charge?

[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.000]
No, no, no, that's not John Stamos.

[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.440]
Oh, that's the, the other guy.

[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.060]
That's Scott Beow and Willie Ames.

[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:12.800]
Willie Ames.

[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.420]
Squared Squirt, but not as good as Peter North.

[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.000]
I don't know what John Stamos is on.

[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.300]
That's what Monica said.

[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:18.960]
She said, bubba.

[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:22.060]
But, he's not as good as the other one of them, and that's what got him in a lot of trouble.

[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.580]
It doesn't belong in the list.

[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.440]
How about eight Ames?

[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.900]
Oh, we're back to the music again.

[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.140]
Who doesn't belong on the list?

[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.880]
John Stamos doesn't belong on the list?

[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:33.140]
See, what do you know?

[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:36.600]
How do you know John Stamos don't belong on the list, mister?

[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.140]
Yeah, how about the soap opera people?

[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.920]
How about the, no, we can't do that.

[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.980]
There's too many of them.

[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.760]
And if we do soap operas, they'll mention that bitch from all my children again

[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.280]
that is famous for being the stiff every year.

[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.260]
Susan Lucci.

[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.380]
Kuchi Kuchi, get rid of Susan Lucci.

[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.160]
Oh, man, I hate that show.

[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.220]
I can't stand her.

[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.500]
It makes me nauseous thinking that there's people watching it.

[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.100]
I vote for passions before I vote for that thing.

[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:00.520]
God.

[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.300]
Hey, boy.

[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:02.900]
Huh?

[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:04.100]
Full house?

[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.120]
Is John Stamos?

[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.140]
Thank you very much.

[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.680]
Hey, don't be knocking, John Stamos, okay?

[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.420]
I always got room in my house for him.

[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:13.740]
Here's Bokeh.

[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:13.940]
Hello.

[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.200]
Hello.

[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:15.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.680]
A couple of followers ago, the one guy is crazy about bar reading.

[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.660]
That, that, that, what he said was un-American, I think.

[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:24.760]
Oh, my God.

[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:25.100]
Yeah.

[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.000]
I'm 40 years old, but, man, I don't think thinking about her.

[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.320]
He must have bad eyesight.

[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:30.200]
Right.

[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:36.340]
And, um, my grandparents are from just southwest of Cooperstown, between Cooperstown and

[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:37.080]
O'Neill, right?

[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.660]
In Clareville, and his, he's married, his wife, they had a restaurant.

[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.020]
I forget what that wrote.

[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.080]
It's just a two-lane highway in the middle of nowhere.

[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.260]
So, country, country.

[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:46.800]
So, it's a big kitchen.

[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.300]
But it wasn't Bob Keeshin?

[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.680]
No, it wasn't him.

[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:50.640]
I'd recognize him.

[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:51.940]
My dad even sent me the article.

[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:52.880]
He's dead, by the way.

[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.120]
He died about two years ago.

[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.160]
Bob Keeshin is dead?

[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:55.920]
He died.

[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:56.780]
Clareville.

[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.060]
Clareville is dead, too.

[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:58.880]
Yes.

[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.560]
I think it was all time that's got him.

[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.520]
Oh, my God.

[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.960]
Yeah, he's so salacious.

[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.380]
So, let's see, Bob is dead.

[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:08.120]
Howdy-duty is dead, Mr. Bluster is dead, and Clareville is dead.

[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.200]
And Clareville.

[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.940]
And I wouldn't be surprised if Princess Summerfall Winnerspring is dead, too.

[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.100]
There he goes, talent.

[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.280]
That's beautiful country up there, but not the winner.

[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:15.780]
Forget it.

[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.120]
Right.

[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.060]
My dad's from Rochester, too, by the way.

[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:18.740]
I'm so sorry.

[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:19.540]
I know.

[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.000]
They make good units of club beer up that way, though.

[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:22.600]
And, Jenny.

[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:24.180]
Okay, pal.

[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:24.900]
All right.

[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:25.300]
Have a good one.

[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:25.960]
See you, Comsill.

[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:26.700]
All right.

[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:26.980]
Later.

[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:27.440]
Bye-bye.

[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.240]
See when a lot of locks come out for those three weeks a year.

[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.440]
That's when Rochester's real pretty, you know?

[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.220]
When a lot of locks come out, you can sniff them.

[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.140]
And that's it.

[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.700]
Then you go to Don and Bob's, the ones that are still left.

[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.100]
And you say, Boyscher, was nice being back here for a couple of minutes.

[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.140]
Yeah, you just can't go back.

[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.800]
That's why my style is just so great, because you can talk about it.

[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.860]
But I mean, try to go back, forget about that.

[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:48.340]
Like, go back to Detroit.

[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.640]
How's all my favorite restaurants?

[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.860]
But, Comsill, that's still there?

[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:51.080]
No.

[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:51.320]
No.

[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.740]
How about the, uh, Topakers?

[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:53.040]
No.

[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.080]
London Chop-Hop?

[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:54.260]
No.

[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:55.800]
They're all gone.

[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.360]
They're all replaced by schwarzers.

[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.960]
See, no matter where you're going, you go back to try to re-kindle your youth and those

[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.460]
where you're, they're all gone and replaced by dark folks.

[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.360]
That's called Get an Even.

[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.260]
See, they don't need any reparations.

[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.640]
They're ready to get in even with us.

[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.900]
And if you don't believe me, just go to North-Dade, take a look around.

[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:11.700]
Yeah.

[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:12.940]
They're getting in even with us.

[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:15.100]
See, we'll teach you honky's a lesson or two.

[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:31.540]
Come on, one at five, sixty-w.

[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.740]
WQM, happy one to team.

[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:34.600]
We got Hank coming up from Shoolestake 2-2.

[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.940]
The mad dogs, you mad at it.

[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.120]
Yeah.

[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.780]
Six to eight, thirty, and then we got all the Amarland stuff, starting with the crow, eight,

[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.240]
thirty, and any KF to the Amarland ever signed an, uh, Arizona Donut backing.

[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:44.740]
Should have a big audience for that one.

[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:44.900]
Yeah.

[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.360]
Based on the attendance to get out there,

[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.360]
Harrison log, tough suggestions, okay, which some will have to be on the list.

[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.460]
I'm going to go down the list again.

[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.200]
But here, listen to this list, grab your marks.

[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:57.560]
Sure.

[01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:58.900]
Gotta be on the go.

[01:22:59.060 --> 01:22:59.340]
Uh-huh.

[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:00.300]
Fred Gwyn.

[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:01.440]
No.

[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.640]
Well, then I liked him, but what, what did you do with the officers?

[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:06.320]

[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:09.380]
Again, these have to be people that have a chance to win.

[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:10.680]
Okay?

[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:11.560]
Okay.

[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.280]
John Aston.

[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:14.760]
Please.

[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.220]
Art Karney.

[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:18.860]
Again, I liked him.

[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:19.800]
Did you get a win?

[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:21.360]
No.

[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:22.360]
Don Adams.

[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:23.620]
No.

[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:24.680]
Get smart.

[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.080]
Sherman Hemsley, we mentioned him.

[01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:27.880]
I, I don't know.

[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.060]
We got to put him on there, don't we?

[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.860]
Wait, the guys got some tokens on there to make sure he goes.

[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.080]
Oh, that's where I got to put a few tokens for us, his honor.

[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.300]
Sherman Hemsley.

[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.700]
But they're not going to know who that is.

[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:39.320]
Okay.

[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.220]
So Eric, when we put Sherman Hemsley on there,

[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.960]
we're going to put George Jefferson in parentheses.

[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.660]
I, I, you know, I realize that's pretty stupid to do,

[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.260]
but again, we got a lot of stupid people out there.

[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.900]
It's not like he's a famous person, you know what I mean?

[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:52.920]
As far as an asset.

[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:53.580]
Not by that name.

[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:53.980]
Right.

[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.860]
You see him and you think a lot of it's like, you're just like if you see his wife.

[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.000]
He's, oh, that's we easy, you know, which I wouldn't know what his wife's name is anyway.

[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:01.300]
Would you?

[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:02.860]
The actress have played we easy.

[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:04.700]
What about the maid?

[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.420]
What about Florence?

[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.380]
Who played her?

[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.300]
Not that we want.

[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:08.380]
She's not going to be on list.

[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:09.820]
Florence was good.

[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:10.840]
Yeah, she's funny.

[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:14.540]
And then I, you know, a couple of romp stairs, Tom and the, what's your name?

[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.700]
The, the, the, the, the, what's his right, Tom and, uh, and whatever.

[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:20.640]
Bob Newhart, what do you say?

[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.780]
Yeah, we got to put him on here.

[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:22.920]
I don't like Bob Newhart.

[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.380]
He used to be very funny long, long, long, long, long, long, long time ago.

[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:27.860]
Just like that.

[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:28.300]
I thought I'd hear.

[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.380]
He was.

[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:31.280]
A long time ago.

[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.740]
You always wonder why is this person there?

[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.100]
What's his, because he once upon a time it was very funny.

[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.520]
We feel, feel sorry for him.

[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.600]
A, Ted Knight.

[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.480]
No, good night, nurse, now.

[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:44.200]
Oh, somebody, here's a girl running me, Michelle Gillan.

[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:44.400]
No.

[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:45.900]
Come on, me, Michelle, what do you say?

[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:46.120]
No.

[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:46.900]
Me, Michelle Gillan.

[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:47.620]
Here's what it says.

[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.380]
I, F and hate Lucy, but she should be on list.

[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.360]
She's already on, it's her.

[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.080]
I'll read it.

[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:51.520]
I'll read it.

[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.200]
Listen to a second.

[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.700]
How about foster Brooks?

[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.260]
I put foster, he would on there before foster Brooks.

[01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.300]
Let's see.

[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.940]
How about, uh, Fancy?

[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:03.100]
Henry Winkler.

[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.200]
Anybody from that show?

[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.120]
Well, you gotta put Richie on there.

[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:10.560]
No.

[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.100]
Because he was in a whole bunch of shows. He was on Andy Griffiths.

[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:14.540]
Ron Howard.

[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.840]
He grew up on TV.

[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.080]
He can't stand Ron Howard.

[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.160]
How long's on the list?

[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:20.160]
Okay.

[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.520]
Not only for his TV stuff, but then, you know, he got big things.

[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.120]
Okay. Ron Howard. Henry Winkler.

[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.180]
And if we're gonna put them on, how about Scott Bale?

[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:30.180]
Mm-hmm.

[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.760]
Hey, news for you. Looked to hell of a lot better than they did.

[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.580]
So you're forgetting again the category for the premise of this.

[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.340]
You didn't have to like him because they were great actors or actresses

[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:45.940]
or because they were very funny. Maybe you were sitting close to the TV

[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.220]
and getting all nervous about it.

[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:48.480]
No nervous in jerky.

[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.860]
Huh? Scott Bale, what do you say now?

[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:51.780]
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:53.400]
Well, it's a moment of weakness on my part.

[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:54.380]
Williams.

[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:58.820]
How about the... well, shields in your nail.

[01:25:58.820 --> 01:25:59.240]
No.

[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.520]
Herb Edelman.

[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.360]
Who the hell is her bed?

[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.820]
I'm the book of Brian Lisk of the 303.

[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:04.660]
Oh, yeah. You were the awesome.

[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.080]
Then you stopped me and Mr. Frank Petrie.

[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.880]
You belong in a Petrie dish, okay?

[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:09.820]
Frank Petrie.

[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:10.820]
You maniac...

[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.640]
Star ski and hutch.

[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.640]
Who was on that show?

[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.560]
Paul Pauley, the blazer.

[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.240]
Paul Lisk of David David the Soul.

[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.760]
Very good. Are they going on the list?

[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:23.060]
No.

[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:23.340]
No.

[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.120]
Gary Coleman is... how about the six million dollar man?

[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.940]
Who was... he's dead.

[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.200]
No, he's not.

[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:31.480]
The neighbors?

[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.500]
The six million dollar man was not the same neighbor.

[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:35.120]
He died.

[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.100]
He might have done the six million dollars to him.

[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.680]
No, not Steve Austin.

[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:39.760]
Steve Nichol.

[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.740]
The six million dollar man was Lee...

[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:43.860]
Lee Major.

[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.540]
Lee Major's.

[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.420]
Or Stan Major?

[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.960]
Stan Major was the two thousand dollar man.

[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.820]
Not the six million dollar man.

[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.140]
Well, I thought it was the guy with those day one king sized sandwiches with the six million dollar man.

[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:53.760]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:54.960]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:55.200]

And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:55.780]

[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.220]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.900]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.060]
And then Jerry Wittner.

And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:01.960]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:02.620]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:02.660]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.320]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:06.320]

[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.140]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:10.920]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:11.740]

And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:19.540]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:21.000]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.020]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:38.620]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.380]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.380]

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.780]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:40.780]

[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:41.000]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:41.100]
And then Jerry Wittner.

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:42.920]

[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.740]
You know, this is a comedy show.

[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:32.880]
You know, this is a comedy show.

[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.380]
You know, this is a comedy show.

[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.200]
You know, this is a comedy show.

[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.440]
You know, this is a comedy show.

[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:43.980]
Huh?

[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.700]
Yeah, and you'd probably be divorced if that were the case.

[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:48.040]
You'd start talking to your wife a lot more.

[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:51.100]
All you people out there, everything's a divorce race bad now.

[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:52.360]
What if we had no TV?

[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:55.780]
And then we got some smart ass who's going to call and say,

[01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:57.560]
well, if we didn't have TV, then you'd have less divorce

[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.480]
because people wouldn't be arguing so much about the, in the clicker, you know?

[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:02.700]
That's the big thing is who's got the goddamn clicker.

[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.320]
I give the feeling that I'm going to mung all over myself with a school here,

[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.640]
which I really don't want to do.

[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.560]
Oh, look, look at that, George.

[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:12.880]
Look at that.

[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:16.300]
A beautiful, rib eye cook just the way I like it, meeting well.

[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.500]
And these barbecues shrimp that could just knock your socks off

[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.380]
from Ruth's Christachios.

[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.340]
Thank you very much, guys.

[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:24.940]
Here's Miami.

[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:25.260]
Hello.

[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.200]
Hi, Neil.

[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:26.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:30.200]
Was, was we the extra roll or was that already mentioned?

[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:31.840]
I beg your pardon?

[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.720]
Was we the extra roll?

[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.060]
No, no, I asked the roll was on, uh, good times.

[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.360]
Oh, uh, I thought, uh, what day, J.

[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:41.860]
Hey, how about, uh, Elliot Kuriyakkin from the man from Uncle?

[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:42.460]
Oh, yeah.

[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:43.880]
Remember him?

[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:44.280]
Uh-huh.

[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.420]
George with 90s.

[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:46.520]
Robert Von.

[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:47.360]
Yeah.

[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:48.640]
Uh, yeah.

[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:53.260]
Now, I know you said don't call in under 82, but my grandson just called him.

[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.260]
Let me know I was only 81, though.

[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:55.740]
Excellent.

[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:57.060]
That was a good, that's okay.

[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.860]
That was a good thing for me.

[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.080]
We all wish we could make it.

[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.480]
Uh, another thing.

[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:04.740]
Well, David, David Von.

[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:05.480]
David Von.

[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:10.020]
No, no, but who is the other, who is the other guy?

[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.340]
David, David Sol.

[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:12.440]
No, I don't know.

[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:12.440]

[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:12.440]

[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:12.440]

[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.100]
I'm not David Sol.

[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.320]
The blonde guy on that show.

[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.440]
Elliot Kuriyakkin.

[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:15.820]
No.

[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:16.800]
That was his character.

[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:17.980]
Yeah, but what was his name?

[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:19.180]
Oh, I don't know.

[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.060]
No, we'll find out.

[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:20.800]
I'm too old.

[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:21.340]
Neil.

[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:26.820]
Do you think the dolphins did very good with the draft as far as their business, that's a

[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:27.920]
better guy I never heard of?

[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:28.200]
See ya.

[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:28.660]
See ya.

[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:29.180]
Say goodbye.

[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.080]
Your Alzheimer's just kicked in.

[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:36.360]
567, 0560, pound 560 on the 18.

[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.980]
Did anybody call in about Andy Devine?

[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.320]
What show, who he was sidekick to?

[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:40.880]
What cowboy?

[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.160]
Got to be stumbled far like me.

[01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:48.900]
San, you notice one of those things just like with the music, isn't that interesting,

[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:49.180]
huh?

[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.540]
And you're going to say, well that's because you don't have that many young people listening.

[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.020]
Bullquab, we have a lot of young people listening.

[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:02.540]
But you'll notice that most of these names are from shows that have been on long ago.

[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:05.120]
Am I right about that?

[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:05.980]
Yeah.

[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:07.220]
Somebody suggested the golden girls.

[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:07.980]
No, thanks.

[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.920]
No, thank you.

[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:14.460]
How about Alan Ludden?

[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.160]
Which we still do like his cop drops?

[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:17.940]
He died.

[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:18.440]
Huh?

[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:20.440]
What do you think?

[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:21.800]
No.

[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.060]
No, he won't get three votes.

[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.640]
Here's a level and four lottery, four lottery, Alan.

[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:27.860]
Hello.

[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:28.860]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:29.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:32.020]
No sports talk, no more into that last caller.

[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.660]
Yeah, when he's old, he's old and soon, I can't help myself.

[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:38.000]
The best show, as I remember growing up, was Mod.

[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:39.520]
You know why?

[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:41.540]
Adrian Barbos.

[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:42.220]
Oh.

[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:43.480]
Incredible.

[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:43.960]
Yeah.

[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.200]
And the worst, Belkies Nurei.

[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.220]
Spooky's Nurei.

[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.540]
Have a nice day.

[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:49.220]
You too, thank you.

[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.260]
They don't like Spooky's Nurei on Channel 7.

[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:52.780]
They can't even stand her name.

[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:53.620]
And what's the one that you have?

[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:54.820]
Catwoman, I can never think of her name.

[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:56.180]
The one with the cat eyes.

[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:57.200]
Boy, she makes me.

[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:59.880]
That whole Channel 7, it's like a free show is what it is.

[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.460]
That's why they got such big numbers.

[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.020]
Everybody likes a free show.

[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:05.540]
Here's Miami Beach.

[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:05.740]

[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:10.140]
Yeah, I think that Andy Devine was Wild Bill Hickock's sidekick.

[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:12.400]
I remember the phrase, I think I'm right on this,

[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.000]
where we would say, hey, Wild Bill, wait for me.

[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:15.480]
Huh.

[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.180]
Remember that phrase on that show?

[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:17.620]
No.

[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:20.120]
Okay, but I do remember Wild Bill Hickock very well.

[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.740]
Yeah, but I got it.

[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.020]
I think the sidekick there was, Andy Devine.

[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:24.700]
And you know what?

[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:25.920]
Yeah.

[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.100]
He died.

[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.100]
It could be now, from my suggestion,

[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:32.160]
from the Avengers, my favorite Diana Rig.

[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:33.560]
Diana Rig.

[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:34.840]
From the Avengers.

[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:37.100]
You know, just top notch.

[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.980]
That's, you know, that'd be my guess.

[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:42.800]
Others than that, you've got the nominations already, Jackie Gleason,

[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:43.640]
now for Hitchcock.

[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:49.100]
Do you remember the name of the guy that was on with Robert Vaughn on the show?

[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:49.420]
I don't.

[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.800]
His first name was David.

[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:51.480]
David Sumpton.

[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:51.920]
Yeah.

[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:52.680]
British.

[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:52.780]

[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:52.900]
British.

[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:52.980]

[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:53.580]
Not charity.

[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:56.360]
I'm bad at actors and actresses.

[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.460]
No, I mean, I'm a deciding member.

[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:00.280]
Ilya Kiriak and with Napoleon Solo, man for a month.

[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:00.680]
Right.

[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.760]
But I did nation's for a fair.

[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.580]
There's got somebody we'll call them, David Sumpton.

[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:04.900]
Yeah.

[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:05.780]
Okay, thanks.

[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:06.040]
Right.

[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:06.400]
Bye.

[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.800]
I can look into the book, but that would be too easy, plus I'm eating lunch right now.

[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:15.820]
So Gary Sarner being the real bitch on today, he brings me a plastic fork.

[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:19.560]
I've got a steak knife for you.

[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.580]
I got a beautiful rib eye steak here from Roots Creek.

[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:22.520]
I've got a steak knife for you.

[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.120]
I don't need one.

[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:24.580]
I thought he would, I thought he would Jewish.

[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.200]
Oh, I don't need, you know, something.

[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.500]
This is so tender that I'm cutting it with a plastic knife.

[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:31.700]
God.

[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:33.340]
David McCallum.

[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:34.480]
Thank you very much.

[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.580]
David McCallum.

[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.100]
God bless you folks.

[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:38.540]
Boy, see?

[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.440]
Sometimes you put the audience down, but that's only those idiots in the first hour.

[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:43.680]
The Monday morning, first hour.

[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:48.740]
But once we get on to something really important like TV crap, like trivia,

[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.000]
like all those old fogeys, then we got something good going.

[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.420]
David McCallum and Robert Vaughan.

[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:57.280]
We got a pretty good list going here, I would think.

[01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.340]
A lot of dead people too.

[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.140]
Now what do you eat?

[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:03.400]
A salad.

[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:07.600]
And there's, I think there's a couple of shrimp over here in a little bowl.

[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.080]
Remember we were worried about how steak would travel and so on and so on?

[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.240]
How's the travel damn good?

[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.940]
I have to take your word for it.

[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:15.620]
That meat is sensational.

[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:19.420]
I might give you a little, like a nub off the end, little nub.

[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:22.820]
26 after noon at 5 p.m.

[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:23.420]
5 p.m.

[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:26.960]
You want a good night's sleep tonight and every night for a long time to go.

[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:28.340]
Of course you do unless you're nuts.

[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:30.720]
So get you a great new mattress.

[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:33.700]
Toss out the lumpy old bumpy one, even the best ones don't last forever.

[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.100]
And get you a great mattress from our friends at Dallamaatris.

[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:37.900]
That's what I always do and you should too.

[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:41.780]
Dallamaatris is the original, the easy, the smart way to buy you a new brand name mattress.

[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.120]
They got a lower house prices every day of your life.

[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:47.880]
So instead of waiting for a fall and victim to some phony sale in a Navetinger department store,

[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:48.900]
here's the way to do it.

[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:52.420]
All of those stories saw house brand mattresses, which is code for cheap garbage.

[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:53.760]
But never a Dallamaatris.

[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.540]
They wouldn't waste their time with stuff like that.

[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:59.720]
They saw only National Nave brand mattresses like Surda and Sealey, Simmons and King Cora.

[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:04.400]
When you call one at 800 mattress, you can be sure the mattress you want is always in stock too.

[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:08.400]
And they deliver to you seven days a week on the day and time that you want whatever it's convenient for you.

[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.860]
And depending on where you live as soon as a couple hours after you make that one easy phone call.

[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.140]
Only Dallamaatris gives you 30 day in home.

[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:16.140]
A 40560.

[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:18.360]
Oh, you got me.

[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:21.460]
Yeah, you criminalized pot in Florida.

[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:23.300]
I, William Shatner.

[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.660]
I, William Shatner.

[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:25.640]
Take this woman.

[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:26.720]
Take this woman.

[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:28.160]
Take it.

[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:32.200]
Take me down to the Paladine city.

[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:36.540]
Well, the past is green and gold.

[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:38.280]
Oh, pretty.

[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:40.060]
Okay.

[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:43.020]
To have and to hold.

[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.140]
To have and to hold.

[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:45.780]
Hold.

[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.020]
Hold me now.

[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:50.880]
Hold me.

[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:53.000]
And you're loving us.

[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:57.000]
Day with me.

[01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:58.480]
Let.

[01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:00.700]
Loving start.

[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:01.740]
Let's.

[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.600]
Love start.

[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.380]
That's fine, but if it's not so much to ask, I'd like to keep this ceremony simple.

[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:12.820]
Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?

[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:13.780]
I do.

[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:15.500]
Dallamaatris.

[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:15.740]
I do.

[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.340]
Everything I do.

[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:18.660]
I do for you.

[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.700]
Look into my eyes.

[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:24.520]
You will see what you means, me.

[01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:27.180]
Such a heart then, such a soul.

[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.320]
And when you find me there, you'll.

[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.500]
Sir, no more.

[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:36.500]
By the powers invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.

[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.560]
You may now kiss the bride.

[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:43.000]
Just kiss the damn bride.

[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:46.620]
Isn't that one of the things we love about William Shadden and the fact he don't take himself too seriously?

[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:47.420]
No, no.

[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:47.620]
Yeah.

[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:48.440]
Got to take anything.

[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.900]
Is it like when his wife drowned in a pool?

[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:50.840]
He didn't take that seriously.

[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:54.040]
He went off and got that young chicken ran off to Mexico and got married again.

[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.060]
Nice going, Airbilly.

[01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:56.740]
He's out of this world.

[01:46:58.080 --> 01:46:59.420]
So the lunch is sensational.

[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:02.060]
George didn't get too much because he's watching his wait.

[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:07.260]
And because I didn't know I was about to think he restarted it and didn't like you very much.

[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:09.260]
Apparently not all those shows I did on his real.

[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:10.700]
Oh, that's right.

[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:10.900]
He is.

[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:11.440]
That's right.

[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:12.680]
Too much Palestinian talk.

[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:17.020]
And then when you start standing up for Benny and the other day, he really got pissed off.

[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:20.660]
Oh, look at Robert.

[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.140]
I don't even know what this name is.

[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.240]
GUILLA, UME.

[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:24.960]
Guillaume.

[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:25.340]
Guillaume.

[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:25.980]
Guillaume.

[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:26.780]
Who is that?

[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.240]
Benson.

[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:29.680]
Benson?

[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:31.160]
Harry Benson?

[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:33.480]
Robbie Benson?

[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:35.080]
I don't know who that is.

[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:35.760]
What's Benson?

[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:37.420]
Benson was a sitcom.

[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.460]
He was also on soap.

[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:42.120]
He was the black butler and he got spun off and it was his own sitcom.

[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.340]
Well, the answer is no.

[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:45.140]
And speaking of no, here's another one.

[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:45.540]
Oprah?

[01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:48.220]
Now see, I can't go on.

[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:49.400]
Not in the middle of my lunch.

[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:50.340]
Did somebody say Oprah?

[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.000]
We got to put around it.

[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:55.920]
Yeah, she's big.

[01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:57.240]
Huge.

[01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:58.340]
About 600 pounds.

[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.060]
Okay, she's on the list and I do, oh.

[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:00.760]
Ah!

[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:01.960]
Sorry.

[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:06.340]
I'm apologizing to myself for putting that bitch on her Oprah.

[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.080]
Yeah, she's got to be on her.

[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:10.980]
She's got all these millions of women, millions of imbosils, idiots.

[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:17.000]
Just following her every word, buying the books that she's peddling, buying into this week's diet.

[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.320]
Oh, here's the good one.

[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:20.880]
Lawrence Welk.

[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.100]
I'm afraid that a audience isn't quite that old yet, okay?

[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:26.840]
Nice try.

[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:27.780]
A one that too.

[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:28.640]
Bob Newhart.

[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.260]
He's on the list.

[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:32.280]
Here's some other ones on here.

[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:33.360]
Let's see, Phil Sovers.

[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:37.040]
Phil Sovers was, I don't know.

[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.220]
I never thought he was very funny.

[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:39.620]
Did you think Phil Sovers was funny?

[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:40.260]
Who?

[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:41.720]
Oh, you don't know who that is?

[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.480]
Q. Glasses Ball, comedian.

[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.720]
You got to know her down more than that.

[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:52.440]
He was in some, I don't know, one of those McHale's Navy kind of shows, but not that one.

[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:55.620]
I'm sure if I saw it.

[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:56.500]
He's not going to be on the list.

[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:57.580]
Raymond Burr's on here.

[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.460]
Larry Hagman's on here.

[01:48:58.760 --> 01:48:59.180]
Eddie Albert.

[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.040]
What do you say Eddie Albert?

[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:00.440]
No.

[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:03.420]
If we put Eddie Albert in there, we got to put Ava Gabor and Jarge Gabor.

[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:05.520]
Is this Merv Griffin going on our list?

[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:05.760]
No.

[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:10.460]
Now, when we do the poll on famous closet people, we'll put a revolver on here.

[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:11.640]
Robert Conrad.

[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.640]
Wild Wild West and Bobob Blacksheet.

[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:15.100]
What do you say?

[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:15.760]
Robert Conrad.

[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:15.960]
No.

[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:16.420]
No.

[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.560]
You know what I mean?

[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:21.200]
Take him or leave him.

[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:23.240]
He's just not strong enough.

[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:24.680]
It's got to be somebody really strong.

[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:27.080]
Somebody really really strong.

[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:29.220]
And he ain't strong.

[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:32.240]
Mobile in Weston, hello.

[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.200]
Good afternoon, Dale.

[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:34.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:37.280]
Do you have Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke?

[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.080]
You know, we got them.

[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.460]
How about Robert Wagner?

[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.100]
Eh.

[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:42.620]
Buddy Epson.

[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:43.640]
Yeah, he's on there.

[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:45.980]
And Marie McCormick, my personal favorite.

[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:47.440]
Who's Marie McCormick?

[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.380]
Marshall Brady.

[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:50.500]
Oh, okay.

[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.180]
Have a great day.

[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:51.700]
All right.

[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:52.360]
Okay, Pervert.

[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:53.900]
Marie McCormick.

[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.680]
The next thing you know, we have people going in, say, it's God-beo.

[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.120]
You know, Chris Adkins.

[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.540]
Perverts, fags, like me.

[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.780]
Tony Dow, Rick Nelson.

[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:06.440]
John Schneider.

[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.280]
Willie Eames.

[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:08.400]
Knight.

[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:09.300]
Straight.

[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.120]
Who's the other one I left out?

[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:12.740]
Well, no.

[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:13.540]
John Stamos.

[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:14.420]
John Stamos.

[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:16.060]
What's wrong with you, John Stamos?

[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.480]
What's right with him?

[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:20.320]
Besides that.

[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:24.580]
I got news for you.

[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:29.940]
If we can have Ronnie Howard and Henry Winkler on there, Ron Howard was a talent.

[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:31.360]
And Henry Winkler?

[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.020]
Eh.

[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.860]
I can tell you.

[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:35.240]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:39.720]
He's got to be on the road because he'll get some votes because there's a certain bunch of

[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:40.700]
people out there that are made.

[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.220]
The a, you know, I think we heard from him in the first hour.

[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:43.640]
Yeah.

[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:45.200]
That's the a-crow.

[01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:46.160]
How about the 18?

[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.280]
How about Mr. T?

[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:48.460]
What do you say?

[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:49.720]
He died.

[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:51.240]
Is he dead?

[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:53.080]
No.

[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:53.920]
Mr. T?

[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:54.960]
Do you make a comeback?

[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:00.600]
Do you see all those spots that he's doing right now for the 1-800-whatever-that-phone thing is?

[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:01.600]
1-800-I have died.

[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:02.360]
He's giving me that.

[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.640]
Yeah, I have seen the funny.

[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:04.460]
Yeah.

[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:06.120]
But what happened?

[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:07.420]
I thought he was dying or something.

[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:08.740]
He got better.

[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.720]
Yeah, I'm-he was just wearing too much gold and it was weighing him down.

[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:13.660]
I suppose that was what it was?

[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:19.520]
560-560-050-560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Time.

[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:22.300]
What do you go over to listing it now that I got a multiple of barbecue trim?

[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:32.460]
Ed Sullivan, Raymond Burr, Bill Bixby, which you wouldn't want to build Bixby on, I wish I think that's-I think George is a communist.

[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:39.600]
Bill Bixby said Caesar, fill down a hue, throw a faucet, Barbara Eden.

[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:44.300]
I still can't believe the guy we called before about Barbara Eden and who is the other one from Jack Lensmith.

[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:48.320]
He must have one eye, you know what?

[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:58.820]
Elizabeth Mamakumri, Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Florence Henderson, David Cassidy, William Conrad,

[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:12.660]
Kelly Sivalis, Jack Parr, Steve Allen, Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke, Jean Raver, Bill Cullen, James Garner, William Shatner, Dick Clark, Jack Lourd,

[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:15.700]
didn't George Harrison make a song about him?

[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:17.600]
Yes, my Jack Lourd.

[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.420]
Got sued.

[01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:27.240]
Bob Barker, Larry Hagman, Regis Filben, Tony Dow, Carol O'Connor, Susan Day.

[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:31.740]
I'm a lot of-you know, Susan Day is not gonna-you know, how many votes is she gonna get?

[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:32.880]
But she's got to be on there.

[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:40.740]
Well, you know, we like-well, Milton Burrell, Caroburnett, Michael Landon, Sherman Hemsley, and in parentheses, George Jefferson,

[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:51.200]
Jerry Seinfeld, Bob Newhart, Bill Cosby, Jay Leno, Ron Howard, Henry Winkler, Lee Major, Andy Griffith, Buddy Epson, Alfred Hitchcock.

[01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.500]
You know who I didn't ask you about? Donnie and Marie.

[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:58.580]
What about-what about him?

[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:00.480]
Neither one of them belongs on the list.

[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:04.040]
For one flash of how about Sunny and Sheriff, you're gonna go that route?

[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:08.520]
What do you mean one flash? Donnie and Marie have had the 80 million different shows on TV for a long time.

[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:10.080]
So it's-well, both of two.

[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:10.780]
Sorry.

[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:11.540]
Two?

[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:16.420]
Their music show and their talk show, both of them were weak and didn't last.

[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:19.480]
Donnie has been making a lot of votes.

[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.640]
There's a lot of us out there, I know.

[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:24.160]
Mm-hmm.

[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:24.720]
Moments.

[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:25.820]
Right.

[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:28.720]
I'm great fact I wrote my bicycle to work this morning.

[01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:29.660]
Do you like my tie?

[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.500]
And your name tag?

[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:32.220]
Mm-hmm.

[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.300]
Stand your helmet.

[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:35.800]
Zacharias.

[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:41.600]
5670560, pound 56 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:43.460]
How about herb-shwiner?

[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:45.920]
Huh?

[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:48.300]
Okay.

[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:49.240]
You know who that is?

[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.020]
Yeah, some guy.

[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.980]
Some Indiana cornpone comedian.

[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:55.740]
Wireless liner?

[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:00.760]
I got it.

[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:03.040]
Hollywood squares, Paul Lind.

[01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:06.880]
Yeah, he gets them votes.

[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:07.980]
He got a copy.

[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:09.140]
He was on the B-wished?

[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:09.620]
Sure.

[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.580]
Crazy uncle.

[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:13.640]
You're right.

[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:14.780]
What else was he on?

[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:14.780]

[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.060]
How about Charles Nelson Rally?

[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:20.400]
No, I don't know.

[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:21.100]
Jack Klugman?

[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:22.440]
How about Tony Randall?

[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:24.480]
And Jack Klugman.

[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:25.240]
Yeah.

[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:26.420]
What did you say?

[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:26.920]
No.

[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.200]
22-1.

[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:30.400]
What?

[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:31.500]
This is the outside of it.

[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.980]
We have taken off, bitten off more than we can chew here, I think, today.

[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:36.940]
Are we finished?

[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:37.820]
No.

[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:39.880]
I'll let him know when we're finished.

[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:42.020]
Okay, tell him just to eat a few more meals and relax.

[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.660]
Okay, this is a heavy duty like I just got to you saying,

[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:45.580]
how you're taking, okay?

[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:47.140]
God.

[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:50.520]
We're going to am in television, then.

[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:53.480]
He's...

[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.340]
Hello, citizens.

[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:56.180]
This is Batman.

[01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:01.460]
You know, even though I'm a fictional character, the Y2K problem is real.

[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:07.520]
In other words, I may be from the comics, but there's nothing funny about Y2K.

[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:10.800]
So, what can you do, Jonathan T.S.

[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:12.740]
That's right.

[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:18.660]
If you have the time right now, run out into the streets and scream your head off like a little girl yelling,

[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:19.740]
why, you okay?

[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:20.400]
Why me?

[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.160]
Who is this kid?

[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.600]
You don't think Batman's coming into your rescue, do you?

[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:26.240]
Ha!

[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:33.120]
I can tell you now, stock up on canned goods, then withdraw all your cash from the back and bury it in the backyard.

[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:37.860]
But be careful if you have a canine friend, then shell your computer.

[01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:40.720]
It'll be about as useful as the best signal in noon.

[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.620]
You might as well get some money out of it now so you can buy a generator and lots of gasoline.

[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:51.660]
But you'll store the gas in the empty plastic milk containers or some unsuspecting moron like Robin,

[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:54.120]
might suck it down, thinking it's right to eat.

[01:55:54.380 --> 01:56:04.620]
Then you gotta get his stomach pumped by rushing to the emergency room and you don't want to do it in costume because people tend to laugh at Batman when he's not on the silver screen fighting crime.

[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:09.360]
And they always please rob them because his outfit is so gay.

[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:11.060]
But I digress.

[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.560]
This is Batman.

[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:17.220]
When it comes to why you okay, go for a Joker.

[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:22.620]
Okay, the reason I played that had nothing with why you two okay.

[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:27.200]
Obviously I had to with the show because I said Bert Ward and George kind of like, hey, like that.

[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:29.120]
Hey, that's no laugh and matter, mister.

[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:31.680]
Anybody has to wear those tights.

[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:36.200]
And there's crime fighting booties and his crime and fighting booties to a court.

[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:39.880]
But Adam West, Bert Ward, what do you say?

[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:40.160]
No.

[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:40.480]
No.

[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:42.540]
A lot of us had a hard place.

[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:44.240]
I mean a soft place for a word.

[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:45.860]
Make no mistake about that.

[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:49.320]
So here's the definitive facts with the answers that says Wild Bill Hickock.

[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:51.480]
Guy Madison is Wild Bill, which I had that right.

[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:53.760]
Andy Devine was his sidekick, Jingles Jones.

[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:57.000]
Over to me, get a request and some more for some Jingles.

[01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:58.640]
Jingles Jones.

[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.800]
And the show with Bill Silver was Sergeant Billco.

[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:04.680]
They ring a bell, Sergeant Billco.

[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:07.800]
Do you ever see that show?

[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:08.140]
No.

[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.500]
George is looking at his wounds because he didn't get any state.

[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.440]
Well, you know, that's your buddy, Gary Sarner.

[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:14.760]
Chief, too, that's all I can tell you.

[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:16.980]
I'm sure that my friends in Ruth Chris would have bought you anything you wanted.

[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:17.320]
Uh-huh.

[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.160]
But not Gary Sarner.

[01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:20.240]
You don't care about you, your small potatoes.

[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:23.320]
Only when he's doing those, you know, $15 appearances that he gets, you know.

[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.180]
Oh, speaking of that, did it Sunday?

[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:26.540]
Where's it next Sunday?

[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:27.460]
This Sunday.

[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:28.880]
Next, this coming Sunday.

[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:31.540]
So you guys, I just happen to see it on a counter because you never tell me.

[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.680]
And then you bitch in the morning.

[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:33.640]
I think you do that for a reason.

[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:34.360]
I don't bitch in the morning.

[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:35.780]
No, because you get paid.

[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:38.300]
Yeah.

[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:39.540]
You have that nobody shows up.

[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:42.740]
Well, if we promoted heavily all week, you get like 20 or 30 people show up.

[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:43.700]
50 or 100 maybe.

[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:45.680]
If Bill Siders, uh, uh, uh, in Davie.

[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:46.120]
Uh-huh.

[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:46.760]
From noon to two.

[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:48.020]
From noon to two this coming Sunday.

[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:49.320]
Would George write a movie over here?

[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:50.400]
Is Miguel gonna be there?

[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:50.940]
Yes.

[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:51.980]
Miguel will be there.

[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:53.940]
He'll let his squeeze it once he tries for the right price.

[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:57.480]
And Miguel, by the way, isn't circumcised.

[01:57:57.700 --> 01:57:59.280]
I mean, he is, uh, he's circumcised.

[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:00.720]
He's very circumspect.

[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:01.960]
Clean cut.

[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:04.760]
That's our pull tomorrow.

[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:06.300]
Is it better to be clean cut or just cut?

[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:09.540]
No, we did to this Sunday.

[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:11.740]
Bill Siders on the University Drive in Davie.

[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:12.980]
So what are you guys gonna be giving away?

[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:14.980]
Uh, good stuff.

[01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:16.080]
No.

[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:18.800]
Crap with our logo on it.

[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:21.620]
It will have some free Q&A crap.

[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:24.360]
Cause we don't have any promotional budget here.

[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:28.780]
All of the good news is Greg just handed out the promotional budget for 2001.

[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:29.480]
Dave Brooks.

[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:30.340]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:31.920]
Up from last year.

[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:34.080]
Yeah, that's a 50% increase from last year.

[01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:34.660]
Let's hear it.

[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:35.540]
Hey, let's go on Greg.

[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.860]
Must be all that CBS infinity money coming in here.

[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.800]
And maybe cause the extra he sold a couple of marlin spots.

[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:43.260]
Am I doing?

[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:43.520]
Do I?

[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:43.900]
Do it?

[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:47.040]
Does it sound like I'm doing a whole show with my, uh, my mouth today?

[01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:47.740]
Uh-huh.

[01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:48.300]
Cause I am.

[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.300]
Hey, I'm not gonna let this.

[01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:53.340]
I mean, I could put in the microwave a little bit later, but it's too good now to go to waste.

[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:55.120]
What a delicious rib ice steak.

[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:56.100]
Not that I want to rub it in.

[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:01.400]
No, if you would have asked, if I would have asked, I wasn't asked to ask.

[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:02.440]
Well, why not?

[01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:05.340]
What is Gary starting with some kind of a moron?

[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:05.560]
Yeah.

[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:06.780]
She's coming out of a quiz later.

[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:08.940]
I don't think he appreciates you very much, Gary.

[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.160]
And this summer when I'm not here, is he gonna be bringing any food?

[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:11.440]
No.

[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:12.640]
Puts.

[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:14.360]
So I don't care.

[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:17.080]
I don't care.

[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:18.840]
But it switches his dishes in the house, you know what I mean?

[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:20.340]
I'll be getting a lot of food.

[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:21.300]
I've lost a lot of food.

[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:21.400]

[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:24.600]
It's not a good place to replace your dishes in the house and he goes to hell because of it.

[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:24.880]
Yes.

[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:27.220]
But it's delicious.

[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:28.060]
So thanks a lot, Gary.

[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:29.540]
And especially thanks to Ruth Chris.

[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:33.400]
Anyway, let's see the fugitive, uh, Richard Jansen.

[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:34.260]
We've had a few people.

[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.300]
Where should I put him on here?

[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.300]
He had Richard Jansen.

[01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:38.040]
There can't be on the list, can he?

[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:40.380]
Richard Jansen from the fugitive.

[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:43.140]
David.

[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:44.700]
How about soupy sales?

[01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:45.200]
David Jansen.

[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:47.040]
Oh, and next, everyone, it says here, Richard Jansen.

[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:47.680]
You see, I got sucked in.

[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:48.300]
David Jansen.

[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:48.680]
I'm sorry.

[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:50.280]
I got sucked in by a fact.

[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:51.740]
Soupy sales.

[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:53.540]
I love soupy sales, but is he gonna be on there?

[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:54.860]
No.

[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.300]
And also says, how about the beaver?

[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:56.840]
I'm sorry.

[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000]
I'm not into beaver, okay?

[01:59:59.440 --> 01:59:59.960]
No, seriously.

[02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:02.240]
Why would a kind of person would vote for the beaver?

[02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:03.880]
Is their favorite TV person of all time?

[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:06.300]
I could see the voting for that as their favorite show, maybe.

[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:07.260]

[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:08.360]
Oh, not because of him.

[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:10.160]
He would at least think about the film.

[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:10.480]

[02:00:11.060 --> 02:00:14.420]
I mean, Gary Madden's, uh, of all the people, even though the show was called,

[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:17.260]
I don't believe it to beaver, of all the people on there, probably the,

[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:20.360]
if you've went in this shopping mall and you got people of the right age,

[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:23.580]
who would know that show, he would be the last one whose name they would know.

[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:27.200]
They'd know Tony Dow, they'd know Barbara Fribili's, they'd know Hugh Beaumont,

[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:28.740]
and the bad, uh, Jerry Madders?

[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:31.500]
They would know Jerry Madders from Marshall Madders.

[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:33.740]
And what, what was special about him? He had Buck Teeth.

[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:36.460]
In fact, have you ever seen Jerry Madders and Marshall Madders together?

[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:36.680]
No.

[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:39.360]
Same first, I think, with a hair dive job, yeah.

[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:42.620]
He had Buck Teeth.

[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.760]
And he was, I would be a little kid, right?

[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:48.960]
So, why would he be their favorite, I mean, Luke Capen, that's another story.

[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:51.680]
How about that?

[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:52.520]
On flipper.

[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:53.840]
I'm not putting Luke Capen on here.

[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:54.520]
How about flipper?

[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:55.680]
They're flipper.

[02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:56.980]
They call him flipper.

[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:00.020]
Yeah, I used to flip it, watch an action.

[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:02.780]
Here's a, that's why they called it flipper.

[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.320]
Here's a mobile informer, Zellab.

[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:05.820]
Hello, Neil.

[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:06.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:11.100]
Ah, guys, maybe turn up, be kind of a TV celebrity that wasn't supposed to be,

[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:12.580]
how about Howard Cosell?

[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:15.480]
Yeah, that's a good one.

[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:16.760]
I love him.

[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:17.880]
Howard Cosell was right.

[02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:20.060]
I think he was supposed to be smaller than what he was covering,

[02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:22.740]
but he, like, he was always trouble-ro.

[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.820]
Yeah, you know, say he does belong under, you're right.

[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.820]
In fact, he made Monday that football.

[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:28.860]
I think he would, any of these other people will try to tell you,

[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:31.440]
he made it what it was, and they'll never duplicate it, you're right.

[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:35.220]
Yeah, and I was surprised that you had William Conrad on there,

[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:36.340]
not Robert Conrad.

[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:39.800]
A couple of secondary ones, or maybe Peter Falk, maybe?

[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:41.280]
Peter Falk.

[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:44.340]
Well, if George hates cops, you know, we have to sneak it on there.

[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:45.400]
Oh, okay.

[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:46.740]
And maybe Linda Evans.

[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:47.620]
I don't know.

[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:48.160]
No.

[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:49.720]
She was like on Big Valley.

[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:50.780]
Well, isn't that other time?

[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:51.620]
Yeah, the old Big Valley.

[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:52.220]
$20, man.

[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:53.360]
Okay, thanks, pal.

[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:54.640]
Do you want any focal ones?

[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:55.960]
Go ahead.

[02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:57.560]
Right, Gumball.

[02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:58.840]
Yeah.

[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:01.020]
You put up around there, down Cornelius?

[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:01.680]
Mm-hmm.

[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:03.200]
That's it.

[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:04.760]
And Cornelius brothers and sister Rose.

[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.300]
Okay, thanks.

[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.040]
Howard Cosell.

[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:09.180]
He belongs on list, even though David Johnson hated them.

[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:10.460]
And still...

[02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:13.060]
Hey, you know something's figured out David Johnson, George.

[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:14.260]
It's not going to be that far away.

[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:17.460]
What's the date, the first look on a calendar?

[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:19.140]
What's the first of Saturday and May go to be?

[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:20.460]
That's the Kentucky Derby's coming up.

[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:25.860]
May, uh, turn, fourth, one, two, three, four, fifth, May five.

[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:28.920]
I believe that's Kentucky Derby Day for Saturday and May.

[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:29.320]
Uh-huh.

[02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:31.880]
Dave Johnson will be calling us because he's doing the Derby on radio.

[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:34.680]
I don't know.

[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:35.880]
He hates Howard Cosell.

[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:37.240]
The guy's been dead for years now.

[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:37.840]
I still hate him.

[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:38.600]
Like poison.

[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:43.860]
But it's not a question of whether you like them, you know, on that basis or not, but, well,

[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:44.620]
I guess it is.

[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:47.120]
Here's a lady in Cooper City.

[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:47.400]
Hello.

[02:02:47.820 --> 02:02:48.420]
Hi, Uncle Neil.

[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:49.020]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:49.500]
How you doing?

[02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:49.900]
Great.

[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:54.860]
Well, I've someone I know who'll never make your list because I think only me and you know who he is.

[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:55.240]
Okay.

[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:57.580]
But I used to just get more self-adaptor McGullen.

[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.220]
I just loved him.

[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.240]
Yeah, Patrick McGullen.

[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.520]
But nobody really knows who he is.

[02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:05.180]
Because he has to show how to call following.

[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:05.840]
That's the problem.

[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:06.080]
Right.

[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:06.840]
That's right, you know.

[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:08.280]
But he just did it for me.

[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:08.960]
He was good.

[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:09.680]
He was great.

[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.500]
And someone more contemporary though who doesn't do it for me but who I like a lot and I know you probably hate it.

[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:15.900]
Got this.

[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:16.780]
He just fell down.

[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:17.540]
And he's on there.

[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:19.260]
I don't hate Regis.

[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:20.880]
I like Regis, but I think he shows sucks.

[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:21.600]
But he's on there.

[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:21.840]
Yeah.

[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:22.540]
But I don't know.

[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:23.280]
Something about him.

[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:24.380]
You know, I like it.

[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:25.400]
He's just enjoyable.

[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:30.280]
You cannot not like, you can't just like a Regis.

[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:31.080]
I like it.

[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:31.960]
Very true.

[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:35.820]
Very true.

[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:40.520]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:45.780]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:45.780]

[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:45.780]

[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:45.780]

[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:45.780]

[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:45.960]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:46.940]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:48.960]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.180]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:52.960]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.340]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:57.760]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:01.840]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:05.800]
I like the fact that he's not like Regis.

[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.840]
No, no, seriously, the people who make it are the ones who keep going.

[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:09.640]
Like Regis.

[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:14.620]
He keeps going and going and going and going.

[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:15.300]
Yeah.

[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:17.660]
He must have eaten the pizza law.

[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:19.920]
He must have eaten the pizza law.

[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:21.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:23.240]
How about your Costello idea favorite TV people?

[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:26.940]
Jerry Mathers.

[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:29.820]
Jerry Mathers.

[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.440]
I'm so sorry I asked.

[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:36.620]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:36.900]
Hello.

[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.900]
Mobile in Miami.

[02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.040]
Going once.

[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:43.000]
Gone.

[02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:45.100]
Here's another mobile in Miami.

[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:45.360]

Yes sir.

[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.000]
No, it's not a mobile.

[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.540]
Here's a stationery in Miami.

[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.000]
Neil.

[02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:51.500]
Fire report from Amsterdam.

[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:52.020]
Uh huh.

[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:53.620]
Dwight Lauderdale.

[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:54.240]
Yeah huh.

[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:54.580]
Great.

5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:58.900]
Palm 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:00.420]
And Verizon wireless lines.

[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:01.960]
So, so sad.

[02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:02.820]
And it's sad.

[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:02.820]

[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:03.260]
Uh huh.

[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:04.980]
Make you want to sit down in this big corner and cry.

[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:08.340]
Here's Pember Pines.

[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:08.580]
Hello.

[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:11.680]
Pember Pines.

[02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:13.100]
What's going on?

[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:13.820]
Are we on a roll now?

[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:14.320]
All of a sudden?

[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:16.160]
Have we had a disconnect with the audience?

[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:17.020]
Here's Miramar.

[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:17.380]
Hello.

[02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:18.160]
Hello.

[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:18.920]
Neil, how are you today?

[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:19.380]
Okay.

[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:20.000]
Good.

[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:20.740]
I've got a couple of them for you.

[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:21.700]
How about dating promise?

[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:22.840]
Ah.

[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:25.400]
Probably worth a thought or two.

[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:27.080]
Uh, Peter Graves.

[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:29.280]
Peter Graves.

[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:30.220]
For mission and power.

[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:30.620]
Yeah, I know.

[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:30.760]

[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.160]
I know.

[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:37.240]
I know.

[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:39.580]
He also did in search of.

[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:42.940]
And Peter Graves is on the ANE on that biorefisher which I love.

[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:43.760]
On the biogeot.

[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:44.680]
Oh, excellent channels.

[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:46.600]
Those are the three best channels.

[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:48.760]
ANE, biography and the history channel.

[02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:49.260]
And discover.

[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:51.100]
And why not discover each other?

[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:53.340]
And a travel channel will always make it people under now.

[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:55.540]
Uh, I don't know.

[02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:56.440]
I didn't watch that one yet.

[02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:57.240]
Trust me.

[02:05:57.340 --> 02:05:58.500]
The learning channel is also good.

[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:02.140]
And the only reason why I got this, the only reason why I got this,

[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:02.140]

[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:02.140]

[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:02.140]

[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:02.140]

[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:02.140]

[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:02.560]
is that the dish.

[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:03.760]
I never watched a learning channel.

[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:04.640]
I've never seen that.

[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.700]
Oh, they got some good stuff on the learning channel.

[02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:07.020]
Do they?

[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:07.940]
We've got good stuff.

[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:09.780]
Already miss Neil, that's all I have to.

[02:06:10.060 --> 02:06:10.280]
Okay.

[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:11.100]
That's all for.

[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:11.520]
Thanks.

[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:19.160]
560-560, 0560 on the AT&T.

[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:22.220]
And Verizon Wireless Lombo, say Peter Graves.

[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:24.420]
Yes or no?

[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:25.580]
Yes, sure.

[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:29.180]
Don't be so enthusiastic about it.

[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:31.180]
I like them.

[02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:34.100]
Don't forget, like I said, because you weren't listening,

[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:35.520]
you were hucking in China, Guizhou Castello,

[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:36.660]
but you got your own lunch.

[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:37.000]
What?

[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:38.340]
I was on the phone, Guizhou.

[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:38.880]
Yeah.

[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:44.120]
But anyway, uh, ANE, he's on a biography show.

[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:44.580]
Yes.

[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:47.780]
But Jack Perkins can't be on the list, you know, he's been on a lot of good shows.

[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:51.140]
What was the, um, well, that was Jack Perkins.

[02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:52.040]
That was the other Perkins.

[02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:53.020]
Marlon Perkins.

[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:53.840]
Marlon Perkins.

[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:54.980]
What about a Marlon Perkins?

[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:55.280]
No.

[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.120]
On you, would you, the Al-Kan of people out there?

[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:00.080]
No, Jack Perkins has been on a lot of things, drugs.

[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.760]
But the fact that he speaks without his teeth on the ANE,

[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:05.600]
biography thing, it puts me off a little bit.

[02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:07.300]
Hey, put your teeth in, Jack, you know.

[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:08.380]
Have you ever noticed that?

[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:10.220]
I don't know that much.

[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:10.400]
I don't know that much.

[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:10.640]

[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:12.260]
Well, it must be the reason.

[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:13.400]
Nobody talks like that.

[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:18.440]
So maybe, uh, from Arlington, I don't want to,

[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:19.520]
I don't want to pick on Dave O'Brien.

[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:20.960]
He's a good, Dave O'Brien's okay.

[02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:22.240]
Howdy overrated.

[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:22.740]
Good guy.

[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:24.020]
Scoot over Joangel Badley.

[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:25.080]
I know.

[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:25.800]
Wasn't his choice.

[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:26.680]
He didn't make the decision.

[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:28.240]
He just put on a big ear, you know.

[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:31.040]
He deserves broadcasting a team that's strong,

[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:31.920]
like six people again.

[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:33.820]
Nice go to our Dave O'Brien, and quit talking

[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:35.420]
through your teeth like Eric Reed, all right?

[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.700]
Hey, it's Shabbat O' Shabbat in the magic city.

[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:38.940]
I can't stand people to do that.

[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:39.860]
Why did they do that?

[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:42.440]
It's their way.

[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:43.620]
Is it their way?

[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:46.120]
I just can't stand people to talk to their teeth.

[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:47.800]
Shabbat team after Shabbat.

[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:50.340]
Like people who talk out of the sides of their mouths.

[02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:52.000]
Oh, yeah, like John and like Jean Critchin.

[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:53.440]
Froggy.

[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:53.920]
I love you.

[02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:56.360]
I'm not Jean Critchin because he said that the bush was a moron.

[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:58.780]
And when John went somewhere, we brought it up.

[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:00.680]
When John brought it up, the frog like him is telling us that

[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:03.100]
it's your W is a moron, and there must be something to it.

[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:05.780]
1256 at 560 WQM.

[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:08.960]
Speaking of the world's famous pizza loft, which I was only moments ago.

[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:11.580]
Well, that's Jeff Cohen.

[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:13.160]
He is really something else.

[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:13.560]
You know what?

[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:15.360]
The secret to success, he's never there.

[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:16.880]
He's out busy.

[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:17.980]
He keeps your busy.

[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:18.620]
Doing stuff.

[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:19.360]
Doing people.

[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:20.440]
Getting laid.

[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:22.320]
Doing all kinds of amazing things.

[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:24.540]
Then he comes in here during lunch and tells me all the wild stories.

[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:28.480]
While the experts out there that he's gotten the kitchen are working their ass off to make you

[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:29.340]
folks their great food.

[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:32.340]
All that delicious and titanium stuff, all your favorite pasta dishes.

[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:35.340]
Three different kinds of great pizza, chicken dishes, beer, egg plant,

[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:38.600]
super-savage, chicken cat pizza, teret calzones, and so much more.

[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.400]
Everything is fresh.

[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:40.800]
Everything is cooked to order.

[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:42.160]
It's never soggy or rubbery.

[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:44.200]
Why are we too loud?

[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:42.840]
I'm so excited.

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:42.840]

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:43.020]
I'm so excited.

[02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:43.260]
I'm so excited.

[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:44.140]
I'm so excited.

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.140]

[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:44.180]
I'm so excited.

[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:56.120]
The parks and what there is in the stars oh yes your close are one framework a lot.

[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:58.460]
What of ClockHi's five sixty before two.

[02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:01.560]
Here's uh a fact that father everybody from Williams Island.

[02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:01.860]
No.

[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:02.260]
No.

[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:03.280]
No thanks.

[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.860]
He'll have to help me on those because Gilligan's island, Hogan's Heroes,

[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:14.140]
Mikhail's Navy, the one with the Pig and Avigabor and

[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:19.640]
Green Acres, and not my stuff, you know, not my bag, just not my thing, you know.

[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:21.620]
I was never into Red Nucky TV.

[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:23.880]
I'm not your Jack Benny.

[02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:25.720]
What about him?

[02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:28.400]
Somebody has him on the thing here, it says Jack Benny.

[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:28.900]
Sure.

[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:31.760]
He belongs on air, absolutely.

[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:32.940]
You betcha.

[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:33.860]
You betcha life.

[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:35.280]
Oh, he's on your stuff.

[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:36.800]
Jack Benny.

[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.920]
Oh, now how about Abbot and Jokostello?

[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:44.320]
I was thinking more like, but Abbot and Lukostello might be on air, but how about Jokostello?

[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:45.380]
That's cute.

[02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:48.440]
Abbot and Kostello?

[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:49.160]
No.

[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:51.280]
Now they were like more famous from the movies, weren't they?

[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:51.660]
That's right.

[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:52.280]
That's right on TV.

[02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:58.760]
Sergeant Bilko has originally titled, you'll never get rich, that's correct with fill solvers.

[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:05.520]
The writings there for your show of shows was Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gilbart, Neil Simon, Woody Allen, and Mel Tolkien.

[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:06.200]
How do you like that?

[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:08.820]
What a bunch of Jews, huh?

[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:10.940]
Oh, I found one of the crew that was.

[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:17.320]
567-0560, pound 560 on a 18T and for Ryan's and wireless line.

[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.040]
I don't think we're going to need to do this three days.

[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:20.480]
I think we've got to lick today, don't you?

[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.720]
Yeah, I do.

[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:25.720]
I mean, how many more can there be?

[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:27.800]
Well, we're not talking about underlings.

[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.540]
We're not talking about little secondary.

[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:35.240]
We're talking about the, and the thing that just amazes me is that all, I'm looking at anybody on this was,

[02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:38.640]
who's like the most recent one, I guess it'd be Seinfeld, right?

[02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:42.040]
Yeah, you have all the friends.

[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:44.920]
We're not going to put them all on there.

[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:45.780]
Friends?

[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:47.740]
Yeah, it's big.

[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:52.900]
No, I know the show is big, but who, I mean, show is, who individually would be considered big?

[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:55.520]
David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, the people that win the awards, I guess.

[02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:58.220]
A lot of people would say Courtney Cox, why, hey, you're a fool.

[02:11:58.640 --> 02:11:58.920]
No, no.

[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:00.740]
No.

[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:03.700]
In a category with these people?

[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:05.080]
No.

[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:07.760]
So this thing is very revealing, just like the music thing was.

[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:10.960]
Not that we want you young people to feel bad about yourselves unless you want to, of course.

[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:15.880]
But the fact is that contemporary stuff, music, TV, movies, most of it, the blows.

[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:17.440]
Most of it blows.

[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:18.460]
It bites.

[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:19.240]
It sucks.

[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.500]
So anybody seen the Schindler's list?

[02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:25.340]
Here's Volka.

[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:25.620]
Hello.

[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:27.720]
Groucho Mark.

[02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:28.640]
He's on there.

[02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:30.280]
Mother's brother.

[02:12:30.780 --> 02:12:31.420]
Not on there.

[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:33.220]
The iron chef.

[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:34.260]
Okay.

[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:35.580]
Put away your head.

[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:37.480]
It's so hard, man.

[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:39.300]
No.

[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:41.080]
It was all over the shows.

[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.080]
I mean, I love Phil Hartman.

[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:43.860]
Don't get me wrong.

[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:44.660]
Okay, Phil Hartman.

[02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:46.660]
Sorry.

[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:47.940]
How's he doing?

[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:49.220]
Oh, sorry.

[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:50.160]
Really, sorry.

[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:52.920]
How about David Hartman?

[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.260]
Mary Hartman?

[02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:57.480]
Mary Hartman.

[02:12:58.940 --> 02:13:00.680]
How about Alistair Cook?

[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:02.000]
Remember him from Onle of Us?

[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:02.540]
No.

[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:03.980]
Of course you know.

[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:05.640]
How about Ben Grower?

[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:06.400]
Who?

[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:08.720]
Oh, Volka Bryant's squeezing himself now.

[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:10.000]
How about Alistair Crowley?

[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:12.940]
How about Morten Crowley?

[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:17.840]
Morten Stakehouse?

[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:21.160]
Terry Dierfield.

[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:21.440]
Hello.

[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:24.200]
Yeah, I'm surprised nobody's mentioned Rob Serling.

[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:25.060]
They did.

[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:27.440]
Oh, well, I guess I missed that point.

[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:31.880]
Well, he wasn't really, I mean, he, you know, he hosted the show and he narrated the opening,

[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.120]
but he wasn't really, you know, a lot of us.

[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:35.500]
Yeah.

[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:37.580]
But we're not asking about famous writers.

[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:38.820]
We're asking about...

[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:45.500]
Yeah, the other thing that you were talking about earlier, I don't know if anybody, I know that somebody said that Andy Divine was on Wild Bill.

[02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:45.900]
Oh, Hillcock.

[02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:46.180]
Right.

[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:48.960]
The character of the play was named Jingles.

[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:50.080]
Yeah, that was on the facts.

[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:50.600]
Yeah.

[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:51.060]
Uh-huh.

[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:58.220]
And if you're talking about characters on shows, probably the best one that I can remember was the Revive and Jim on Taxi.

[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:00.280]
Christopher Lloyd.

[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:01.400]
Yeah.

[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:04.520]
Okay.

[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:05.280]
That's all I got.

[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:05.700]
Thanks.

[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:08.560]
You think we ought to have Christopher Lloyd on the list?

[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:08.840]
No.

[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:11.500]
560, 7.0560, 0.560.

[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:15.660]
Hey, I'll put a bird ward on there before Christopher Lloyd any day.

[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:16.780]
Hands down.

[02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:18.900]
Those, uh,

[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:19.880]
pipes.

[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:23.220]
Here's a mobile in the propano.

[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:23.540]
Hello.

[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:24.620]
Hey, Neil.

[02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:25.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:26.700]
I got a handful for you.

[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:27.160]
I've been.

[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:30.260]
How about, uh, you know, how about Larry Agnes?

[02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:30.880]
He's out.

[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:31.220]
He's out.

[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:31.360]
He's on there.

[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:33.240]
How about Tom Selik?

[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:35.040]
Tom Selik.

[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:35.500]

[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.120]
Oh, I'll see you.

[02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:37.480]
I'll see you.

[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:39.080]
No, I don't think so.

[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:40.980]
How about Alan Alder from Mash?

[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:43.020]
What do you think, George?

[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:44.780]
Somebody else mentioned Alan Alder.

[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:45.320]
People along Zonner.

[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:46.280]
People along Zonner, you're right.

[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:47.940]
How about John Johnson?

[02:14:48.660 --> 02:14:49.340]
Don Johnson?

[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:51.380]
My amy butt.

[02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:52.340]
Yeah.

[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:53.200]
Hope you're.

[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:54.140]
I don't think so.

[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:56.160]
How about Fred Savage from the one you used?

[02:14:57.060 --> 02:14:57.500]
Okay.

[02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:58.160]
Put it right here.

[02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:01.380]
560, 7.0560.

[02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:04.300]
Wow.

[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:04.960]
Yeah.

[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:07.140]
How about that muniz kid from, uh,

[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:08.940]
how about Tinney from Passons?

[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:09.600]
I still say,

[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:10.420]
what's the name of the song that he belongs on here?

[02:15:11.860 --> 02:15:14.460]
It's the best TV going now next to the guiding light.

[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:17.460]
560, 7.0560.

[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:18.520]
We're getting close to the end.

[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:19.720]
We almost have this list compiled.

[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:20.680]
We're just hanging on tight.

[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:21.000]
Okay.

[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:24.080]
Hang on to your big industrial size box of Cheerios.

[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.300]
Very tightly and relaxed.

[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.300]
Oh, don't let me forget to bring in that book that

[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:29.120]
that Akins book to arm.

[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:30.280]
We're going to read that stuff on here.

[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.140]
It's going to make a lot of...

[02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:32.660]
If you have a week's stomach, I mean, it's not...

[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:33.760]
There's nothing gross in there.

[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:36.880]
But it's just something that when you hear it,

[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.760]
when you hear the words,

[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:38.860]
when you read them in print,

[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:40.500]
when I put them on the ear, people will say,

[02:15:40.540 --> 02:15:42.220]
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:43.940]
Better stop trying my insides.

[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:47.340]
Cheers Hollywood, hello.

[02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:48.560]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:48.840]
Great.

[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:51.560]
I get stuck in Lansing with...

[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.700]
How about Jizelle McKenzie?

[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:53.140]
Yeah.

[02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:54.420]
How about us, Russell Arms?

[02:15:54.660 --> 02:15:55.420]
You know, a...

[02:15:55.420 --> 02:15:56.140]
How about Dorothy Collins?

[02:15:56.860 --> 02:15:58.860]
A real, a real trans center in...

[02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:02.860]
and probably had more spin-offs than anybody in television.

[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:03.200]
Yeah.

[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:04.340]
Which judge Watner.

[02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:05.680]
Uh-huh.

[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:07.940]
Yeah, but we're not asking the rainman.

[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:09.960]
He's not voting on our pool.

[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:11.640]
Yeah.

[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:12.620]
He's good with Judge Watner.

[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:13.800]
Everybody watched him.

[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:15.220]
Yeah, and now we got...

[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:17.860]
And now we got 75, uh, uh, a judge shows him.

[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:18.700]
Do you remember...

[02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:20.020]
Yes, when I made him more spin-offs?

[02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:23.680]
Do you remember a court show before Judge Watner

[02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:27.360]
and the court attended was...

[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:29.140]
Uh, Jim McKenzie.

[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:29.760]
Jim McKenzie.

[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:30.620]
Yeah, you know, that...

[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:31.980]
That goes back 40 years.

[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:32.420]
Yeah.

[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:34.660]
Sure, he used to sit out in the hallway outside of the pool.

[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:35.780]
And he was at the counterpoint.

[02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:37.120]
And he was always a breffless.

[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:38.920]
He was talking in a low-yeah, a breffless, yeah.

[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:39.500]
Jim McKenzie.

[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:39.700]
Right.

[02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:40.400]
I imagine that.

[02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:41.880]
All right, no thanks.

[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:42.320]
Thanks.

[02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:45.780]
This is a pretty interesting...

[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:48.780]
Pretty damn provocative.

[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:51.340]
Is that provocative?

[02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:51.720]
No.

[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:52.700]
Exciting?

[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:53.080]
No.

[02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:53.640]
Stimulating?

[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:54.180]
Okay.

[02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:59.460]
5607-0560, 0.560 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:00.440]
George is really upset.

[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:01.840]
And he can no stake today for lunch.

[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.320]
And it's all Gary Cernersfall.

[02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:06.500]
Yeah.

[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:07.380]
Yeah?

[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:09.120]
Well, I'm just sticking out for it.

[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:09.420]
It is that...

[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:09.720]
Thank you.

[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:11.600]
That's being a real prick to be like that.

[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:12.900]
It goes back 30 years ago.

[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:14.980]
Like, you're supposed to sit in there watching me eat.

[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:19.000]
I mean, in the IOD days, I don't understand that I'm a schlepper and a mountain.

[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:20.420]
They're a part of the show now.

[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:22.780]
You even do the show for like, you know, head...

[02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:26.400]
But even the gendered homeless people wouldn't want to sit and watch somebody else eat his cake.

[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:26.480]
Right.

[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:28.260]
I'm a captive audience, exactly.

[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.940]
Then it's so good that I'm certainly am I going to share it with you?

[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:31.240]
No.

[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:31.940]
Too good for that.

[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:34.380]
Watching your eyes roll into your head and the whole tummy.

[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:35.220]
They are delicious.

[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:38.320]
I'm not sure whether I enjoy that better or thinking about Adam Ward.

[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:39.060]
I mean, Berwer.

[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:39.940]
Adam, West.

[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:43.120]
See, that's how good it is.

[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:45.320]
I'm giving a little of my brain is scrambled.

[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:47.940]
At least my blood sugar is not going up as in your...

[02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:48.040]
No.

[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:48.320]

[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:51.600]
Robert, you're triumphant and delicious ribon, medium well from earth, Chris.

[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:52.920]
Mm-hmm.

[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:55.640]
Hey, here's something else that's really great.

[02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:57.140]
And that's Reggie and Mobile AC charging.

[02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:58.280]
This guy is great.

[02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.700]
He's not just good.

[02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:00.280]
He's great.

[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:02.700]
Which is shocking because this is Peter Leonard's account.

[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.100]
Does that shock you?

[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:07.460]
Yeah, little.

[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:08.060]
Yeah.

[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:09.200]
You know Peter Leonard.

[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:11.180]
Oh, yeah, that's the one.

[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:14.200]
But Reggie and Mobile AC is a magician.

[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:15.360]
And this is one of the...

[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:20.420]
You know, for years I've wondered why do you have to keep wasting your time going out and sitting in an office somewhere,

[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:24.320]
reading a 20-year-old magazine while they dittle around changing your world,

[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:25.820]
doing the other minor repairs on your car.

[02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:27.680]
Why can't somebody come to you and do it?

[02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:29.240]
And now Reggie and Mobile AC does.

[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:32.500]
Whether you need a quick shot of free-out and make sure that your AC is working the way it should,

[02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:34.420]
or any minor motor vehicle repair.

[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:36.500]
They changed your oil in Georgia's car last week.

[02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:38.140]
That's the one that's still around, right?

[02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:40.160]
Yeah, that's not what we don't want to talk about that.

[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:44.280]
And both of my cars, both of my beautiful co-writes, and what a great job they do.

[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:45.880]
That's right.

[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:49.340]
I'll do a complete, Lou Boil and Filter change for just 35 bucks.

[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.380]
I don't know what I'm told or true.

[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:03.520]
Playboy pages are all just like Lou.

[02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:10.000]
My pants with the iron are through the making of floor.

[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:15.820]
I'm too old to outside no more.

[02:19:18.180 --> 02:19:23.720]
My suit is gone, get out on the stage,

[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:32.660]
so I see this old, just faster than you really told.

[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.860]
For that line I see this,

[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:38.680]
so I see this in my mood,

[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:41.460]
playing with myself again.

[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:47.440]
That's why I can't go through the course again.

[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:51.000]
So I sit at home,

[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:52.720]
playing with myself.

[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:55.440]
I'm 13, at 560 W.

[02:19:55.540 --> 02:19:56.680]
This will make you feel even worse.

[02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:58.340]
I put the rest of my meat in the microwave,

[02:19:58.820 --> 02:20:00.180]
and nuke it for about half a minute.

[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:03.080]
And evidently this has got the butter in it.

[02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:06.220]
Sometimes I tell them to hold the butter because it makes me every now and then.

[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:08.780]
But they brought the steaks in butter with Chris.

[02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.780]
And the butter all I came out again there,

[02:20:10.860 --> 02:20:12.420]
it's like real juicy, now and delicious,

[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:13.540]
and just melts in your mouth.

[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:14.700]
Not that I want you to feel bad.

[02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:15.060]
Oh no.

[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:16.860]
But you know what this reminds me of?

[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:17.860]
It would be like, if you're a starter,

[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:19.540]
invited you to dinner with your wife.

[02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:25.260]
And he brought you, you know, a meal of steak

[02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:27.880]
and whatever, and the side dishes and some soup or any

[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:29.140]
brought your wife like a little salad.

[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:30.320]
Right.

[02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:32.900]
What I got were the sides that you didn't want.

[02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:34.200]
You understand? That's what I got.

[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:36.360]
No, no, I had the barbecue trip.

[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:37.060]
I had my own.

[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:38.200]
But he brought like extras.

[02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:40.600]
Well, I assume I got like a salad.

[02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:42.960]
I'm sorry, I wasn't really even intended for you.

[02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:43.620]
It's like, right?

[02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:44.980]
It's like, oh, he won't want this,

[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:46.160]
so let's give this to the other guy.

[02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:47.780]
So I guess we're not going to be going to his house

[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:48.720]
any time soon, are we?

[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:48.960]
No.

[02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:49.260]
No.

[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:51.040]
Gary Freak and Sarner.

[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:52.400]
Scum bag.

[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on him.

[02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:57.800]
But by the way, the lunch is delicious.

[02:20:57.940 --> 02:20:59.280]
I like your restaurant myself though.

[02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:00.560]
I'm only speaking for you when I say,

[02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:01.020]
succumb back.

[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:03.440]
Because this lunch is sensational.

[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:05.820]
You're not scum nothing to do with him.

[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:06.900]
It just has to do with the recruits,

[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:07.420]
because they're great.

[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:08.060]
Mmm.

[02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:10.700]
I'm sure it's like when you put a look at it.

[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:11.720]
Mmm.

[02:21:11.980 --> 02:21:14.700]
It gets all juicy and butter in there

[02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:16.760]
like starts dripping in there again.

[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:18.420]
Nice and pink.

[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:19.240]
Mmm.

[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:20.540]
And a steak too.

[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:23.800]
Here's Miami.

[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:24.140]
Hello.

[02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:25.320]
Meal God.

[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:26.000]
How you doing?

[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:26.360]
Great.

[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:28.840]
I can't believe nobody has mentioned this.

[02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:30.400]
Crueco Fran and Ollie.

[02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:32.040]
Yeah, now which one?

[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:33.000]
Ah.

[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:34.080]
Neither one.

[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:35.420]
Yeah, how about Fran Allison?

[02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:36.020]
She's dead.

[02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:39.440]
Where about the guy from neutral Omaha's Wild Chewie?

[02:21:39.580 --> 02:21:41.020]
Yeah, we mentioned him too, Marlon Perkins.

[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:42.180]
Are you mentioning him too?

[02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:43.000]
You haven't listed him.

[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:44.660]
Is he dead?

[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:46.060]
Yeah, he is dead.

[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:46.740]
And so is the guy.

[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:46.740]

[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:46.740]

[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:46.740]

[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:46.740]

[02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:49.600]
He's the guy who used to do all the dirty work

[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:51.320]
and test the alligator and stuff like that.

[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:53.520]
And Ben Bertelstrom, who was the puppeteer

[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:55.660]
from McCookle Fran and Ollie, he's also dead.

[02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:56.300]
He's also dead.

[02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:57.100]
Yeah, he died too.

[02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:59.060]
Where about big whips in if you want to go local?

[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:00.080]
He died.

[02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:00.820]
Okay, thanks.

[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:04.440]
If we started doing local, we'd have to have all the dead people.

[02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:06.100]
Big Wilson and Dave...

[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:07.880]
What was his name?

[02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:09.020]
I went to the two, Dave Dixon.

[02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:12.600]
Boy, for just a second there, I thought the Alzheimer's was kicking in.

[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:13.460]
Dave Dixon.

[02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:17.940]
Boy, that is sure some state, everybody.

[02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:19.220]
Just melts in your mouth.

[02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:20.940]
Oh, don't feel bad about Georgia's on a foin nightmare.

[02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:22.060]
I'll say real low.

[02:22:23.100 --> 02:22:24.280]
I wasn't saying anything.

[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:26.840]
Here is the sunrise.

[02:22:27.020 --> 02:22:27.160]
Hello.

[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:29.500]
Hi, Glenn. How are you, Neil?

[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:31.080]
Neil?

[02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:31.740]
Is this Glenn?

[02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:33.080]
Glenn, can you hear me?

[02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:34.460]
I thought you were calling for Glenn, yes.

[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:35.880]
Yeah, 50 air, right?

[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:36.880]
All right.

[02:22:36.980 --> 02:22:38.480]
I think without the butter, by the way,

[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:39.340]
you're all the time.

[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:40.720]
I think you'll put it without it.

[02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:43.320]
I do order it without the butter, but you know,

[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:43.440]
this is what I'm saying.

[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:45.160]
I think it's the first time they brought it with the butter and it's even better.

[02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:47.500]
It's more of pure comedy.

[02:22:47.780 --> 02:22:49.960]
Think back to number one rated show.

[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:53.620]
In its time, all for years was called Back Girl.

[02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:54.840]
I believe with Marlon...

[02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:55.720]
Marlon Thomas, yeah.

[02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:57.540]
You know, it's pretty funny.

[02:22:57.860 --> 02:22:59.740]
And I think her father was on the show too.

[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:00.660]
Danny Thomas.

[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:01.340]
Right.

[02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:02.620]
Just a suggestion.

[02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:03.520]
Okay.

[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:04.700]
Thanks.

[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:05.140]
Thanks.

[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:08.100]
Yeah, Danny Thomas probably ought to be on the list, but he won't get any votes.

[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:09.540]
Marlon will get any votes.

[02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:11.100]
Because Phil Donnie, he was pissed off at her.

[02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:12.500]
Or is it the other way around he votes?

[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:13.600]
Oh, by the way, thanks again.

[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:15.440]
All your Ralph Nader people for screwing us up.

[02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:17.440]
Now we got this environmental terrorist in there.

[02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:21.820]
Isn't that exactly what I said before the election?

[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:25.300]
When the Nader people were saying there wasn't a dime's worth of difference,

[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:27.460]
and he's supposed to be the big environmentalist, Ralph Nader.

[02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:31.560]
He's just an egotistical pompous, old, self-serving fool is what he is.

[02:23:32.980 --> 02:23:34.920]
And you people are wasting your votes on Ralph Nader.

[02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:35.600]
I don't want to get...

[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:36.820]
Yeah, I don't want to get going on it again.

[02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:37.340]
What's the point?

[02:23:39.260 --> 02:23:43.120]
Let's see, Michael Landon for his whole bananza and little house on the periphery thing.

[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:44.260]
Michael Landon's on the list.

[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:47.480]
Melissa Gilbert will one with the teeth.

[02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:48.160]
Melissa Gilbert?

[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:50.200]
I put Gilbert on there for...

[02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:51.900]
Michael Z. Fox, what about it?

[02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:53.660]
I can't be...

[02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:54.600]
Because I can't win at him.

[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:56.900]
Yeah, I love the Parkinson's factor.

[02:23:57.240 --> 02:23:59.580]
Yeah, that'll make Tom Jicca happy like him.

[02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:01.020]
I think he's got a thing for Michael Z. Fox.

[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:01.920]
Because he's...

[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:02.280]
You know, short.

[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:03.640]
He likes short people except you.

[02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:05.500]
Oh, I think he's for people.

[02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:05.900]
What is for people?

[02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:06.300]
Huh?

[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:07.800]
He is for what I'm saying.

[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:11.140]
And the golden girl squad, especially the one with the man's voice.

[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:13.760]
Yeah, I ruined my tiny hand, rhymes with man.

[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:16.620]
How about the Betty White?

[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:17.460]
Betty White and the List?

[02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:17.720]
No.

[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:18.280]
Alan Newton?

[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:18.600]
No.

[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:19.840]
Did we put Alan Love Nader?

[02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:22.000]
No.

[02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:25.080]
Did we once do a thing with Game Show host?

[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:26.620]
Did we do that or not?

[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:29.240]
We talked about it.

[02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:29.980]
I don't think we ever did the whole thing.

[02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:30.580]
We already did the whole.

[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:34.240]
We'll save him for the day that we do the Game Show host.

[02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:38.140]
We'll let Bill Cabrant come in and supervise that to make sure we don't leave anybody on.

[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:39.600]
And they're all dead.

[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:41.380]
No, amazing.

[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:46.240]
All you young people out there don't aspire to be a Game Show host, especially now that the genre is coming back to TV,

[02:24:46.380 --> 02:24:50.140]
thanks to Regis, don't aspire to be a Game Show host, because they all die very young.

[02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:51.860]
Alan Newton.

[02:24:52.620 --> 02:24:53.140]
Bill Colbert.

[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:53.640]
Bob Barker.

[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:54.460]
Bill Cohen.

[02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:56.500]
Bob Barker, 28.

[02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:58.980]
Um, Bert Convey.

[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:01.060]
Right?

[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:02.340]
And Dick Clark.

[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:04.680]
Dick Clark's 36.

[02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:08.620]
Um, what's the guy that killed himself on a family feud?

[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.720]
The little strug.

[02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:11.500]
Grimes?

[02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:12.000]
Wait, no.

[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:12.600]
Gary Grimes.

[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:12.840]
Yeah.

[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:14.320]
Now what was his name?

[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:17.460]
The little little strippy guy that replaced Richard Dawson.

[02:25:18.140 --> 02:25:18.760]
Lewis Brains out.

[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:19.640]
He was good too.

[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:20.160]
I liked him.

[02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:23.420]
And then...

[02:25:23.420 --> 02:25:24.220]
Oh, he don't.

[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:24.700]
I'll do it.

[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:26.480]
What's his name?

[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:27.880]
A draw blank.

[02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:28.660]
That's bad.

[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:32.680]
Gene Rayburn, speaking of a Gina's blank, he's dead.

[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:34.440]
A lot of dead Game Show hosts.

[02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:35.820]
Jack Barry, he's dead.

[02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:37.820]
He won't be fixing any more TV shows.

[02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:41.260]
I bet you that sunny Foxes did too.

[02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:44.600]
Not the one on the radio, but the sunny Fox from the $64,000 challenge.

[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:46.000]
Yeah, we're supposed to find out.

[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:48.280]
Somebody called and said that Cox wasn't on this morning.

[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:52.040]
Which is?

[02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:53.960]
He wasn't on the kids.

[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:56.040]
So we need to find out what's up with that.

[02:25:56.900 --> 02:25:57.260]
Party.

[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:00.320]
Yeah.

[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:02.060]
Ray Combs, by the way.

[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.060]
Oh, Ray Combs, thank you.

[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:08.240]
Ray Combs was the one from Family Feud in between Richard Dawson's.

[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:12.360]
And his baddest Richard Dawson was when they tried to bring him back when he weighed 600 pounds away.

[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:13.700]
That's literally very sad.

[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:15.900]
He was like a parody of himself and a joke.

[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:18.920]
This other guy, whose name I can never think of, and that's what we're interested in.

[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:19.380]
Louis Anderson.

[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:21.320]
Are they kidding with that?

[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:22.200]
Have you seen it?

[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:24.180]
Yeah, he's not good on the show.

[02:26:24.180 --> 02:26:25.180]
He does good stand up.

[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:26.980]
I'm going to show you.

[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:28.060]
It's embarrassing.

[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:29.620]
It's an embarrassment.

[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:32.840]
It's like they're real for serious with this.

[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:37.120]
And it's one of those things where he's so bad I can't turn it off.

[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:41.340]
Again, I love to watch when he does that motion with his hand when they look up to see if the answer is on it.

[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:43.500]
And okay, show me a dish bag.

[02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:44.260]
Show me a dish bag.

[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:48.140]
And he makes that little wave with his hand which he can barely move because he weighs 4200 pounds.

[02:26:49.340 --> 02:26:50.020]
Louis Anderson.

[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:51.680]
Let's put him on list.

[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:52.080]
What do you say?

[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:52.320]
No.

[02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:54.860]
Here's Halondale.

[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:55.120]
Hello.

[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:56.800]
Hello, and how you doing?

[02:26:57.020 --> 02:26:57.260]
All right.

[02:26:57.380 --> 02:26:59.560]
Okay, listen, I think they have a whole bunch for you here.

[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:00.320]
A whole bunch.

[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:00.680]
Why?

[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:01.680]
Well, let's see.

[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:02.460]
George Maharis?

[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:04.440]
George Maharis.

[02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:04.960]
Wow.

[02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:06.320]
You need to hear how that one.

[02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:07.520]
That really goes back.

[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:09.460]
He had for instance, a junior in 77.

[02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:11.280]
That's when Zimbola is junior.

[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:13.320]
How about James Gardner and Matt Rick?

[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:14.760]
James Gardner's on the list.

[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:15.760]
How about Richard Boone?

[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:18.080]
Richard Boone.

[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:19.120]
Richard Boone.

[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:19.240]
Richard Boone.

[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:19.440]

[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:19.960]
Richard Boone belongs on the list.

[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:20.840]
He was on a lot of different things.

[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:21.340]
He was on medic.

[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:22.000]
Remember medic?

[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:23.720]
Richard Boone.

[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:24.240]
Richard Boone, you got it.

[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:25.080]
How about two Walker?

[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:25.800]
Who?

[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:27.160]
Two Walker, Cheyenne.

[02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:28.000]
Two Walker?

[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:28.560]
Yes.

[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:29.880]
You remember Cheyenne?

[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:31.000]
Are you doing cowboy sedator?

[02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:31.960]
I know Cheyenne.

[02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:33.160]
The singer, but I don't know Cheyenne.

[02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:34.360]
Same with the guy.

[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:35.280]
Cheyenne.

[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:36.520]
Good captain.

[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:37.580]
Good captain.

[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:38.200]

[02:27:38.460 --> 02:27:38.680]
Yeah.

[02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:41.620]
If we put him on there, we'd have to put John Revolta on there.

[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:42.740]
No, my Lord, I start talking.

[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:44.080]
How about a fiscal kid?

[02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:44.900]
Cisco kid.

[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:45.660]
What's that was his name?

[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:46.220]
Leo.

[02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:47.260]
I don't know what to read.

[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:47.960]
Leo Carrillo.

[02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:48.600]
Leo Carrillo.

[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:49.240]
Yeah, Leo.

[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:49.640]
Uh-huh.

[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:50.420]
That's what I had.

[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:51.560]
Okay, thank you.

[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:52.860]
How you love you?

[02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:53.580]
I get a day.

[02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:54.160]
Okay.

[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:55.680]
That's probably why.

[02:27:57.460 --> 02:27:57.860]
5670560.

[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:00.720]
Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:03.240]
Well, the Cisco kid and I used to sleep on his poncho.

[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:04.440]
That's what I hear.

[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:08.400]
5670560.

[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:11.640]
Pound 560 on his AT&T.

[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:13.180]
Did you ever see the Cisco kid?

[02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:13.580]
No.

[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:14.460]
Oh, Cisco, Cisco.

[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:16.540]
It's on the right-hand side.

[02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:17.300]
Chuck Connors.

[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:21.680]
Now, do you think that the loan ranger and tons are something separate tense?

[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:24.740]
Here's a mobile invoker.

[02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:25.020]
Hello.

[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:26.620]
Hey, Neil.

[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:27.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:27.480 --> 02:28:28.700]
You are, uh...

[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:29.280]
Yes, I am.

[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:30.380]
Ha, ha, bless it.

[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:34.480]
Did anybody mention Craig Stevens and Peter Gunn?

[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:34.880]
No.

[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:36.440]
That was good.

[02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:37.220]
That was okay.

[02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:38.660]
Didn't like that, hello.

[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:39.520]
That was, that was your...

[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:40.560]
No, I mean, it was okay.

[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:41.760]
I really didn't like it.

[02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:42.680]
Oh, okay.

[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:44.080]
Well, I figured I'd give it a try.

[02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:44.660]
Okay, thanks.

[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:45.360]
You bet.

[02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:47.280]
That was all right.

[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:49.080]
I think about about two and a half on a scale of ten.

[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:51.520]
It wasn't one of your better cop shows.

[02:28:51.700 --> 02:28:54.540]
And of course, George hates cop shows like poison because of that for whatever reason.

[02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:55.620]
He's got a fetishy cause.

[02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:56.600]
Because why?

[02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:57.800]
Do they get their guy?

[02:28:58.120 --> 02:28:59.240]
And please don't start telling me about it.

[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:00.380]
It's not realistic that they will.

[02:29:00.660 --> 02:29:00.780]
No, no.

[02:29:01.020 --> 02:29:01.900]
Nothing on TV is realistic.

[02:29:02.140 --> 02:29:03.620]
Do they catch the criminal at the end?

[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:04.320]
All of them.

[02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:04.980]
Every episode.

[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:05.440]
Yeah.

[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:05.800]
Yes.

[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:07.100]
But, Ray, what's the point?

[02:29:07.180 --> 02:29:08.560]
Even the Prerimation lost one case.

[02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:09.340]
I know it's not a cop.

[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:10.140]
Well, it's a lawyer's show.

[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:10.920]
I know what he liked Prerimation.

[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:13.200]
Prerimation was fine.

[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:14.680]
But not iron sides.

[02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:15.500]
No.

[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.440]
So, now somebody has to cry.

[02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:18.400]
It was what you read in the message.

[02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:19.620]
Ray is that you don't like Gims.

[02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:20.740]
They're all in other ways.

[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:22.520]
You were walking around on his own two legs.

[02:29:22.660 --> 02:29:23.000]
He was okay.

[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:25.640]
But as soon as they stuck his ass in the chair, they needed to like Raymond Burr.

[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:26.220]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:27.720]
I don't like cookie cutters.

[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:30.240]
The same thing happens every single episode shows.

[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:31.100]
He died?

[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:32.120]
Yeah, Raymond Burr died.

[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:33.340]
He went to Hawaii and he died.

[02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:34.900]
Jack Lauren, he went to Hawaii.

[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:35.500]
He died.

[02:29:36.860 --> 02:29:37.880]
No, I did like to rock your file.

[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:40.660]
Speaking of that, on the travel channel, forget about the rock your files.

[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:44.160]
On the travel channel, the top beaches in Hawaii.

[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:44.660]
I'm telling you, Ray, I'm going to go to the beach.

[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:51.160]
And every night they come up with some new way to show almost naked young people on the beach.

[02:29:51.340 --> 02:29:53.380]
And off the beach and son of a beach.

[02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:54.360]
I mean, just amazing.

[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:55.140]
Yeah.

[02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:55.860]
We like that.

[02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:57.580]
The travel channel.

[02:29:57.760 --> 02:29:59.040]
Trust me when I tell you.

[02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:05.500]
So, the beach says, all his favorite TV personalities can both camera.

[02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:06.900]
We do the sports on channel four.

[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:07.680]
That's what he said.

[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:12.460]
He always tried to suck up for those terrible things he said about him two weeks ago.

[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.600]
There was that one you were on vacation that he said this.

[02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:16.560]
Apparently, I don't know.

[02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:17.120]
Oh, man.

[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:19.680]
He was read in a post like you sometimes get.

[02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:23.640]
And then Kim came into building was like storming around all pissed off and been out of shape.

[02:30:25.480 --> 02:30:26.300]
I'd be afraid of that.

[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:26.840]
Yeah.

[02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:30.580]
He said he looks down on the beach now.

[02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:33.440]
Of course, that's not unusual because Kim is about 18 feet tall on the beach.

[02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:34.340]
About three inches tall.

[02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:35.940]
Yeah.

[02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:38.560]
He said that Kim sucked on the air or something like that.

[02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:40.760]
You know, he said he was a nice guy, but he sucked on the air.

[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:42.640]
It wasn't that what you said.

[02:30:42.820 --> 02:30:43.460]
What did you say?

[02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:44.280]
I don't want to miss quote you.

[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:45.000]
What did you say?

[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:48.980]
You said his air work is an embarrassing, humiliating, uh, something like that.

[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.180]
He said he makes it.

[02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:52.340]
Joe Zagaki looked like Mr. Personality.

[02:30:52.680 --> 02:30:53.740]
He said it was all about dream.

[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:54.320]
Yeah.

[02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:55.380]
He loves Kim Bo camper.

[02:30:55.580 --> 02:30:57.400]
I don't think that ever really happened.

[02:30:57.540 --> 02:30:58.060]
Did it really happen?

[02:30:58.160 --> 02:30:58.280]
No.

[02:30:58.400 --> 02:30:59.920]
No, I just dreamed it.

[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:00.500]
He said it.

[02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:00.700]
Kim.

[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:05.540]
560, 7.050, 560 on the AT&T ever.

[02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:08.860]
I'm telling him in such a good mood because I got that TV joke hostelokin.

[02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:09.900]
And he said, what's the newspaper?

[02:31:10.380 --> 02:31:11.400]
He's over the TV screen.

[02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:16.500]
I said, you'll notice it's only over the bottom part there where the crawl is with the stock market stuff.

[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:18.560]
And especially when the market got off to a real guilt.

[02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:19.740]
I had to start this morning.

[02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:23.400]
I thought, I'm not going to be a captive of audience and sitting here watching four hours of it again.

[02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:27.620]
So I just taped my hero sports section right over to bottom part on CNN.

[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:32.200]
I can see they're talking about the silly war on drugs and the audio and everything I need to see.

[02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:35.620]
I just don't have to see that stock crap, you know, on my money vanishing.

[02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:38.520]
Here's a lady in the redlands.

[02:31:38.600 --> 02:31:38.740]
Hello.

[02:31:39.640 --> 02:31:40.000]
Yes.

[02:31:40.240 --> 02:31:40.700]
Hi, Neil.

[02:31:40.780 --> 02:31:41.300]
Good afternoon.

[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:41.800]
How are you?

[02:31:42.460 --> 02:31:42.820]
Fine.

[02:31:42.980 --> 02:31:43.500]
How are you?

[02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:43.860]
Great.

[02:31:43.900 --> 02:31:45.760]
Can I push topics here?

[02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:51.360]
I remember you mentioned that you have problems with the good level toilet you have in Amsterdam.

[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:52.220]
Oh, we got rid of that.

[02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:53.940]
I got a house now with no split level toilet.

[02:31:54.380 --> 02:31:54.740]
Okay.

[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:56.480]
No, because I just had a friend.

[02:31:56.480 --> 02:32:00.740]
She's from Vienna, but I looked in Amsterdam like a couple of years back and I had the same problem.

[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:03.480]
I kid marked after you leave the bathroom and it's so embarrassing.

[02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:07.600]
So finally, I had a nerve after how do you guys do it?

[02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:08.280]
There she goes.

[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:16.540]
All you've got to do is just put a toilet paper in the dry area and then that takes care of the problem.

[02:32:17.380 --> 02:32:17.640]
Hmm.

[02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:19.220]
Before you do your thing.

[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:20.400]
Put the paper in ahead of time, yeah.

[02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:21.420]
I know.

[02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:24.060]
Well, I'll never be a droppin' on that seat again.

[02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:25.180]
Thank the Lord for that.

[02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:26.160]
I'm more out of that place.

[02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:27.280]
I know.

[02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:32.660]
Well, I thought that might be a healthy, but I guess he didn't go for that kind of toilet.

[02:32:32.660 --> 02:32:33.600]
More maybe now.

[02:32:33.700 --> 02:32:34.380]
We're making the progress.

[02:32:34.580 --> 02:32:36.580]
Now we're moving on to like the 18th century anyway.

[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:37.760]
Okay, then.

[02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:38.340]
Thanks a lot.

[02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:38.900]
That's about it.

[02:32:38.900 --> 02:32:39.140]
Okay.

[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:39.900]
Thanks.

[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:40.340]
Bye.

[02:32:40.600 --> 02:32:40.820]
Do we?

[02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:44.920]
26th after 1 at 5.60 WQAM.

[02:32:45.340 --> 02:32:46.440]
Do you want yourself a great smoke?

[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:48.240]
Let me highly recommend Nixigarth here.

[02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:53.880]
A lot of you folks who got in Smarter for these past three years and gone down to Nix and discovered that you don't have to pay an armor leg for a quality smoke.

[02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:55.360]
A legal smoke we're talking about.

[02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:56.400]
Are we talking legal?

[02:32:56.580 --> 02:32:56.780]
Uh-huh.

[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:57.080]
You bet.

[02:32:57.500 --> 02:32:58.160]
Try them all.

[02:32:58.340 --> 02:32:59.440]
And you'll figure out which ones you like.

[02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:00.940]
I have a feeling you'll probably like them all.

[02:33:00.940 --> 02:33:04.020]
But you'll finally settle on one of the best like I am.

[02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:10.320]
I used to love the Pradomo Reserve, which I still do, but my new favorite is that Rich Pradomo is Squared, which has got a unique and amazing shape.

[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:11.540]
And it just, it's orange well.

[02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:12.460]
Somebody mentioned that earlier.

[02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:13.240]
Is he going on there at all?

[02:33:13.380 --> 02:33:15.400]
No, we don't have enough geriatrics to qualify.

[02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:19.400]
Oh yeah, we forgot Tobogijo from the Ed Solomon show.

[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:21.520]
Tobogijo, yeah Ed Solomon.

[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:22.560]
Did he have a personality?

[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:22.960]
No.

[02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:23.580]
Or what?

[02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:24.340]
Did he have a neck?

[02:33:24.900 --> 02:33:25.160]
No.

[02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:28.740]
He was kind of like the beast he had no neck.

[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:31.360]
5.6705.60.

[02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:32.540]
But I'm going to read the list now.

[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:32.780]
Okay?

[02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:35.760]
Give Eric a little opportunity here to get these down.

[02:33:36.260 --> 02:33:37.140]
Howard Cosell.

[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:40.620]
Our question, by the way, if you're doing this in the stream and I can't imagine why.

[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:43.120]
Who is your all-time favorite TV celebrity?

[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:53.080]
Howard Cosell, Ed Solomon, Richard Bullin, Raymond Burr, Oprah, Bill Bixby, Sid Cesar.

[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:53.960]
You know who we left off?

[02:33:54.220 --> 02:33:54.740]
Jerry Springer.

[02:33:58.780 --> 02:33:59.220]
What?

[02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:00.440]
You don't think he belongs on there?

[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:00.680]
No.

[02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:03.280]
I'll build this piece since he's here.

[02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:05.200]
Fill down a new fair faucet.

[02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:13.280]
Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Fandike, Jean Raver, Peter Graves, Jack Berry, Bill Cullen, James

[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:20.240]
Garner, Phil Hartman, Alan Alda, Dick Clark, William Shatner, Jack Lourd, Bob Barker.

[02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:22.740]
Did I say Peter Graves?

[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:26.100]
I don't know.

[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:27.660]
Well, I have these written all over the page.

[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:29.780]
Fill down a new fair faucet, Peter Graves.

[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:30.400]
They're off to the side.

[02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:31.120]
I guess I don't know.

[02:34:31.460 --> 02:34:33.320]
Well, I'm sure Eric is paying attention or not.

[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:38.300]
Dick Clark, Jack Lourd, Larry Hagman, Bob Barker, Regis Philbentoni, Dow Carollow-Conner,

[02:34:38.740 --> 02:34:44.780]
Susan Day, Carol Burnett, Michael Landon, Sherman Hemsley, AKA George Jefferson, Jerry

Ball, Jackie Gleason, Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Florence Edison, David Cassidy,

[02:35:03.940 --> 02:35:06.920]
William Conrad, Tally Sivalis, Jack Par, or Steve Allen?

[02:35:08.660 --> 02:35:10.460]
I'm thinking we'll let somebody off here.

[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:15.960]
No, seriously, I'm looking, maybe I didn't write one down.

[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:16.720]
Oh, no.

[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:18.520]
I hate when that happens.

[02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:21.280]
Oh, William Bendix.

[02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:22.500]
No, he's not on here.

[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:27.740]
Five, six, seven, okay, last minute editions here in last 25 minutes and then that's it.

[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:30.460]
Then we'll put this all together and get like 25 million votes overnight.

[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:31.660]
You know who's going to win?

[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:32.500]
Roy Orbison.

[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:35.300]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:35.660]
Hello?

[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:36.700]
Hill.

[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:37.320]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:38.620]
How about Ernie Vardinay?

[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:39.360]
No.

[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:40.720]
Oh, come on.

[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:41.180]
No.

[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:43.340]
Mickey, we already discussed that earlier.

[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:46.300]
We took a vote and we said, nice guy, but no.

[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:48.580]
I'm a little earlier than Claudia and they mentioned Joseph.

[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:52.040]
Well, today that was a guy who used to be a candidate.

[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:52.660]
Right.

[02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:57.340]
And George put on a little music right before the new now.

[02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:59.580]
I think that was for local show.

[02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:01.380]
I used to play down here called jumping jack.

[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:01.840]
I don't know why.

[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:02.480]
He's a kid.

[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:03.000]
That's right.

[02:36:03.260 --> 02:36:04.000]
I'm out of material.

[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:04.320]
Okay.

[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:05.200]
See ya.

[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:10.440]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon.

[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:12.660]
So the bad news we learned today is Clarebel.

[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:14.980]
Not Bob Keeshawn, but the real Clarebel.

[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:15.500]
He died?

[02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:16.180]
He's dead.

[02:36:16.620 --> 02:36:17.580]
Oh, that's sad.

[02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:21.460]
No, how do you do the cast, rest in peace?

[02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:25.460]
All we can do is put on the search for Princess Summerfall with his spring and prey.

[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.620]
Pray to the heavens that he's still around somewhere.

[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:30.160]
Here's Homestead.

[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:30.420]
Hello.

[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:31.900]
I'm Dale.

[02:36:32.140 --> 02:36:32.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:34.580]
How about Arthur Gottfried?

[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:39.060]
Well, you know, on the heels of a great lunch, I guess you're right.

[02:36:39.100 --> 02:36:40.040]
I have to put him on here.

[02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:41.480]
And Liberace.

[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:43.440]
What do you say, George?

[02:36:43.700 --> 02:36:44.040]
Liberace?

[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:48.720]
Okay.

[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:49.540]
Have a great day, sir.

[02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:50.600]
We're debating Liberace.

[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:52.280]
Arthur Gottfried, I have to put down.

[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:54.720]
Even though I find it personally repugnant.

[02:36:55.980 --> 02:36:57.780]
But he was an icon.

[02:36:58.000 --> 02:36:58.840]
He was a pioneer.

[02:36:59.100 --> 02:37:00.180]
He was an anti-Semite.

[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:01.480]
He was big.

[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:04.800]
Then in the street after most self-hating Jews, I might be beaten.

[02:37:04.980 --> 02:37:06.400]
Then in the street after him.

[02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:08.800]
Right next to Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him, Him,

[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:09.100]
them to drive.

[02:37:11.980 --> 02:37:13.280]
Then the rich, danches his way.

[02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:20.880]
How about people for the American way?

[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:24.620]
Arthur Gottfried, I'm not putting Liberace on it.

[02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:25.720]
That's the sewer in birsen.

[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:26.120]

[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:27.660]
How about a retina?

[02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:28.520]
I don't know how to deal with a show.

[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:28.900]
Not sure.

[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:31.740]
The Liberace show we use to sit there with his brother and George?

[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:33.660]
And he used to play divinity Allen in.

[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:33.840]
Nacht.

[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:34.020]
And Dunlop.

[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:34.260]
Yeah.

[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:35.620]
The люблю, the love run a piano.

[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:36.800]
He was a great pianist.

[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:39.180]
So I've heard.

[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:39.920]
Uh-huh.

[02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:41.420]
Here's Orlando.

[02:37:41.420 --> 02:37:41.840]
Hello.

[02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:45.880]
No, I was stopped laughing since about 10-20.

[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:46.260]
Really?

[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:49.840]
That phone call, the guy, was that the same guy that called you?

[02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:53.220]
I thought he worked at a station, then he was friends with the bird.

[02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:56.240]
And then said the bird, hate your gut.

[02:37:56.700 --> 02:37:57.480]
That's the same guy.

[02:37:57.560 --> 02:37:58.380]
No, this was his boyfriend.

[02:37:58.900 --> 02:37:59.700]
That was funny.

[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.060]
And then you might have had the best weekend you've had in a long time, man.

[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:04.440]
You've been with him today.

[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:05.820]
I mean, really sharp.

[02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:06.720]
You want to know why?

[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:09.280]
I got my income tax refund check.

[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:10.440]
Great.

[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:11.740]
Yeah, that's what I said.

[02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:13.980]
But I have a few names here.

[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:17.740]
Why I'm mentioned already, it was Robert Conrad from Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild.

[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:20.680]
How about Robert Eurick from Vegas?

[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:22.440]
No.

[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:23.460]
No.

[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.680]
And you were talking about Regis of WallaGale?

[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:26.980]
Yeah.

[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:27.960]
Here's one for you.

[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:29.380]
You remember a lot.

[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:34.820]
Before Regis got to be real big, it was the first thing you remember seeing him on TVF.

[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:36.320]
Joey Bishop.

[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:37.980]
Oh, you got it.

[02:38:37.980 --> 02:38:39.260]
I thought I was going to want to do that.

[02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:39.800]
No.

[02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:41.500]
Well, we're not going to put Joey Bishop on.

[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:41.880]
Are we?

[02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:42.200]
No.

[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:43.660]
No, Joey Bishop.

[02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:47.500]
No, these people don't know Joey Bishop from Ann Bishop.

[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:48.660]
Yeah, I watch that.

[02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:51.680]
I've never seen an evil, evil, cradging, and seizures.

[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:52.600]
Uh-huh.

[02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:56.200]
But Jack Albert was going to be played with Chico in the man.

[02:38:56.580 --> 02:38:56.780]
Right.

[02:38:57.500 --> 02:38:58.820]
And that's about it, Neil.

[02:38:59.080 --> 02:38:59.320]
Okay.

[02:38:59.520 --> 02:38:59.980]
Great show.

[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:00.940]
I'll see you at Albert's.

[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:01.440]
Bye.

[02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:01.940]
Thanks.

[02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:03.760]
Yeah, we're getting there.

[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:06.760]
We got Arthur Gottfried, added a list of now and all, and Phil Harmon and I'm not sure whether

[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:07.440]
those are originally well.

[02:39:07.540 --> 02:39:10.860]
I'm sure Eric gets all these names out there because this is very, very important, Eric.

[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:12.320]
This is very crucial.

[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:16.560]
This is heavy, heavy, heavy, duty, baby.

[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:21.100]
So I saved the big piece of my steak there for like after work, for after the show.

[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:26.040]
Got to take home pop it in the microwave that butter will like release all the juices in there again.

[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:30.140]
Oh, nothing like a delicious ribeye steak from Ruth Chris.

[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.100]
So I hear, yeah, that's what George heard.

[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:36.040]
Well, I took it there a couple of times and I once once once.

[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:39.200]
Well, if he gets JP back down here again, they will go again.

[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:39.760]
Okay.

[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:41.140]
And his new girlfriend.

[02:39:41.500 --> 02:39:42.720]
What we got rid of that other one.

[02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:45.340]
I think.

[02:39:46.420 --> 02:39:47.360]
Yeah, I think she's gone.

[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:48.560]
She maybe gone.

[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:50.140]
He was done.

[02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:52.680]
Well done is what I'm hearing.

[02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:58.380]

[02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:02.040]

How about those sabers, baby?

[02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:13.620]
Yeah.

[02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:15.200]
Oh, Bobby Clark.

[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:17.280]
I'm telling you, you can stick it right deep inside your.

[02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:17.440]
Correct.

[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:18.600]
You piece of turd you.

[02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:20.560]
It made me so deliriously happy.

[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:21.880]
Eight nothing was good.

[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:23.600]
28 nothing would have been even better.

[02:40:24.420 --> 02:40:28.860]
For Bobby Clark and those are missing a glim with the Philadelphia flyers.

[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:29.540]
It's not either though.

[02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:30.320]
They got some ish.

[02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:32.000]
Baja the whole organization.

[02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:34.420]
Hey, where is the bargains?

[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:35.300]
You may be wondering right now.

[02:40:35.380 --> 02:40:35.960]
I'll tell you.

[02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:37.820]
They're at the swap shop over 88 acres.

[02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:39.960]
Shock full of bargains from indoor and outdoor vendors.

[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:43.220]
The swap shop is the busiest retail location in the world before daylight.

[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:47.480]
And a nice swap shop has got the world's biggest 13 screen drive in movie theater featuring great

[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:48.200]
first run movies.

[02:40:48.580 --> 02:40:50.600]
Why do so many people shop at the swap shop?

[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:54.500]
It's easy to answer that question because no part of the South can you see millions and millions

[02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:55.300]
and millions of people.

[02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:05.660]
Is it A dock, B pier, C marina or D inlet?

[02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:07.400]
Whoa, man.

[02:41:07.940 --> 02:41:09.300]
Is the hundred dollar question ready?

[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:10.420]
You're kidding me right?

[02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:12.060]
This is a hundred dollars.

[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:13.560]
For one hundred dollars.

[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:15.120]
Is it a million dollar question?

[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:16.980]
This is the first one.

[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:17.800]
Man.

[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:19.020]
Holy for a hundred dollars.

[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:20.260]
Is this a black thing?

[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:21.840]
Did you like to use a lifeline?

[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:23.200]
Yeah, I wonder what I got.

[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:23.740]
What do I got?

[02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:27.240]
Well, we have the ask the audience the 50-50 and the phone of friend.

[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:28.280]
Ask the audience.

[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:30.120]
Not too many white people in here.

[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:31.840]
That's 50-50, you may help me.

[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:33.320]
Oh, you know I'm going to phone a friend.

[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:37.000]
I'm going to phone a friend on the hundred dollar question finishing the nursery run.

[02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:37.700]
Yeah.

[02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:39.860]
All right, who are we going to call, puppy?

[02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:40.840]
Oh, my boy.

[02:41:41.020 --> 02:41:42.020]
Old dirty bastard.

[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:44.020]
Old dirty bastard.

[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:45.360]
Yeah, dirty we call.

[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:49.260]
Our friends from AT&T will get old dirty on the line.

[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:51.200]
And hopefully he can help you.

[02:41:53.620 --> 02:41:54.180]
Yo.

[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:55.560]

I got your friend here, puff daddy.

[02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:04.300]
Your dirty was that?

[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:05.180]
Was that?

[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:06.080]
Was that?

[02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:08.220]
Was that?

[02:42:08.740 --> 02:42:09.140]
Was that?

[02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:09.820]
Was that?

[02:42:09.900 --> 02:42:10.220]
Was that?

[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:10.240]

[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:10.240]

[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:10.240]

[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:10.720]
All right, all right.

[02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:12.700]
Old dirty?

[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:15.340]
Uh, puff daddy's a number.

[02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:18.120]
I'm going to put a little bit of trouble here on the hundred dollar question.

[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.040]
Hey, the first time, man.

[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:20.940]
First question.

[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:23.640]
And the next boy she hear will be his.

[02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:25.600]
He'll come on the line and he'll ask you the question.

[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:27.660]
He'll give you four possible choices.

[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:28.380]
Are you set?

[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:29.400]
Hey, man.

[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:36.040]

[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:37.200]
Yo, dirty.

[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:38.820]
It finishes off for me, all right?

[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:39.500]
Hey, man.

[02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:41.800]
Pickery, decory, blank.

[02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:43.400]

[02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:43.900]

[02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:44.000]

[02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:44.740]

[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:49.880]

[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:51.420]
Or D?

[02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:52.780]
Italy?

[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:54.840]
Oh, oh.

[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:55.680]
Come on, man.

[02:42:55.860 --> 02:42:56.520]
I don't got much time.

[02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:57.320]
Yeah, I know this.

[02:42:57.480 --> 02:42:58.220]
I know this.

[02:42:58.300 --> 02:42:58.440]
I know it.

[02:42:58.440 --> 02:42:59.320]
I see this Pia.

[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:00.420]
Pia, you sure?

[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:02.200]
About 30, man.

[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:03.440]
There's a lot of money, man.

[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:04.340]
About 30.

[02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:05.080]
All right, man.

[02:43:05.180 --> 02:43:05.880]
Thank you very much.

[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:06.800]
All right, man.

[02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:09.060]
Time's up, uh, old dirty.

[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:10.180]
Said Pia.

[02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:12.820]
You still have two lifeline as well.

[02:43:12.820 --> 02:43:14.120]
Yes, we are on the $100.

[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:17.080]
But three lifelines have used one you have two left.

[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:17.840]
No, no, no.

[02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:19.600]
I get another lifeline.

[02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:21.160]
It's a brand new one to the game.

[02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:23.060]
And, uh, what is that, Puffy?

[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:24.440]
It's called Shoot the Host.

[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:26.360]
Puffy, you can ask the audience.

[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:27.760]
I call it Shoot the Host.

[02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:29.140]
Puffy, use the 50-50.

[02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:30.000]
What's the answer?

[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:30.880]
Puffy, it's Doc.

[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:31.480]
It's A.

[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:32.400]
It's Doc.

[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:33.620]
My final answer is Doc.

[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:34.220]
It's Doc.

[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:35.360]
And it's a good one.

[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:36.320]
You got a hundred dollars.

[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:37.720]
Where are you, Ray White?

[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:38.460]
Where are you, Ray White?

[02:43:38.460 --> 02:43:39.240]
Come on, come on, come on.

[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:39.820]
Come on, come on.

[02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:42.920]
144-560 WQM.

[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:45.140]
So I got this fact a long time ago and I forgot to mention it.

[02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:46.700]
Weasy, which we've talked about this before.

[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:49.520]
Weasy from the Jefferson's is Lenny Kravitz's mother.

[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:51.720]
Oh, I believe it as much as we love Weasy.

[02:43:51.780 --> 02:43:52.660]
That proves what I always said.

[02:43:53.020 --> 02:43:54.840]
Forest realization is a really good idea.

[02:43:56.100 --> 02:43:56.920]
Nice hair to Lenny.

[02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:00.500]
One night is a couple lay down for bed.

[02:44:00.580 --> 02:44:02.240]
The husband gently tats his wife on the shoulder

[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:03.480]
and started rubbing her arm.

[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:05.180]
His wife turned over and said,

[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:05.900]
I'm sorry, honey.

[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:07.460]
I've got a gynecologist appointment tomorrow

[02:44:07.460 --> 02:44:08.300]
and I want to stay fresh.

[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:11.740]
Her husband rejected her and tried to sleep.

[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:14.860]
A few minutes later he rolled back over and tapped his wife again.

[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:16.660]
This time he whispered in her ear,

[02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:18.660]
Do you have a dentist appointment tomorrow too?

[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:22.640]
How about the streets of San Francisco?

[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:23.420]
I'm Michael Douglas.

[02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:23.980]
What do you say?

[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:24.260]
No.

[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:28.760]
Carl Molden says, forgot the other actor's name.

[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:30.220]
I've actually didn't forget his nose though.

[02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:30.920]
Carl Molden.

[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:31.860]
That was a good show.

[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:33.420]
Are they going to be on the list?

[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:33.760]
No.

[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:36.040]
Let me ask you something.

[02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:36.460]
What's that?

[02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:37.780]
What's blaring out there in the hall?

[02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:38.280]
What is that?

[02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:40.360]
Did you hear that?

[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:40.780]
No.

[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:42.360]
Oh, it stopped.

[02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:44.220]
By the way, it was Roxy Roker's

[02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:45.240]
Lenny Kravitz's mom,

[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:46.280]
which is the upstairs neighbors.

[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:48.340]
No, not Weezy.

[02:44:48.700 --> 02:44:49.200]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:50.560]
Yeah, get it right, OK?

[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:52.560]
God.

[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:54.420]
Ah!

[02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:56.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:57.820]
We're getting at the end.

[02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:58.360]
It's a good thing.

[02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:01.020]
I just flipped on CNBC for just one second there.

[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:03.680]
Good thing I have my Harold's sports section taped

[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:05.220]
right over the bottom of my ISCNN.

[02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:06.100]
Good move.

[02:45:06.620 --> 02:45:08.200]
No, it's not that bad.

[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:08.840]
Not that good.

[02:45:09.060 --> 02:45:09.420]
Sogway.

[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:11.800]
Here's a model in Miami.

[02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:12.300]
Hello.

[02:45:12.780 --> 02:45:13.720]
Are you Neon?

[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:14.100]
Yes.

[02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:15.300]
How you doing, Daniel?

[02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:15.640]
Good.

[02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:17.580]
Got a couple of names for you.

[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:19.520]
Actually, you're talking about inshows.

[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:20.700]
The Monty Hall would be one.

[02:45:21.900 --> 02:45:22.560]
Monty Hall.

[02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:24.860]
Remember, let's make a deal.

[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:26.100]
Yeah, I know Monty Hall,

[02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:27.220]
but I think the answer is no.

[02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:27.540]
No.

[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:28.460]
Is that the Zeth?

[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:30.020]
That was the medley of his smash, you know?

[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:30.480]
Yeah, I know.

[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:32.580]
I got a couple of names for TV.

[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:34.400]
How about Robin Williams' work in Mendy?

[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:35.160]
No.

[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:36.880]
Lauren Green?

[02:45:37.820 --> 02:45:38.440]
What do you think?

[02:45:38.660 --> 02:45:39.800]
We debated that earlier.

[02:45:40.060 --> 02:45:40.860]
Lauren Green, you know?

[02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:41.680]
Yeah, let's put them on there.

[02:45:41.780 --> 02:45:42.100]
What the hell?

[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:45.040]
I don't know if you put Lucy and Desi.

[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:45.860]
Lucy's on her.

[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:46.440]
Not Desi.

[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:47.280]
Okay.

[02:45:47.480 --> 02:45:49.200]
We don't want to start making this into a Julio list.

[02:45:49.900 --> 02:45:51.140]
All right, how about this one, Daniel?

[02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:52.140]
I know you did baseball.

[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:52.500]
I know you did baseball.

[02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:52.980]
I know I haven't.

[02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:53.620]
This week in baseball.

[02:45:54.020 --> 02:45:54.240]
No.

[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:55.100]
No.

[02:45:55.500 --> 02:45:56.200]
Lee Major's?

[02:45:56.460 --> 02:45:56.940]
He's on her.

[02:45:57.500 --> 02:45:58.140]
All right, take it in.

[02:45:58.260 --> 02:45:58.660]
See ya.

[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:02.180]
Okay, Lauren Green has one more edition of the list.

[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:03.900]
Yeah, what about Desi?

[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:04.900]
We're gonna put Desi on there.

[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:05.060]
No.

[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:07.260]
Lucy, Babaloo, Babaloo, come on.

[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:08.440]
Let's put Desi on there.

[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:08.780]
No.

[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:09.100]
No.

[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:10.300]
Because that was it.

[02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:11.240]
That was his bagel.

[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:12.840]
Yeah, Miguel was very close to him.

[02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:13.100]
He wasn't about that.

[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:14.740]
He said when he's gonna put some more Cubans on there.

[02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:16.440]
Well, you know Miguel.

[02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:18.200]
Yeah.

[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:19.280]
I do know Miguel.

[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:20.580]
And you said C.Z.

[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:20.940]
Romero.

[02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:24.200]
Just because you asked, you know, name another guy.

[02:46:24.200 --> 02:46:25.960]
I said name another famous TV Cuban.

[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:26.500]
You said C.Z.

[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:26.720]
Romero.

[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:28.140]
I said that man.

[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:29.240]
He was the Joker.

[02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:30.260]
He was very good in that role.

[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:31.460]
What else did he do on here?

[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:33.160]
He was a character actor.

[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:33.880]
He was in a lot of movies.

[02:46:34.140 --> 02:46:35.320]
Yeah, but not TV.

[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:38.320]
But I'll say again, if you want to see a whole bunch of C.Z.

[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:40.520]
Romero's just go to Caracas, Venezuela, when they go in there.

[02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:41.800]
They made your hotels downtown.

[02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:45.340]
And there's all these people standing around in the lobby with pinstripes suits who look

[02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:45.980]
just like C.Z.

[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:46.320]
Romero.

[02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:47.860]
Yeah.

[02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:50.600]
It's like a time warp.

[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:52.620]
Caracas.

[02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:55.480]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:55.780]
Hello.

[02:46:56.660 --> 02:46:57.180]
Hi, Neil.

[02:46:57.380 --> 02:46:57.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:58.620 --> 02:46:59.400]
Three for you.

[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:00.780]
John at the winners.

[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:03.720]
Yeah.

[02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:05.300]
Ernie Kovacs.

[02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:06.900]
Ernie Kovacs.

[02:47:07.380 --> 02:47:08.420]
But he died in the way.

[02:47:08.460 --> 02:47:10.320]
I mean, he's under here for about five minutes and he died.

[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:11.940]
I know, but he's still used to hearing.

[02:47:12.180 --> 02:47:12.880]
He was great.

[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:13.840]
He was one of my favorites.

[02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:14.360]
He's right.

[02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:15.120]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:47:15.220 --> 02:47:16.580]
Ernie Kovacs needs to be on the list.

[02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:16.940]
You're right.

[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:17.280]
Excellent.

[02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:18.040]
One more.

[02:47:18.220 --> 02:47:18.620]
Wild card.

[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:19.440]
Paul Lynn.

[02:47:20.260 --> 02:47:22.860]
Yeah, I mentioned him before, but George seemed pretty good down on it.

[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:24.360]
He was funny as hell.

[02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:24.800]
Yeah, he was.

[02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:25.720]
He was a center square.

[02:47:25.900 --> 02:47:26.360]
And he was on B.

[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:26.600]
Which.

[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:27.740]
Yeah, let's put him on there.

[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:28.020]
You're right.

[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:28.840]
You got two out of three.

[02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:29.780]
Thank you, sir.

[02:47:29.880 --> 02:47:30.160]
Thank you.

[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:31.240]
Yeah, let's put him on there.

[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:31.940]
What the hell is going to hurt?

[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:33.120]
Okay, let's have a token of fact.

[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:34.260]
I mean, Paul Lynn.

[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:37.240]
And Ernie Kovacs.

[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.860]
Of course, how many people remember Ernie Kovacs?

[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:42.160]
Do you remember Ernie Kovacs?

[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:45.680]
He's struggling in shoulders like who?

[02:47:46.060 --> 02:47:46.200]
Huh?

[02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:47.860]
How about John Kovacs?

[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:48.580]
He's the harness driver.

[02:47:48.780 --> 02:47:49.180]
What is it?

[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:50.000]
Whatever.

[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:50.600]
You'll...

[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:51.280]
You tell me.

[02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:55.760]
No, I put it on there, but I'm seeing you remember Ernie Kovacs?

[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:57.400]
Why would I remember Ernie?

[02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:57.760]
You don't.

[02:47:58.660 --> 02:47:59.840]
Do you remember ED Adams?

[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:00.880]
No.

[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:04.500]
With the white-out spots or whatever, uh, cigar, she was selling?

[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:07.140]
Do you remember ED Adams?

[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:07.700]
No.

[02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:08.780]
Oh, no.

[02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:10.500]
That explains a lot.

[02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:10.960]
ED Gormay.

[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:11.840]
ED Gormay.

[02:48:11.940 --> 02:48:12.900]
How about Steve Lawrence, huh?

[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:13.140]
No.

[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:13.900]
ED Gormay.

[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:14.120]
No.

[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:17.380]
Yeah, we got to get a few more Jews on the list here.

[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:20.600]
How about Steve Lawrence's brother that worse the elevator

[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:21.280]
over the track?

[02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:21.640]
No.

[02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:23.800]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:24.160]
Hello.

[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:25.080]
Hey, Uncle Leo.

[02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:25.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:25.900]
How are you?

[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:26.240]
Great.

[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:27.740]
I got a bunch of them for you.

[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:28.040]
Okay.

[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:32.560]
One of them, unfortunately, died too soon, but Jack Sue was soon.

[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:33.160]
You got it?

[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:34.420]
How London.

[02:48:34.700 --> 02:48:35.140]
I love them.

[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:36.360]
Red Fox.

[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:39.540]
And Barbara Eden, because I always wanted to...

[02:48:39.540 --> 02:48:41.700]
Yeah, Barbara Eden was the first name I put on the list.

[02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:42.360]
What's that?

[02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:43.160]
Barbara Eden.

[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:46.800]
Oh, yeah, because I always wanted to blonde that new, I'd say, yes, master and mentor.

[02:48:47.140 --> 02:48:47.680]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:48:47.900 --> 02:48:48.400]
Okay, thanks.

[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:52.440]
See, now there's a rebuttal to that guy before that was telling that Barbara Eden and whoever

[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:55.760]
Jack Lin Smith weren't at the least bit sexual than any heterosexual man.

[02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:04.040]
That's like telling me that the birth war wasn't attractive than any homosexual man, you know?

[02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:08.260]
With those tights and those crime fighting booties.

[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:15.960]
Well, that feels really weird.

[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:17.020]
Yeah, never mind that.

[02:49:17.020 --> 02:49:18.660]
Unless you like it, of course.

[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:20.080]
Still in the whole time.

[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:22.340]
Get a little bumpy here.

[02:49:23.060 --> 02:49:24.100]
Oh, tiny corn.

[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:27.080]
Easy and run away from your own house.

[02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:29.960]
154 or 560 WKM.

[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:31.780]
Here are two faces, one good and one ridiculous.

[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:33.420]
The first one says, do Lockhart.

[02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:35.680]
Lassie lost in space.

[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:36.300]
What do you think?

[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:41.040]
Call us the flockhard or do Lockhart?

[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:43.620]
None of you, Bob.

[02:49:43.620 --> 02:49:46.220]
Well, you know, we like you, June, but you're not going to make the list.

[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:49.700]
Now, here's the fact that you're going to just love from Laurie who says.

[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:53.360]
And then you can see by the handwriting she's psychotic.

[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:56.300]
Lenny K's mother was the woman in the interracial couple.

[02:49:56.300 --> 02:49:57.340]
George is an asshole.

[02:49:58.760 --> 02:49:59.160]
What?

[02:49:59.360 --> 02:49:59.820]
What I said.

[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:00.300]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:02.480]
And weezie wasn't the woman from the interracial couple.

[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:04.040]
She was the George Ephraines wife.

[02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:07.500]
The woman from the interracial couple was Roxy whatever they were.

[02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:08.280]
Roxy, Roxy, Roxy, Roxy, Roxy, Roxy.

[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:08.620]
Right.

[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:11.560]
That's how my honky's wife, right, bitch.

[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:12.860]
So how do you like that?

[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:14.340]
All of a shit has to have a point.

[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:15.840]
Well, she's got George spelled with the G.

[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:18.100]
So maybe she's talking about somebody I'd like George Jefferson.

[02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:19.620]
And that's what she meant.

[02:50:19.740 --> 02:50:20.120]
Do you think so?

[02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:20.480]
No.

[02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:21.760]
Fine, Laurie.

[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:23.020]
I think it's really from Gary Starner.

[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:28.060]
567.0560, 05.60 on A.T. and T.

[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:28.600]
And Verizon.

[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:32.100]
I mean, if you're going to be wrong, lady, don't be loud and wrong.

[02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:33.560]
OK, you're wrong the first time.

[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:34.860]
OK, anybody can make a mistake.

[02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:36.660]
But then to call back and bitch out, George,

[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:38.160]
it's just because you were a whole crap.

[02:50:39.580 --> 02:50:41.340]
We got your weezy right over here, honey.

[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:43.360]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:43.680]
Hello.

[02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:44.660]
Hello there.

[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:45.620]
How about Edwin?

[02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:47.400]
Edwin's on the list.

[02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:49.020]
Oh, yes, I didn't hear it.

[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:49.680]
I put him on there.

[02:50:49.740 --> 02:50:50.360]
Well, no, wait a minute.

[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:51.220]
Maybe I left him off.

[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:52.100]
I thought I'd put him on.

[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:54.940]
I left him off.

[02:50:55.020 --> 02:50:55.260]
You're right.

[02:50:55.680 --> 02:50:56.100]
You're right.

[02:50:56.220 --> 02:50:56.800]
Thank you.

[02:50:56.840 --> 02:50:57.220]
All right.

[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:00.160]
Do you remember a good old, a breaching gram

[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:01.960]
from the old IOD days?

[02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:02.320]
Sure.

[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:04.660]
Did you hear that last week,

[02:51:04.660 --> 02:51:08.020]
a wonderful human being of a person,

[02:51:08.980 --> 02:51:09.920]
husband, passed away.

[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:11.300]
He lost his battle to cancer.

[02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:14.680]
Chuck Dent used to do the morning news on the GPS.

[02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:15.180]
Sure.

[02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:17.220]
Yeah, he passed away last week.

[02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:18.120]
I didn't know if you heard it or not.

[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:18.720]
You did not hear that.

[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:19.120]
So it heard.

[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:22.440]
No, it was one of the few good people left in this business.

[02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:23.040]
Good news guy.

[02:51:23.580 --> 02:51:23.740]
Yeah.

[02:51:24.020 --> 02:51:24.980]
Well, have a great one to your face.

[02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:25.500]
OK, thanks.

[02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:26.300]
Thanks for the bad news.

[02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:27.700]
Chuck Dent died.

[02:51:29.800 --> 02:51:30.120]
Oh.

[02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:31.500]
Edwin.

[02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:33.420]
Well, I could be the whole list again.

[02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:33.920]
Sure.

[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:34.060]
I.

[02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:35.000]
Yes.

[02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:40.960]
And you've got to keep in mind when we ask these questions,

[02:51:40.960 --> 02:51:41.660]
it's just amazing.

[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:45.000]
I understand that you could whip up in the, oh, you left the name out.

[02:51:45.240 --> 02:51:48.000]
But you've got to understand who's your all-time favorite.

[02:51:49.640 --> 02:51:51.540]
Your all-time favorite TV personality.

[02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:55.860]
And I mean, I just boggling to me that somebody could say like,

[02:51:55.860 --> 02:51:56.360]
Mady Hall.

[02:51:56.620 --> 02:51:57.340]
Oh, sorry, tree.

[02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:00.260]
I mean, Mady Hall is your favorite all-time TV personality.

[02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:02.880]
Mady Python, maybe Mady Hall, no.

[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:06.580]
So here's who we have on here now.

[02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:08.620]

Garner, Mary Tadamore, Dick Van Dyke, Jean Raver, Jack

[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:22.420]
Barry, Peter Graves, or that's Jack Benny, not Jack Barry.

[02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:23.640]
Sorry, Eric, Jack Benny.

[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:30.240]

Will you leave anybody out? Probably a lot.

[02:53:20.860 --> 02:53:22.080]
That's a pretty good list though.

[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:25.940]
Damn good. And I'll say it again. Are any of those people

[02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:28.600]
from the shows in the last couple of years? No.

[02:53:28.720 --> 02:53:29.500]
Last five years? No.

[02:53:29.620 --> 02:53:30.180]
Ten years? No.

[02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:32.620]
None. I mean, would Jay Leno and Letterman?

[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:34.240]
But they've been on longer than that.

[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:39.460]
Goes to show you there's a desperate lack of real entertainment,

[02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:41.460]
of real star power out there now.

[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:44.200]
Got some real marginal, terminal people on there.

[02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:46.340]
I'm not saying there aren't a few good shows. Not too many.

[02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:49.280]
Lady in plantation. Hello.

[02:53:49.980 --> 02:53:51.120]
Oh, you're telling me that's me first.

[02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:52.200]
That sounds like you, sorry.

[02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:54.600]
Yes, I'll go quickly. A correction first though.

[02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:57.340]
A man's a wild back on nervous, but I don't mind my first

[02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:58.900]
really nice thing when I'm not nervous.

[02:53:59.100 --> 02:53:59.240]
Okay.

[02:53:59.420 --> 02:54:02.160]
A man said, Marsha Gids, it's Marla Gids.

[02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:02.940]
Right.

[02:54:03.220 --> 02:54:05.240]
Okay, my list is 8-A-Goat-A-Fish,

Okay. Thanks.

Okay, thank you.

[02:54:19.960 --> 02:54:20.380]
Bye-bye.

[02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:22.120]
Good list. Are we going to put them on here?

[02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:22.320]
No.

[02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:22.540]
No.

that's done.

[02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:13.180]
I don't know what I'm going to vote for.

[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:14.780]
