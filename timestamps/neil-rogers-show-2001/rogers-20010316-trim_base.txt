[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.440]
560 WQAS presents a Neil Rogers Show to Tom Tameel.

[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.140]
It's a 7.660 in Daneel, Rowan County, on count 560, 18.818, where was it?

[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.980]
87775 Neil is a toll-free QVP on the four-wheel Rogers, his guests are followed.

[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.340]
Does not reflect those of the measly broadcaster.

[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.280]
It's now the advertisers for it.

[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.960]
Now, the Neil Rogers Show on 560 QAS.

[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.060]
It's Friday, you first, dude.

[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.740]
Oh, I don't know where it is about.

[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.720]
They're lining little voices or they're big noses.

[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.660]
To be hard, tiny little meckles.

[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.720]
I don't know, they just rub me the wrong way.

[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.060]
Anti-Semitism, lebson, every speech, I love regensits, and the news.

[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.040]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:52.580]
Portido. Hello clouds, hello Wii U five, 60-Fu w.w.w., I'm happy Friday to that you're a friend Roy

[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.860]
Crazy Horse. I thought the Crazy Horse was like, was that what not a different Crazy Horse was.

[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.940]
Crazy Horse was discained about 168 or 9 or something like that. Something like that. Yeah.

[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.380]
A mail strip club. Right. Well yeah, surely tweeters used to talk about that all the time.

[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.900]
Surely tweeters. Then became a psychic, became a whatever it held she. What was the name?

[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.000]
Yeah, no. That's the only name. I don't watch the other.

[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.060]
That is clear. I keep my track of all these psychic names because once we start our psychic stock network line,

[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.840]
I don't want to mention no names, but once we start that, what is it? Nothing.

[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.460]
So anyway, that's pretty exciting. Mons Venus too, but I wouldn't get too excited because,

[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.600]
they'll probably be open about two, three weeks. They'll start busting all over the place.

[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.280]
For example, courthouse crackdown on Atlantis. There's more good news.

[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.220]
Oh! But the old farts in Fort Lauderdale and the powers that be never to be turned say,

[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.080]
well, we'll find some other way to do it, you know, the under run 21 thing.

[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.980]
Now what's the name of this guy? Mike Kent, not Norma Kent, but Mike Kent, owner of a club at Lannis.

[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.100]
He says the under 21 laws, the screw Atlantis ordinance. He says the city selectively

[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.960]
enforces it against him and he can prove it. He says, hopefully their coffers are deep enough

[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.780]
because I'll pay for the legal. The city is the opportunity to deal with businesses like this.

[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.340]
It's called condemnation or eminent domain. That's what they should be doing if they want to be

[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.140]
to the different purpose. Not even like that, but they're trying to put them out of business

[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.400]
because they don't want no whippersnappers over there. And it's been that way for a long time.

[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.420]
Ever since they decided to say bye bye bye to the spring breakers long, long time ago.

[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.340]
And then of course, you know, they'll say, we know this 19 year old kid that jumped out of the end

[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.220]
the pool and got killed a couple days ago. They'll say, see, there you go.

[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.780]
But the point is that, you know, that can happen anytime. I mean, used to happen a lot

[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.340]
because drunken college kids do a crazy thing. Yeah. So let's just throw the baby out with the

[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.820]
bad water, bath water, put everybody out of business. How about putting up some condos for old

[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.820]
people? How about you say right there in the beach and prime of beach from property? They already

[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.780]
did that down by the golf ocean mile all the way down there. They used to be really happening

[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.120]
apart of Fort Lauderdale Beach. Is it anymore? No. Old, geriatric, the creppant. Just like they did

[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.200]
out of Miami Beach many years ago when they turned all that beach front property over to the old

[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.400]
parts for those condos. So the median age there is death plus a hundred. Even if they brought

[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.720]
that if they took Meyer Lansky out of the box, he'd be like a teenager compared to most of the

[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.700]
people living there on columns out of it. So there you go. That's what they want. They like old

[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.860]
people. Okay, because on you young people you create too many problems. Too many drug problems,

[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.160]
too many people having a good time. Too many naked people running around too much flesh. We don't

[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.760]
like that here in South Florida. Too many fags, motticonis, all these things. Pete the chronic

[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.780]
border. Remember that song by Peter Paul Merri? Pete the chronic border. So whatever happened with

[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.500]
puffed eddies, did we get a didn't get a bird fear? No, I guess they don't look too good like they're

[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.720]
going to nail him though. Because they said the case against him is just like the case against

[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.960]
Joe Carroio week week like that tee he was brilliant like Al Martino's voice and the godfather

[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.520]
being a man. So anyway, Pete the chronic border. Facts that sends me these pictures of where his

[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.780]
kid goes to school. I mean this is embarrassing. These are like portable, yeah, portable, they call

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.280]
them. I call them like quonset huts, shacks, the sugar shack without the sugar. Look at that.

[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.960]
No turlits, no nothing. There was a fags that here somewhere with it or a letter. Whatever it

[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.880]
is, I got so much crap here I can't keep track of the crap. Including that caustic fags about

[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.880]
your good friend, Rimmer. Rimmer the psychic hockey nut. Oh here it is. It says here I hope the tax

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.840]
dollars, here's the tax dollars that work my son goes to school here, Flanagan High in Pemberpine,

[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.100]
ninth grade annex. All portapoddies, the entire f-ing school he says of this grace.

[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.100]
And Frank Motek said hello. I don't Frank wherever you are. I guess he's on the west coast.

[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.020]
So thanks Pete the chronic border off because that's a, there you go, and does anybody care? No.

[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.600]
And I'll pay the reason they care. Marlon's head for the river. What a guy. I love that headline in

[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.760]
the Sun, Central, Marlon's head for the river. Don't jump too soon John Henry Bud. Bye bye bye.

[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.360]
I will send you an anchor. Two great pieces of news from Tallahassee speaking about panel

[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.960]
defeats limits on class size of course because it would cost two billion dollars you know because

[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.020]
they'd have to build new schools and all of that. And right beneath that Senate budget be stores cut

[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:31.360]
to education. But somewhere along the line we're going to come up with like a billion dollars

[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.840]
for John Henry so we can build another billionaire a play toy because it's going to cost about 400

[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.160]
million for the stadium itself. And then the city supposedly if they go ahead with this thing

[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.120]
is going to cost land acquisition construction related expenses could run as high as five

[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.420]
or twenty one million dollars. So it's really going to be like you know close to a billion by the

[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:55.340]
time they get done. Always is with all the cost overruns etc. And is John Henry putting that money

[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.700]
out? No. No. What spend a billion dollars? We've got kids going to school in portaporties. We

[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.940]
can't afford to limit the class sizes because that's going to cost money that we don't have and we

[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.340]
got to cut make all kinds of cutbacks especially on education. This state man is a freaking disgrace.

[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.740]
But I don't want to get started on the Friday with negativity. Do we want to do that? Yeah.

[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.780]
We don't want to do that. Let's keep it light. Keep it happy. Okay. Keep them laugh and keep them smiling

[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.100]
especially with us. Just like yesterday. Look at that. Look at that phone.

[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.300]
See what I mean? I was thinking about coming to work this morning. This is like squeezing blood out

[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.500]
of a bullying ball. Well we already had a couple calls this morning saying what? They wanted basketball scores.

[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.860]
Yeah even blood comes in here. Muff comes in this morning and Muff is not in the area again by the way.

[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.700]
What? The bad thing that's the guy. QAM sport line. Oh no I want to talk to Neil. Oh speaking.

[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.860]
Hey Neil. Yeah that was a joke. Are you are you still looking for a good chocolate malthad?

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.700]
Am I looking for it? Well you were talking about a chocolate malthad. I'm still looking for it.

[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.100]
Not necessarily the malthad. Yeah. Okay well maybe you can get that too. Why the Johnny rocket

[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.260]
be surprised they actually make a good chocolate malthad. What is that? There's one in the fall that's a chain.

[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.700]
There's a half in the place. What is it? It's a chain. It's like a 50 hamburgers chain.

[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.480]
Johnny rockets. I know there's one that there's one in the falls. I know that there's one.

[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.980]
Well I'm not going to the falls for a chocolate malthad. Well I'm thinking I have them in the other.

[00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.830]
They have them in the other. I'm taking another stock tip from rumor. I'd have to be institutionalized if I did that.

[00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.690]
Seriously. Yeah but they do have it. I think there's one up even in the sawgrass.

[00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.510]
Oh is there in the sawgrass? I think there's a Johnny rocket. What?

[00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:46.330]
Car wash. Yeah no no car wash. Can't afford it. Okay we'll find out. Thanks a lot pal.

[00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.930]
Okay. Okay. Oh I guess what I have very bad news though. See I don't want to start unloading all

[00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.250]
the bad news you know. All of the good news. Mond venus is coming out. A lot of guys may be coming

[00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:00.390]
but you better do it fast because they'll close it down. But the bad news is that they got the drive

[00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:05.770]
through it. My stake in check there by the sawgrass. All scharches in the drive through part.

[00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.570]
Inside they got like you know nice white young people in there but I guess maybe probably for me

[00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.670]
because they don't want me talking about any memes on here and checking them name tags out which I

[00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.010]
won't. I mean they're very nice people and they're very efficient. They give you the right order.

[00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.230]
You don't order cheeseburger with onion and wine. I'm getting a chicken sandwich with mayonnaise and

[00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.210]
lettuce. I mean you know which is what the forechers have done to most of the fasts who joins

[00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:32.110]
especially like a Wendy's in Burger King. Anybody in this audience ever to go through the drive

[00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.090]
through and Wendy's in Burger King in the last year or two and get what you ordered. No.

[00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:41.890]
Never happened. Ever. It's like as you know American airlines ever arrived anywhere on time in the

[00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:47.630]
last five years. They had a great piece on the MSNBC last night about the airlines and what are

[00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.350]
the scrapes all the stuff that's going on and the delta they rip them and ask did you see a thing

[00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:56.330]
about Midwest what is it called and they ripped America worse too which I love you see that crappy

[00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:02.450]
guy at the counter that would attitude Midwest cheese which I would never fly because we don't live

[00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.850]
in the Midwest. It doesn't go anywhere we go. They get you by the balls and they know what they

[00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.850]
act like. So I luck you know the one really great domestic airline is that Midwest something

[00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:16.850]
or somebody will call them and we're not going on it because it's not for us. That's a price you

[00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:22.950]
pay for being here in this goddamn place. Don't start on that negative let's be a positive okay it's

[00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.390]
St. Paties they coming up tomorrow let's all march in the parade let's all mince in you do our

[00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.690]
little leprechaun thing put on those yeah put on those tights all those good heterosexual Irishman

[00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:49.030]
It's like these little green mushrooms quick let's get them. You got the kinky charm.

[00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.410]
Oh no no no stop. Yeah.

[00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:40.310]
Oh we got the little kinky charm. I hate the Irish. Yeah that's what I'm supposed to say.

[00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:46.110]
Boy this thing is they're getting temperamental. 10, 16 at 5, 60 W to QM Subaru and W to QM

[00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:51.970]
present our 2001 college hoops hysteria contest. Do we care about this. I started to say before

[00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.290]
muff comes in here and he started talking to me about the oh yeah these college basketball games but

[00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:02.070]
I love it when he's underdogs. I said I don't really care. No interest. Don't care.

[00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.730]
No I don't. I just don't care about it anymore. I just have no interest. I'm not going to fake it.

[00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.850]
College terminal terminal. Just like I'm in the car last time going to the store and I got the

[00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.610]
booster on orange head and he said oh the 12 beat the five. Yeah yeah you know he's doing

[00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:25.090]
this the Rock and Roll DJ sports crapper. The 12 beat the five. I thought I was listening to the

[00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.870]
fat rich. Oh I had the four over the 278 and the seven made a brick in a stretch and pay me a

[00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:34.050]
jump over the hub rail and while you pulled back and you know the 12 beat the five. Aren't you

[00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:41.170]
impressed by that? Don't you want to know that? That the 12 beat the five? Come on you you know

[00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:46.150]
stop being such a god damn hard to ask. Well yeah you better you know loosen your load a little

[00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:51.350]
bit. Yeah I shouldn't have to say that to him. I've never seen anybody take a crap more than this

[00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:56.710]
man. Seriously you for a little guy you crap more than anybody I've known in my life a lot. Yeah

[00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.530]
and you don't even have irritable bowel. Maybe we're developing irritable bowel from eating all

[00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:05.710]
that garbage speaking of crap that PD Laney brings in here. I never eat anything that he brings in.

[00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:10.390]
Yeah but you have don't you remember the day they were like for hours and then when Homer is

[00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.770]
still watching you chapter three I learned for yeah I learned my lesson and then he brings you

[00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.250]
those six. Now let me ask you this talk about I don't want to say because today he's in the

[00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:22.090]
Williams hardly. He's getting his thing removed or whatever. He's getting some kind of a nodule

[00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.290]
removed. So I know we wish him the best of luck on that and maybe the work on his brain two of

[00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:32.250]
they can find it. But he brings in these syrups these low cal I said well what the hell is that for

[00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:38.910]
ice cream or what's the point of putting low cal I syrups on ice cream. That's like it in the small

[00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:44.950]
diet soda with a banana split. I mean well yeah what's the point of that. Jesus Christ PD Laney

[00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:50.370]
I mean do you have any brains at all. Oh yeah and then so anyway he put those two big containers

[00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.410]
of the stuff and sure enough I come in yesterday morning which I begged him get that stuff out of

[00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.470]
here we don't want it and I look on the list the first ingredient in both of the water and the

[00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:09.990]
second one is soba tall soba tall yeah so they both went where they belong in the Schmidt

[00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:16.850]
can. I thought at least one of them was chocolate but they were and had something to do with

[00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:22.110]
chocolate yeah but not the kind you're thinking about. Subaru and WQM presents our 2001

[00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:47.830]
hard cash courtesy of Subaru in sports radio 560 QAM see the reason I have to read this a lot is

[00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.530]
because I'm sure they promise to Subaru people a lot of life plugs on the air like our sales department

[00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:55.750]
probably charged them an arm and leg for it yeah probably they're not going to get anything

[00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.150]
else in return because that's one of the big scams that our sales department loves to do like

[00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.410]
during that golf tournament you know that's probably why they were asking me to make air checks

[00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:08.730]
of your reading of that are you serious yes are you sure you don't know so they can prove to

[00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.950]
the client that they actually got some mentions on it well you should told me that before we came

[00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:17.270]
on here and I could have read it off the air you could have taped it why would that be different

[00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.990]
than some of the other oh I'm sorry no I know then instead of reading it on the air see here's

[00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:31.050]
the tape of it like that proves I read it on the air being my voice right so anyway thanks

[00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.670]
Rick for the good news about Mond the penis or whatever that thing is going to be up there in

[00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.910]

[00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.970]
military trail power line no no no in uh pompano the word the what's the name of that place

[00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:58.370]
then the titty bar up there in the pop it up here the cheetah 3 that's one are there any like white

[00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.110]
people alive in that neighborhood no I mean a lot of white customers I see you know driving

[00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:06.290]
in that place I don't see any white that's a neighborhood that that's the hood maybe that'd be the

[00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:11.590]
hood I thought it was just like industrial what a great lead into our poll question today great

[00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:19.450]
poll which group of people destroy a neighborhood the fastest I don't think that'll be a tough poll

[00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:27.230]
the polls the Irish well I give it the ones I have on my list and I'm trying to like you know make

[00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.790]
the list as broad as possible so that because if we make it too narrow it's like I'm trying to

[00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.790]
lead people in a wrong direction down the garden path down the promos lane

[00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:42.690]
which group of people destroy a neighborhood the fastest Cubans African-Americans

[00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.310]
Haitians Jews or Gays

[00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.550]
but those are the only ones that could think to put on you got to put like you know red necks on

[00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.350]
there trailer park trash right next okay red necks good yeah we got to make this as broad as

[00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.470]
possible because otherwise people say oh you see you're picking on you know certain people again

[00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.490]
I don't know what the result is going to be do we don't have a whole lot of Italians down here but

[00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.850]
there are Italians don't ruin neighborhoods or you put people on there that don't ruin neighborhoods

[00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:16.290]
like Gays yeah but but there's no prejudice against don't you understand there is no

[00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:22.310]
prejudice against the Italians generally oh and speaking of that and unprecedented ecological

[00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.970]
battle between the Vatican and Italy heated up on Friday when the Italian environment minister

[00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.910]
Willie Borden will or Borden boarded the cut off the electricity supply to Vatican radio

[00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.870]
Vatican radio which has been charged with raking Italian laws on electromagnetic levels

[00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.890]
said it was astonished by the threat which would effectively pull the plug on the station

[00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:48.410]
which broadcast Pope John Paul's words around the world how do you like that all right if within

[00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.170]
15 days the broadcast it does not get backed on under the limits of a lord of the national

[00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.650]
electricity provider the suspense of flight of the transmission set his board and told a news conference

[00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.650]
if the supply continued to provide electricity it too would be held responsible for committing

[00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.910]
your crime Vatican radio broadcast the Pope's propaganda I mean speeches and events to the world

[00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:11.510]
in some 40 languages from a huge forest of antennae north of Rome or some groups have reported that

[00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:16.810]
normally high levels of cancer oh just a coincidence I guess the transmission center like Vatican

[00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.550]
city itself in the center of Rome is on extraterritorial land and considered part of a sovereign state

[00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.650]
maybe that's why he and Fidel got along so well they both like pumping up you know those big

[00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:31.090]
transmitters and jam and 80 billion watts of propaganda Borden said the national agency for the

[00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.950]
protect of the environment had registered three times Italy's legal limit of electromagnetic

[00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:40.350]
magnetism during one of Vatican radio's evening broadcast Italy has slapped strict regulations on

[00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.850]
any mission levels the tightest in the European Union after Vatican radio had been set up 44 years ago

[00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:50.030]
how do you like that so they might cut off his water Gord Scort and his power too good what do

me as possible well I mean not necessarily but just from our hood which group of people destroy

[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:33.280]

about ill sink or the mile one will find out here's a call in western hello good morning yes sir

[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.080]
you know first of all use your psychic abilities once again you mentioned that George

[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.380]
I put a little guy spend a lot of time running off there to the red zone yeah he does

[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:19.260]
and now are you are we sure that it's just not that he's full of Schmidt or B that he's really

[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.500]
going there to go to the bathroom I don't know what he's doing in there but he sure spends a lot

[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.460]
of time in the twirling all right well that brings me to the top news story as I turn on

[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:32.580]
channel seven news this morning by mistake yes was the broken sewer pipe at the mouth of the

[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:39.300]
mime river any coincidence with the fact that they suggested mime river locations I must be

[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.640]
crazy I must be not wow maybe he's opening up the concession stands already and that's you

[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.780]
know he's just figuring public law and sewage is about the same deal here yeah so that that

[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.380]
always at least this miss don't cost us all that money well that's right and it's interesting

[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.600]
you know they were talking about how all these spring breakers you know that are down you know

[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.920]
any Julia Tettle set they're trying to close beaches Julia Tettle South but I figure first of all

[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.400]
those kids they'll have no clue anyway because they'll be such drunk by the time they get out to

[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.720]
the beach anyhow they won't recognize it we don't want any young people here don't make any

[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.660]
mistake about it so far to hate young people who live here the ones who visit here we hate young

[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:20.300]
punks we can't stand and we want nice old people who are safe we'll just shovel a crap

[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.540]
light up on the beach just to keep them away for that now we'll just let the old people lose

[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:28.820]
out there with a clasmini bags when in doubt squeeze it out you mentioned you're also mentioning

[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:34.580]
how or we'll just send them over the mimey river to the bank there you go but the NCAA tournament

[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.260]
which of course is a huge sporting event no interest you are sports radio you know how you have

[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:45.200]
no interest intensive but look at the hypocrisy about you know how the NCAA comes out and

[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.480]
how they have this big issue about how they really don't want to promote gambling for college

[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:57.720]
sports yeah yeah they're offering free email and pager and authentic americ digital phone

[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:03.340]
updates of scores now who needs to get a picture oh that's only for serious fans that are

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:09.040]
considered out for school yeah people who want to know what the scores it has right not because

[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.420]
they might have you know a couple of bucks on the game or something like that but and then I'm

[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:18.720]
actually I'm kind of hiding in my house over here you know you have a timer on my sprinkler system

[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.500]
right the time on the sprinkler system hasn't worked for months and so I have to go out and early

[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:29.000]
in the morning yeah if you want to do it manually manually exactly so now they restricted it to

[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.680]
Monday and Wednesdays for the for the address you know that I'm odd number address or whatever

[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.380]

[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:48.880]
Friday so all of a sudden my sprinkler's going off this morning when I you know but at a wrong time

[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.740]
exactly at a wrong time because the thing hasn't worked and the timer's all screwed up as I'm

[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.960]

[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:25.240]
don't ever try to time the market that's what he said just sit tight as painful as it may be

[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:32.900]

[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:31.820]
general I think it's I'm gonna say it's unfair but I'm saying that if we're gonna put all

[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:37.520]
different nationalities we might as well put in the Pakistanis and the orientals but we don't have

[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.680]
but well why would orientals ruin the neighborhood I mean Asian they're not they're not but the

[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:48.340]
thing is that we all don't have a poll that is what I'm west they uh how'd that but we don't have

those earthquakes in California there's like too much weight you know like on a plane

[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.980]
although I understand that many of the people in San Francisco float so if your toes are done

[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:08.840]
Thurman Gibson buddy Bommar that's it now we're gonna start doing old bowling guys

[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.800]

[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:28.560]
must be nuts

[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.880]
I guess

[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.080]
I

[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.080]

[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.440]
you

[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.760]

it's wrong me

[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.340]
new language

[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.260]
but it's terra

[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.920]
I'm richer than I was before

[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.900]
Every day is beyond the shore

[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.260]
The gift will follow me right to the shore

[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.560]
Yes!

[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.380]
I am richer!

[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.260]
Then any minor ought to be

[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.000]
Hey, hey!

[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.380]
Way to go, that's the go

[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.980]
Don't care if it's things like this

[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.120]
Oh, oh, oh

[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.340]
Here's your moon like me, you're drinking

[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:50.140]
Every day, until I'm richer than God can tell

[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:54.040]
On top of the ocean, in the shell

[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:59.300]
The poison that you just increased my way

[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.040]
Uh-huh

[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:07.120]
I am richer than all of you

[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.300]
Please don't drink any thousand new

[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:17.000]
There's a fancy no-go, gas in on high school

[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.480]
Wreck them

[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.780]
I am richer!

[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.120]
1047 at 560 WQM, or Boer is here's a thanks Don Carter

[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.340]
I'm sorry, I haven't had anybody for good Don Carter

[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.700]
About half the bowling elies in the American named after Old Don

[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.820]
Johnny Patraglie, which I never heard him

[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.560]
Here's one that I just remembered, Buzz Faisal

[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.420]
I don't remember him, sure, old Boers

[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.580]
Drought hammered Florida's marijuana crop

[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.000]
Here's some very bad news for you

[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.700]
But I started moving into what you make in neighborhood, man

[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.900]
Drug eradication efforts got a boost from Mother Nature in Florida

[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.420]
Where a severe drought has stunted the illegal marijuana crop

[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.040]
The Florida FDLE set on Tuesday

[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.360]
Law Enforcement Agency sees 39,000, 219 marijuana plants

[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.140]
We're 39.2 million dollars from around the state in 2000

[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.540]
About 30% less than the previous year in the lower number in 20 years

[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.580]
If you think you're having trouble keeping your lawn alive

[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.380]
Imagine trying to covertly water an entire marijuana plot

[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.680]
After your lead agent David Broadway told the Orlando Sentinel

[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.860]
David Broadway

[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.620]
Mother Nature has played a big part in the scarcity of the domestic crop this year

[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.420]
He said meteorologists said 2000 was the driest year on record in Florida

[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.760]
Where most residents are under water use restrictions out there burning bands and wildfire alerts

[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.420]
Marijuana plants generally have short roots and need lots of water Broadway said

[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.520]
I got short roots, I can relate to that

[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.040]
92 votes already in our survey and our survey says

[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.580]
Which group of people destroy a neighborhood the fastest?

[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.460]
I mean like lightning, like Greece lightning

[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.860]
92 votes, African Americans have 42

[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:59.000]
Rednecks 11, Haitians 10, Puerto Rican 7, Cuban 6, Jamaican 6, Orthodox Jews 6

[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.500]
Yays 3, Nicaraguan 1 and Mexicans

[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.720]
They don't have any Mexicans here

[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.060]
They're in Leisure City, Homestead, Parade

[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.920]
Let them move their soul

[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.540]
Huge plants of them, well they're not

[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.380]
Pick and grapes, they didn't start as red

[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.400]
What is parade?

[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.880]
Tomatoes, strawberries

[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.580]
Well somebody's got to do it

[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.000]
No, we don't have any Mexicans here, I think you're making that up

[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.800]
The 500 people called in there

[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.980]
Well then they must be nice neighbors because they don't have any votes on here now

[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.200]
Actually?

[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.120]
Yeah, I mean they're safe neighbors

[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.040]
They invite you over from a refined bean or two here and there

[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.320]
They're not going to commit crime on you

[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.780]
Generally speaking

[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.440]
Are they safe?

[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.360]
They're safe

[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.620]
See I'm going to tell you right now we need to bring in bus roads to Chinese people

[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.880]
Okay, no, why not?

[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.860]
They're safe, I like Chinese

[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.100]
I love Chinese, let's play it, will you want to play it?

[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.080]
No, sorry Rick

[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:58.040]
Seriously, Chinese people are wonderful people in there like ethics and morality

[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.660]
And like, any other Chinese gangs like there's gangs and everything like punks

[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:07.440]
But generally speaking, the Chinese are very educated and polite and very generalizing

[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.300]
What?

[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:08.640]
What?

[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.740]
What about the city, Chinese?

[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.680]
The rural Chinese are very backwards and antiquated

[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.120]
No, I'm talking about Chinese people who come here

[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.980]
I'm not talking about Chinese in China

[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.220]
What rural Chinese people are being oppressed and getting those

[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.980]
What rural Chinese like in Montana?

[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.920]
Where are you talking about?

[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.480]
It's huge

[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.620]
But when I talk about Chinese people in rural China, they're not coming here

[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.320]
No, they're not

[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.120]
Okay

[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.240]
The rural Chinese people are the ones who come here

[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.280]
Large portions of them, yes

[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.960]
And open up all these great Chinese restaurants?

[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.720]
Not in them

[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.840]
Oh, well what do they do?

[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.400]
You haven't seen any of those reports on the West Coast that what they do what they do is to case

[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.640]
Wait, wait, wait, on the West Coast

[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.480]
Right

[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.580]
We're not talking about here

[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.500]
We have barely any here

[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.980]
That's what I'm saying, I said we need to bring in bus roads of nice Chinese people

[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.120]
Not to kind of like sewer rats you're talking about whoever they are

[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:02.940]
That's not what I'm talking about

[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.200]
Which is most of the Chinese people, those are the refugees

[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.780]
Overware in the West Coast

[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.200]
Well, all the drags around the West Coast, you know?

[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.600]
They're hell with them, let's worry about us

[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.680]
They eat tiger balls

[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.860]
Well, they're so there's something good there

[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.960]
Somebody's got to eat tiger balls

[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.220]
Yeah, maybe they like golf, I don't know

[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.740]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pot

[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.560]
No, seriously, we could use tons of Chinese people here

[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.300]
And they're very friendly

[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.960]
A little upside in the beginning but once you loosen them up a little

[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.720]
No, seriously, of course, I don't want to get into it

[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.080]
109 votes so far and African Americans are running away

[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.700]
No, actually it's the white people that are running away

[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.720]
From all of the above

[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.480]
See, that's bad

[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.060]
But you can call us bigoted in all these other things

[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.400]
But see people don't move out of a neighborhood just because they're afraid of

[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.560]
They're afraid that their property value is going to go down

[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.160]
The quality of life is going to go down

[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.220]
It's going to be crime, it's going to turn into a toilet

[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.700]
That's why people move out

[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.580]
And then other people point the thing

[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.420]
They say, hey, you be a bigoted man, you be bad

[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.000]
And of course, that's not true necessarily

[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.560]
Kind of like a chicken in the air question

[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.080]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pot 5, 60 on the AT&T

[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.240]
A very weak response, you're on a phone today about anything

[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.020]
These people are in law, law land again

[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.600]
I got such a headache, it was for me that I'm with this morning

[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.120]
That thing was crap

[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.180]
I'm with this man

[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:20.360]
What?

[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.280]
Hey, I don't care, it may get so sweat off my ass

[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.080]
I don't need no omelette, I can buy all of them

[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.720]
I don't need anything anyway

[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.480]
Keep drinking all those milkshakes, some steak and shake

[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.500]
Or they have the sparsers and the drive-through

[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.960]
You see how it's kind of like a spreading thing?

[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.600]
I don't want to sound like some kind of old bigoted racist here on the air

[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.440]
But I mean, isn't there any place where they're like just white people besides Denmark?

[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.100]
No, no, you don't know what I'm talking about

[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.780]
And cork evils, I mean, there's got to be some place else

[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:49.680]
Mm-hmm, where?

[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.260]
Montana

[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.100]
No, I'm talking about a place where people would want to be

[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.840]
I mean, you could say the North Pole

[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.660]
I don't want to be in Montana, maybe you want to be in Montana

[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.900]
Don't, well don't this shall be Montana

[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.700]
No, not shelter

[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.120]
And I'm going to do this

[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.420]
You'll see all of those relatives up there with the orange hairy

[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.560]
Why would you be in the library?

[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.160]
With tumble rhymes with Mary

[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.140]
You got to get to the mountains

[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.020]
Here's the mobile implantation, hello

[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:11.840]
Hello?

[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.980]
Yes, how are you?

[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:13.480]
Great

[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.720]
You're the only guy that talks to Anas on the air, I never called before

[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.340]
I remember I only been listening for a week

[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:18.860]
Really?

[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:19.360]
Yes

[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:20.920]
But I love your show

[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.620]
Of course

[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.700]
I got a few questions

[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.220]
Sure

[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.040]
Why are our blacks better in sports?

[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.140]
Why are they better in sports?

[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.660]
Well, I don't know because they've been learning to train to run fast

[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.900]
Because they've been chased a lot, you know?

[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.940]
Back during the days when they had the lynchings

[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.340]
We taught them how to run like a mother

[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.400]
When you were speaking last week

[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.240]
Like I said, only been listening for a week, right?

[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.480]
You thought I told them to ship it back to Africa?

[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:43.580]
I love that

[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.920]
I'm not saying we should do it, I'm saying I love it

[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.680]
Sure, sure you are, you're saying we gotta do it

[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.840]
I see, I see, I see, I said it, but you don't have the balls to sail

[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.400]
What I'm saying

[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.640]
We have a lot of black people on the ground

[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.840]
We have a lot of black people listening to the show

[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.180]
And the people who listen to the show

[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.300]
And the people who listen to the show they can stay here

[00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.740]
And as long as they're nice, we'll interview them

[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.260]
And if they're friendly and nice, they can stay

[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.260]
But all the rest of them, I mean, it's just one of those things

[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.460]
We don't have room for them here, and they multiply too fast

[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.380]
Well, anyway, I love your show

[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.740]
Like I said, I've been listening for only for one week

[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.260]
But I've been listening every day since

[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.000]
There you go

[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.340]
Can I get a ticket, I'll tell you a joke?

[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.700]
No, we don't do jokes, but have a great weekend, get out of here

[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:17.660]
No, do jokes

[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.280]
On the fact that we do jokes so I can preview them

[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.720]
And if they're amusing, all I do

[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.440]
Midwest Express is the name of that airline

[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.360]
I was trying to think of earlier, I forgot to mention that

[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.040]
Corn MSNBC, it's a great airline, does it fly anywhere here?

[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:29.220]
No

[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.280]
Does it do anything good for us unless you're in the Midwest?

[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:31.560]
No

[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.160]
But it's a great airline, and they serve great food like I'm real China

[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:34.800]
Even in coach

[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.400]
I think if I caught the drift of that piece last night

[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.080]
They don't even have a first class, everything is first class

[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.460]
It's all the same

[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:47.340]
Big wide seats, great service, fancy, shmancy food

[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.180]
Silverware like real China, real silver

[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.100]
And then they showed Delta, but they got the Maturell mix

[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.760]
You know, I mean, that's just

[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.460]
And what's the other one that they call the, not the happy meal

[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.380]
But the little box, I think that's Delta, maybe it's American

[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.560]
Where the porcelainers in coach they have the fun pack

[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.280]
Now there's something in the light light, it's something

[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.640]
Yeah, the uptruck lunch

[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.500]
And a little box, and as you're getting on a plane, the people in coach

[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.020]
They have to take this little box

[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.820]
Here it is, we just charge you like 800 bucks to fly 200 miles

[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.520]
And here's a box with some steel crackers in it and a couple of nuts

[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.480]
Which you already bought my own, thank you

[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.120]
And what the hell is that?

[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.020]
Kind of garbage is that

[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.700]
Soking a guy damn public, you airline people, you suck

[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.120]
That's what I just want to say right now

[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.040]
There's some good airlines like my friends in here in Canada

[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.720]
And Martin, Skirr and a couple of others, although those are not domestic airlines

[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.580]
Is there really a good domestic airline beside Missile at Winwood Express?

[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.080]
Which I never heard of till last night, I'll have to take their word for it

[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.920]
You know, I'll have to assume it's the MSNBC

[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.660]
But is there really such a thing?

[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.820]
I mean, getting placed on the, I'm not getting on the airline for great food

[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.660]
Because it's not going to happen anyway, unless you're flying alitalia in first class

[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:07.620]
Not even business class anymore, in first class, for like, you know, 8 grand or something

[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.660]
Forget about it

[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.320]
Because it's all a monopoly, it's all crap

[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.540]
And they have all these, they bring on all these shows and all those

[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:17.940]
It's a box

[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.540]
Thank you, the B-strow box

[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.360]
Thank you, Woody Graber

[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.900]
Because I call it the barfstrow box is what I call it

[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.480]
The B-strow bag

[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.600]
The B-strow bag

[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.260]
Oh, God

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:33.020]
And be sure to take your B-strow bag with that wonderful food in it

[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.260]
Before you go back and sit those little tiny seats that were, you know, invented for five-year-old kids with tiny asses

[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.560]
Oh, Jesus

[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:46.580]
But I have a very few complaints because like I said, I've been very lucky flying mostly international carriers

[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:48.560]
And most of them are pretty good

[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.840]
I mean, Martin Air Force, cheap as they are, I got to tell you they're pretty good

[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.700]
I've had, you know, a couple of first-wing experiences

[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.960]
But generally speaking, it's one who flies about four million times a year

[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.880]
I have few complaints

[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.900]
But what he's domestic here is like America worst they should only have wicked diarrhea for about six months

[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.740]
And the B-G should be right there with him too

[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.740]
It's Friday, you best, kids

[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.700]
Feeling down in blue, I all knew Devin's orders

[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:20.040]
Putting sun, brown suit, yellow shirt, surprisingly I'll lose her jacket

[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.980]
Oh, that's right, cool man

[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.080]
Hey, is that ground up, cloveries?

[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.320]
It's right from the pastures with cocky corks

[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.820]
Wee, colleagues, how's your cork kind of this?

[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.000]
Hey, man, your stuff is great

[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.760]
Is that a leopard gun on the ceiling, man?

[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.800]
Why are you kidding?

[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.300]
And that's another one, another one, I don't know, number one two

[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.640]
Hey, I think you're right, man, the place is proud of you with him

[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.460]
I knew Sterblin's going

[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.320]
Amazingly, how do you feel about getting a cash?

[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.280]
Love it, I wanted five-sixty WQM, we got Jim Mad Dog, man

[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.880]
Yeah, and for Hanky to the sand, and for Hank's author in Vegas

[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.260]
Ostensibly for the NCAA's, but of course the flunges brains out and have a great time, I'm sure he is

[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.380]
Gaudi, I'm game light, hard rock, half-aid, six

[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.240]
Panther preview at seven o'clock tonight, the penguins in a panthers

[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.980]
That game looks like it'll be the only cell out of the year

[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.140]
Are they going to see the panthers?

[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.220]
No, they're going to see Meriel

[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.780]
Eddie Kaye after the hockey game

[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.420]
Am I going to that game tonight?

[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:11.720]
No

[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:12.080]
No

[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.380]
A man once had an extremely bad case of hemorrhoids

[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.340]
He decided to go to the doctor and prescribe him some tablets to take

[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.840]
However said the doctor because this is such a severe case of hemorrhoids

[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.340]
These tablets will have to be given aimally

[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.100]
Correct them

[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.060]
Thus said the doctor gave the patient the tablet via the anus

[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:34.260]
Also you'll have to have another one today at seven o'clock, another one every 12 hours for the next week

[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.780]
The man thanked the doctor and went home

[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.300]
At seven o'clock his real friend was at his house, he asked her if she could give him the pill

[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.880]
She agreed and placed one hand on the boyfriend's shoulder and gave him the pill

[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.720]
Was that the man promptly screamed?

[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.900]
Are you okay honey? Did it hurt that much?

[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.320]
No, it didn't hurt reply the man I just realized when the doctor gave me the pill and he put two hands on my shoulders

[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.020]
Correct them

[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:56.680]
Exactly

[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.120]
5,670560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless blind

[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.340]
Don't forget one more time for this because parents are good upset

[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.440]
Even though I have absolutely no interest but our friends at Subaru do

[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.680]
Subaru and WQM presents our 2001 college hoops hysteria contest

[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.480]
Are you hysterical?

[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:13.680]
No

[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.320]
Long on to www.commonstartmakingyourselections for days around one game to the NCAA tournament

[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.480]
You have fuel noon today to get your first round Friday picks in

[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:26.060]
Prizes will be given away after each round of the grand prize winner walks away with $1,000 in cash

[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.800]
courtesy of Subaru and sports radio WQM

[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.880]
I'm sure that Subaru is giving away like $995 and we're giving away like maybe $5

[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.960]
So you're probably going to get the $995 real quick and the other $5

[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.080]
Don't hold your breath

[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.620]
Here's Poppano, hello

[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.980]
Hey Neil how you doing?

[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:43.260]

[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:48.440]
Real quick couple of old timers, Common Selvino and Billy Wailu

[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.280]
Right very good

[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.180]
Yeah I think Billy Wailu is dead I believe

[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.240]
I think so

[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.020]
Neil I was reading yesterday and you might say good at the moment

[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.340]
I think Common Selvino is dead too as a matter of fact but anyway

[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.460]
I was reading yesterday's paper USA Today

[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.920]
Did you hear about the poor guy out in Las Vegas with the slot machine?

[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:05.500]
No

[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.240]
Well he was out there and he was playing this progressive slot machine with a fly bigger

[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.660]
And what happened is his friend asked him a question and he turned and he pulled a rubber

[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.240]
And he came up and he hit the mega bucks mega bucks

[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.260]
Right

[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.220]
Only to fight when the manager came that you know how you have to put in

[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.100]
You know what maximum?

[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:27.200]
Oh no no no no no no no no no

[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.540]
Yeah he only put in two coins instead of three

[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:30.780]
So you don't put a wire line?

[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.760]
He would have won seven and a half million and steady one ten thousand

[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:34.780]
Oh

[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.540]
Because he didn't put in three coins

[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.580]
Because his friend interfered in the

[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.420]
And he struck them

[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.340]
You know and if I didn't open it

[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.420]
You know what I would do to his friend?

[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.060]
Yeah

[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.060]
Just like somebody gives you a bad stock this

[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.300]
Or turns you out to a bad stock broker

[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.480]
Neil if I didn't like it at least

[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.960]
If I didn't know that I said a deep old coach

[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.920]
I would have thought it was a deep old cap one out there

[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.300]
Probably

[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.740]
But you know and if I had to get you know hands out this

[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.600]
I hope it wasn't Hank

[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.300]
I'm sure not

[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.640]
But you know what I really had to say to you

[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.000]
Okay thanks for good news

[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:02.360]
Okay

[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.500]
Hank would know where to stick it in

[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.540]
Can you imagine that?

[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.020]
I like it

[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.120]
I mean talk about stupid

[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.360]
You'll see people playing the wheel of fortune slots out there

[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.460]
And in order to have a chance to get the wheel

[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.140]
You have to have all three coins in

[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.540]
And they're putting in two coins or one coin

[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.860]
Are we ever going to get any spins?

[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.760]
What's wrong with this guy dancing there

[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.160]
And they're sticking the money in there

[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.820]
And like you know

[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.160]
Milan, dumb

[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.300]
It says right on the machines

[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.800]
You know, spin on the third wheel

[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.840]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh God

[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.040]
Not that many smarter because I'm out there playing the slots

[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.440]
Anyone just as dumb as they are

[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.900]
Plunging my brains out

[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.640]
But at least I'm having a good time

[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.800]
Unlike that stock market

[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.120]
Take another precipitous drop today

[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:47.740]
But I don't care

[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.140]
Nothing I can do about it

[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.180]
Just sit back, be philosophical

[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:51.880]
Don't try to time the market

[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.260]
And don't buy bonds

[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.200]
Now seriously, according to this book

[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.000]
Stocks outperform bonds and cash

[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.540]
Buy like a zillion times over the years

[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.160]
That's what it says

[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.860]
So if it turns out not to be two and three or four years

[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.000]
I'll just find a guy that wrote it

[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.240]
And just you know

[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.540]
Shoot him in the lake

[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.820]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood, hello

[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.200]
Hello, I want to give you the name of another old crime bowler

[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.260]
Blue sea laugh from the strobe team in Detroit

[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.460]
Never heard of him

[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.260]
And Fazio, Buzz Fazio and Lucila

[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.500]
From the strobe team

[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.980]
They used to give exhibitions on Sunday mornings

[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.880]
At the old Y7 in Detroit

[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.940]
And the old one drove

[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.640]
Great

[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:31.800]
That's it

[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.860]
Franklin Sears

[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.060]
5667-0560

[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.100]
And we're back to the harness drivers

[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:36.980]
And I can't do any of these names

[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.320]
And they don't know which is good

[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:38.920]
Confuse them

[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.640]
Keep them off balance

[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.400]
That's what I say

[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:41.820]
Who is that?

[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.260]
Some old guy, some old fart

[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.700]
Okay, here's our last call

[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.400]
It's from out of town

[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.560]
And it says Milwaukee, hello

[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.240]
Meal, happy Friday

[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.020]
Same deal

[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.160]
Hey, you're talking about Midwest Express

[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.780]
That's their hub up here in Milwaukee

[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.640]
It is the best airline you'll ever travel on

[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.960]
The seat, there is no first class

[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:02.320]
All the seats are the same

[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.360]
The same, the meals are actually good food

[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.140]
They sure got some great publicity on MSNBC last night

[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.260]
They did, they gave a free wine

[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.480]
I mean it just makes a happy flight

[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.140]
If I'm gonna fly over an hour

[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.380]
What do they do like fly from Chicago to Milwaukee or things like that?

[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.960]
No, they actually fly down to the Dallas

[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:25.080]
They're going to lay down to I think four Myers and maybe Miami

[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.740]
But it's only seasonally

[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.020]
I think they've canceled after Easter

[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.540]
They only run it from in the winter months

[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.780]
Kansas City, you know, they're throughout the Midwest

[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.140]
Honestly good, I mean it is the best airline you'll ever take

[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.260]
You're gonna fly over an hour, go Midwest Express

[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.560]
I guess I'll have to move there, huh?

[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:45.520]
Thanks for the good news

[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.600]
Why would you want a week paradise?

[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.840]
Yeah, that's your good point

[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.220]
Take care, Neil

[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:49.920]
Thanks, bye

[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.480]
Okay, we got 75,000 open lines here

[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.320]
I'm embarrassed for this audience again this week has been really bad

[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.300]
I feel like I've been this this week I've been yanking it, pulling it, squeezing it

[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.700]
And still can't get a response

[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.260]
What's wrong with these people? What is wrong with you folks?

[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:06.380]
Here's our last call lady, mobile and coral springs, hello

[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.140]
Hello

[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.240]
Yes, ma'am

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.280]
Yes, are you still doing the poll?

[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.300]
The data is doing

[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.940]
Yes, ma'am, we're still doing the poll

[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.240]
Who ruined the neighborhood?

[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.220]
Yes

[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.320]
Trailer park trash

[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.120]
Trailer park trash, red now

[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.300]
Okay, thanks for that

[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:24.560]
Okay

[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.360]
Trailer park trash, but then we got to have them around for the jury spring or show

[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.840]
Not a call on the board, baby, that's it, go home

[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.200]
I'm going home, I'm gonna go to the Midwest and get on the summer

[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.460]
Anywhere in the Midwest, hop on that Midwest Express airline and just keep flying around eating there you have good food

[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.120]
Just having a lot of wine

[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.560]
That's it, I'm just not taking any more calls today

[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.460]
I mean, what's the point of this? The show is over

[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.760]
This audience is dead

[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.260]
This has been remembered this happened yesterday, two like about 1035

[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.600]
Here it's like 10 after 11

[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.800]
And the cats got their tongue

[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.820]
Yeah, we're just tired of your crap, you know, we're just sick

[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.240]
Oh, Neal, what are we gonna do? You're gonna be leaving us soon, not yet, three years

[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.000]
You're gonna be doing it, what are we gonna do? I don't know, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do

[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.300]
I've worked this great UCD, let's just play the poll

[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.760]
Yeah, but don't you miss this during the summertime?

[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.260]
Yeah, I miss sitting around every day, a begging, pleading for people to say something, anything

[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.200]
Why, I just love them then

[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.420]
Hello, hello

[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.180]
Hi

[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.120]
Tonight on the WB, it's Buffy, the Leprecon Slayer

[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.980]
Hey, hey, that's not

[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.480]
I miss Tornin' you, that's not wrong

[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.760]
What are you doing? No, you're a vampire Slayer, not the Leprecon Slayer

[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.640]
Oh, what should I do?

[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.340]
You can stop punching me in the head

[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.300]
Buffy, the Leprecon Slayer

[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.840]
I'm broken my head

[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.620]
We're not supposed to move the body

[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.440]
1114, you know, somebody wants to describe the St. Patrick's Day

[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.380]
There's just another excuse for the Irish to get drunk, which I find ridiculous

[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:54.680]
because everybody knows the Irish don't need an excuse to get drunk, that's right

[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.380]
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T

[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:03.220]
I think somebody peed in my omelette this morning, you know, I'm staring like my eyes are watering

[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:07.360]
and I feel like, you know, my head is, oh, all congested

[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.760]
Either better, it's my Florida allergies

[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.920]
I'm allergic as hell to this place

[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.080]
How could you forget Earl Anthony says this one?

[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.360]
Oh, and not only that, that's right, another great bore

[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.180]
Oh, excuse me for blowing my nose on here, not supposed to blow it on here

[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.620]
Here's the thing

[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.920]
And they do fly to Fort Lauderdale like during the season, I guess

[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:32.520]
They fly that some Midwest Express Airlines, somebody factfully they're itinerary, the map

[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.540]
They fly from Milwaukee, that's their hub to San Francisco, to Las Vegas

[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.260]
You hear that?

[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.500]
So let's go to Milwaukee and get drunk

[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.780]
And they will go to Las Vegas, okay

[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.000]
She's hysterical

[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:52.600]
Los Angeles, they fly to Phoenix, Denver, Omaha, I do like Omaha

[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.600]
Next range that I like Omaha, it's ever been there

[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.240]
Really?

[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:01.440]
Oh, they got all those great steak houses and boy those corn fed men westerner people

[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.560]
Both, some, well some you can't tell

[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.520]
Now seriously, they got beautiful, have you ever seen the people in Nebraska?

[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.220]
I think if we wanted to take a definitive place for the most beautiful people in America

[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:18.520]
And you know, talk about the beaches and you know, South Beach and Fort Lauderdale in LA

[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.480]
Who I, I think Nebraska, Omaha anyway

[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.280]
Blimey, what?

[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.640]
And you wouldn't think so would you?

[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.840]
Well, no Bible, Bel, well, no people so

[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.000]
Oh man, those corn fed people

[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.560]
Corn fed

[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.380]
Corn fed and corn hold

[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.240]
Good skin

[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.460]
Beautiful skin, not as good, not as smooth as the Chinese people though

[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.420]
See, I don't know why you're so much against the heaven a whole bunch of men

[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:48.300]
I think you got a very tunnel visioned view of the Chinese because of what we have here

[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.860]
I hate to break the news to you sir

[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.440]
I mean, if I didn't have this headache, which I have a horrible headache

[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.800]
But if I didn't have this headache, I'd laugh so hard that I would like, probably wet my pants

[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:03.800]
See, the Chinese people we have here, he says

[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.920]
Keep in mind that I've been in, I have like a lot of Chinese people all over Europe

[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.880]
I've been like in Rome and in like Amsterdam

[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.140]
Do you have any idea how many Chinese people are in every European city?

[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:13.640]
No

[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.760]
In one block, in any city in Europe, you'll find more Chinese people in five minutes

[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:23.280]
You could scour all of South Florida, including all the restaurants and you wouldn't find as many Chinese people

[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:23.900]
Okay

[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:27.800]
And how about in Toronto where they have not won three different Chinatowns in Toronto, eh?

[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.440]
Okay, yeah, we need a Chinatown

[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.500]
That's what I'm trying to tell you

[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.440]
They're beautiful people and they have a problem

[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.540]
They have a problem with an out west, they're having problems

[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:44.720]
When you get your brain out of out west already for Christ's sake between Montana and West Coast

[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.380]
Bring your brain a little bit closer back to here please

[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.780]
I know it's very desirable, but try to do it

[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.480]
We're talking about us, sadly

[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.860]
Anyway, they fly over to place, Kansas City

[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:02.640]
From Milwaukee, that's their hub and they fly from Kansas City to Atlanta

[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.320]
Anybody want to go to Atlanta?

[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.280]
No, not me

[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.840]
Well, Raleigh, North Carolina, that's where you can fly there

[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:14.580]
From Milwaukee, so go drive up to Raleigh and then fly to Milwaukee and then back

[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.600]
Just do a round trip just to see how the airline is

[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.580]
Now you're smiling if you have to play your cards right? Tell me gave me some free publicity

[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:21.680]
You get your freebie on it

[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:22.580]
Okay

[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.760]
Worked like hell on Martin Air, didn't it?

[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:25.920]
No

[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.700]
No, it worked like hell on National Airlines, the Vegas didn't it?

[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:28.900]
No

[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.020]
No, damn it

[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.640]
Well, they need the money nationally, we got to keep them afloat

[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:38.180]
I or Hank just flew up through the Vegas on National, they're still on business, you think Hank got a Phoebe?

[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.080]
Here's line two and somewhere, hello

[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:51.260]
I just kind of a closet racist, but I'll say that for number two white trash certainly will mess up a town family

[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:56.920]
Well, I know something you might have your thumb on it because so far African Americans are a distant number, I mean way ahead of the pack number one

[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.360]
But number two are rednecks

[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.360]
Yeah, I just got a flash

[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:00.920]
Say let's ask

[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.540]
I just don't have the balls to discuss it

[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:04.460]
Okay

[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.020]
You know, black people, it's weird, it's just...

[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.700]
So what do you mean you don't have the balls to discuss it?

[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:12.380]
Well, I don't know because I know I'm somewhat racist, I'm not...

[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:12.800]
You know, not...

[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.380]
Well, but you understand this is the black man's plan, this is how he gets even for those slavery and all that other stuff

[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:21.160]
This is by making a lot of problems for us and they're doing a great job of it

[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.000]
Well, I've been using this problem for a long time

[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.160]
Everyone would be and I'd give the benefit of a doubt, every human being I mean

[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:31.400]
Well, we're not talking about individuals, I mean there's obviously some nice black people, I haven't met too many, but there's some individuals are very nice

[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.180]
But we're talking as a group, you know, as a class, we're generalizing

[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:39.720]
I've met a lot of nice black people, but I'll tell you this, the neighborhood that I would never live in, that's all the rest of it

[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.440]
Would you live it over time?

[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.960]
I've been through there, huh?

[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.040]
Very quickly

[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.780]
Oh, Polaka?

[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:45.820]
Lovely

[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.900]
I just go into the arena, but we'll get down to the...

[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:49.320]
Liberty City?

[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:50.740]
Liberty City

[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:54.180]
Downtown Miami right there by the arena in the Camille's house?

[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.940]
Come up here to West Palm, I'm sorry

[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:56.820]
Some good pre meals?

[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.900]
Downtown West Palm Beach, there you go

[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:02.600]
That's where I am, it's a scary situation

[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.240]
Okay, I'll see you on the other side of the bridge

[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.840]
I'm moving up the mallabar next week

[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.220]
Okay, so how'd I ask you louder?

[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:09.880]
Whoever that is

[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.220]
Okay

[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.320]
Whoever that is, here's a guy who lives in West Palm Beach, you don't know how to say that

[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.040]
Guys, they won't let him on the other side of that bridge over to Palm Beach

[00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:20.480]
They don't allow his kind over there, whoever that is

[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:21.480]
Makeup?

[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.740]
I don't know if that's the louder still live, I would think so

[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.540]
Because she had like, oh, the company, I don't know about her, huh?

[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.760]
Well, they had a huge mansion in Palm Beach, I mean, gigantic

[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.500]
Not like the Kennedy compound

[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.440]
So let's hang out of this thing here, Midwest Express Airlines

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.420]
Maybe we can scan a free trip on that, although I don't think they need our help

[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:45.680]
I have to get into a deal on MSNBC last night, nationwide, worldwide, great publicity

[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.840]
See, it goes to show you

[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.500]
You do a good job and people are going to say nice things about you

[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.700]
If you do a crappy job like American and Delta and America worth people are going to say,

[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.480]
BAH for them, that's what, oh, I like that

[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.060]
Do you hear that?

[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.900]
Yeah, that was a good one

[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.060]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.380]
Neil, yes, sir

[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:07.140]
Uh, good in the act and got no problem, you know, eating all the protein and stuff

[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:09.000]
It's just the sweet-timeness

[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:11.660]
That's why I came late at night

[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:14.380]
That's why I can't, I don't, I don't combat it, that's why I'm fat as a pig

[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:17.680]
That's why my head is spinning from all those chocolate shakes from me to the steak and shake

[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.800]
I'm serious, I'm going to die from steak and shake

[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.820]
So what do you do with it, what suggestions, yeah?

[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.420]
What do you mean, what do I do? I'm fat

[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:25.740]
That's what I do

[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.800]
All right, thank you

[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.240]
I turn my guts out, wishing that I could be slid and beautiful

[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.040]
Thank you

[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:30.760]
And have a good day

[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.760]
Neil, do you have more chance in a Chinese film book?

[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.860]
Yes, no, I don't, it's not a fact, I don't

[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.620]
Oh, yeah, okay

[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.420]
Only one, thank you, Solomon Teuno

[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.660]
So, Tonto Uno, isn't that interesting, the same thing

[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:44.860]
There's a lot of similarities between esponial and italiano, but the Italian is a wonderful language

[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:47.600]
I understand, I know that, okay, the same route

[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.520]
The same route

[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.320]
Like a baby route, that's what I got, a baby route

[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.320]
Yeah, it's like a candy bar

[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.480]
It didn't see anybody want to, so anyway

[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.220]
Ever, two

[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:57.920]
Yeah

[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:06.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 0, 5, 60, I'm just in coherent that Lomlet just sent me at it, I'm my head is swimming

[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.640]
Do you ever have that literally like when your head is like busy, you know, like swimming?

[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.120]
Yes

[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.020]
I'm not talking about like the sugar swimming from like the rubber lock

[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:17.460]
I'd say to assume that you don't want pizza lots of visitors today

[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:20.160]
Oh, God, no, is that man crazy or what?

[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:24.400]
I want to bring me more of that rubbery pasta like that last time, is he out of his mind?

[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.980]
I mean, I went ahead and made the call, I just figured it was a safe one to make

[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.080]
You made the call for what?

[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.140]
No, he called

[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:32.900]
And I told him, no thank you, I don't think you're in the mood based on that

[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.680]
No, thanks

[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.720]
No, thank you, Jeff, we love you, you're great, haven't I, shower in the back

[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.960]
If a big kiss to my friend Tanner give a little fun down his throat for me

[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.880]
And you know, say I wish I were me, but that's it, no way, no fool, I gotta stop

[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.880]
I sympathize with that last guy because God, you know, the American people we are so God damn fat

[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.320]
And I know that nobody wants to talk about this because it's embarrassing

[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:55.480]
Because you know, it just like the thing with the neighborhoods, I'm the only person in the God damn country

[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.680]
That's willing to come on to God damn radio every day

[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.100]
And talk about the stuff that most people are too pacified to talk about

[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.320]
Like that guy that called about a half hour ago, it said he's been listening for a week

[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.020]
And he can't believe how great this show is and all the stuff that I say that nobody has the balls to say

[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.060]
Much less on a radio

[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.240]
And that's right, that's the F and right man

[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.420]
Fat, we're disgusting, we're just huge cows

[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.640]
We're these big pups and I'm talking to these really bad

[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.600]
I went to steak and shake yesterday and I had a pretty good day, what did I eat here?

[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.280]
Oh, I had it from Ira

[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.640]
Had it let it stay in the subs, huh?

[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.460]
Yeah, I had the cold cut stuff and it wasn't really all that much in there, except a lot of greens

[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:37.420]
Which is good, that's why I like it and I know none of the kutans

[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.980]
Which I can't eat that, it's in your blood sugar skyrocketing

[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.040]
So that was okay

[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.120]
And then I went home and I had one of those protein bars

[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:48.600]
Huh? Not the Actions ones but these carbohydrates

[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.160]
Carbolite?

[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.600]
Carb solution, I'm sorry, carb solution

[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.180]
Thank you again, guys, it's from Rexall

[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.260]
And then last evening about 7 o'clock, I got in the car and went over to steak and shake

[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.140]
I got to stop going there

[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:05.380]
I got a double cheeseburger with onions and bacon and a large chocolate shake

[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.060]
And I did something I never ever do, ever

[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.880]
I ate the cheeseburger with the bun

[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.700]
And I'm going to tell you something, it was delicious

[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.380]
It was and she did

[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.260]
Yeah, and I wonder what my head is swimming this morning

[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.080]
Now my blood sugar this morning was 137

[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.240]
Which is an astronomical, but I mean, no it should be a bit lower than that usually is

[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.800]
And then in the morning, you know, it goes up quite a bit

[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.440]
And then I came in here and ate that goddamn omelette

[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.640]
And so now my head is swimming and I'm struggling to see a fat

[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.240]
And the only way that I'm lately treading water is by taking diuretics

[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:46.020]
You know what, taking diuretics spreads bad for diuretics

[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:51.560]
Because first of all, for anybody, because taking prescription diuretics increases the uric acid levels

[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.780]
What's going to give you gout and you know, your feet, it's bad for you

[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.620]
But I have to do it, it's like taking a sponge and bringing the water out, you know

[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.880]
And you keep bringing it out and pretty soon the sponge is like drek, you know

[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.360]
You got like a handful of pieces of what used to be a sponge

[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.360]
And that's what it's like doing to your body taking those diuretics

[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.340]
That's what it does to your kidneys

[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.720]
See, now here I go again with this crap, but that guy got me motivated

[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.680]
Because he's frustrated

[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.400]
I relate to your surface, it actually feels like I'm another fat swab that can't stop the goddamn sweets

[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.420]
I can't stop the sweet, I can't stop the goddamn sweet

[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.700]
I can't stop the pasta, I can't stop the bread, I can't stop the rice although I tell you that

[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.780]
Cheeseburg with a bun last night, it's so good

[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:35.580]
Almost made up for the fact that Josh was not in the drive through and all the shfarts were in there

[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.280]
What is that all about, seriously?

[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.860]
What, what, do we have to ship, I mean I know we bust people to schools

[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.040]
But do we, those people don't live out there?

[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.560]
I hope

[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.920]
I mean, I don't think

[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.300]
Huh?

[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.540]
I shouldn't have said I hope, should I?

[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:52.940]
I hope

[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.620]
No, no, I mean, it's not that I don't want, we have black people living out there by me

[01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:00.740]
Because most black people don't want to live in Liberty City or they don't want to live there

[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.400]
They're going to afford to get out, they get out, they don't want to live in a swam

[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.220]
Of course not, they don't want to live in the hood

[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.940]
They want to live in respectable places where like upstanding white people live, you know

[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.200]
And I can't blame them

[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.820]
But why can't we just have like some fast food place that's got like white people in there

[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:23.240]
And I don't get that, there was white people in there last week and now all of a sudden there's black people at the address

[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.040]
And I bet you're going to wake them up, you ain't white people working there

[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:26.960]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.560]
See how that starts, like you plant one little seed and all of a sudden you got a whole goddamn field of it growing in your backyard

[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.320]
All you do is one plant

[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.280]
And now all of a sudden you got a whole yard full of that crap and a helicopter is flying over

[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.680]
And you got real tourists baby, yeah, that's right

[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.680]
When the chopper starts flying over, you've got problems man, they're after your ass

[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.720]
And because this is the US of A, they're going to drag your fat ass away

[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.140]
And it will be a fat ass because it's America, everybody's got a fat ass

[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.420]
And they'll drag it away and throw your ass in jail for 20 years

[01:03:55.420 --> 01:04:00.620]
Because they don't like the god damn wicked weed, they don't like the drug people, they got them a pot people

[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:03.240]
Because this country like a bunch of overgrown chillins

[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.560]
And I do understand I salute the black people for getting even, that's what they're doing

[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.480]
I don't know why you're smiling, this is what they are doing, that's why they cause so many problems

[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:18.120]
I mean you can run around with Jesse Jackson and Farrakhan and I'll sharpen all those assholes

[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.780]
Nobody pays any attention to them

[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.480]
But when you go around start screwing up people's neighborhoods and turn them into a juggernaut

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.360]
And I'll slump and force them to keep selling their property and move it to big laws

[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.160]
Then that's getting even I would say

[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.920]
So nice going out of your starch as you, you're doing it baby

[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.060]
Now don't forget this Sunday to become a pick you up

[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.200]
I mean that's where all those kids were

[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.280]
Remember I said they were scattering by the school I heard yesterday

[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.520]
Maybe they're getting ready to hop on that BTA thing

[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:42.780]
Yeah

[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:46.780]
That was Friday you first did

[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.940]
That week I did the craziest thing

[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:55.620]
I moved open to run ebony

[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.940]
And then I hit the street to go check out my stuff

[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:02.920]
And what happened was why I got it

[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.060]
There was a black guy standing on the corner

[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:10.240]
I said to him, was up and your blood was going down

[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.640]
And looked at me as if I was some kind of brain

[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.180]
And you also see what he called me

[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.080]
Check the food, check the food

[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.500]
Now how did you like the chicken food?

[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:25.040]
Check the food, says you don't like the chicken food

[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:25.900]
Check the food

[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:28.420]
The honky don't like the chicken food

[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.040]
Check the food, check the food, check the food

[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.720]
He's very bothered safe for you

[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.720]
And he pulled out his gun and never seen it

[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.040]
And I'm just learning ebonyx from an old one

[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.520]
And he aimed at me, said his lesson would old you

[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.840]
A rock, pop, a loop, pop, a rock, a rock, and see

[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.460]
As I lay there, I saw now his die

[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.180]
Someone called the paramedic

[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.620]

[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.280]

Now how did you like the chicken food?

[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.700]

Check the food, check the food

[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.180]
It's not that I'm ready, too, five, fifty, double the QA

[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.040]
Anyway Jeff Claw, I think, is going to come over

[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.380]
or do a demonstration of eating ants here on the show

[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:39.800]
instead of like having lunch, but this dispenser would launch what? Who's the subject?

[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.180]

And tell you that I love you. Okay thanks. And have a great day. Bye bye. Bye. Bye.

[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.620]
Well customer found guilty of exposing himself. Oh right. This is a great story. A Rossville man.

[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.500]
I don't know where Rossville is. Let's see. Well I guess they'll make any difference.

[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.040]
Who said he wasn't aware that his penis was hanging out of his shorts during visits to

[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.840]
three stores at the Tipecanou Mall last October has been convicted on three counts of

[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:27.340]
public indecency. Christopher M. Felipe 28 was convicted at the end of a one day jury trial

[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:32.640]
in Tipecanou Superior Court on Tuesday. According to testimony, a clerk at Hotline Shoes

[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.140]
notified Mall Security the morning of October 16th when Felipe left the store. She told

[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:40.620]
a security officer that Felipe would expose his penis to the leg of his shorts while

[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:46.640]
trying on shoes. Mall Security began monitoring Felipe via surveillance cameras after leaving

[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.840]
Hotline, Felipe went to the shoe department at Cole's department store. Video taken

[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:54.960]
there showed Felipe fidgeting, rearranging his shorts and looking around. After leaving

[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.240]
Cole's, he went to Sears to spend some time trying on suits and then went to the shoe

[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.020]
department where he was caught on surveillance video again exposing himself to the leg of

[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:09.220]
his shorts. He never bought any shoes. Security officers confronted him as he was leaving

[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:13.060]
them all and he was arrested by Lafayette police. Felipe was murdered in a youth leader at

[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:21.520]
his church was represented during the trial by Attorney Stephen Meyer. Felipe testified

[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.100]
that if he exposed himself it was inadvertent his genitals must have slipped out of the

[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.360]
lining of his shorts. He said it was surprised when he watched the video and saw how frequently

[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.460]
he was tugging at his shorts he said it was an unconscious habit. Deputy prosecutor Christine

[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:39.920]
Smith argued that the repeated incidents could not have been accidental. Several friends

[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.920]
and family members attended the trial his minister testified to a strong character and

[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.520]
large penis. The jury deliberated for an hour and twenty minutes before convicting

[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.340]
Felipe of all three class Amistam leaders. Judge Laura Zeman sentenced him to two years

[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:56.420]
on probation including 90 days in house arrest and imposed 425 thousand fines and court

[01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:04.440]
costs and hopefully we'll get him some new shoes. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and

[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:09.000]
provides a wireless blind maybe it's just my allergies you know. I think that could be it

[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.560]
or acting up could be because like my eyes like watering it's gold or alias and my nose

[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:19.280]
is running is it spray. I think I got bad allergies. My WQAM allergies are really big.

[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.300]
Oh awful especially when I saw Maddie Bell in the whole waiting. Get out of here Maddie

[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:29.400]

my leg on because all those chocolate shakes. Uh huh. Yeah. It'll do it every time.

[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.460]
You've got I got some old bowlers for you. Okay Ray Bluth. Ray Bluth yeah with the

[01:09:54.460 --> 01:10:00.120]
big eyebrows. Bobby Canippel. And that don't know that one. Dave Davis. Yeah. And I got

[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.260]
one more thing about the neighborhoods. Having come from New York 20 some might years ago.

[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:08.680]
There is nothing that can kill a neighborhood faster than the Hussetek Jew. Well it's on

[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.640]
there they're doing pretty good they got 22 or 20 or 18 whatever it is. They ruined every

[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.540]
neighborhood and when they move out the blacks move in. Okay and that's why also in your

[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:23.320]
fast food places soon as the first black person was in the white people move out. In the

[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.720]
fast food joint. Sure. Are you serious? Sure. Especially my amy subs. Okay thanks for

[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:34.220]
the good news. Hi. See you. I'll see you at Subway. Orthodox Jews you didn't think that

[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:42.440]
belonged on the list this guy he has experience he knows what it would be all about. What

[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.800]
you create havoc and dissension and a full mint in the throw rocks and just create the

[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:53.280]
psychosis not to mention the aroma of course of the good. Well the ones out by me and Hollywood

[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.120]
are just fine. Wonderful. Yeah see what you're just sucking up because your accountant is

[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.580]
one of them you know that's why you're sucking up. Okay. Yeah I hope he gives you some

[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:05.420]
of that diet the hall of law. And then I hope he does. Yeah I hope he does. And then

[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:11.740]
you'll think Peter Lem is probably not so bad. Yeah man all your neighbors will be schmutz.

[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:21.500]
265 yeah without the M. 265 votes on our survey so far which is pretty heavy duty. Which group

[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:26.180]
of people to store in neighborhood the fastest. African Americans seem to be leading the list

[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:32.840]
with 101 that's pretty shocking. No. No. Redneck's 47 like trailer part. I don't want to

[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.660]
put trailer trash on it. That would have been bad. That would have been like putting

[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:40.520]
shfarts here on there instead of African Americans is like respectable you know at least it

[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:51.980]
sounds respectable. Redneck's 47 Puerto Ricans 25 Haitians 22 Orthodox Jews 19. Cubans

[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:59.520]
19 Jamaicans 18 Jamaicans 18. They got the good stuff. Month Mexican 7 see we finally got

a few Mexican people in there just to make you happy since you continue to to the loop

[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.960]
and nobody put Chinese on there. Of course I didn't put it on the other Chinese people

[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:12.600]
are wonderful. I don't know what kind of a delusory you must be doing a bad drug this

[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.160]
way. George couldn't find his regular supplier this week and he's a wants to apologize.

[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:22.860]
Why do you say those things about the Chinese because of all these things in addition to

[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:29.340]
which the West Coast is filled matches with Koreans and right and the Asian. The Vietnamese

[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:52.860]
that was some time ago and at the rate they multiply it's probably like a half a million

[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:59.800]

little Nicaragua yeah maybe we could bring back on our squeaks so she could say Nicaragua Nicaragua

[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.520]

area I live right there uh huh it's uh it's nice I mean definitely queen nothing in

[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:37.260]
August when they all start coming outside and then a woman starts walking through the year that's

[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:42.100]
that we're heavy to take you know and one more thing was that and then when they start rolling

[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:46.600]
their tits is you know yeah but I mean the neighborhood at least I should pop your values down which

[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:51.120]
is a huge problem yeah that's a good point which group of people destroy a neighborhood the

[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.880]
fact is some people aren't to understand there are some of the people are just looking for an

[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.120]
opportunity to express their disgust with some people in their bigotry well look at the way

[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.860]
they're wet you know yeah but as far as uh look at the way those riots in Seattle there were

[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:10.920]
all those nice white people yeah well that's different that's part of country obesity yeah yeah

[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.720]
I mean you got any other country in the world you never seen such a beast people like you do in the

US it's not really not questionable no question about it and you go like those these Chinese

like the faces and going for seconds and thirds right I I feel like uh Ike about crane when I

[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.220]
go to the ammo coast in the Chinese buffet you know because I'm one of the skinniest people in there

[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:38.140]

[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:55.320]
not as big of a tub of crap as he used to be he's still limping around with his hip fall

[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.580]
on his ankle you know because he's like a gigantic tub of crap he'll lose enough weight so it

[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:06.580]

[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:13.380]
what language but you know they're from another country but the point is they bought some into that

[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:20.540]
area they must shove them all in the back when they see me coming in there because I never saw

[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:25.500]
I'm coming I'm in there like 10 times a week in that public so I practically live there absolutely

[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.320]
through the drive-through the people working in the main part of the restaurant all because you

[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.820]
can see them through the window when you drive up to the end of the end of the back there at the

[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:10.860]
drive-through it's all dark folks what is that all about you walking the right

they make it up and you're white right in the front the managers white maybe the drive-through guy

[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:21.560]

[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:03.680]

[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.400]
know see I think what I'm gonna do I got a I want to be fair about this but like anybody else that I

[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.700]

[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:17.840]
latched on to my paycheck it's just when we reach is when my minus when I get to a certain

[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:23.200]
minus point and at the you know at that point I suspend all other payments you know it's just

[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.840]

for minutes kill noon at 560 say better get a suck up in the broke camper it's all I can tell

[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:52.560]

[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:59.300]
bad breath I know Frank I've tried everything brushing, flossing even industrial strength mouthwash

[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:09.400]
here try some all new glycerine wow my breath sounds better already it sure does that's because

[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:15.280]
glycerine is a musical mouthwash substitute that goes to work immediately by making a pleasant cleansing

[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:21.000]
sound just open the top switch some glycerine around and at festering germ breeding ground you

[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:28.520]
call a mouth and listen to glycerine patented audio non-action go to work sure sounds fresh

[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.940]
too bad it doesn't smell that way

[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:38.400]
with your mind laughing in the other direction

[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.420]
so glycerine with the artificial sound of freshness to work on your bad breath today

[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:48.080]
another fine product from the glycerine to corporation and what a great segue in this

[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:52.080]
fax here from listener in Tampa who says his one fact another I thought you might enjoy this

[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:57.360]
what's the difference between love true love and just playing showing off spitting swallowing or

[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:03.960]
gargling not bad speaking of that I was thinking of myself you know this desperation to lose weight

[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.560]
you just have to stop eating you know when I was on a liquid protein you know I died many years

[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:12.680]
ago 26 years ago I was working with WJ in the most pumping lost 100 pounds in a year some of it

[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.140]
on acne some unskilled men but mostly on liquid protein oh it's a good thing he walked out because

[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:22.960]
I was thinking he was going to help me start to die 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 8th

[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:29.000]
tea what's wrong with that I do blushes shake vitamins he's good for you baby

[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:34.380]
when a doubt shake it out on speaker that here's another fact that says there's no way the

[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:38.300]
gaze should be on itlers now I put them on there just to prove a point but it says the greatest

[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:41.980]
way to get a neighborhood improved is to try and sell a few homes to some gay people all of us

[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:45.720]
on the homes are beautifully painted flowers and trees are planted in the property looks great

[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.500]
the great things about gays is they have the best sense of decorating love to keep the gardens

[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:53.100]
of the homes full of flowers and keep the neighborhood looking elegant like those beautiful pandas

[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:56.620]
they also don't mind moving into poor black areas since the blacks eventually sell their homes

[01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:04.440]
to other gay couples oh is that is that true yes huh so others the schwarches when the facts start

[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.960]
moving in the schwarches start moving out yeah well they get a good price for their home oh I see

[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:13.440]
also going to give them a good price for their home that's true they have taken some run down

[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.140]
here is a fort waterdale and also off a busking boulevard downtown mine it's there to improve

[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:21.340]
the general appearance in the area I'm not gay but I could kiss these guys for the beauty

[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:25.940]
they bring in some areas that are dead and look like a garbage dump before and that so give

[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:32.700]
my big kiss but just watch where you stick it five six seven oh five sixty better fact if some of

[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:37.040]
these depressed neighborhoods were smart they would start advertising that they're gay friendly

[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:41.080]
where a fact friendly neighborhood uh-huh we won't stone you beat you burn you out of your house

[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:44.520]
do you mean like right around the crowbridge because the church of the church

[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:51.020]

[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:57.680]
Verizon line here's Lake Worth hello yeah I'm in high alia here's high alia actually I live in high alia okay

[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:09.640]

[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:15.680]
hey I misspeed my airline southwest sucks and I travel in the software the software's really

[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:19.660]

[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:39.620]
stops horrible but I travel in the south a lot and I go to Mississippi and obviously go to

[01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:01.020]
Sunrise are in St. Pete it's amazing absolutely amazing uh-huh well they like the bus ride that must

[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:06.860]
be it yeah but don't put it in our state right okay amigo all right see in the Mississippi not

[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:13.380]
I'm not gonna miss a city no five six seven oh five sixty oh and I forgot to read this promo

[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:17.480]
anymore and it's all over now thank goodness okay sorry class why don't I do a couple of times

[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:23.660]
that said the price was right leave me alone here's the mobile and Jupiter hello hello yes sir

[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:27.880]
yeah the way you're running the south pole you gotta you gotta do something different about it

[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:33.320]
all the votes for the slaughters and Cubans and everybody you gotta put all out in the category

[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:38.940]
with the Jews because what the Jews do is they live in the neighborhood still about 75 80 percent

[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:44.640]
ruined and they turn them over these other people so they look like the bad guys uh-huh yeah

[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:50.040]
you know you give the other people a break it's the Jews that ruined the places and the other people

[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:55.540]
want to just look bad yeah okay thanks sure by the way say hi to your friend from Finland

[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:02.220]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T in Verizon you might come to the

[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:08.200]
have no need yeah old Jews are what anything else I know you're finished say how to ockie berg while

[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:14.420]
you're at it five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Marla's line

[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:19.140]
see what this guy may have had a point by saying that Jews sell out to uh-shforches and that's true

[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:24.300]
that's true because Jews tend to be very liberal at least they used to and then they sell you know

[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:27.580]
the first they let the first black family in and now all of a sudden everybody else goes oh

[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:31.960]
more moving out and then of course before you know it everybody the hood is black that's why

[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:37.780]
they call it the hood and then you got some real problems because then it's payback time we're

[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:43.080]
gonna show you a finger too and then if you really get this pissed off we'll burn down our neighborhood

[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:49.780]
here's Dallas hello you know how you doing all right thank you for the internet oh man

[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:55.240]
couldn't live without it now good but I work for airline that has a couple of days on it and

[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.360]
I mean if you can just briefly tell me what have your experiences been on American airline not good

[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:07.100]
not far as as far as anything the only good thing I'll say about American airlines is if you

[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.000]
happen to be taking a flight at the right time of day and you're in first class and they give you

[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.120]
like a meal that the food is pretty good better than the other domestic carriers food is pretty damn

[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.340]
good but other than that I can't say anything good about America especially down here in Miami

[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:23.280]
because between the hand grenades and the drugs and the heroin and all the other stuff it's a

[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:27.880]
nightmare and in addition to which the part of the airport in Miami International that they fly out

[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.800]
of it's like the banana boat part of the airport yeah that's one of the they call it the banana boat

[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:38.860]
terminal that's one of the things I'm you know since I've lived in Miami now I'm out here now I'm kind

[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:44.060]
of I've looked at a lot of what the company does here and the terminals that they're gonna be building

[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:48.420]
in Miami is actually gonna be very beautiful I think it's gonna change a lot of people's opinions on

[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:54.100]
Miami it's gonna be about $20 billion over budget but it will be nice well you know the mayor

[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:57.920]
needs some although I'm thinking I bet they're looking like they're gonna build a stadium down there

[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:02.520]
boy oh boy the construction people are just salivating their rubbing their hands and their

[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:09.020]
glands together just waiting to get all the graph from that yeah but you know I would like to try

[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:16.000]
to get to a try to recombate you on maybe one of your tribes trips to Toronto how to do fly

[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.720]
fly first for business how what how often do you fly first for business I always fly first

[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.360]
to business I wouldn't fly coach again I mean when you got at least I used to have the big bucks when

[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.540]
you have a few bucks then why would you want to fly like a sardine exactly my point that that's

[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:33.120]
what I that's what I do you like I might go and hold on the line I can try to make you a proposition

[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:39.380]
on the trip for one of your next trips to Toronto okay great hang on okay thanks a lot okay on line

[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:42.960]
nine there take that guy's info there maybe I can give me a little freebie out there yes you

[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.160]
going around again sure why not most of you would like to have in a bank right now the money I've

[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.260]
wasted on airlines the last ten years take care of the guys info they're online please

[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.260]
I think it's because it's a hundred degrees below zero in here that might have something to do with

[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:03.380]
it my allergies act on it so I didn't call the George footage jacket on this is like a crazy

[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:34.520]
mention we don't expect anybody talking about hockey down here and don't don't start confusing

[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.680]
those black rats you saw back in that year a hundred years ago been thrown there's nobody down here

[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:43.080]
interested that you know if it's uh... and then the global penguin game and they see a sellout all

[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:59.120]
existent and I still think that the guy that we give the tickets to the other day I think he

[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:02.460]
what party after sundown please but i want to ask you a question by the way when i say

[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:06.940]
every time i now have a second career very unexpectedly i've finally

[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:14.020]
to it uh i organized legally an organization a little over three years ago and i'll

[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:19.460]
mention any names it's not necessary now it's not necessary uh this organization we're very very

[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:25.520]
concerned as to what is being done to children and families in our community

[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:31.760]
and the main one of the main culprits there are a number of them and they all work together

[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:35.540]
unfortunately why they do it's like god call them all together and say this is what you're

[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:40.660]
going to have to do together but they do it and we are determined that we're going to see if we

[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:47.040]
can put a stop to it we have put a stop to what the the terrible things that have been done to

[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.360]
children and families there is no level playing field down here as a matter of fact

[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:58.120]
even throughout the state of florida is no level playing field that is accorded to children and families

[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.580]
it's just know that the children don't count because they don't vote yeah this is this great

[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:10.020]
so what do you got to do for them sir what are you saying well my organization what we do is

in a million of them uh-huh and I understand you can fly from here to Tampa to only six stops

[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:02.780]
uh here to Tampa the one stopper but I got so in the bathroom and I think that's a three stopper

[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:08.860]
but it's cheap it's like a hundred and sixty nine bucks round trip to go to you know Massachusetts

[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:14.140]
or I've flown them quite a few times they have a pretty good credit card deal every time you spend

[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:18.800]
the thousand bucks on their credit card you get a flight credit and every sixteen flight credit you

[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:23.280]

[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:32.940]
value chain used to be and also the value they used to be well I don't sound too promising well not

[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:36.440]
not in the fact that they're going to wreck but just there's a lot of people on the plane it's not

[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:40.560]
like not because the two witnesses they have like a clown outfit on like like the fool fighters

[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:45.520]
not quite that bad they're pretty funny though actually the uh-huh the flight attendant for hilarious

[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.240]
their crack a joke so oh that's great that's I always love that when the flight attendants are

[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:54.060]
laughing and fukin and playing grab ash you know and a plane start like diving and shaking and listen

[01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:59.140]

[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:03.560]
delayed or late they always are on time mm-hmm they don't have a first class so they

[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:07.180]
I love the way that the congress they keep having these hearings and they keep threatening them and

[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:10.800]
you have never you've got to serve the public and you will do it yeah I'll hold in my breath you know

[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.040]
they they always talk a big game and make a lot of noise they don't do a goddamn thing to them

[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:18.620]
aren't they the ones that want to deregulate everything anyway they already did that's why we got

[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:23.740]
the problems exactly they got themselves to blame California power outages the problem example

[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:29.880]
that's right hey gays moving into your neighborhood yeah nothing could be better not that's what I

[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:34.460]
say I bought my house and and a gay couple bought the house across the street from us a month

[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:38.840]
earlier we moved in I looked at my wife I said then then you did do some work on that house

[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:44.320]
within three months people were stopping on our street staring in our house right or excuse me at

[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.500]
their house they should probably should have closed the blinds no I mean they're just their house

[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:56.880]
is beautiful exactly what you said three flowers P if you want to make a good real estate investment

[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.880]
find out where the gay people are moving and you'll make big bucks there you go that's why they put

[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:06.120]

[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:31.540]
live under a totalitarian government and yeah you can have a great neighborhood but that's why we

[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:36.320]
have America and it's free because we do have to free them to make moral choices that maybe not

[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:40.880]
consider moral by others I have a quick comment well well well well well wait a minute well

I'm not talking about the Chinese in China I'm talking about the people who come here and have

[02:37:00.460 --> 02:37:06.220]
a very high ethic as far as having a good education and being hard working in all of these

Jamaica for some reason that's what I was trying to tell you you know well there's a billion

[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:54.260]
Chinese people you're you're probably going to run into hope and then they travel in packs 1.3

[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:58.620]
now they travel in packs like when you go to Rome and you go to like a to a trot to Rio they bring

[02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:02.520]
them in in bus loads because you know they're on papers and whatever and that's got nothing to do

[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:07.980]
with it they know they're nice people and let me ask you this if you're in a goddamn restaurant

[02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:12.820]
in Rome New York or wherever to hold you a Rome Georgia Athens Georgia wherever you're hanging out

[02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:18.580]
and a bus load pulls up now what would you rather have a 20 people hard on the visiting

[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:23.960]
20 tourists get off of that bus who would you rather have them be Chinese people

[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.660]
African Americans uh Puerto Rican with Swiss blades who would you rather have them be

[02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:35.460]
orthodox Jews I like Chinese let's play it

[02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:42.080]

[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:11.100]

[02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:20.520]
where put yourself let's do

[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:22.480]
he tell you how I built

[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:24.320]
Guangdong

[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:40.400]
The game's over, I'm at Surrey State

[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:43.500]
And the FCC won't let me sing this

[02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:46.360]
So I'm not supposed to stay now at the CCK

[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:48.860]
Take her hand, tell me say

[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:50.700]
That after this transition

[02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:52.800]
I'll be out in 90 days

[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:55.960]
Oh, if you see KMT wanna

[02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:59.520]
Then I'll see you with Tio wanna

[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:01.460]
Go, wanna go, but gotta

[02:42:01.460 --> 02:42:03.620]
Keep with Tio wanna

[02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:04.100]
Go!

[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:10.280]
So you have to ask yourself

[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:11.860]
What kind of assuming that the story was true

[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:12.440]
Which I don't believe

[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:14.420]
Well, what kind of a normal or even close to normal

[02:42:14.420 --> 02:42:15.480]
If there's such a thing person

[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:16.960]
We'll be getting a cab

[02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:20.640]
And here's a radio show on the back

[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:23.040]
And be subjected to it allegedly for 30 minutes

[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:24.580]
Which I can't imagine what the hell she's going for

[02:42:24.580 --> 02:42:25.500]
30 minutes in this place

[02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:28.020]
And take the time to call up the talk show

[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:29.420]
And express her displeasure

[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:33.420]
And like we give a crap of what the hell she thinks

[02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:34.660]
No, I don't think so

[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:35.980]
That's f***ing bit

[02:42:35.980 --> 02:42:37.620]
Exactly, I couldn't say better myself

[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:39.880]
She's giving me a song of dance

[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:40.800]
And you wanna know why honey?

[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:44.140]
Because you're one of those obnoxious New York imperial snobbitches

[02:42:44.140 --> 02:42:44.960]
That's what you are

[02:42:45.380 --> 02:42:46.360]
I'm from New York

[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:47.840]
Well great, that in 50 cents

[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:50.140]
Oh, buy about a half a cup of coffee at Tim Horton's donuts

[02:42:50.140 --> 02:42:50.660]
Okay?

[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:56.220]
The factor was visiting a sweet kind 80-year-old parishioner

[02:42:56.220 --> 02:42:57.420]
And while she was preparing tea

[02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:59.860]
He noticed on top of a ranteed pump organ

[02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:02.500]
A bowl of water-inch which floated the condom

[02:43:03.260 --> 02:43:05.240]
When she returned it, it was curiosity

[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:06.360]
Got the best of many asked

[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:08.340]
I wonder if you tell me about this point into the bowl

[02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:10.640]
Oh yes, you replied isn't it wonderful?

[02:43:10.900 --> 02:43:13.600]
I was walking downtown last fall and I found this little package

[02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:15.780]
The direction said to put it on your organ

[02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:17.240]
Keep it wet and it would prevent disease

[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:19.120]
And you know I haven't had a cold all winter

[02:43:21.420 --> 02:43:22.460]
Nice go on grandma

[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:25.740]
That can't all be great

[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:29.980]
560-560-560 on the AT&T line

[02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:31.860]
Mobile in Miami, hello

[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:32.840]
Hey, what's up Neil

[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:33.340]
Yes sir

[02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:35.580]
Hey, those were two weak horns by the way

[02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:37.320]
Yeah, like you said they can't all be good

[02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:38.540]
They can all be a four-star

[02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:41.700]
Hey, that girl, she's never been north of a Quail Roos drive

[02:43:41.700 --> 02:43:43.560]
And cutler rigs much less New York

[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:43.840]
Yeah

[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:47.820]
The worst people to have live in the U

[02:43:48.980 --> 02:43:50.640]
Most of the time just come back

[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:53.360]
You know, whether they're wide or black or Cuban

[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:56.580]
The people that leave their junk cars and stuff like that

[02:43:56.580 --> 02:43:58.880]
No, that's mostly usually red next to junk car crash

[02:43:58.880 --> 02:43:59.620]
And you're really hit

[02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:01.840]
I mean, you know, I don't want to say it

[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:03.820]
But it's like the redneck white trash people

[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:05.980]
Why don't you want to say it?

[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:07.520]
I mean, I don't know

[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:09.300]
You've got to call them off in a straight way

[02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:10.460]
You've got to call us straight

[02:44:10.460 --> 02:44:12.540]
You've got to never had black people live near me

[02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:12.860]
Yeah

[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:14.620]
You know, so I don't know about black people

[02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:16.100]
But you know, really scummy redneck

[02:44:16.100 --> 02:44:17.220]
And people are disgusting

[02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:20.100]
You know, tonight's my last game, Neil

[02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:24.040]
Going tonight, I got my last game tickets here

[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:27.820]
And hopefully by this time next year things will be a little bit

[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:29.220]
Tomorrow night's my last game

[02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:31.120]
I get to get to get to the end of the way you're not going

[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:31.660]
What is it?

[02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:33.000]
Are you going tonight or you're not going to go?

[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:33.700]
No, of course not

[02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:36.840]
Well, yeah, I guess you should only go to see your team

[02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:38.680]
That's right, Toronto may finish it

[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:39.460]
Please, that will be it

[02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:40.320]
Okay, I have a rate day pal

[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:41.100]
All right, later, my friends

[02:44:41.100 --> 02:44:44.160]
When they get new ownership in here, they want to make a commitment to the public

[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:46.000]
And make it worthwhile going and I'll go back

[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.380]
Otherwise, to them, okay?

[02:44:50.100 --> 02:44:51.140]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello

[02:44:51.140 --> 02:44:51.640]
Hello, Neil

[02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:52.260]
Yes, sir

[02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:55.020]
Long time, Lister and Frequent Collard

[02:44:55.020 --> 02:44:55.280]
Okay

[02:44:55.280 --> 02:44:57.580]
Getting hammered here is from Green Beer

[02:44:59.200 --> 02:44:59.600]
Lepicondom

[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:01.740]
Can I hear Lepicondom?

[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:03.080]
Yes, you can, as a matter of fact

[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:04.420]
And Brian Craig says hello

[02:45:05.100 --> 02:45:06.320]
Like I said, no chance

[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:08.200]
Isn't that sad?

[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:10.520]
Isn't that pathetic?

[02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:13.520]
Do you know who that is, Brian Craig?

[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:15.760]
Yeah, and I know he got a thing called

[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:17.500]
He was calling and marauding for a long time

[02:45:17.500 --> 02:45:18.520]
There apparently got tired

[02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:20.080]
I thought he had found a life that appeared there

[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:21.300]
Who was calling and marauding?

[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:23.340]
Yeah, saying gay things

[02:45:23.340 --> 02:45:24.440]
Over and over again, like

[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:24.680]
Oh, really?

[02:45:24.820 --> 02:45:25.500]
Off the air yet

[02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:27.660]
Uh-huh, involving Brian Craig

[02:45:27.660 --> 02:45:28.420]
Oh, really?

[02:45:28.660 --> 02:45:29.060]
Yeah, sure

[02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:30.900]
And now he's there with him or is he just making that up?

[02:45:31.020 --> 02:45:31.720]
Oh, apparently he was the whole turn

[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:33.180]
I see

[02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:34.460]
That's my theory

[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:38.220]
Well, you know, if you have enough of those green beers, you forget about all those other things, you know?

[02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:39.740]
Why would you be obsessed with someone else?

[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:40.580]
They weren't so hard

[02:45:40.580 --> 02:45:42.160]
Yeah, you forget about Norm and you know

[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:45.180]
Then you start thinking about your wife and your adopted black children

[02:45:45.180 --> 02:45:46.180]
All these things

[02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:47.540]
Monkey sea, monkey do

[02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:50.500]
I was talking to somebody about that the other day

[02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:54.080]
About, you know, people who are just like little sucklings, little underlings

[02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:56.980]
She, Mr. Ego, is always going to have a

[02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:58.960]
Be surrounded by a bunch of those people, you know?

[02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:03.760]
If he takes a crap and it's like, uh, diarrhea, they got to go have instant diarrhea too

[02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:05.640]
Good thing we don't have anybody in this building like that

[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:06.120]
Right

[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:07.360]
Good point

[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:10.420]
So what's the morning line on?

[02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:13.000]
It's 11 before 2 at 5, 60 at WDQAM

[02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:13.760]
That's very sad

[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:15.280]
Are you gambling nerds in here?

[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:16.740]
Very tragic, you know?

[02:46:17.380 --> 02:46:18.720]
Hanking the 80k wannabes?

[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:22.360]
Gambling away their hard earned money

[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:23.700]
Well, like I said, you know what I mean?

[02:46:24.180 --> 02:46:25.760]
No, I wasn't either. I said wannabes

[02:46:27.100 --> 02:46:27.540]
wannabes

[02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:30.160]
And who are you talking about?

[02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:32.280]
Oh, that wannabes!

[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:33.100]
Well, I see!

[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:35.380]
Now we understand just a vendetta

[02:46:35.380 --> 02:46:36.060]
Break H2

[02:46:36.060 --> 02:46:36.720]
Yeah, that's why

[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:38.420]
That's the whole mother's story

[02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:41.420]
Dumber than sawdust

[02:46:42.420 --> 02:46:44.620]
10 till 2 at 5, 60 at WDQAM

[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:46.100]
We got Jim Mad Dog Manditch

[02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:47.880]
Yeah, I'll be along for Hank at 2

[02:46:48.420 --> 02:46:51.260]
And then they had the hockey stuff. You know the hockey stuff by now

[02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:54.420]
Because your soul is dirty more

[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:58.240]
What a sin she's got a sin

[02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:01.780]
I thought she will, I was shocked and dissaid

[02:47:01.780 --> 02:47:03.860]
Where it was cavern

[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:08.220]
Maybe Steve or Jim I thought

[02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:11.560]
With my tent down I was caught

[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:13.300]
Holy potent pulse

[02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:14.900]
With your remote control

[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:17.820]
It's cavern, she's the mole

[02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:20.920]
I couldn't have guessed

[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:24.240]
Surely you can't say it's not dope

[02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:27.620]
I like hate the bed

[02:47:27.620 --> 02:47:29.180]
Charlie the bed

[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:30.840]
He had to go

[02:47:33.860 --> 02:47:36.640]
I can't wait for the mole to

[02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:38.800]
D4 and Y

[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:40.420]
D-D blue next time

[02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:43.440]
Also confused other wives to rules

[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:46.080]
Make it my life to prove

[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:46.600]
All right

[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:49.180]
155 at 5, 60 at WQAM

[02:47:49.860 --> 02:47:51.980]
Greg Poked his head in the door there a couple of minutes ago

[02:47:51.980 --> 02:47:52.740]
And we said

[02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:54.640]
Get lost

[02:47:55.700 --> 02:47:57.960]
One day, what is this?

[02:47:58.420 --> 02:48:00.320]
Oh, this is at the beginning of this is screwed up

[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:03.140]
One day at home, the wife is home alone

[02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:04.060]
In the doorbell rings

[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:05.640]
She opens it to a guy

[02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:07.000]
And he says

[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:07.840]
Hi, it's Tony home

[02:48:07.840 --> 02:48:10.200]
This is very probably written to ever send me from the United

[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:11.280]
Airlines I appreciate it

[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:12.680]
But this is weak

[02:48:13.940 --> 02:48:15.400]
Hi, it's Tony home, the wife replies

[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:17.360]
No, he went to the store being wait here if you want

[02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:20.080]
So they sit down and after a while of silence

[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:20.660]
Of the French

[02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:22.200]
You know, Sarah, you have the greatest bread

[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:22.960]
I've ever seen

[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:24.820]
I give you a hundred bucks just to see one

[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:27.160]
Sarah thinks about it for a second and figures

[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:28.320]
What the hell, a hundred bucks?

[02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:30.960]
She opens her robe and shows one to him for a few seconds

[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:33.000]
He thanks her and throws a hundred bucks on the table

[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:35.240]
They sit there a while longer than the guy says

[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:37.340]
That was so amazing I've got to see both of them together

[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:40.200]
Together I'll give you another hundred bucks if I can see the both of them together

[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.340]
Sarah amazes by the offer since things about it for a second and says

[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:44.300]
How wide hell not?

[02:48:44.540 --> 02:48:47.380]
She opens her robe and gives Chris a nice long chance to cop a look

[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:50.160]
A while later, Tony gets back home from the store

[02:48:50.580 --> 02:48:51.880]
The wife goes up to him and says

[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:53.260]
You know your friend Chris came over

[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:54.400]
Tony says

[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:56.300]
Well did he drop off the 200 bucks he owes me?

[02:48:58.320 --> 02:48:59.000]
Not bad

[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:00.220]
Not great

[02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:01.160]
Not bad

[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:02.840]
You're about three and a half

[02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:07.560]
560-560, pound 560 on the AT&T

[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:09.420]
Mobile in Fort Lauderdale, hello

[02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:13.280]
Hey, I'm talking about a little further north now

[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:16.140]
Like your show, don't get down to Miami much

[02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:20.260]
But I enjoy the topic today and I wanted to share something with you

[02:49:20.260 --> 02:49:20.820]
Yes sir

[02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:25.400]
You mentioned earlier about Blacks and Indians screaming victimization all the time

[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:28.560]
And I've got a case that I've been talking about

[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:30.140]
I didn't say that sir

[02:49:30.140 --> 02:49:33.580]
I did not say that I didn't say scream and victimization

[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:35.180]
I said now they're getting even

[02:49:35.180 --> 02:49:37.080]
Well I mentioned that some other day

[02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:37.780]
That's what I said

[02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:39.960]
No that is what I said

[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:40.560]
All Indians

[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:43.060]
Anyway I think you'll enjoy this stuff

[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:43.920]
That is what I said

[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:44.500]
I live in South Florida

[02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:45.840]
That is what I said

[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:47.740]
Go back to Central Florida, go away

[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:49.000]
We don't want you here

[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:51.700]
How do you like that?

[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:55.100]
See there's nothing more than putting words in my mouth

[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:57.540]
I've had many things in my mouth

[02:49:57.540 --> 02:49:59.480]
But words that I didn't utter that ain't one of them

[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:01.200]
Somebody wants that utter in their mouth

[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:04.340]
Here's a mobile somewhere, hello

[02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:05.120]
Hello

[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:05.740]
Yes sir
