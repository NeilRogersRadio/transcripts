[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]
Ami Frags, invading.

[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.740]
I'm looking through you, Wendy.

[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.220]
York Attorney acting as General Counsel to the PTL Television Network today, confirmed

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.720]
that the ministry intends to file a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S.

[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.700]
Bankruptcy Code.

[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.960]
The Board of Directors voted yesterday to authorize the filing, which he says will allow the

[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.640]
financially beleaguered ministry to continue operating pending a restructuring of its debts.

[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.820]
Miller also says the filing will freeze PTL's assets thereby protecting them from being seized

[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.940]
by creditors and by Jim and Tammy Faye.

[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.160]
I wonder if that the timing of that is just because Jim and Tammy Faye happen to come back

[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.900]
into town yesterday.

[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.480]
Oh no.

[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.460]
They don't want to get their hands on anything, I guess.

[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.620]
That's another problem.

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.000]
I know.

[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.580]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.160]
I just wanted to get into the privacy of his vehicle and hear this by himself.

[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.700]
I have my business, and one of the reasons I don't hire black Americans because they are

[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.240]
very delinquent and estupics.

[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.160]
Oh, that's nice.

[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.980]
Oh, they're saying it.

[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.840]
Wait a minute.

[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.880]
Let's slow down for the benefit of the people who couldn't understand your broken English.

[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.760]
You don't hire black Americans because they're dirty, delinquent and stupid.

[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.420]

[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.340]
They have proof.

[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.580]
They have why?

[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.580]
They have proof.

[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.580]
They've proved it.

[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.100]
Yes.

[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.540]
Now, the other thing is...

[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440]
What's matter, you jealous because there are no Cuban basketball players in the NBA?

[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.180]
Is that your problem?

[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.760]
No.

[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.200]
I mean, you've obviously got a problem.

[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.780]
No.

[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.440]
How about your problem?

[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.340]
I want to tell you, I got this citizenship because that way I can do whatever I want, and

[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.900]
I can put my own people to represent me over there, like Pereira and all these good people

[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.380]
that you are talking about then.

[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.880]
I don't care what they do.

[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.200]
The idea is they have no a deal from a Cuban business.

[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.980]
And listening to this, we don't need like you people.

[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.120]
You can go over there and to leave or not.

[00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.860]
What do you mean by them?

[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.140]
What do you mean like you people?

[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.460]
Who else don't you like beside the blacks?

[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.160]
In other words, you don't like anybody but Cubans, right?

[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.220]
How about black Cubans?

[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.380]
How about all those black Cubans who came over during the Marriott Bolt lift?

[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.980]
You don't like them?

[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.640]
They are okay.

[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.600]
Oh, they're okay.

[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.120]
Okay.

[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.440]
But listening to this.

[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.400]
So it's just American blacks, all depending on where they came from.

[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.860]
If they came from Africa, they're bad.

[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.120]
If they came from Cuba, they're good.

[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.260]
How about Haitians?

[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.200]
Haitians?

[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.660]
Yeah.

[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.460]
No, no, they...

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.480]
Listen, I don't want to know Haitians.

[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.380]
What does that mean?

[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.740]
No.

[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.600]
What kind of an answer is that to the question?

[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.180]
They are pigs.

[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.280]
You want to know that?

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.180]
They are pigs.

[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.340]
They don't like it.

[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.740]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.260]
I want to tell you about...

[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.880]
And what are you?

[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.060]
What are you?

[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.520]
Some kind of a subhuman cretin?

[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.480]
No.

[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.680]
Then what are you?

[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.720]
No, but we...

[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.540]
Sound like one.

[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.860]
You go to an American neighborhood.

[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.120]
You see the...

[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.720]
What is an American neighborhood?

[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.780]
What the hell does that mean?

[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.940]
What is an American neighborhood?

[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.100]
Get out of here.

[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.980]
You moron, you jackass.

[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.600]
You subhuman douchebag.

[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.320]
Scum, that's what you are.

[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.340]
You're human excrement floating around.

[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.640]
Driving the team.

[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.060]
The South is big dreams.

[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.620]
It's just you better.

[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.460]
Watch your step.

[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.040]
Take a step forward.

[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.380]
See them limp down the court.

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.620]
While you're holding up the stretcher.

[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.100]
Can you hold down the fork?

[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.640]
We're parishing fast.

[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.920]
Engine of cast.

[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.820]
Any other team would just be dragging us.

[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.480]
The man got wilder by killing my tail.

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.560]
Angles getting better now.

[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.140]
His wand is bad.

[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.560]
Driving the team.

[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.200]
The South is big dreams.

[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.720]
It's just you better.

[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.600]
Watch your step.

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.260]
Open your eyes.

[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.580]
Then drop it like flies.

[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.560]
You can't give up all the rest of you.

[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.280]
You can keep a good bite.

[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.760]
You can't give up all the rest of you.

[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.140]
You can't give up all the rest of you.

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.360]
Almost made up for losing at Calder yesterday being able to watch.

[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.180]
Mr. Kesai, where you'd end of time or where I ought.

[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.760]
And money from the arms sales to I ran.

[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.940]
Was being illegally devloited to the contrast.

[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.400]
You know Mr. Senator?

[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.240]
I'm glad you asked that question.

[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.500]
Because the countries are guerrilla fighters.

[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.580]
And guerrillas always remind me of the monkeys.

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.340]
And isn't it great that after all these years,

[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.620]
there once again the hard drop of teenagers all across the US of A.

[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.800]
Mr. Kesai, where you just answer the question.

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.860]
Well sir, there's nothing I'd like better.

[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.440]
But on the advice of council, I must regrettably and respectfully decline your request.

[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.720]
But don't go away because I'm going to take the fifth.

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.760]
And of course I can only mean the fifth dimension.

[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.780]
The year was 1967 with this.

[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.540]
It's a case of the chance.

[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.920]
Well the guards removed this man from the train by immediately.

[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.420]
See those mangames on the town of Eicheggak.

[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.580]
26 pairs, 10 at W.I.

[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.820]
Yes.

[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.520]
Are the US?

[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.900]
Okay, it's 11.07 at W.

[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.100]
Oh, that's good.

[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.160]
Oh, that's good.

[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.880]
Turn it up a little louder.

[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.980]
Turn it up a little louder.

[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.240]
Oh, wait a minute, I got a good idea.

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.220]
Wait a minute, I got a good idea.

[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.960]
Wait a minute, I got a good idea.

[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.760]
Oh, they hung up.

[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.160]
Oh, they left.

[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.720]
That was the best call of the day.

[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.900]
That was a good time.

[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.420]
That was the best call of the day.

[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.220]
What line is that on?

[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.020]
That's gone.

[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.360]
That was terrific.

[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.940]
Got a paid phone in Hollywood going back with a phone again.

[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.300]
Great.

[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.580]
Okay, put that one on hold.

[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.220]
Leave that one there.

[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.940]
Can't do it.

[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.260]
Hello.

[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.400]
I'm Mary Smart and trend this year is perfume named after television celebrities.

[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.060]
First, there was crystal for women and Carrington for men.

[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.240]
But now you can also dab on an essence of cause.

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.140]
If you want to smell like money,

[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.300]
hold out to smell like a hairy cat eating extra terrestrial.

[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.260]
And introduce just this week its stench of Oprah,

[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.240]
the overwhelming smell of a big nosy fat woman,

[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.920]
crossing my legs behind my head and tying them in a knot.

[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.660]
I'm Mary Smart entertainment this morning.

[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.240]
Okay, I'm going to be excited when the...

[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]
This is the world.

[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.740]
The world is the world.

[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.480]
The world is the world.

[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.080]
The world is the world.

[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.760]
Your life came running to jobs.

[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.260]
Said, you're your children are dead.

[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.880]
You're a pusher god instead of fazing them instead.

[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.760]
He said, he said, woman, you talk like foolish woman.

[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.800]
You do not talk like my woman.

[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.000]
Because the Lord God did it.

[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.800]
And the Lord God took it away.

[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.820]
Hallelujah, be the name of the Lord.

[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.880]
Hallelujah, be his name.

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.000]
My friends, this is your good friend, the Reverend Moli.

[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.500]
Holy moly.

[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.220]
Invent you all to join us here.

[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.920]
And I cannot tell you how good it makes me feel

[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.880]
to see so many Christian faces here in our player tent tonight.

[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.900]
As you know, we are now going into our tent consecutive year on the air

[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.320]
with our combined faith healing and Christian crusade against communism.

[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.180]
Now, God, God cannot win this battle against the atheist,

[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.220]
communist and conspiracy without your help.

[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:10.200]
God needs your financial aid in this struggle against the communism.

[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.700]
God needs your help. God knows God needs your help.

[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.900]
My friends, my program, The Word of Truth is broadcast to 150 stations

[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.320]
throughout the United States and Canada.

[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.560]
And of course, I need your financial aid to continue this battle against the atheistic communist to conspiracy.

[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.480]
So we ask you to send whatever you can.

[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.820]
Be it a penny, a dime or a dollar to kill a communist for Christ, box to to you for.

[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.740]
Box to to for and tell.

[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.820]
So, oh, oh.

[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.620]
You do it today.

[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.920]
You feel better far.

[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.460]
Come on.

[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.280]
Hear my friend.

[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.920]
My friends, we have witnessed this week as we do every week.

[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.460]
Many poor unfortunate handicapped individual Christian brothers.

[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.840]
Good Lord, it seems that.

[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.640]
Good Lord, it seems that.

[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.260]
It's right from down during Passover.

[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.480]
Why we do not know.

[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.120]
But we do know this, my friends.

[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.440]
If they believe, if Jesus is in my heart, then I can and will cure them here tonight.

[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.580]
All I have to ask is that you give your heart to Jesus.

[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.500]
The first one who does will receive 2500 fame stamps.

[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.340]
All right, now.

[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.320]
May I have my first poor unfortunate.

[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.700]
Will you please step right out here.

[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.040]
You have nothing to be afraid of now.

[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.820]
You are in the 10th of the Lord and you tell us what is your problem.

[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.760]
All Lord, may I come down.

[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.480]
You talk to me.

[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.320]
I talk to the Lord.

[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.160]
All right, thank you.

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.180]
My thumb, she's immobile again.

[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.880]
Immobile, well, my friends.

[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.740]
Immobility, immobility, immobility.

[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.440]
How many times have I heard that tire some praise.

[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.260]
Three times.

[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.380]
All right, now don't fool around us as airtime.

[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.040]
All right, now.

[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.640]
Hold it out there.

[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.320]
Tell me now.

[00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.580]
Do you believe?

[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.320]
Yes, I do.

[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.140]
Are you Christian, thought, and thee?

[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:02.840]
Yes, I am.

[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.900]
Do you go to church every Sunday?

[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.340]
Yes, I do.

[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.480]
All right, then come with me.

[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:06.720]
Hold up.

[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.340]
Oh, Lord, you hear?

[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.860]
Oh, Lord, she's your friend, the Reverend Loli.

[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.280]
Come with me over to W.W.W.W.W.P. and West Virginia.

[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.020]
Hello?

[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.240]
You'll be able to bore him by the hazym's down pretty mobile thumb.

[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.620]
He's been on A.V.M. that thumb since Chabot.

[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.800]
He'll order I ask to invent this boy mobility.

[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.860]
He'll order I ask to cur him as I say those two great words.

[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:26.640]
Say them every day.

[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.860]
Jesus, he all.

[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.620]
Hey, John.

[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.120]
A little more face.

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.180]
A little more face.

[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.980]
It's a money in the pot and the way out my friends.

[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.720]
He was not cured because Jesus was not in his heart.

[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.220]
Was he not cured?

[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.640]
There was.

[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.180]
You heard his accent.

[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.020]
He came up from Godless Cuba.

[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.400]
The spict comes out here.

[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.200]
What's God's decree?

[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.760]
My friends, God will not cure those spicts.

[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.100]
They won't let Jesus in the house.

[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.820]
They're not helping for a frame.

[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.360]
Then until I did, I'm not cured and spict won.

[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.240]
All right, man.

[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.480]
My friends, I am the word of truth.

[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:09.940]
Hey, man.

[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.440]
I will tell you things the government never's not.

[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:12.960]
Tell you.

[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.900]
The government says to me, hush up.

[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.700]
They say, hush up, forever, my wife.

[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.760]
I will not.

[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.320]
Hush up.

[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.320]
I will sleep the truth.

[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.520]
I will tell you what the government there's not.

[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.040]
Tell you.

[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.940]
The government says you will not accept the truth.

[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.720]
I say you will.

[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.740]
You know what's happening to stay in Florida?

[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.400]
Tell us.

[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:27.900]
All right.

[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.660]
Giant frogs are eating people in Florida.

[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.560]
Giant tormenting frogs.

[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.600]
They're eating people in Florida.

[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.220]
And they are devouring whole towns in Florida.

[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.340]
And if you think I'm lying, what was the last time anyone here

[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.380]
got a call from Tampa?

[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:44.940]
All right.

[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.600]
You think about that, my friends.

[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.760]
My friends, I say these are gallous eight theistic frogs

[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.640]
bred in coming to Cuba.

[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.340]
I say, cast a beacon.

[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.680]
And now the shed of night and shit's about to daydk.

[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.120]
Telling to hang around a fountain of the hotel.

[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.020]
And people say to me, happy you noticed.

[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:05.920]
How do you notice?

[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.440]
There's one.

[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.120]
All right.

[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.780]
We know.

[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.220]
We know these frogs come from Godless Cuba.

[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.960]
We have photographs of large number of Cuban refugees

[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.400]
arriving in this country with words.

[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.700]
More than that.

[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.720]
More than that, my friends.

[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.320]
We have with us tonight a gentleman who is living poop.

[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.240]
He's going to give us mute testimony in an oral way.

[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.480]
So what he saw.

[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.720]
He has come up here from Dave County by any day choke out

[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.080]
fountain to let his own expense of the great personal loss.

[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.660]
And he is going to tell us what he saw and what he heard in his own

[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.420]
Christian words.

[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.480]
The place day I got there.

[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.120]
What's your matter?

[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.380]
Are you one of us?

[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.880]
I'm a converter.

[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.220]
That's all right.

[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.060]
That's quite all right.

[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.840]
I understand that he was too.

[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.600]
All right, man.

[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.180]
You go ahead.

[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:02.820]
I heard that.

[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.320]
All right.

[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:03.700]
Yeah.

[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.900]
But what happened was I was sitting behind you know by the pool in the back

[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.440]
on the Sunday.

[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.040]
And suddenly I heard enough not just sound.

[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:11.900]
It's terrible sound.

[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.740]
It's terrible sound.

[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.420]
It got less sound.

[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.820]
It got less sound.

[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.820]
It's the air.

[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.020]
Now, would you reproduce the hideous sound of the Communist frog for us

[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.420]
here tonight?

[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600]
Would you reproduce that sound?

[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:22.900]
Ready?

[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:23.820]
Oh my God.

[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.420]
I've never heard anything like that.

[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.580]
I've never heard anything like that.

[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.700]
My friends, if you got a senior neighborhood, a senior neighborhood,

[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.740]
a senior neighborhood, I want you to squash it.

[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.080]
Kill it.

[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:35.880]
Kill it.

[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.100]
Kill it.

[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:36.540]
Kill it.

[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.420]
Kill it.

[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:48.320]
God can't take that chance.

[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.340]
Now, what did you do?

[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.720]
What did you do?

[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.620]
You heard that sound.

[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.280]
What did you do?

[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.580]
I came to where my wife, Walter, was diving off.

[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.320]
She loves to dive.

[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.140]
A big woman.

[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.300]
She was diving off the top ball.

[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.080]
And she was halfway down in a beautiful cannonball.

[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.940]
And suddenly a gigantic tongue whipped out.

[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240]
Grab the...

[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.480]
It's the biggest, 12-y mouth I ever saw in my life.

[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.580]
It can't be this far.

[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.060]
Definitely.

[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360]
I recognize the uniform.

[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.220]
Hey, you're...

[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.860]
All right.

[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.140]
Now, did you go to her age?

[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.060]
I either went.

[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.340]
And I haven't been able to move the head since.

[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.980]
God, you know what I said.

[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.960]
God said I would use this bar as an example.

[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.440]
God said that I did.

[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.620]
All right. Now, hold it up there.

[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:29.720]
Do you believe?

[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.560]
Yes, I do.

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.940]
Are you fishing by the lead?

[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:32.860]
Blately.

[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.580]
Do you go to church or something?

[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.200]
I do.

[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.120]
Have you even washed him a blood of the lamb?

[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.940]
I can't even imagine that.

[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.560]
I'm going to...

[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.300]
It's three-way.

[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.660]
I'm going to go land now.

[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.200]
I'm going to go land now.

[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.340]
I'm going to go land now.

[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.140]
We don't do it, it sounds good.

[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.360]
What's in the wild, you'll get a seed.

[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.140]
There's a lot of you going to go.

[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.080]
That's all right.

[00:14:59.200 --> 00:14:59.940]
Hold it up there now.

[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.740]
Long you believe.

[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.660]
That's from the bottom.

[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.500]
All right.

[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.380]
Hold on.

[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.900]
Oh, Lord, look at me.

[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.880]
Oh, Lord, you have the twist in that pan.

[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.000]
Lord, he is sorry.

[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.940]
Oh, Lord, I believe you.

[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.320]
He is sorry.

[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.020]
I'm kind of...

[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.200]
Lord, I asked you now, to please it for the Lord.

[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.180]
But this is Lord.

[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.000]
To please make that one hand like the other.

[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.140]
To Lord, I beg of you, make that one hand like the other.

[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.080]
To Lord, please make that one hand like the other.

[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.320]
So Lord, I say what I said was here.

[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.420]
Oh my God, he did.

[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.840]
Lord, you've got the wrong hand here.

[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.100]
Lord, you've got the wrong hand, Lord.

[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.260]
Oh, Lord, he's on the road.

[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:32.660]
Go along.

[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.200]
Go along there, son.

[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.380]
I can't hear that puppy or not, I can't hear it.

[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.280]
Come on, large shape up.

[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.000]
Our last word unfortunate of the evening is a face that is familiar to many of you.

[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.820]
He was with us last week. He was not cured.

[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.960]
But through your cards and letters, you voted him most popular, and so he is back again.

[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.440]
You can write up here now. You have nothing to be afraid of. You can write up here now.

[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.080]
There he is. All right. There you go. There you go.

[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.480]
I'd like to thank everybody who voted for me.

[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.900]
All right. Well, see if we can't get that big vote in the sky.

[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.780]
All right, man. You tell us.

[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.080]
You tell us what is your problem.

[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.100]
I got these tight shoes.

[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.100]
I can't hear it.

[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.220]
Oh, holy moly, I'm a mess.

[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.560]
All right. Here we go.

[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.120]
Now you tell us, can I do you believe?

[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.200]
Do you believe?

[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.860]
Do you party, you believe?

[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.840]
You got your finger on my ear.

[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.420]
That's the good one, yeah.

[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.060]
That's all right.

[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.400]
Do you believe?

[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.180]
Yes, I do.

[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.020]
Are you Christian and Bob and me?

[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.720]
Yes, I am.

[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.080]
Are you going to church every Sunday?

[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:06.740]
Yes, I do.

[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.440]
Have you been washed in the blood of the oil?

[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.980]
I tried everything hard.

[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.100]
And come with me.

[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.800]
Oh, Lord, look at here.

[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.780]
Oh, Lord, hear me now.

[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.760]
Lord, I know that we only have a few moments of your precious air time left.

[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.340]
But Lord, I ask, you know, Lord, do you say Lord?

[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.960]
I ask, you know, Lord, I ask you to sit down.

[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.540]
The electricity of the honey goes to Lord.

[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.240]
I ask, you know, Lord, I ask you to speak to Lord.

[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.900]
I ask you to make a sound, Lord.

[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.440]
I ask you to speak this mind.

[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.860]
I ask you to speak this arms.

[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.180]
I ask you to speak this bag.

[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.520]
I ask you to speak to Lord.

[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.420]
I ask you to make a call, Christian and your army.

[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.160]
Oh, Lord, I'll beg of you.

[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:44.560]
Amen.

[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.460]
There's a more faith for some.

[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.500]
Put some money in the apartment way.

[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.540]
I'll try again next week.

[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.880]
Now my friends, these young people.

[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.100]
You know, look, you did it.

[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.420]
You've given me a straight.

[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.560]
You've voted me.

[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.820]
I support you.

[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.900]
I assistance you to it.

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:14.900]

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:14.900]

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:14.900]

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:14.900]

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.480]
In the name of Jesus Christ to me, I say,

[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:20.620]

[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.520]
I beg of you and pray for me to you.

[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:21.520]

[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.340]
If you're worthy and beloved,向祂."

[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.720]
When the fire of God comes out of your Todo Christ,

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:22.720]

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:22.720]

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:22.720]

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:22.720]

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:22.740]
Jesus Christ craves your own recyclines and you'llней

[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.020]
I see world, most centuries in every world.

[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.020]

[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.320]
Jesus Christ who speaks and stole it from your teachings.

[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:25.320]

[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.300]
I call it the Rogers.

[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.880]
Somebody can sleep.

[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.800]
That's the smoke eater, folks.

[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.620]
Do you believe that?

[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.640]
Doesn't make any noise, right?

[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.500]
Of course not. It's just our imagination.

[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:49.780]
Adios.

[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.420]
We're just losing it today, folks.

[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.500]
It's all slipping through our fingers.

[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.940]
Here's a letter that we got today that I think we ought to share with the audience, don't you?

[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.240]
Major came on yesterday and he blamed you for the fact that he didn't get any calls in the

[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:15.940]
beginning of the show.

[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:16.440]
Mm-hmm.

[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.420]
Well, you know, whatever happens, it's my fault.

[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.140]
You have a mic on top of the smoke eater?

[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.760]
Oh yeah, it's on. Keep it on.

[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.480]
That's to the talk what the teletype is to the news.

[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.120]
Oh, that's part of our new format here at Winds.

[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.900]
If we got the pot open all the way, good.

[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.140]
Good. Good. That's good.

[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.840]
Dear Mr. Rogers, Glen Hill on cart.

[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.360]
Just when I think I'm listening to FM, I hear Glen Hill cackle in the middle of

[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.180]
money is too tight to mention and know that he hasn't found a real job yet.

[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.500]
I love the music.

[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.220]
Keep the music.

[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.940]
He puts it at a shame and besides,

[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.480]
Zeta doesn't have Glen Hill.

[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.100]
It's better than the Stephen Edie show.

[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.680]
If Steve had Michael DeSisto cackle on cart,

[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.680]
Aralus had Brian Norcross tittering, it wouldn't be the same.

[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.700]
Keep the Glen Hill cart.

[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.380]
We have some morbid fascination with Glen Hill.

[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.340]
Tweety birds should go into syndication.

[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.040]
The old prunes probably hate the music.

[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.720]
They hated what you said, but now they have to contend with.

[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.720]
I want your sex by George Michael.

[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:27.320]
The last time they remember sex is when they had their last animal.

[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:27.920]
Oh god.

[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.300]
Oh god is what they said.

[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.140]
You can really satisfy Fowler's fascination with Rantel.

[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.060]
Fowler's quote, yes, I'm jealous.

[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.500]
I settled for program director when I knew I could do talk or at least polls

[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.940]
by playing Paul Simon's myth of fingerprints off his Graceland album.

[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.860]
Come see us over on the FM.

[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.700]
We might have it on CD or at least on Edison's cylinder.

[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.420]
We like Stan, at least we don't have to wonder whether she's Donner Rice under that school

[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.900]
teacher with her hair in a bun, Ernie's quote.

[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.560]
What does that mean?

[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.080]
I don't know that.

[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.520]
I don't know that.

[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.100]
Well, we have to get back to our drug-induced listeners.

[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.040]
Keep up the great work.

[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:00.880]
See what peaches.

[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.540]
And surely Jeff Gonser and Jeff Chase, aka Glen Hill.

[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.320]
Now, I don't think that Gonser and Chase were probably ideal.

[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:07.920]
Huh?

[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.200]
Is it possible?

[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.780]
It's like Don Johnson.

[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.880]
I'm not sure.

[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:13.940]
We don't really know.

[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.920]
No, we don't really know.

[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.040]
Well, I don't know which is worse.

[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.500]
I'm hearing you in one channel and I hear the smoke heater out of the other one.

[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.880]
It's like stereo on AM.

[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.320]
Don't we complement each other?

[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.180]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.040]
Okay, maybe we'll take a poll.

[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.560]
Which is the most annoying sound?

[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.240]
The smoke heater humming in the background or Tweety Bird cackling over to my right.

[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.920]
Which one just makes you nauseous?

[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.880]
It's AM stereo.

[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.180]
Well, actually, the smoke heater is a voice heater.

[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.900]
What it's designed to do is to get your voice off the ear.

[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.200]
I'm here.

[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.720]
It just eats up the sound waves off of that mic.

[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.900]
I'm here to bother people.

[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.000]
Yeah, and you're doing a great job of it, man.

[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.940]
They're hysterical.

[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.420]
I know.

[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.880]
By the time Major came on yesterday,

[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.860]
there was no audience.

[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.320]
No measurable audience.

[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.060]
That's what he said.

[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.740]
You know, here I sit here leaving him the biggest audience in daytime radio in this market.

[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.960]
And he has the audacity to come on here.

[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.840]
What did Neil do?

[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:05.720]
What did Neil do?

[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.700]
I heard that yesterday.

[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.520]
What did I do?

[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.520]
Must have been Glenn Hill's.

[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.920]
Well, his guest today is going to be the Kapo De Tudi.

[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.480]
What the hell does that mean?

[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.360]
Would you want to be the Kapo De Tudi?

[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.700]
That's seriously.

[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.760]
With the mafia, they have all these different titles.

[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.160]
There's the Kapo De regime and the Kapo De Tudi and the Kahn Salieri.

[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.040]
And maybe we can get a lesson today for the audience.

[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:29.620]
Maybe some...

[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.540]
Remember, we had the first time when we had what's your name on?

[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.680]
Sam Giancana's daughter Antoinette on the phone.

[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.720]
The second time when she was here in the studio,

[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.320]
we got no response.

[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.720]
But the first time was amazing.

[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.460]
We got all these mafia people calling in.

[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:42.720]
Really?

[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.240]
They were all in the grave.

[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.380]
They all lived down here, darling.

[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.260]
They lived my show.

[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.020]
It was great.

[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:47.880]
Yeah, they loved it.

[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.940]
And they just...

[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.660]
Homes down here.

[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.520]
Yeah, over there in...

[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:51.880]
What is it?

[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:52.700]
Golden Beach.

[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.220]
Sure.

[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:53.760]
Of course.

[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.300]
Right over there by Hallendale.

[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.280]
And we appreciate all of you listening.

[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.020]
We're thrilled to have you.

[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.340]
Maybe we ought to do the rest of the show for the mafia today.

[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.820]
And listen, they're having some rough time.

[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.520]
We ought to...

[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.360]
You know, we like to share things with people who are going through rough times in life.

[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.400]
Let's take a call from Pembert Pines while you're here

[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.660]
and see if they're more upset about you, the mafia, or the smoke eater.

[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:21.960]
Hello?

[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:23.940]
Are you there?

[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.820]
Pembert Pines disappeared.

[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.480]
North Miami.

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:26.940]
Hello.

[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.200]
No?

[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:28.800]
Yes.

[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:29.980]
My name's Ali Yul.

[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:30.420]
Okay.

[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.040]
I'm calling about...

[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.720]
I'm calling about...

[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:33.920]
Hello?

[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:34.720]
Yes.

[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.480]
I'm calling a reference about the remodeling of the maid earlier.

[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.320]
You're wrong.

[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.520]
You think that none of the Haitians listened to your I-maheation

[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.400]
and I do listen to you and I don't take anything personal?

[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:45.820]
Good.

[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.240]
Well, I told them that all the Haitians listened to this show.

[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.880]
He didn't want to believe.

[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.820]
I enjoy listening to you in regards to anybody.

[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.140]
It doesn't bother me.

[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.000]
Well, what do you think about that contrived thing that took place here on the weekend?

[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.460]
All those people dragged out here.

[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.620]
Didn't even know what station this was.

[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.360]
Even took it personal.

[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.280]
I mean, if they know that it's not them,

[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.520]
they should have even bothered.

[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.040]
If they came out here, then it proved that they were...

[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.740]
They're proven what's done, whatever he said was true.

[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.340]
Exactly. That's a very good point.

[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.100]
I never thought of that.

[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:15.420]
I did.

[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:15.920]
Yeah.

[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.240]
I listen to you every morning and I go to work listening to you

[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.320]
and whatever anything I say,

[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.600]
I listen to you as a bother near that.

[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.360]
Yeah, that's an old American saying.

[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.100]
If the cat fits, kill it.

[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.900]
Okay, you have a good saying.

[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.400]
You too.

[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.400]
Thank you. That's great.

[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.140]
That's a good call.

[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:32.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.000]
That was a good call.

[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.380]
I agree.

[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.860]
We have a lot of nice Asian people out there listening to this show.

[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:37.920]
Sure.

[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.120]
Nightcree.

[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.260]
You're right.

[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.500]
Downtown Miami.

[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:44.940]
Hello.

[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.580]
Hello, Neil.

[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.020]
How you doing?

[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:46.500]
Okay.

[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.380]
All right.

[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.440]
First of all, who does the Vatican rag it

[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.660]
and is it available on record?

[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.120]
Yes.

[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:51.820]
Yes.

[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.400]
Oh, Tom Lear, L-E-H-R-E-R.

[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.360]
And it's on an album called That Was The Year That Was.

[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.640]
It's on Reprise Records, R-E-P-R-I-S-E.

[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.160]
And if Peeches can order it or any big records

[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.000]
to it, they don't have it.

[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.440]
They can order it.

[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.420]
Okay.

[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.440]
Can I do that?

[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.940]
Also, I have a special request for that

[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.400]
a request.

[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.140]
Pee is the rock that I called out from under by a Tammy.

[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:19.760]
Special.

[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.320]
Tammy Faye.

[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.220]
Special request.

[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:21.960]
Yeah, that.

[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.520]
Now while I'm looking for it, I want you to reprise.

[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.080]
Yeah, that's what I always call it.

[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:28.660]
Reprise.

[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.920]
Not reprise.

[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:30.760]
I always called it.

[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.800]
Oh, get out of here.

[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.380]
Refreeze.

[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.760]
While I'm looking for that, I want you to tell me which one is

[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.680]
annoying you the most now.

[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.760]
The sound of the uh,

[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.300]
vocal, the cackler.

[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.420]
The cackle.

[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.980]
I can't hear the uh, the mosquito.

[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.400]
The mosquito thing, yeah, the mosquito fryer.

[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:48.460]
Yeah.

[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.920]
That's a great thing about it.

[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.780]
It kills bugs in the studio until it's getting close.

[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.460]
Well, that's because we had all these patients come out here on Saturday.

[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.140]
Only kidding.

[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.240]
Now that's just a joke.

[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.460]
Just a joke.

[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.520]
The guy had a, I think he had two wives and four cats.

[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:03.920]
What?

[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.820]
There was some guy, you said he was four wives and two cats or two wives and four.

[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.180]
Oh, yeah, I remember that guy.

[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.120]
Have I got any of the strange?

[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.980]
I was going to call out, but I wonder if the godfather is cute up again,

[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:17.520]
or if it's.

[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.260]
I think so.

[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.700]
I always take my life and my hands when I open that pot.

[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.100]
I really do.

[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.640]
Well, listen, you want to hear Tammy Faye, huh?

[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.040]
Yeah, please.

[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.560]
What does Tammy Faye do for you?

[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.100]
Um, not much, really.

[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.340]
Really?

[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.080]
Really?

[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.800]
Well, maybe she'd like to do something for you.

[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.860]
Maybe you could go shopping and T.J. Maxx with her one day.

[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.460]
That's an idea.

[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.800]
Okay, have a great day, sir.

[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.580]
You too. Thank you.

[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.560]
In a wonderful life.

[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.740]
Finally, but 10 record sets.

[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.120]
You've been waiting for.

[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.540]
Tammy Faye's unbelievable new album.

[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.040]
Here's the rock.

[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.280]
I crawled out from under.

[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.900]
I put six p.m. tons of makeup on.

[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.900]
Then my husband does it with Jessica Hound.

[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.180]
Oh, very far cold.

[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.200]
And go, I will.

[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.800]
A most strong man with on boobs and pants.

[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.500]
It's all here.

[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.400]
The headache.

[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.540]
The heartache.

[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.980]
The pancake.

[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.980]
The rocket weight just is my face.

[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:36.440]
My mascara only rays.

[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.640]
Tammy Faye's here's the rock that I crawled out from under.

[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.960]
Won't you buy my new album?

[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.420]
If you don't, you're burning hair.

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.520]
You're belly-wee-yo.

[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.100]
Thank you, God bless you.

[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:46.740]
Are you?

[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:47.920]
Okay.

[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.700]
Glenn is gurgling.

[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.800]
He's making gurgling sounds now.

[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.760]
Usually he caccles, but during the playing of that, he was making gurgling sounds.

[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.140]
Before he leaves the studio, he's going to tell us the name of that this jerk.

[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.480]
I have to do that.

[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.600]
Has nicknamed her husband's genitals, hermen and mcbeens.

[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.420]
Also, we want to promote a new show on Zeta since they are after all our sister station.

[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.900]
They have that little segment every day called the sole patrol.

[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.860]
And I hear it through the grapevine.

[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.960]
I haven't confirmed it that they have a new segment today.

[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.100]
And I'm not sure I really understand what it's all about.

[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.540]
It's called the whole patrol.

[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.120]
That's coming on Zeta at about one o'clock.

[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.380]
So that ought to be a real winner.

[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.280]
Pemberg Pines, hello.

[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.180]
One in nail.

[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:29.660]
How you doing?

[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.220]
Okay, first time call it.

[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.420]
Nilo is wondering if you received something in the mail called the PHS formula.

[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.280]
Yes, I did.

[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.040]
You mean for winning at the track, I haven't in my car as a matter of fact.

[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.860]
Okay, I'm the fellow who sent it to you.

[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.980]
Well, I'll tell you now, I know in the beginning you said on there that system

[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.680]
that it seems pretty bizarre.

[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.840]
And I will say that it does.

[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.960]
I just glanced at it.

[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.640]
And I don't know.

[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.060]
I have my doubts.

[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:52.940]
Does it really work?

[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.980]
Well, it's worked for me for 12 years.

[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.840]
Really? Are you not working?

[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:57.940]
You just go to the track?

[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.120]
Uh, no, I don't even go to the track anymore.

[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.220]
I'm a flimmer owner and breeder.

[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.580]
Who developed this system.

[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.420]
And now I'm, excuse me, now I make my living selling this system.

[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.700]
And I have an awful lot of testimonials.

[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.060]
And awful lot of people like it.

[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.900]
And I want to know if you've given it a shot yet.

[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.720]
Well, I'll tell you, I'm so desperate these days.

[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.180]
Next time I go out to Calder, I'll give it a try.

[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.020]
Well, please do.

[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.460]
I think you'll be very happy with it.

[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.160]
Good. Thanks a lot.

[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.000]
I appreciate it.

[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.660]
Okay.

[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.240]
When anybody who can't hear the sound of that smoke eater

[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.060]
has got to be deaf,

[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.660]
the guy on the phone said he couldn't hear it.

[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.540]
Well, he was deaf.

[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.520]
It's incredible in here.

[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.780]
It's real loud in here.

[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.660]
I have to go out and listen on my radio,

[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.520]
out in the office and see if I can hear it.

[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:45.880]
I'll let you know.

[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:46.860]
What do you mean if you can hear it?

[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.260]
That's the monitor you're listening to.

[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.920]
Now dummy, that's not it.

[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:50.820]
That's the monitor.

[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.860]
It's real loud.

[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.800]
It's louder.

[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.160]
That means it's.

[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:56.780]
What was that?

[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.180]
What kind of a non-sequitur was that?

[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.940]
Kind of a moronic statement was that.

[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.860]
I'm the king of non-sequiturs.

[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.100]
Yeah.

[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.260]
Or something close.

[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.160]
Listen to that.

[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.520]
Now, what do you people in the audience do

[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.720]
about the militant non-smokers in your office?

[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.880]
Or in your home?

[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.780]
Or in your restaurant?

[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.320]
What a disgusting sound.

[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.980]
Yeah, a woman called in to say she can hear it.

[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:25.300]
Good.

[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.940]
And she doesn't even have a radio on.

[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.100]
So in the neighborhood?

[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:31.880]
Exactly.

[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.720]
Somebody who was out there for that rally

[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.520]
for that, um,

[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.840]
sanary ritual on Saturday.

[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.360]
By the way, they're still selling souvenirs

[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.460]
from Saturday's get together.

[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.060]
They have stand-made your voodoo dolls

[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.560]
that they're selling out in the corner at 207th and the palm.

[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.120]
Okay, a man,

[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.000]
he had a mobile phone.

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.020]
No, a man in plantation.

[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:54.740]
Well, that's close.

[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.840]
That's just as good.

[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.020]
Man in plantation said

[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.700]
that there is a

[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.020]
terrible

[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.840]
buzz on the radio,

[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.160]
on the ear.

[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:13.060]
Yeah.

[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.360]
He's probably got a terrible buzz

[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.220]
from what he's smoking over there in plantation.

[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.760]
He's probably out there clearing the ground

[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.920]
for that new shopping center

[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.280]
that nobody wants to tell us about.

[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.480]
Boy, that's just enough to drive you nuts.

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.060]
And you notice they've just abandoned us now.

[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.980]
It's like they've left that in here.

[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.340]
And Gary Lawrence comes in.

[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.820]
Oh, the girls are getting sick in the office.

[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.140]
Their eyes are tearing.

[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.600]
And I try to explain them.

[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.500]
That's only on payday.

[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.640]
It's only when they open up those checks.

[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.160]
Your eyes would tear too if you saw that.

[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.860]
And he evidently didn't find a lot of humor in that.

[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.260]
I don't know.

[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.240]
It didn't?

[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:47.600]
No.

[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.480]
He gave me some kind of a signal.

[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.180]
I think it meant your number one or something.

[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:52.520]
Yeah.

[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.200]
Middle finger.

[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.140]
What made me nervous was when Richard Van Hook came in here

[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.140]
and you told him it was

[00:31:59.140 --> 00:31:59.560]
arcing.

[00:31:59.760 --> 00:31:59.840]
Yeah.

[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.160]
And he ran away from it.

[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:01.720]
And he ran.

[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.400]
That's our chief engineer, folks.

[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.300]
He ran away from the smoke eater.

[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:05.960]
He went.

[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:06.580]
It was.

[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.160]
And he ran out of here.

[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.120]
So like a maniac.

[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.980]
In fact, he and Mark Riffin are running up and down the hall

[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.260]
screaming and shouting right now.

[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.300]
When in question or in doubt,

[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.100]
running circles scream and shout.

[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.460]
That's our slogan here at Winds.

[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.160]
That's what's brought us to this position of prominence

[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.580]
in the South Florida radio market.

[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.240]
Exactly.

[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.880]
In fact, when they have their corporate board meetings,

[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.240]
that's what Bob Gilbertson gets up and says in Portland,

[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:29.620]
Maine.

[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.060]
When in question or in doubt,

[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.040]
running circles scream and shout.

[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.420]
When it's got its radio jammed up, Miami.

[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:35.820]
Hello.

[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:36.560]
Hello.

[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.460]
The audience up and let them feel like,

[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.580]
yeah, that's good.

[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.400]
Like they're right here in the studio with us.

[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.760]
It's a copy of a letter.

[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.980]
Well, it's addressed to me so I can read it on the ear.

[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.720]
I have two copies that were one hand delivered in one sent by certified male

[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.040]
and one by certified mule.

[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.680]
Dear Mr. Lawrence, we have been requested by our client, Mr. Rick Shaw.

[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.100]
To contact you in connection with the outrageous and defamatory statements

[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.380]
uttered on the ear by your employee, Neil Rogers,

[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:13.360]
during his radio broadcasts on June 13, 1987 and June 15, 1987.

[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.040]
During the aforementioned broadcast, Mr. Rogers referred to our client as a

[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.760]
Nazi on three separate occasions.

[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.520]
As you are aware, such references, particularly in the South Florida area,

[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.300]
conjure up extreme emotion and hysteria to members of the listening audience.

[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.660]
These statements are totally false and defamatory and made with malicious intent

[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.440]
to defame Mr. Shaw in both his professional and personal life.

[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.960]
We hear by demand on behalf of our client that both WI and Z and Mr.

[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:49.060]
Rogers broadcast a retraction on the ear in accordance with Chapter 770 Florida statutes.

[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.740]
In the event that a full retraction of said defamatory statements is not broadcast within

[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.260]
10 days of the date of this letter, we will recommend to our client to immediately

[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.520]
institute litigation for the recovery of compensatory and tuneative damages

[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.120]
against WI and Z and Mr. Neil Rogers individually, Jan D. Atlus attorney.

[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.320]
Here is another one.

[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:11.720]
Wait a minute.

[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.940]
Here is a third copy.

[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:19.800]
I want to make sure it says all the same things before I begin my response.

[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.680]
Yes, it is the same thing.

[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.080]
So we have one, two, three strikes in your out three copies of the letter from

[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.620]
Capella Witsandless, Perlman and Trump.

[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.280]
Well, it is interesting.

[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.140]
There are a lot of apologies and retractions being demanded here at Windsor last few days.

[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:40.740]
And there are a lot of overly sensitive people in and out of the business who have no

[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.700]
sense of humor whatsoever.

[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.820]
And certainly Mr. Shaw, aka Richard Hummel, is one of those.

[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.620]
And all I can say, I want to get to my dictionary first.

[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.440]
And I couldn't nitpick.

[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.780]
I could really make a case here because I don't know Rick Shaw personally.

[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:55.860]
I've never met the man.

[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.800]
I would recognize him because he is bald with that silly blue hat.

[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:06.080]
But I will say this that in the dictionary that I have the Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary,

[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.940]
there are two definitions of Nazi.

[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.440]
One capitalized, a member of German fascist party, etc., and so on.

[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.460]
And I'm sure that the one with a capital in would be the one that would

[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.400]
arouse the kind of emotion that the attorneys in this letter are referring to.

[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.720]
The second one, not always capitalized, one held to resemble a German Nazi.

[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.420]
And unfortunately, I've had the bad personal misfortune of coming in contact with several

[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.120]
people who have worked with for or around Mr. Shaw.

[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.460]
And they have been responsible for referring to him in such grotesque terms.

[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.640]
Not having met him, it's certainly unfair for me to refer to him in that manner because I don't

[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.900]
know him personally. Although I will say that when one looks up fascism, if we carry it from the

[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:54.160]
second definition of Nazi with a small end, the second definition of fascism is a tendency toward

[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.140]
or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control.

[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:03.080]
So you see, it really has nothing specifically to do with the Nazi party or swastikers or with

[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.620]
that repugnant group of subhumans who are responsible for the extermination of so many

[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:12.020]
millions of people. But naturally, when you're listening on the radio, you can't tell when we say

[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:17.200]
Nazi, whether we're indicating with a capital in or a small end. And I'm not going to debase my

[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.920]
sub to the poem. I'm going to get into a semantical argument with the attorneys or Mr. Shaw,

[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:27.560]
aka Richard Hummel, because that would be pointless. I am hereby giving a full total and absolute

[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.680]
unconditional retraction of those scandalous remarks. I mean, it's very possible that those people

[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:38.140]
who worked for Mr. Shaw have grudges to bear were misinformed, that those people could all have

[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:44.320]
been mistaken, that they had a false impression. Who am I to make that judgment? So I am absolutely

[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:49.140]
positively. What happened to my lighter, by the way? Somebody steal my lighter? Without a shadow

[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:55.680]
of a doubt, giving at this moment 10, 13 AM June 17, 1987, a full and total remark. In fact,

[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.760]
I'll even go to the point of apologizing to Mr. Shaw aka Richard Hummel for having made those

[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:07.760]
remarks. They were intemperant in poor taste and very possibly incorrect. However,

[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.640]
in my own personal opinion, I think that Mr. Shaw aka Richard Hummel is a douchebag,

[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.720]
is a disgrace to the radio industry. And again, this is only my own personal opinion.

[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.880]
I think that his brogue, his phony brogue on the air, his disgusting two-minute talk-ups to records,

[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:30.040]
the fact that he's doing things that he did 30 years ago in a year, are tasteless, are shameful.

[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:35.920]
But again, that's only my personal opinion as a listener to Waxi 105.9 on occasion. So again,

[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:40.940]
on the one hand, I do offer a full apology and retraction of the comments, Mr. Shaw is not a Nazi,

[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.900]
those comments should never have been made in the first place. But on the other hand, again,

[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:49.480]
and only expressing a personal opinion, not trying to influence the audience in any way, shape or manner,

[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.800]
I do offer my strong personal opinion that when it comes to this industry, when it comes to broad

[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.900]
casting, when it comes to professionalism, when it comes to that ugly blue cap, Mr. Shaw aka Richard

[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:07.220]
Hummel, perhaps is a douchebag in the broadest general sense of the term. And while you're sitting

[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.420]
here laughing and gurgling, I have no idea because this happens to be a very serious matter.

[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.460]
Okay, is that enough said about that? You know, this we did the talk up on that record.

[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:29.520]
I was just in honor of Rick Shaw aka Richard Hummel. And now, seriously, if the man is offended,

[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:36.000]
and if he took it personally, I have the greatest sorrow and regret. And, you know, what can I say?

[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:41.600]
I mean, there are some people who just don't have any sense of humor. And what can we say that we

[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.720]
haven't said before, right? Have a lot of question Mark, me on this morning, don't we?

[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:57.900]
A lot. So Mr. Shaw, we're sorry. I apologize. We retract it. Full retraction. We have several

[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:03.880]
witnesses in the building. We've made a full and total retraction. Mr. Shaw is not a Nazi. I have never

[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:10.620]
seen his party card. I have no reason to believe that he holds one. Am I right? Have no reason to

[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.980]
have said that. No, I take that back. I do have reason to have said it because I was unduly influenced

[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:19.580]
by former Waxie employees who again may have been spreading malicious misinformation.

[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:26.020]
Now, those people, those people perhaps ought to be the targets of some kind of investigation

[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.200]
for spreading that kind of malicious misinformation. I have a letter here. You want to talk about how

[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.080]
bright the people in the audience are? We have a letter. Did we, didn't we ask you to send a stamped

[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:41.100]
self-adreced envelope for the boon in the box pictures? Well, here's a guy who sent a stamped self-adreced

[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.760]
envelope. The only problem is he got his address wrong. Now, wait a minute. I want confirmation. I

[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.760]
see that old pinhead up there is in the control room now. Was that sufficient or should we do it over

[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:59.740]
again? It's James Hummel. Oh, wait a minute. Okay. Now I got to do the whole retraction over again

[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:05.440]
because I was given more misinformation by Glenn Hill of all people. What a disgrace.

[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:15.520]
So to Rick Shaw, aka James Hummel, we offer our sincerest apology. We offer a full retraction.

[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.380]
Those comments should never have been said. They were in temperate. They were in port taste. The

[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:28.080]
man is not a Nazi with a capital N. In spite of some of the scurrilous and scandalous remarks that

[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.680]
have been made about him by former co-workers. I don't want to mention any names. Although one is

[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.760]
standing very close to this studio right at the moment. I'm not mentioning any names.

[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.420]
One just disappeared very rapidly from the news booth.

[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.940]
So you see, it's another's a very good lesson to be learned in all of this. Don't be

[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.180]
unduly influenced by sore losers. You know, I mean, if there are people out there have an

[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.420]
extra grind with you, Rick. That's their problem. I don't know you. I haven't met you. I do think

[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.040]
you reduced back on the air, but that has nothing to do with the Nazi party or any of this other

[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:08.640]
scandalous stuff that's been said. And I fully and totally retract those scandalous scurrilous

[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:14.640]
remarks. They were defamatory, disgusting, and temperate, and I'm sorry. And if we had

[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.860]
brendily in our collection, I guarantee you I would play I'm sorry by brendily for the rest of the

[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:27.580]
hour. I have no idea how to apologize sufficiently to Rick Shaw aka James Hummel. I mean, next time give

[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.960]
me the right name. Would you please, if you're going to give me some name? You are just a fountain

[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.140]
of misinformation. In fact, I think most of the problem can be traced back to Glenn Hill,

[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:45.780]
who is a fountain of scurrilous and scandalous misinformation, who is a spier of untruths,

[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:53.160]
who is a radio hatchet man, who uses his position at W.I.N.C. now to take out his personal

[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:04.240]
rights with former employees and co-workers. And of course, that's Legion legendary on virtually

[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.440]
every radio station in this market and even in Sarasota. We have certified mail coming in next

[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.880]
hour from Sarasota. Try to get Glenn to retract some of the scurrilous and disgusting remarks he's

[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:20.080]
made about Marshall Moore and Johnny Dark. And they will be, we'll be reading those live on the

[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:28.480]
in the next hour. Anyway, this guy sends the envelope and it comes back

[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.660]
address unknown. Okay, he's addressed the envelope. Okay, to get the picture of Pat Boone in the box,

[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:40.420]
he's addressed the envelope. It's the wrong address. I mean, talk about a douchebag. I take it back.

[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.900]
Rick Shaw isn't even a league with some of these people. Okay, you're okay, Rick. You really are.

[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:50.340]
But cut out that phony broke. Will you please? And those four-minute talk-ups. He's the only guy I

[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:54.680]
ever heard in my face going to be a celebrity caller who will accept hopefully Glenn's apology.

[00:42:54.900 --> 00:43:00.060]
Already apology? Well, that wasn't good enough. I'm not going to do anymore. Where is she?

[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:06.100]
Do you really want to talk to her? Yeah, if Kyle puts her on the air, let's put her on right away.

[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.420]
If she'll speak to us.

[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:14.280]
Drew, I've heard that Glenn actually apologized for yesterday.

[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.940]
And you're going to accept that weak apology? Well, I haven't heard the apology yet. Now,

[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:24.060]
is this true? First, you have to confirm or deny it. I didn't hear it. Well, Glenn,

[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.480]
now, didn't we make nice nice one month ago? Well, let's not, well, wait a minute. Let's not get

[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.180]
into that. I don't want to hear about making nice nice. I thought all of our little differences

[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:39.840]
have been put aside. I don't even know what they were in the first place, obviously, with him leaving.

[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.200]
And us working together so long and so forth, he get caught up in the middle of all of that stuff.

[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:50.020]
But I thought we had all of that smoothed out. I mean, we made up every month, you know, on the

[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:58.800]
first leg. Glenn. It's true. Well, but do we have any differences now now? Tell the truth. No.

[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.960]
Okay. So what is it yesterday that you're announcing that I have pet names for my husband's private

[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:12.700]
parts? Doesn't everyone? I hope not. Is there any, are there any women in the audience who have

[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:17.260]
pet names for their husband's private parts? We should do a whole show out of that. Of course. I

[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.540]
think Stan should do that show. Yeah. That'll be on the hormone show this afternoon. Stan will do

[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:28.780]
that show this afternoon. All right. Well, like you're truly sorry. Oh, sure. All right. Well,

[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:37.800]
I apologize to him. Why? Did he hear about it? Of course. Oh, God. Are you kidding?

[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:42.660]
Everybody listen to this show. Don't you understand? The whole world is listening. He's not mad

[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:48.160]
that you made mention of this, Glenn. Why should he be? No, he's angry that you didn't get it right.

[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:56.840]
It's big harmon. That's why you need to apologize. Okay. Well, that's fair. I do apologize for that.

[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.820]
You're absolutely right, Irene. Okay. Now you stiff me on my mommy. Vice jacket. Where is that?

[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.160]
I'm looking for the big tanky net for the $100 check. That's coming. It's on the...

[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:10.760]
You're not going to stiff me here. No, it's on the way. Okay. Does it say big hermit on the jacket?

[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.320]
No. Okay. You know, we don't need a name necessarily, but...

[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.400]
Well, I'm sorry. I got that wrong. Yeah. We're getting a lot of misinformation in here.

[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.120]
It does have a picture of the hermit on the back of it, the jacket. Oh, that's right. It's a full

[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:31.820]
on the back. Yeah. Right. Okay. All right. All right. So we're all squirt away on that,

[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.160]
but I'm going to off the air now. We'll have to get you together with Jeff. Okay.

[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.640]
Well, I don't want to hear about that. Wait a minute. Wait. I don't want to talk about that.

[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.360]
I'm staying made to show. This isn't the hormone show. Okay.

[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.280]
Phil and I wanted to tell you the best thing about my new hours.

[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.500]
Thank heaven. They don't interfere with listening to you.

[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.300]
Now, he's sitting here with a very skeptical look on his face. Glenn doesn't believe you

[00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:01.380]
listen to the show. Oh, how absurd. Yesterday, right before I went on the air, you know,

[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.740]
I'm running around doing errands, getting in and out of the car, I'm going to have to get some of

[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.260]
these stupid headphones that don't have wires connected to them. But I get in the car and hear

[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:14.280]
you talking about you're going to get a gift certificate for a tattoo that says Herman for my husband,

[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.480]
and I'm thinking, are they talking about? And I had missed the runner. No, it's going to say

[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.220]
big Herman, the tattoo. Big Herman, right. I'm sorry. See, here I am. You

[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:28.180]
ought to see where you have to put it though. Forget it. No tattoos. No tattoos.

[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.500]
Okay, you guys. So we're squared away.

[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:39.480]
Don't look at me, Irene. I just, I'm an innocent bystander in all of this.

[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:44.640]
Okay. It's this chronic troublemaker, this radio misfit that's causing all of these problems.

[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.360]
Well, if it's truly okay, I'm going to come and give Glenn a good thrashing.

[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.140]
And if it's not okay, I won't. Well, we're going to take a quick vote on that. Every,

[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.360]
every hand in the building gives you permission. Everybody wants you to do that.

[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:03.020]
Glenn, I've got some new BB pictures for you. This sounds like it might be a pleasant encounter.

[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.320]
Yeah. Bring the whip, the chain, and the BB Kate's pictures, and the glen will be in his glory.

[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:12.440]
Okay, Glenn. Give a call when you can. Okay. Say hi to Tweety Bird for me or Big Herman, whatever it is.

[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.620]
Okay, Irene. There she goes. Pretty, uh, pretty pleasant call.

[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:21.400]
Yeah. You know, considering now when Rick Shaw calls in a couple of minutes, what are you laughing

[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:26.980]
about? Ricky Tiki might call in here. He's got a good sense of humor. He does. Well, maybe

[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.980]
can call up and do some record intros for him. Exactly. He can do a talk up to our next break.

[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:38.740]
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. Hostar Nile. Hoo-hoo-hoo. The beaters.

[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:46.120]
Sunrise. Sunrise.

[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:02.940]
Hollywood

[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.460]
Eddie Murphy back

[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.860]
But it's no good

[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:14.000]
Every little cop

[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.380]
Made a Zillion bucks

[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.980]
But the Christmas day

[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.640]
Got the people

[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.380]
Hope they even go

[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:28.100]
Hey what are you talking about? I'm a business man

[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.380]
You understand? I'm a businessman

[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.360]
I don't have to be funny. I just make you money

[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.680]
Eddie Murphy

[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.200]
Eddie Murphy

[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.660]
Hold up the key

[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:38.960]
Don't die with nothing more than Eddie Murphy

[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.560]
Eddie Murphy

[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.260]
You're just making money

[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.920]
And you must have money

[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.300]
Take you up a dime

[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.720]
It's a hit is gone

[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.140]
I'm laughing all the way to the back

[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.440]
Give me another million

[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.620]
I think I bought five cars today

[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.320]
Beverly Hills, Cops, OO

[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.100]
It's a big tree

[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.120]
You

[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.760]
What do you think I am? I'm not jumping, Jamie

[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.340]
I'm Eddie Murphy, I'm a superstar

[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.140]
And I'm a businessman

[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.140]
That's why I'm a millionaire

[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.180]
Here we have this just in from the Wins news department

[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.800]
Why is L. Vice Presidente just arrived

[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.920]
And the county manager greeted him at Miami International Airport

[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.700]
He was there, I have to go shopping downtown for my motor

[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.520]
She needs some tortillas and chili pepper

[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.880]
Can you believe this douchebag bush

[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.680]
She comes in here on taxpayer expense this trip

[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.100]
Allegedly, you know, to participate

[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.140]
And the ceremony with the names

[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.440]
And so on and so forth at the streets

[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.460]
And it's nothing more than another political pandering trip

[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.360]
That's all it is and we're paying for it

[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.100]
The one thing I wonder about though

[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.000]
Why is everybody so angry today?

[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.540]
Everybody's angry, they're all bad

[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.680]
They're all worked up

[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.480]
And we're frenzy today, what the hell happened?

[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.080]
Was it the Bernard Gets verdict?

[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.000]
Did that get everybody whipped up into a frenzy?

[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.400]
Has that kind of given us the green light?

[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.940]
Has Don Stoner would say?

[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.100]
To let out all our frustrations?

[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.920]
And now, a continuous neo-Rodges music sweep

[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.320]
One song in a rush

[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.800]
Three minutes of continuous music

[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.660]
A 94 W.I.N.C.A.

[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:28.540]
Music

[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.740]
Well, I was driving down 95 the other night

[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.140]
And somebody nearly cut me right off the road

[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.280]
I decided wasn't gonna do any good to get mad

[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.880]
So I wrote a song about him instead

[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.080]
And it goes like this

[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.740]
Where he mornin' asshole

[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.740]
Or did you work it in your whole life?

[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.820]
Either way, it worked out fine

[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.880]
Cause you're an asshole tonight

[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:12.220]
Yes, you're an A, that's that's actually

[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:17.080]
And don't you try to blame it on me

[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.240]
You deserve all the credit

[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:24.860]
You're an asshole tonight

[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:31.500]
You were an asshole yesterday

[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.320]
You're an asshole tonight

[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.420]
I've got a feeling

[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:43.720]
You'll be an asshole the rest of your life

[00:51:43.720 --> 00:52:07.720]
Music

[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.000]
Music

[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.560]
And I was talking to your mother

[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.640]
Just the other night

[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:32.860]
I told her I parked you an asshole

[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.580]
She said yes, I think you're right

[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.520]
Music

[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.060]
And all your friends are asshole

[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.900]
Cause you know that you're whole life

[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:51.240]
And somebody told me

[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:55.120]
You've got an asshole for life

[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:01.600]
Where he mornin' asshole

[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:05.520]
Or did you work it in your whole life?

[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.600]
Either way, it worked out fine

[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:17.540]
Cause you're an asshole tonight

[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.420]
Okay, that's an honor of the

[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.600]
El Vice Presidente's visit to South Florida last night

[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.060]
For all the people that were backed up at 630 in traffic last night

[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.500]
We want to send that out

[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.960]
Now there's nothing wrong with that record

[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.280]
Is there anything wrong with that?

[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.000]
Of course not, open his mic for just a minute

[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:36.700]
Get your wife

[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.540]
He's timing you again

[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.920]
No, you want to send that out to all the people

[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.900]
The bureaucrats at Cox Broadcasting

[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.480]
Because we're dedicating our entire show today to them

[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.180]
I mean forget about El Vice Presidente

[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:54.120]
He's small potatoes compared to all those wonderful bureaucrats

[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:57.400]
At Cox Broadcasting, man, they are really something

[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.300]
Wonderful folks to work for, right?

[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.100]
Skip and Jim?

[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.300]
Skip Herman and Jim McBean are scheduled to be the guests on the stand major show today

[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.540]
And by the way, stand your taste in music is just terminal

[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.640]
I mean that Elvis cut yesterday?

[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.820]
Get rid of it

[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.220]
Get serious

[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.260]
Himmungus, grotesque

[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.960]
nauseated, it was the worst racket I've ever...it was just noise

[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.400]
You're speechless

[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.140]
You're right

[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:33.380]
Okay, let's find out. Let's see if anybody in the audience enjoyed the record that we played

[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.660]
That's number three already on the wins head parade

[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:36.260]
Is it really?

[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.720]
And let's see if there are people in the audience especially those who are frustrated of driving on i95

[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.800]
Who enjoyed that record to do something for you

[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.900]
Did it get a little of your frustrations out of your system?

[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.400]
Look at that. There they go

[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.340]
Record breaker. I think we just did it in three seconds

[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:58.380]
Continuous meal, Roger's commercial suite, three commercials in a row, without music, or phone call

[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.720]
Interruption, a 94-WI-NC

[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:04.700]
Well I like that

[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.720]
Great point. We ever get three c-

[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.060]
Like they are

[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:12.060]
And I'm gonna tell you something. It is unbelievable

[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.320]
Okay, are you ready? Are you standing up?

[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.800]
Or are you sitting down?

[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.560]
I want to make sure Bill Caltor's awake. Should we call him and wake him up?

[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.720]
Sure. Think so. Okay, wait a minute

[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.740]
Yeah, I want to make sure that he's awake to hear this

[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.680]
Anything to bother the guy, you know

[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.340]
I'm just kidding

[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.820]
Yeah, all you got to do is talk that bothers a lot

[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:32.960]
That's right. That bothers everybody

[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.080]
Let me talk to him

[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.720]
No, I don't want you spreading ugly rumors

[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.220]
Hello? Are you asleep?

[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.560]
Okay, turn on W-I-N-Z right now

[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:46.760]
Okay, okay

[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.340]
No

[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:58.660]
Poor Caltor, he's getting all that he got to call yesterday, it 10 to 4 at his house saying turn on I-O-D right now turn on the radio

[00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.680]
That's right. I heard it so

[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.920]
And now he gets his call from me saying turn on I-N-Z immediately

[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.160]
Mm-hmm. If not sooner

[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.020]
Do we have that worst alert alarm just by itself?

[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.880]
No, I wish we did. That would be great

[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:14.760]
The new lineup at the wonderful Isle of dementia

[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.580]
I want you to give it

[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:26.540]
Michael in the morning and with with Ms. Peyton

[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.960]

Yeah in the morning 10 to 2

[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.300]
10 to 2

[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.320]
Are you standing up or sitting down?

[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.280]
Ladies and gentlemen of the listing audience

[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.400]
His first name is John

[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.580]
Bob, Bob

[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.660]
Very good, Glenn

[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.880]
That's no this guy

[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.060]
Count on Glenn to give you the straight poop

[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:46.560]
Text

[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:48.600]
McQueen

[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:55.960]
McQueen from Tendertu who had never done a talk show in his life they found him in a 7-11 store in Austin, Texas

[00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:03.240]
About two months ago brought him into do overnight on the weekend his first guest was Bob Kunst his R-E-G-O

[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.300]
And he's going to be doing now

[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.120]
This is only a rumor. Yeah, I want to get my can't that he too upset

[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:13.580]
But it's only a rumor that the text McQueen is going to be doing Tendertu

[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.200]
You got that great accent

[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.600]
Yeah, he'll be real good in this town

[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.580]
You can do get some of those kiss list news over at I-O-D

[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:27.760]
And uh, oh I'm telling you I just can't believe it man with stiff competition like that I may have to go to another market

[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.080]
You know like Windixer or something

[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.040]
I mean talk about stiff competition right?

[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:37.900]
And then of course uh, hold what's his name back here major is going to have to go up against Michael Desisto

[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.000]
What do you have to do to look like in all those wrestlers

[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.700]
In all those professional wrestlers

[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.820]
Oh, Steve O two to six

[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:48.320]
Yep, and of course what can we say that hasn't been said then after about 40 hours of sports talk

[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:51.440]
Carter will come on and have to put all the pieces together good luck to you Bill

[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.620]
They need him they need him desperately

[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.860]
Oh, you better believe it. I hope he stays

[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.740]
Boy do they need him. Yeah

[00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.540]
Yeah, no idea. Oh

[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:00.620]
Text McQuig

[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:05.400]
I'm going to play for the Montreal Royals in the old internationally

[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:07.300]
With Tom LaSorta

[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.620]
He may have

[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.120]
Text McQuig

[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.900]
Are you sure? Yeah

[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.980]
Okay, well listen Mike it's been nice knowing you and Bob Rich of course

[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.520]
So we certainly wish him the best of luck

[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:22.080]
He wears nice three-piece suits and never met a you know never met a broadcaster he didn't like

[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.940]
And never told a story that was untrue

[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.520]
Look at that 2.3 for GTR and that was with Herman and McQueen on the year

[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.840]
Can you imagine what it's going to be now that they're bringing in a short order cooks from the

[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:34.820]
Restaurants down on 79th Street

[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:36.060]
Unbelievable

[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.240]
It's incredible. What's happening in this market folks?

[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.380]
Is it unraveling? Yeah, it's coming apart at the seams

[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.080]
Yeah

[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.780]
I'm speechless. It's too

[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.140]
I may have to just sit here and breathe hard for the next hour

[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:50.720]
Text McQuig

[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:52.460]
Oh boy

[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:58.220]
You know it would be great if they could get Brian Norcross to do the weather on his show

[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:03.740]
Well, what do you think about that Brian? Well, I think the weather will be really good on the 79th Street Cosby today

[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.460]
Well, that's good partner and now let's talk to Bob Coons

[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.140]
Hey Bob, what do you think about AIDS? Bob? Oh boy

[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.040]
Oh man, oh man

[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:20.180]
I heard that Rick Weaver is in such a series taking a shower right now

[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:21.740]
Oh, yeah, you're making that up

[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.460]
And that's big news ladies and gentlemen

[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:24.800]
You're making that up

[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.220]
That's not going to bring Hank Goldberg back to town

[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.100]
Rick Weaver taking a shower, you're making wild out of it

[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:30.980]
Wow, we're getting carried away

[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.900]
Yeah, you went too far

[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.280]
Maybe the story was he went to the coast, he wasn't using it

[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.300]
I think maybe

[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.040]
Oh boy, I can't believe this

[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.980]
Text McQuig? Oh boy

[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.600]
He could do some of those bullwinkle spots

[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.940]
He could be JJ Moose

[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.880]
Maybe Mike McKase looking for work, the two of them could do it to a man's show

[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.840]
Oh god, I can't believe this

[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.800]
Can this really be happening in this market?

[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.840]
This isn't a market, this is like

[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.720]
What is that? The note handed

[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.520]
Yeah, right, Texas first guest will be a beef jerky

[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.840]
Or a lady jerky from Calder, one or the other

[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.160]
Old text going to be doing a remote from you, told him the first day

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.700]
Hey, let's do one from over here by the jar, pickled eggs

[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.740]
He wants to go back where they found him, you know

[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.020]
That label, where he was discovered

[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.280]
Now let's examine the lineup, okay

[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.220]
Because we've got Ron, Ron Sacks

[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.980]
I can't, now they all sound alike

[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:36.940]
Didn't I tell you that there was a trend

[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.120]
I always pick up on these things first

[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.980]
I told you about a month ago on this show

[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.080]
There was a new trend developing in talk radio in South Florida

[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.580]
And the sound had to be, in fact, when Brian Norcross gets his own show, then you'll know

[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.640]
We've gone full-site

[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.660]
Everybody has to sound kind of like this

[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:54.760]
If they have a whiny scratchy voice

[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.540]
And maybe we started there with Daffy

[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:58.440]
Yeah, maybe

[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.380]
I got an idea, maybe Daffy could go to work with Bill Tanner on that scratch station

[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.300]
Scratch talk

[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.860]
And they could hire Glenn Hill to be your sidekick

[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.220]
They call laughin' and scratchin'

[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.120]
We get an 80 share

[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:12.660]
Adios

[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:13.620]
Adios

[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.080]
Boy, I can't believe this

[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.920]
I'm coming unglued here

[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.700]
Boy, it's a good thing I'm going to the eye doctor

[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.260]
So I can see straight after this show

[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.900]
Man, I'm talking about your coccyte

[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.860]
Pardon the expression

[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.180]
I just, I can't believe it

[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.760]
Let's think about coccyte for a moment

[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.940]
Yeah, let's look at that picture of the fish over there

[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.420]
Whatever that, that's, I just can't handle this folks

[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.980]
Can this really be happening for real or what?

[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.180]
What?

[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.200]
Boy, Tex McQueen

[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.140]
Oh, boy

[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.200]
Mike Anthony, the assassin strikes again ladies and gentlemen

[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.520]
And Sandy, by the way, has been gagged

[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.880]
Yeah

[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.480]
Yes, she wasn't talking about it

[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.020]
She's talking about that picture over there

[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.200]
That's a picture of it, right there

[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.960]
She won't talk about it

[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.080]
I'm just talking about that

[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:15.360]
You can see it's a good thing we didn't describe the picture

[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:15.520]
It's a good thing we didn't describe the picture

[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:15.740]
It's a good thing we didn't describe the picture

[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.840]
It's a good thing we didn't describe the picture

[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.200]
Wait till you see this picture

[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.620]
I think that's a dolphin, isn't it

[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.260]
Yeah, it looks like Jim Manditch is a matter of fact

[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:27.260]
Anyway

[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.920]
It's not she and her attorneys of course

[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.300]
So all on the QT you know she not allowed to give any more of the truth

[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.660]
Maybe a few little lies or something like that but no more the truth on the earth

[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:44.740]
You know dream so if there is anybody in the market that wants to know what's really going on

[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:51.760]
They can tune over right here at 940 on their AM dial. That's right as they say in a sunset in a 79

[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.960]
W.I.N. Z. Right. We got a letter addressed to that exactly

[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.960]
But I was probably from Bill Kelly

[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.100]
You're right. Oh boy

[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.980]
Okay, now if you'd like to cancel the Harold here are the numbers in Dave County

[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.800]
In Dave County 350

[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.900]
2000 getting close to Father's Day and in Broward 462 3000

[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.860]
I think Glen Hill

[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.880]
I think a lot of you may get your wish in this hour

[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.100]
I think he may just gurgle off into like a little puddle of gurgle at the bottom of the table here by the end of the hour

[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:25.820]
He's just cackling and girling and bubbling like ET you know and they go down the drain

[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.380]
And he's like we've been talking about how can you get that?

[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:32.160]
Incredible. How could I possibly not what's the guy's last name?

[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.820]
McQueen McQueen McQueen or maybe it's McQueen maybe it's Joe McQueen from the weekly news. Do you think that's possible?

[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.120]
No, maybe he has a Texas accent with a list

[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.400]
Hey there good buddy. Oh

[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.600]
My god, let's go down hang out at seven eleven. Oh

[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.120]
Oh boy, I can't believe it. I do hear he's doing the first show side-saddle so I don't know what that means

[01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:00.720]
Okay, one seven that's gonna be a steam song Jean-Octree's back in the saddle again

[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.560]
One seventeen and W.I.N. Z. Let's do a desperately needed time out and we'll come right back

[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.160]
Not it's rock music's hottest stuff in a new morning

[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:17.480]
Okay, like can you help me out here? Should I like shave my armpits? Why?

[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.040]
It's much better here

[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.240]
How about a mohawk?

[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:29.800]
The show that takes the most talked about issues of the day and ignores them. Okay, so like on today's show

[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.520]
We got this gay priest a transvestite teacher and a bisexual cop

[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.660]
So guys, hey, do you think I could fit a Grammy in my belly button?

[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:46.100]
It's flashy. It's trashy. It's Madonna you the talk show with only one topic me

[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:52.780]
So what do you think should I wear the crucifix in my ear or like take my stockings off and tie and run my hair?

[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:53.600]
Madonna you

[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:58.120]
He's desperately seeking attention. Come on guys help me out

[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:06.080]
Okay, 108 at W.I.Ciles checking his watch checking the he's got one of those not second-hand but like hundreds of a second

[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.940]
Now we want you to understand that we're not putting this creature on the ear here to

[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.640]
participate in the show

[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.860]
But he just is bringing more

[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.740]
News we're trying to recapture his old rule on gloves 94 gossip editor

[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.880]
Whatever it was that they called him

[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.700]
Yeah

[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.780]
gossip editor, okay, let's set this up now

[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.040]
Okay, that was taped at

[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.840]
441 yesterday at a very important meeting at WNWS

[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:40.260]
We always like to report on these important radio meetings exactly we gave you first the new lineup of WS news before it happened

[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:43.780]
Yeah, we gave you the departure of Mike Miller before it happened on the air

[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:49.160]
We told you that Sandy was in limbo and litigation all came to limbo rock with Mike Anthony

[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.420]
It's an amazing how it all came true is it yeah

[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.540]
We're just hallucinating here, but our hallucinations seem to come true

[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:59.080]
They denied it and denied it and denied it and sooner or later it happened bingo

[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.960]
La Bamba as Richie valence would have said

[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.600]
You could be here to sing to us today

[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.280]
Maybe we could get the Shirley McLean to get Richie valence to sing a little later in the show

[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:14.900]
And the big bopper to do a little chantilly lace for Mike Thompson. Yeah, okay

[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.240]
So anyway, they had this very major meeting over at WS news

[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.480]
And the consultants were there and all the other gonsum offers are the big shots

[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:29.540]
Dennis Collins the big guy and we follow her calls him the big guy. Mm-hmm

[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.840]
That's so big. I've seen it and

[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:39.120]
What else well you heard the show that Alice did a couple of weeks ago where he was complaining about Mike

[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.400]
Thompson, you know was was advocating that

[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.120]
Genocide yeah, that AIDS victims should have a tattoo

[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:53.120]
William F Buckley let's fry a routine put an A on their arm or something. Yeah, and this really upset

[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:59.780]
Maybe we ought to put an A on one of Mike Thompson's arms and an H on the other arm because certainly those are the two appropriate initials

[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.020]
That's an interesting a H could be

[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:07.860]
Yes on one arm and hold on the other or could be eight off on one arm and who knows what it might be on the other arm

[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.880]
Right him just a coincidence it might be hummel

[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:17.140]
And thought about that now you haven't thought about that anyway, you know

[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.240]
You you heard the show and I heard the show and I feel like writing

[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.920]
Where Al was very upset that Mike

[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:30.600]
advocated this and and Al called him a Nazi on the air many times, right?

[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:32.920]
So

[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.320]
Mike is very upset that Al did that and he

[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:38.820]
burst in

[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.420]
Okay up into the meeting kind of like a German Shepherd and he

[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:52.320]
Yeah, German Shepherd yes, and they were screaming at each other about this

[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:57.020]
You know, that's what I hear so I don't know Al course was talking about this on the area yesterday

[01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:03.680]
So this is no secret. Yeah, they're fighting cats and dogs if you pardon that expression. Yeah, who's a nail? Yeah

[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:11.000]
And as a matter of fact Mike didn't know it but our winds news team never to be out done had a little hidden microphone in that meeting

[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.020]
Yeah, huh and when Mike burst in in the middle of that meeting we have some of his intemperate remarks I

[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:21.740]
How many cost of this same mark?

[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.980]
Have you nothing else from the same sort?

[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:27.940]
So

[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.260]
So there's just a little recording from yesterday's big powwow or

[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:35.220]
Bowwow is the case maybe over at the W snooze man

[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.400]
I'm telling you this market is just to go in a hell and a hand basket isn't it? Okay?

[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.960]
Really? Okay, shut us mic off immediately

[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.960]
