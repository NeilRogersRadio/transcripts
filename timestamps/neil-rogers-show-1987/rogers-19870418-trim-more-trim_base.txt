[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940]
All those great things yesterday that just in fact

[00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.980]
It wasn't broken right?

[00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.880]
In the time the ship in the glass bottle was not broken

[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.920]
It wasn't just ship in the glass bottle

[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.520]
A glass ship in a glass bottle

[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.420]
In fact when I leave the studio today I'm going to get inside on the ship and head for any place it'll take

[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.440]
I'd love to see that

[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.620]
I bet you would

[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.800]
Listen, Kathy West is just adorable

[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.220]
Is it amazing how the audience has turned around with her?

[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.860]
Look at the hot girl can you do the show from her hospital room?

[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.860]
No, as a matter of fact she's going to have her baby here in the studio

[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.280]
Oh, wonderful!

[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.140]
I want to be there

[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.940]
No, seriously she's going to have her baby here in the studio

[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.840]
I love it, I can't wait to see it

[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.100]
Or have the midwife and the house show

[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.680]
What a pair, I love it

[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.740]
It's just great

[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.480]
What I want to ask you

[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.700]
Do you have club passes to a golf team?

[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.420]
I have a lead show

[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.240]
I have everything you could ever need and then some

[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.800]
I'm sure you do

[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.360]
I just wondered if you did a lot

[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.500]
Well I sure appreciate the thoughtfulness I was really nice yesterday

[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.660]
That's sweet and I give my love to mom

[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.880]
I hope she likes what I sent

[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.780]
Thank you and have a great Easter tomorrow

[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.020]
Well, I know Passover is still on so keep enjoying

[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.880]
Okay

[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.620]
Okay there

[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.340]
Man who called Craig said that Craig said that Neil would never kill himself

[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.700]
There he is

[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.040]
Interesting

[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.420]
Alright I'll tell you what I'll show him a finger to wait till the next hour

[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.880]
Okay

[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.460]
It's eat some of those still nuts in that

[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.000]
Exactly, man I'm telling you

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.700]
Kathy West left some garbage here that even a parrot would laugh at

[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.660]
In fact I think the parrot dropped some of those in the box

[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.340]
I mean it is the most disgusting looking stuff that anybody's ever seen

[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100]
Now what just happened on the phone there with that glitch

[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.780]
All of a sudden just in like one second

[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380]
Okay we have a couple of open lines

[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.840]
In date county 624-0191

[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.380]
And there's an open line in Broward at 764-0707

[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.360]
What are you looking for Tom?

[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.020]
Tom Gallagher is always who Tom's looking for the newspaper

[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.540]
So that he can bring you some headlines

[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.600]
That of course is one of the great tactics that the Winds News staff has been famous for for 11 years now

[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.800]
Is that we take boring news out of the herald and we make it

[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.840]
Interest the collider and he would say

[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.680]
Call up some news and they'll give it to you

[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.360]
Oh that's true we can get the weather from the folks over there

[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.760]
Maybe Tom Schaefer is still hanging around with Craig talking about his mystical boat

[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.120]
I'm telling you man radio in this town is reaching new levels ladies and gentlemen

[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.440]
Even the FCC isn't prepared for what we're on the horizon of

[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.860]
In this world

[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.360]
Follow sleepless and listen with them

[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.180]
Exactly they'll be into a terminal coma

[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.700]
And of course the new chairman of the FCC Mr. Right Wing

[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.300]
We're going to have him probably on the tap

[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.720]
You may count them show one of these days in the next couple of weeks

[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.640]
And he'll probably be the first guest to follow sleep on the phone

[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.120]
Although I do remember a call to had a couple of callers

[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.040]
Oh that's right by the phone number those

[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.780]
We'll leave it be you from you fit from the redlands

[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.740]
He must be related to Biff from the redlands

[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.580]
Okay listen we're out of time for this hour

[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.920]
Fruitcake is here and he's going to stick around until the reform police come in and take him away

[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.400]
And Tom Gallagher who just is trying desperately to figure out what the hell this Saturday morning business is all about

[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.620]
Tom is standing by he's going to try to bring some respectability back to all of this

[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.440]
He's got those Yoko and Arya news headlines that wins this so famous for

[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.500]
World News from CBS at the top of the hour and we'll come back at 1106

[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.940]
Ernie Sochin is going to be doing his show from Temple Bethel at 2 this afternoon

[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.400]
Get up 94 news wins if you'd like to call Neil dial 7640707 in Broward

[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.480]
Or 624-0191 in date and now here again is Neil Rogers

[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.760]
Okay we have a special celebrity guest standing by

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.520]
Boy we've got them all today man they're coming out of the woodwork they're coming from Kendall and from Pinellas Park

[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:53.040]
And from from Carol city and from hunger is a matter of fact and yesterday of course we had that jerk on from the FCC

[00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.540]
James McKinney who absolutely told us nothing I mean the most ambiguous vague bunch of mong in the history of radio

[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.880]
And we also talked to Jerry Williams and this morning we thought we would probably talk to one of the real experts on radio obscenity

[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.220]
Who is standing by in Pinellas Park are you there sir?

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.260]
Yes I am this may cost me my job Rogers but frankly your full of do-do

[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.400]
Oh that's okay

[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.880]
Hello Mr. Lasano

[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.000]
Oh wait a minute does that have to do with ex-Gritory something?

[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.340]
I'm not really sure

[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.060]
Or is it just that you haven't grown up and you continue to talk in baby talk if that's the case it's okay

[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.140]
There's a lot of old number two if you ask me

[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.540]
See here he goes man we've had him out like for 20 seconds and he just spew a get out man

[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.440]
It's just like a gigantic telephone animal

[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.280]
Well I'm really taking it off of the whole thing Rogers

[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.420]
There's a guest here in the studio who'd like to say hello to you

[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.220]
Hello Mr. Lasano how is everything up there doing?

[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.680]
Everything is fine up here doing

[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.340]
You still have that right there in the studio with you?

[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.020]
He's in the studio we have him captured in here and Lee Fowler is on his way with a group of board ops

[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.600]
And they're gonna beat the crap out of him

[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.820]
Well I'd like to change to the chair I wouldn't let him get away

[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.540]
I think his phone privilege is at least

[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.620]
They're taking away don't worry about that

[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.300]
Good good

[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.340]
That's okay but we have sources up in Tampa

[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.160]
Help me get through

[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.440]
We were trying to get to a night 800 number but

[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.480]
I don't want you to pay a dollar for it that wouldn't be fair

[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.160]
Don't answer the 800 number anymore

[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.860]
You don't?

[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.280]
Only when we're desperate don't have any other calls do we have?

[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.700]
Oh no one there was ringing a lot of them

[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.840]
In other words every 20 minutes

[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.240]
So how are things going over there Bob?

[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.460]
Things are going pretty good

[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.680]
How's the wife?

[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.340]
Now the wife is fine thank you

[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.320]
Did you get the news letter out there?

[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.420]
What is this house the wife?

[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.340]
What is this?

[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.200]
This is this the Joe Franklin show?

[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.860]
By the way speaking of Joe Franklin

[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.740]
He had the professor Irwin Corrie on again last night

[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.700]
And I got to tell you something that man is the funniest man

[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.800]
In the history of mankind

[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.160]
No he was still alive

[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.200]
He's hysterical he really is

[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.220]
And of course Joe Franklin you know what a great sense of humor he's got

[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.640]
And he's sitting there and he's trying to interview his 40 other guests who are sitting you know sprawled over the couch

[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.880]
And Irwin Corrie just keeps going on and on

[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.800]
It was great I don't know what that has to do with anything

[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.800]
But well I did actually has a great deal to do with things because they were dropping apparently the PTL network up here and replacing it with WLR out of New York

[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.720]
Hey listen to that there's hope for mankind even hill is that in Pinellas?

[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.360]
Yes that is a big secret no one knows that yet

[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.500]
Even in Pinellas County that's with two L's

[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.480]
We're coming into the 20th century

[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.720]
Well wait till the governor finds out about that he'll probably try to stop it

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.900]
Well there is there is some talk about that

[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.120]
So what of the words did you want to say to us this morning?

[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.580]
Don't do it please I'm asking a wrong guy

[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.380]
No we worked for the same company I wouldn't dare

[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.180]
Well you did once

[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.900]
Can we rip up while he's on the line?

[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.220]
Go ahead you can rip him he's got broad shoulders

[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.320]
Bob did you know?

[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.680]
Big shoulders I mean enormous

[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.460]
Bob

[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.020]
Yes

[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.680]
You there of course you are

[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.160]
How did how close was it between you and talk mate?

[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.060]
How close is it?

[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.900]
Number is numbers I mean not this thing

[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.920]
What?

[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.920]
Near the man's point like an 18 share in this market

[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.760]
And you have a five so much I heard you had the height of it

[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.440]
Wait a minute wait a minute who's pulling an 18 share?

[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.040]
Talk mate

[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.600]
Why is there this deafening silence?

[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.560]
Near what you said

[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.340]
No no who's pulling an 18 share in that market?

[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.660]
Bruce Williams?

[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.220]
Yes

[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.660]
And I've been in the show so

[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.220]
I have a highest live local members which are just under a five

[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.080]
Four most hours just over a five for one

[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:27.960]
You

[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.440]
Aren't away the highest locals

[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.140]
But Bruce Williams is point 16, 17 and 18

[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.660]
Oh my god

[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.600]
Amazing

[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.760]
We have to have a saliva test in the Tampa Bay area ladies and gentlemen

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.980]
No more

[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.240]
I don't think there is any saliva up here

[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.340]
That's one of the ones

[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.280]
I can't believe that are you serial or is this a put on?

[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.980]
Oh that's real

[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.440]
That's why I feel like doing so good

[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.740]
Whoops

[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.000]
I had a call from somebody at WFLA the other day had a message

[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.860]
Some lady at WFLA

[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.060]
And I threw it in a waste basket and I laughed

[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.220]
I wonder what that was all about

[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.360]
Well they are aware of you I had lunch with some people over there this week

[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.440]
And we were talking about you

[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.700]
Oh in other words they were calling me to offer me a job perhaps

[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.360]
I don't think that was it but we were talking about the FCC

[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.640]
And you and Howard Stern last Tuesday in that month

[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.140]
Well I see

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.360]
Well you know the chances of my

[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.000]
Talking to FLA and one of the competing stations

[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.320]
That would be outrageous

[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.440]
Oh no, they are not going to pay pretty well probably

[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.440]
They probably go to 50 maybe in 285 a week for you

[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.300]
Really

[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.800]
They'd like you up there too

[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.480]
Although they are

[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.820]
I'd be big in that market man

[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.540]
Oh you really wanted

[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.200]
I'd be almost as big as Bernard Meltzer

[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.220]
Bernard probably is doing over there

[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.960]
Well it's funny that Bernard is beating all the ass the attorneys

[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.880]
And they'll be snoozing

[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.640]
Snooze which is kind of interesting

[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.140]
He is he's beating them by

[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.060]
I think one thing that all three of us have in common is a basic and trinsic love for Lee Fowler

[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.640]
I don't think there's any question about that

[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.900]
Bob do you have any latest information about Lee?

[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.780]
I talk to Lee this very week

[00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.580]
You did what did he have to say?

[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.040]
No

[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.440]
Oh

[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:02.780]
Oh that's all

[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.660]
Oh no, okay I get it, okay

[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.560]
Don't even go over there they're going back

[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.120]
Bob isn't going to go too far because he knows that when you know the door is still

[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.520]
Even if there's a little creek in the door that he just doesn't want to close it all away

[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.120]
I wouldn't give Lee the pleasure he probably do better than he would

[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.920]
He's just as popular as Shirley

[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.560]
Two five

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.120]
Six for him and two five for Shirley

[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.120]
Last time I had spoken with him he told me over my dead body

[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.360]
And there was a report up here this week that he had a stroke and died on the air

[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.680]
No that's not true

[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.980]
You got to tell Joyce to straighten out to her sources

[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.980]
I spoke to her today she crankled me up at home

[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]
Boy now to see this is getting really inside

[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.200]
Is that that misfit down in Homestead?

[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.960]
Are you calling her a misfit?

[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.420]
She's working at PLP now

[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.720]
She's a wonderful person

[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.520]
Are you serious?

[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.520]
Yes

[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.760]
Now the audience is listening to all of this and they haven't got any idea and I'm beginning to agree with Mark Hune

[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.340]
That this is gotten so inside that it just I mean even I haven't got any idea

[00:09:59.340 --> 00:09:59.940]
Yeah I mean it's anything

[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.400]
What any of these people are talking about all of these we have like several different levels of crank collars

[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.380]
And groupies and subgroupies and subhumans and it's just amazing

[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.380]
What goes on in the periphery of the real world

[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.640]
You want to know about Joyce Bender?

[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.360]
Of course

[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.960]
Is she related to Tom Bender?

[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.860]
To Bender over

[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.160]
Oh she's probably full sister to Dr. Bender over

[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.320]
That's from now on he may be a favorite guest

[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.040]
Bender over

[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.340]
She used to work at WRBA which is a country station now which is off the air

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.460]
She used to do weekend nights over there

[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.580]
And she used to call John McEw over here and play records and stuff like that

[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.080]
John McEw that's a familiar name

[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.000]
John McEw

[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.960]
Every time I speak to me takes shots at you about

[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.660]
The radio douchebag you remember him

[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.000]
Bow or at least I'm working

[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.420]
No he's working too now he matter fact he's a general manager of WZOR in Mockely

[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.900]
That is pretty funny when you're doing

[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.600]
He's doing news over there in Spanish and acting

[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.480]
I'll tell you one thing they're big and Indians over there man

[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.780]
He's got eight thousand like Indians and migrant workers it's fantastic

[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.800]
Because their name is Raúl Travaj

[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.220]
And I got news for you

[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.680]
They're loyal because when they get that buck to fill out the diary man they'll do anything

[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.080]
So he's got an enormous audience and that in two

[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.740]
Do you believe this?

[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.280]
I mean do you believe this is on the air?

[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.220]
Because I'll tell you I sure don't

[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.820]
Anyway getting back to why I called you because I'm sure that someone who lost a job over an innocent four letter word

[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.720]
Probably is apoplectic

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.900]
It turns out that most of the people on the air in this market are a bunch of wimps

[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.920]
They don't know who lost it are

[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.900]
They're really a bunch of wimps because you know I'm the only one who's really making a shrill protest to this

[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.100]
And the other ones of course are you know busy looking the boots of the commissioners up there

[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.820]
Lee

[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.640]
Getting me

[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.540]
Oh yeah even Fowler is quoted in the heraldous morning as saying

[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:54.400]
I think it's a good decision there are many irresponsible people in this business who are offensive

[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.800]
And have no business being on a radio

[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.480]
No, of course of course we all know that Lee is patently offensive just on the face of him

[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.360]
Oh I wouldn't say

[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.040]
With his sex elephant poles and how often do elephants do it?

[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.180]
Yeah

[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.140]
Yeah he's recently been involved in a series of sex pole

[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.160]
I wonder why is that like that old

[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.860]
The way you say

[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.140]
Is my favorite down there

[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.200]
People who don't get to talk about the most

[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.060]
I can say that about Lee

[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.260]
No question about it although capy west is an exception

[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.020]
Go ahead sir I'm sorry you were saying what?

[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.080]
I just said that Lee Fowler is my favorite talk coach

[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.500]
He's my favorite too especially David Fowler up and they have another Fowler up

[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.160]
Just before last I think in the mornings

[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.880]
And I'll keep losing my train of thought because I'm trying to have a conversation

[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.020]
And this misfit over here just keeps rambling on and rambling on with incoherent non-sequiters

[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.980]
That make absolutely no sense even to him

[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.640]
But why do you have that misfit in the studio?

[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.540]
He just showed up here today just showed up and you know we felt sorry for him

[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.360]
We figured you know he's been desperate for so long to have some attention

[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.660]
And we thought we'd give him some

[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.160]
This is the man or the boy that you would call me in the middle of the night and cry about

[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.680]
Exactly he used to bring tears to my eyes

[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.280]
Are you serious?

[00:12:59.580 --> 00:12:59.740]
No

[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.040]
Oh okay that's good

[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.600]
Now what were you saying about what you said yesterday or last night about the FCC ruling

[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.800]
Are we going to ever get to that or is this just going to be one of those teases that goes on and on and on?

[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.820]
Oh I did about 15 or 20 minutes on at the

[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.840]
That's it?

[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.540]
It's totally ignored it

[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.460]
They're not not in the least bit interested

[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.600]
I can check that out

[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.420]
You've got to be kidding me

[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.380]
Oh I'm that serious

[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.620]
I mean this is on the front page of the Miami Herald this morning

[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.960]
Of the world famous Herald and Channel 4 and the world famous Channel 6

[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.640]
News people came by yesterday during my show and if Channel 6 comes by the cover

[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.200]
You know it's got to be big stuff

[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:45.100]
Well the front page of the same Petersburg Times this morning has Florida and other states revive long term alimony

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.020]
Oh that's good

[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.900]
Oh wait a minute I bet they're big on the obscene bumper sticker law, though aren't they?

[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.720]
No that doesn't really even know about up here

[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.700]
They don't have cars up there at all

[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.360]
Can I ask you a stupid question?

[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.780]
What the hell is it that they do talk about up there?

[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.820]
What on my show or the other?

[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.000]
On any show up there

[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.600]
Well for example this morning

[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.760]
My station is a very hot conversation with a drugist in some place in Kentucky

[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.260]
Wait a minute can you give me a prescription for penicillin?

[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.360]
I doubt it very much

[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.800]
No I'm serious I'm getting a strip through

[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.760]
You are

[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.320]
And Kathy West has gone all the way home to get me whatever the stuff is to give me some drugs

[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.060]
You West?

[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:24.580]
Yep

[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.900]
Who is Kathy West?

[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.420]
We don't have time to go either but she's in a family way

[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.540]
She's pregnant. Guess who's the father?

[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.260]
I wouldn't even want to try

[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.620]
So long pause here I notice that

[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.700]
I wouldn't even want to

[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:43.120]
Go ahead don't let him you know don't let him deep-six this conversation just keep going ignore him

[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.560]
Pretend he's not here

[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:52.820]
Well notice this market up here could not care less first of all we don't have anything that even comes close to this market with a possible exception of the QZU

[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:59.240]
Now on the QZU they are extremely racist and sexist that's okay that is not indecent

[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.960]
And Mason Dixon the operations manager at the QZU was quoted in the...

[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.060]
Mason Dixon

[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.160]
He's in Dixon right

[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.760]
Oh it was quoted in paper yesterday is saying that he thought a decent radio was awful and he would never do it

[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.880]
But they just sit there and take shots at every minority known to man and perpetuate every stereotype known to man

[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.900]
But that's not indecent

[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.180]
They do do is

[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.600]
Mason Dixon

[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.180]
I don't make up these names

[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.880]
I can't believe it go ahead I'm sorry

[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.760]
And that's about as far as it is gone

[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.420]
What kind of a stiff market is that I mean how are you surviving up there?

[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.460]
How is a man with an IQ of at least over three?

[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:52.640]
And I know that from personal experience from some of those long depressing conversations we've had on the phone about you wanting to get out of there

[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.780]
How is a person able to survive mentally?

[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.680]
I'm lucky I have my own following and after a year and a half of going to Zurk up here I do whatever I want to do

[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.400]
I take a lot of heat for it and it costs me money out of my pocket however

[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.320]
Well what does that mean you pay to be on the air?

[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.320]
Almost

[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.840]
Pay by the hour by the minute

[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.720]
It's very close to my name's them to be on the air

[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.080]
No it was endorsements in a lot of spots

[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.660]
Yeah can I let it out of the bag?

[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.080]
What's that?

[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.840]
All the people up there don't like Las Vegas views so they're calling up the sponsors and they've actually had an impact on his sponsorship on the show

[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.580]
Oh yeah sure

[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.580]
See now that's a difference between the two markets because down here especially during the halendale thing they tried that

[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.940]
And you know there were one or two nervous people who like went into limbo for a few days and they all came back

[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.840]
How are people up here going to threaten to turn me into the Chamber of Commerce?

[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.120]
I'm sad for tourism

[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.980]
To turn you into the Chamber of Commerce and what is the Chamber of Commerce going to do to you Bob?

[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.660]
Oh boy they're going to sentence you to two weeks in clear water with the Scientologists

[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.900]
Where water is where at that clear water is the action town up here?

[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.140]
Boy that says a lot

[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.180]
I thought Bob's going to work at WSU and playing bingo on the air with the ill people

[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:07.880]
That would be good

[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.740]
Man I'm telling you those old ladies they still just they just go nuts

[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:17.640]
They're probably right now hearing your voice is doing things for them the likes of which even Dr. Ruth couldn't do

[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.080]
He has more crankers all up there for square inch than anybody you know

[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.700]
Do you get a lot of crank calls up there?

[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.380]
Millions

[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.160]
Not the way that you do in Miami in Miami

[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.120]
No he does he's lying to you

[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:32.040]
I have them docked I have them on tape I should have brought the tape Bob you get so many crank calls up there

[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.580]
Oh wow Mr. Lassiter

[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.620]
Who are just enraged?

[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.820]
They are for real people

[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.280]
They're not calling up just to crank they're calling up because they can't take it anymore

[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.940]
Oh in other words they're really POed

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.080]
Yes

[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.920]
Really tingled off

[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.320]
Hmm

[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.040]
She I'm still waiting for that letter to come in the mail

[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.220]
You know this McKinney that I had on yesterday

[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.360]
I asked him if it was true that they sent a personal letter of warning to Howard Stern

[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:03.220]
And he said the warning is not only for Howard it's for you to kneel and for everybody else like

[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.880]
Just a little subtle intimidation you know about it subtle as an elephant in the Chinese shop

[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.640]
Okay listen hold on a second you're not going anywhere are you?

[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:11.420]
Hi

[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.080]
Like I said hold on for 20 minutes past 11 at WINZ

[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.640]
Bob Lassiter is with us

[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.780]
Fruitcake is here in the studio if Lee is listening by the way you know where the station is

[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.960]
And we have an open door policy here

[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:29.340]
Moving from one place to another is a big step and it's important to work with someone that you trust

[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.520]
If you're considering a move call your neighborhood moving in storage experts

[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.280]
Father and son moving in storage

[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.780]
Father and son has been family owned and operated since 1908

[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.720]
Three generations of moving experience and you'll receive modern movement

[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.620]
24 minutes past 11 at WINZ

[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:55.900]
We're speaking with Tom Likus and now actually Bob Lassiter is on the phone and you'll be pleased to know that some little old lady in tennis shoes

[00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:01.500]
Just called Kyle and he's just spaszing she's so delighted to hear your Malif Lewis voice

[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.820]
Oh Centaurian

[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.820]
Oh Jean was Jean?

[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.660]
I don't know who it was one of those old bags that you just caught you in a weekend

[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.960]
We mean they're all your listeners you told them not anymore they're not man

[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.660]
I've I've sent them all to Siberia my audience is all under 10

[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:21.440]
By the way it's really I want you to understand the impact of this the business about exploiting children

[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.500]
You know children may be listening that business

[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.320]
I will of course that's just a bunch of nonsense

[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.600]
Yeah, they're they're using children as an excuse to be fascist and sensor free speech

[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.560]
But the bottom line is you know who they're referring to

[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:38.560]
They're not talking about anybody under 12 because all of this is based on the nationwide arbitron ratings

[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:45.120]
According to Mr McKinney of the FCC and as a result of that since there are no measurements for anyone under 12

[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.140]
They're talking about people between the ages of 12 and 17

[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.720]
Now aren't you just positive as can be that somebody to say 15 years old is really offended

[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.340]
When they hear somebody use one of the words that they use you know 400 times a day on the average

[00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:58.720]
Yeah

[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.340]
Well the extraordinary thing is last night talking the way into work

[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.500]
We stopped off and got a quick hamburger at McDonald's okay

[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.060]
Wait a minute was Craig was Craig worthy with you?

[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.920]
He wasn't

[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.260]
You don't know what it's like not to be able to afford to go to McDonald's when you don't have a dollar of your pocket friends

[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.680]
You don't know what that's like

[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.740]
There was a man sleeping in one of the benches over there

[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.280]
But he had a satar head on?

[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.040]
Yes he did

[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.500]
And brown checkered pants

[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.200]
I can't believe it

[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.740]
I can't believe he came all the way back in this morning to do our show that's incredible

[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.700]
I don't know who it was but he did look familiar

[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.360]
And in any event we're sitting in the booth and there's a booth next to us with two women

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.160]
Apparently young mothers perhaps under 30 just over us

[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.560]
Not under

[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.280]
We were getting up to leave and one of them said

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.240]
And I just think the whole thing whatever they were talking about

[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.160]
As a bunch of bull you know what

[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.760]
The point is you can go into even McDonald's with Ronald and the American flag

[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.880]
And the monopoly game and the whole thing

[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.960]
For this language all over the place

[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.200]
Does anybody remember the Watergate tapes, Nixon's tapes?

[00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.540]
Apparently not

[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.640]
I was gonna say tricky dick but we can't say that under you anymore either

[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.180]
Well does anyone remember our illustrious president calling the members of the press?

[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.320]
Oh yeah

[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.380]
Oh boy even Ronnie

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.740]
The press has used exploits I can't believe it

[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.520]
What do you gotta understand we're living in this Casper milk toast world at the FCC and all those

[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.980]
Seen Isle of Farts up in Washington before they come from

[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.040]
Has nothing to do with children it makes the people themselves the moral majority

[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.420]
The federation for decency and all these other white women

[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.540]
Morality and media by the way are jumping on the bandwagon on this one now

[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.700]
They say that they're going to fact it's in a lost regional that our guest brought in this morning

[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:43.600]
Bradley Curl National director of morality and media says that they're going to be monitoring Howard Stern's show

[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.740]
And complained to the commission if he violates the broader indecency standard that they passed yesterday so

[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.360]
They had something else in there about increasing promiscuity in there

[00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:02.160]
Did you see that was a little quote down there at the end of the article about saying that if people started using those kind of words on the air then AIDS would I guess get out of control

[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.760]
Oh yeah no question about it

[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.900]
All somebody has to do is say douchebag on here and right away everybody

[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.680]
Grab the person next to them and starts doing you know I've seen things

[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.920]
By the way if there are people in the audience would like to speak to Bob Lasseter wouldn't you love to do that?

[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:22.720]
I've got to take calls to call it check that one. This is our dime you understand you know what a cheap company this is.

[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:28.000]
I've got to talk all of your push cavities down there exactly. Okay. Would you do that? Of course.

[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.700]
Okay now if there are any we've already got a whole bunch of people that have been hanging on I have no idea why because

[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:38.240]
Years is what do we do we took this call right after the news? So what the hell are these other people still hanging on for man

[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:44.020]
I'm telling you they are loyal aren't they not too bright but they are loyal to hang on and on and on

[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:51.520]
It's just incredible. Okay. We have a couple of open lines here in date at 624 0191 and I'm sure that there must be some

[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:59.740]
Lasseter groupies in date who would just spaz at the nose to get on the phone and hear this malifluis soothing voice

[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.940]
From Pinellas Park speaking to the phone and say aw shucks

[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.360]
Pasha aw pasha but you know I bet you don't say that up there do you you wouldn't have the guts to say

[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.360]
Pasha in Pinellas Park the caller say it have we got one for him doesn't have a shock

[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:24.720]
Now you want your that had Miami you know it would be embarrassing what if nobody wanted to talk to you that would be

[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.260]
That would be more to talk they don't know who Lasseter is it's been a long time you see how soon they forget man

[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:34.640]
They haven't got any idea who the hell you are how long has it been Bob Bob pardon how long has it been since you

[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.640]
When was the last day when was your last day here what do you remember the date?

[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.900]
I'm really a one wasn't a year ago December the a's over a year like almost a year and a half

[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:51.460]
Somebody is 1985 boy that's incredible. Whatever you say house over here that was right around the time of our last talk

[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.520]
Mania in fact that was the same weekend wasn't it I think I know who that caller was by the way

[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.380]
He made that made me do say that

[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.740]
Well, how'd you like his number?

[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.240]
I know who it is too. Do you really?

[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.260]
Uh-huh. Oh the guy called me and said oh Mr. Lasseter you're coming there stand up

[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.820]
And so you are full of yeah, yeah, no what's it me?

[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.740]
So although it's been alleged

[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.820]
Okay, listen we got some calls for Bob

[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:24.820]
Oh, we do is that for Lauderdale call for Bob Lasseter? Well, let's check it out. Hello

[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.000]
Hello, hello

[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:35.460]
Hello, yes, yeah, I think this is a crank call. No, it's not okay. It's this I get out there. I know see I know it

[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.060]
I'm meeting you

[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.620]
Okay, I can't believe you said that to Bob

[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.700]
North Miami hello

[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:51.180]
Yes, how are you doing? I'm doing fine. Please come home. I tried to but they won't let me isn't there anything

[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:56.580]
Mr. You can do this is a power that would convince him to put you on well the matter of fact

[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.520]
I just that can that question is very weak and he's this is another crank call or by the way

[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.320]
It's not a crank call. I think Mr. Lasseter is one of the best talk. Hopefully we've ever had in South Florida

[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.620]
Well, next to John Braward

[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.140]
Please

[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.020]
Okay, sir good luck to you. I'm not getting pressed my luck with that one. Yeah, have a happy happy circus

[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.820]
Okay, I'm telling you you're bringing him out of the woodwork today

[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.120]
I'll tell you that dance late bought that card and that little thing that you did on the air and he's gonna play it right now

[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:24.720]
Okay, wait a minute

[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.140]
Let's interrupt the segment with Lasseter for just a second. We have a little special

[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.540]
Thing here that's just been handed to me from the news department

[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:38.880]
Prior to the arrival of the now famous FCC letter the federal authorities have devised this FCC danger zone cart

[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.020]
Which is to be played when it would be talk show host is getting near what the commission feels is

[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.140]
obscene and indecent

[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:52.880]
I

[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.900]
Ooh that was Jeff

[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.060]
That's the bad song 23 people in the production department and that's the best they can come up with

[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:20.320]
Are you serious now those there has to be maybe not here, but the other stations have a stacy queue and all those

[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:29.100]
Double entendres in there. I can't believe it then what happened to you is something happened to your mind since we last spoke

[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.840]
I mean that on a scale. I mean Dan has been just

[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:40.460]
Working to a frenzy in a production studio and I thought he was gonna. He's been putting such great stuff together for us

[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.260]
And I thought this was gonna be a real winner

[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.200]
Well, that's just to let people know when you're getting there the dangers on so they can get there

[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.900]
I mean that was so weak on a scale of zero and while Lasseter is on the phone

[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.020]
We might as well play something that Lasseter will enjoy

[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.900]
Hello, this is Michael Jackson

[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.860]
Orson you to help stop the spread of social disease

[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.220]
Don't risk your life by having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar Queens. I urge you to do like I do go it alone

[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.020]
But make sure you wear protection

[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.040]
That's why I recommend the Michael Jackson glove

[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.160]
One on either hand the Michael Jackson glove add the security piece of mind that I need to do it myself

[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.960]
So remember before you put it on

[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:33.140]
The Michael Jackson glove proving once again that a bird in the hand is better than one in the bush a

[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.200]
Vatable in sequence models for extra stimulation

[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.520]
Okay, I bet you they would play that in Tampa, wouldn't I?

[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:39.660]
I

[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.800]
I don't I I sounded very much do you really yes? I do well

[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:51.720]
What a bunch of old bags up there and oh let's see woman wants to talk about that foul mouth done web

[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:57.520]
Babe boy, that'll be good. Well, let's see. I was in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi. Hi

[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.240]
I'm not a crank call right now. I want to say hello to Bob and tell my nixon. Well, thank you

[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.100]
I have friends over in Tampa area who hear

[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:11.800]
Joshua or here all the time and I'm wondering if ever go to you to Per Boondill or for anymore

[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:19.060]
Oh, I've not been up that way for probably a dozen years. Oh my goodness. Well, I miss you Bob. Thank you

He's the one that's blocking me in the market

[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.240]
He could do something for you because he knows there are people maybe pay a salary

[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:19.960]
Well, I'm gonna wait until you come back, Bob because you we really need you in Florida because we can't not be

He they see if she'll be we heard that the person that if children say it's okay if adults say it then it's bad

[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.780]
But you understand you've got to protect the adults who are listening out there. That's right. We don't want

[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:03.160]
Exactly there was another one. I thought you didn't have any adults left me. I thought you're all into got much younger

[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:24.740]
Froggy no, she says the words that just oh, that's very close to froggy, but not exactly a man

[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.720]
Great okay, are you listening mr. McMillan okay? Now, this is a two-year-old child okay?

[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.500]
So he can't be for to appear to the purient interest of our adult audience

[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:44.920]
Nice to hide okay. Thank you Kathy. That was very thoughtful, but don't do it again. Thank you Miami. Hello

[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.940]
Hello, yes, bye-bye

[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.680]
Yes, ma'am

[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.180]
Go ahead. This is for you Bob. Okay

[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:02.540]
Mr. Laster, I'm not one of the fatty the fatty degenerates normally, but I really do miss you

[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.220]
And I sure wish you were back on the air

[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.600]
Down here. I really thought that Neil Rogers was one stopp on you from being on the air

[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.860]
I've come over there and punch him in the nose. Oh, it isn't true. I got more calls than Neil and I

[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.460]
Oh, then we're from me. That's only problem

[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.300]
Yeah, they were all cranks that was the problem. I've been on the hit parade cop 10

[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.520]
The one call is more than Neil Rogers gets

[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.980]
Begging for calls are you attacking him? Oh, no, not really. This is another one of those

[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:37.820]
Elaceter callers always attacking Neil black campily, but let me say that go ahead man. I didn't like Neil Rogers originally

[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.400]
But I've been listening to him and I'm getting used to him. You know, he's kind of like a ward on your finger

[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.600]
You get used to him. Yeah, Bob. I sure a big word

[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.180]
You're doing issue and I always should come back down here. Well, that's very kind. I appreciate it

[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:55.820]
Well, you take care of yourself and jeez if you can do come down even if you go to another station. Okay, okay

[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.640]
WT. Aw, shucks. This is good in it. Aw, shucks

[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:07.540]
Man, I'm going to tell you something the tinkle meter has just gone right off the end. Let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, you're doing

[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:14.360]
Neil. Okay, was there a decision by the Supreme Court that the seven words could not be used or was there a legal decision at all?

[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.980]
That's correct. These are Supreme Court.

[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:22.360]
The SEC preempt that legal decision. Oh, they're not preempting it. They're expanding it. And of course it is going to be

[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.780]
Challenged by the ACLU and it is going to go to court again. The only thing you have to be concerned about is when you look at the

[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:34.300]
Composition of this court, you know, somehow I just can't see Sandra Day O'Connor saying douchebag. You know, I just I've just real

[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:40.080]
Nervous about it. We still have that five before sometimes. Yeah, they fluctuate. They swing both ways. Right.

[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:46.720]
Um, uh, anyways, uh, okay, I just wanted to ask that I wouldn't share if there was a decision or not. And I like the idea

[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:52.280]
Maybe we get blasts and air and that two to four shift you think you pull some strings or nothing about three to seven.

[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.260]
How about two to six? Well, two to four.

[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:02.280]
In the like a two to four. You know, he's not saying anything now. He speaks. It was me. My bags are packed. I like it.

[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.780]
Always been packed. Oh, you know, if you get Neil to pull some strings, well, you have a lot of cloud. I got news for

[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:13.000]
I got about as much cloud with this present regime as a dead frog. Okay. That's how much cloud I've got.

[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:19.420]
Anyway, they haven't even speak to me. Okay. Thank you. They didn't even speak to me. They passed me in a hall named Mudder like, oh, there he is.

[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:30.700]
What's he going to do today? You know, Lauder Hill. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Uh, I get off at a Tampa quite a bit. I was in the WPLP. You're the one. Yeah, the signal is good for about 20 miles.

[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:40.200]
That 20 blocks. Yeah, very weak signal. But I'll tell you I listen to that. That the talk radio over there. And I cannot believe where these people are coming from.

[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:58.900]
They really are in the dark ages. Yeah, most of them are coming from Britain. Yeah, well, Sarasota. Oh boy. And they want to hang everybody. And they think that Reagan should be canonized. And, uh, well, maybe we ought to put. Yeah, happy on the air over there. And we'll swap her for Lassiter and bring him back here.

[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.100]
They couldn't use tapiova. That she's too left wing.

[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:12.400]
Is it any market is really much more conservative than the Tampa market? The Tampa marketer, a bunch of armchair, social security recipients who hate everybody.

[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:28.140]
In Miami, the conservatives down there put on fatigues and go out into the Everglades on the weekends and practice. What's John? Can I talk to Bob a woman? Ask them one question? Go ahead, sir. This is America. Okay, Bob, when you would do in the, uh, I guess it was five to eight or something. I would leave Tampa.

[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:40.440]
Probably around five o'clock and start down 75. And I could pick up almost a four of myers. And you get into something really, you know, free swinging and liberal and making people think.

[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:46.700]
And then the call to start coming in. You got to be frustrated. I have the feeling that the people weren't listening to what you were talking about.

[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:52.960]
Well, that's the same case in Miami as it is up here. If you really want to know the truth, um, the Miami market.

[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:55.600]
It.

[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:07.040]
How can I phrase this Miami market was a was more inclined to express their opinion up here. The people just express their frustration. They just call up and scream.

[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:19.240]
You can't really get a dialogue going. Yeah, sure. It's frustrating for me. I go home many a night. How about this? If you want to do a morning show and competition with the zoo over there and let's have a kneeling Bob.

[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.280]
Hey, it's fine with me.

[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:28.180]
I think that would be great. I probably last one hour and a half to hours. I was I didn't think it'd make 10 minutes.

[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:38.820]
The FM here is looking for people. Bob, maybe you can. Yeah, the FM is speechless. As a matter of fact, over the last book, they're speechless. They haven't sent anything for two weeks.

[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.240]
And I think they got another two weeks to go before they're going to let their people start speaking again.

[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:48.600]
Why are the rumors that they've taken all the pictures of the FM people down? Oh, that's been for over a year. In fact, just when you left, they took them all down.

[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:56.820]
Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. The book, this last book had to be in two colors so they could put the FM rating in red and leaves.

[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:08.580]
Okay, sure. Well, listen, good luck to you. I have a great life and audio. I work on that great life. Okay. 12 minutes before noon at W Y and Z couples concerned about

[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.220]

[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:55.580]

[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:24.880]

[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.940]
assuming you're just a question of time and Bob let me tell you I can see how you feel

[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:53.100]
over there because you know when you got you this is very low hit count whether you're living

[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:57.720]
I can imagine how depressed you are living in that place. I want to tell you after the last

[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:03.200]
call hearing that Crick or Crick was a topic of conversation. Exactly. I'm not so sure I want to

[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.020]
come back. Yeah. Oh come on. This is a more sophisticated town. Listen to that. Neil. We even had a

[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.980]
call yesterday from Rock Crick. Go ahead sir. As long as you're going to be your thing's going to

[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:16.220]
Bob will come back to Miami somehow in a radio station. Give me a second of the hour. No he's

[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:21.900]
going to be back in a couple of weeks sir. I didn't want to let it out of the back before you.

[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.880]
I'm Bob I really hope you make it back because this people are sleeping. I don't know what's

[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:30.140]
going on here. Great talent. Just like Neil Rajson. I hope you come back maybe. Who good?

[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:36.580]
Maybe tomorrow. Who's I could. Thank you. Thank you. I hope you do that. Okay. Thank you. Okay

[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.340]
now listen we're going to do our last break. You want to stick around a little more as your wife

[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.680]
getting hysterical. I like to start getting hysterical. I thought with you told noon but that's it.

[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.580]
What do you mean told noon? Mike way. It's six and a half till noon. We got a three minute break so

[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:55.900]
I guess when we come back we'll have to say goodbye. So long for a while to Bob Lasseter when we

[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.740]
return. Okay it's three minutes before noon ladies and gentlemen and this is a sad moment in

[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:06.420]
radio broadcast history. Bob we just called up Mike Millen he's going to be collecting postcards to

[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:11.980]
bring you back to Miami. I appreciate that. Thank you Mike. He did. And the real question of course

[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:21.040]
before you leave us positive negative or negative neutral. I can't believe it. Well listen obviously

[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.640]
you've really titillated the sound floor audience. They're excited to hear your voice again. We thank

[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:30.680]
you for your perspicacity on the FCC ruling and of course probably you'll be the test case knowing

[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:35.680]
you as we all do here in sound Florida and good luck to you. Can I ask Bob a question before it

[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.060]
goes I know you got about 30 seconds. Was it true that you were up in the rock station up there

[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:45.520]
and you said something about giving out police car undercar police cars license plate numbers and

[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.700]
because of that they jumped on your case and you were a did land that was not me that was not

[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:55.720]
you and did you ever play that record that you were a part of a yes I did a landmark thing in FCC.

[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.840]
Well I tell you this is also exciting I wish to hell I knew what they were talking about but

[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.440]
Bob take good care of yourself our best regards to your wife your boss Dave Murray the whole staff.

[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.180]
By the way what time will you be home this afternoon I was going to call you today I have something

[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.880]
to discuss with you really really well I would say probably around three o'clock so long as

[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:18.040]
nobody hijacks me on the way okay I'll talk to you later excellent thank you Neil you bet bye I'm

[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.400]

[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:29.940]
last year who knows tomorrow maybe even David Gold we're reaching for the heights of broadcast

[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:35.360]
intensity here in South Florida now when we come back we have two more open hours till noon which

[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:39.320]
makes it very unfortunate because what the hell we do at this point nobody's got any idea but you

[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.820]
said you're going to have the young kids calling oh that's a good idea all those kids are going to

[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.400]
call in but of course they'll probably be all your friends will now dump them Tom Gattagher is

[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.140]
here with a headline CBS with the news at noon we'll come back with our number three at 1206 and

[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:57.740]
Ernie Soch in broadcasting live from the Hadassam meeting at two this afternoon area wide nation wide

[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:04.600]
worldwide when you narrow it down here's where you get radios and now back to Neil Rogers on

94 news wins if you'd like to call Neil dial 7640707 in Broward or 624 1191 in date and now here

[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:20.040]
again is Neil Rogers okay it's 1206 at W Y's is funny you should say that because I was thinking

[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:26.220]
about yesterday having my producer called Pam's Jingles in Dallas oh I'm serious and doing a show

[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:31.240]
would be great we could get all the old jingle packages that are no longer in use like in W ABC

[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:37.220]
Jingles and limits you know a keen or 13 in Detroit for all the real radio groupies but of course

[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.740]

[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.820]
Bob Lasseter is gone he's having a wonderful life he and his wife are having a little lunch now

[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.980]
been a morning the likes of which even Bill Tanner never had a morning like this and I wonder

[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.380]
where Bill Tanner is right at this moment as we're speaking killing makes him speculation or who's

[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:12.040]

be there in a short fat way yes thanks for calling there now only kidding Mike why do we do that

[00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:39.810]
why is it so easy to pick on poor Mike because Mike is a pickable person he just is he's one of

[00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:43.990]
there's something indefinible about them you just want to pick on him all it's because of that

[00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:49.090]
dentistry I don't boy Mike it's kind of like Mike Miller was calling me the town bully the other day

[00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:53.310]
that just came back to me in that insipid conversation he was having with the caller and he was

[00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:57.150]
talking about how some people have to be the town bully and they're always bullying everybody around

[00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:02.090]
but that was before I redeemed myself with a show yesterday with a guy from the FCC I need some

[00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:07.470]
help I don't know what you need but probably a job probably a job in fact there's a rumor that

[00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:13.390]
yesterday was Mike's last day was Hollywood hello yes well there is now yes sir

[00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:20.430]
Holly weird I'm a cab driver and I had to pull off the road yesterday I bet yes during the

[00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:26.810]
your conversation with the general lending from the fascist censorship commission yeah

[00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:34.430]
I'm hearing can I read some here it's called amendment one it's 200 years old go ahead sir

[00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:40.030]
congress shall make no more respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise

[00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:46.710]
there are or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of people who are peaceably

[00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:52.610]
assembled right into petition to government for redress of grievances yeah there's no asterix

[00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:57.890]
in there exactly there are no exceptions and first of all when a supreme court ruled years ago that

[00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:03.210]
the first amendment is an obscenity is not protected under the first amendment they're not they're

[00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:10.050]
crazy I don't see any asterix I like that there are no exceptions you know right um I was in

[00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:15.510]
the Vietnam and stuff and I would like to say I think you you're fighting for all freedom more

[00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:19.770]
than I was there because we're not gonna loosen from the vietcong or the Russians that these

[00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:24.570]
church bag bureaucrats are just gonna kind of nibble it away well nobody's paying attention

[00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:29.630]
everybody wants to get that BMWs or their BM is the case maybe but you know that that's the thing

[00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:35.410]
that amazes me is that and maybe I'm just in dream world but the rest of the broadcast at least

[00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:39.450]
in this town the rest of the broadcast community doesn't seem to be up in arms I mean they're exploiting

[00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:43.910]
it naturally because it's on a front page and something to talk about and get some calls on but

[00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:48.750]
but in terms of really being up in arms they're not and a lot of them in a very selfish way as I

[00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:54.310]
said earlier if it doesn't affect them or what they do they don't care about it but how about next

[00:52:54.310 --> 00:53:00.130]
week or next year when the FCC decides that any vicious verbal attacks against politicians

[00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:05.690]
or against the president are beyond the bounds of decent broadcasting and you know the year after

[00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:11.670]
that when it's something else uh what can the people that are urinated off can I say that yes

[00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:18.050]
what can we do about that what can we what can we do about it the only average you know the average

[00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:23.950]
uh guy out there to just you know it this woke me up and it's trying to still look still on

[00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:27.730]
freedom yeah well I was going to do about I was going to do something about that today but I'm

[00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:31.510]
going to wait till Monday because I want to talk to somebody at the ACLU here maybe we'll

[00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:36.010]
even get him on the phone and I realized that petition drives on something like this I don't

[00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:39.810]
want to sound like Mike Miller petitioning for the Super Bowl but at least you know I mean if 69

[00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:45.330]
letters can influence the FCC out of Philadelphia then I'm sure that thousands of other letters

[00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:48.550]
ought to have an impact I'm not sure they will but at least they ought to

[00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:53.570]
did you say 69 well if the guy from the FCC did yesterday although I noticed he was trembling when

[00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:59.870]
he said it oh he tremble when you said dickhead oh yeah oh twice no but uh Monday really I mean

[00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:04.450]
you know I mean there are people out here that are concerned about our freedom man and we know

[00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:09.390]
we got a fight from these bureaucrat two spags can we can I say two spags you already did twice

[00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:13.870]
isn't a three times like that really uh yet but wait a minute you see it's that constant repetition

[00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:18.570]
of course of course the word has no meaning but I'm sure that some of those stuffy jerks up

[00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:24.070]
your little thug one you can say in a bag thank you okay well it won't change it to that one but uh

[00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:28.430]
you know I mean really we don't have the letter yet okay so you can say anything you like other

[00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:33.130]
than those seven words because we don't have the letter yet there's long channels oh don't say

[00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:37.550]
don't say any one of the seven I'll have to dump it although I'm not sure we can say dump anymore

[00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:44.570]
either no oh no that's executory exactly that has a new colloquial meaning can you say uh bovine

[00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:53.150]
feces or things like that bovine or feline or canine as a matter of fact just not human just not

[00:54:53.150 --> 00:55:00.470]

[00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:08.670]
because we can say any of it but it isn't going to serve any useful purpose so what's going to happen

[00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:12.850]
now that nothing's going to happen I mean what's going to happen is a lot of us are going to raise

[00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:17.450]
holy hell and the ACOU is going to take these morons to court and then we'll find out if the

[00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:09.030]
what I'm a little bit under the weather and we had a weird final game last night the hercane's

[00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:14.310]
119 to 9 and I think ron Fraser's comment as he went to the mound in the ninth inning probably

[00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:19.250]
captored very well and he said listen we got to get this over I'm going to sleep was his comment which

[00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:24.890]
I thought he didn't realize his mic was on but ron never have two or words been spoken but it was

[00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:28.910]
a good way to go out we won big and everybody was happy and we had a lot of shots of the cheerleaders

[00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:33.110]
and the back girls and the ball girls and all of that good stuff I'm telling you those guys in the

[00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:41.090]
truck man they're just in a constant did there huh did there oh that's all right you think you can

[00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:45.870]

[00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:51.730]
between innings is the guys with the cameras are panning around the stadium okay let's do our

now in north Miami Beach hello you know I can't believe that Ken block is calling us again okay

[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:12.190]
oh there's no question in my mind about it there's not even the slightest bit of question

[01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:19.890]
now I thought that we had a good hard to hard conversation with Saul on Monday and that we had

[01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:24.930]
put this to rest but you know it's obvious there are some people in this community even adults

[01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:31.410]
supposedly mature adults with responsible positions who don't care about them and that's amazing

[01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:36.070]
I mean that's come Monday morning man the you don't think that was him I do

[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:42.670]
is a friend but I don't think that was him I know his voice

[01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:46.890]
you know the way what there he goes he's still talking yeah he was still talking I should

[01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:55.450]
left him on there a hollywood hello yes I just want to mention I agree with you on

[01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:02.890]
that these ACLU should proceed with that and you're doing a good job and I hope that your

[01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:09.750]
pills work for something I want to mention first unite on channel 10 they had Steve Paynot

[01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:16.970]
asked him two questions yeah who should be responsible for a talk show's

[01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:26.570]
words he specifically said management yeah that's because he's going to have to clean up his act

[01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:30.210]
yeah that's who is he going to work for Cox Broadcasting and of course they change into

[01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:38.910]
every half hour and and Bishop asked him yeah I said he said you know of any

[01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:47.850]
talk show host in this area but use foul language yeah foul he says I couldn't mention that

[01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:55.110]
I couldn't mention the station of the name why not I guess he didn't have a goddamn nerve

[01:01:55.670 --> 01:02:00.370]

a last call with a doctor yeah well that was true that thing on tv though that movie altered states

[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:13.460]
in fact is on a cable this weekend George South Carolina we you know this could go on forever sir

[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:17.800]

let's go to Fort Lauderdale hello hello nil yes sir first time call a bit only because I listen

[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:58.880]
every week in the car great you know this morning you were talking about professor Corey how great he

[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.880]
was yeah well compared to him he's nothing compared to that episode from that cc who double talks

[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:08.980]
better than I know Corey personally is ago this episode double talk to you even more than Corey

[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:13.500]
could ever do no question about that but you know what the problem is the only wait a minute the

[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:17.940]
only difference is that Corey's funny and he wasn't yes unfortunately I have to agree with you but

[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:23.100]
you know the problem is he said he got 69 letters from Philadelphia yeah the rest of us sit on our

[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:27.340]
butts and we don't write in when we like something yeah well just wait till monday sir we're going to

bottles uh we're going to send Mike Miller up there with bags of cars anything we can do now

[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:42.040]
on your previous call it is was telling you about the penis in planal that that you know children when

[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:46.380]
they see of course health programs they know the difference obviously correct with a very

[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:51.100]
facetious tone I say that yeah yeah but I have to have seen that well I got to based on a medical

[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:55.760]
research and new discovery I got news for you though so wait a minute wait a minute sir I was

[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.340]
hello hello sir be slow down I know you're getting yourself excited but just one comment to you

[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:07.780]
again mr. McKinney in referring to children was talking about 12 to 17 year olds now if there

[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:13.660]
are any 12 or 13 year olds out there who have yet to see a penis uh good luck to them yeah that's

[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:18.880]
what I'm saying I'm not saying post impersonal necessarily but you know I used to be a distributor

[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:26.160]
or a year back in the early 70s and it was only to movie theaters legitimate movie theaters during

[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.220]
the deep throat days and all that yeah and I had dear friends and I escaped it that was

[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:38.180]
okay how's was it a prosecutor by the federal government uh with obscenity and I being arrested

[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:43.840]
in their homes because they shipped the piece of film to somebody I mean the laws were so ludicrous

[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:50.460]
as comparable to this and it took unfortunately about another 10 15 years before it finally got

[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:55.640]
to where I could show it in specific areas and so on but I think the radio is still 10 of 15 years

[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:01.620]
away this is the sad part about this thing okay sir well listen good luck to us all believe me you've

[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:06.160]
been a pleasure to me and my car for the last year and I love you for it thank you thank you

[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:13.820]
oh we got W snoozes calling over here well that's embarrassing okay what what is he doing

[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:18.700]
is he taking all of my calls away over here I think Fowler just put this back on hold would you please

[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:24.000]
go sit down and relax and have a wonderful life Hollywood hello I need to hide on tape okay

[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.860]
enjoy the show yes sir I thought you really tore the guy up I mean he he couldn't I don't know if

[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:34.280]
he couldn't answer because he didn't know or because he was probably told you know not to be

[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:39.500]
really specific about it like the whole lot right just being ambiguous about the whole thing but

[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:45.380]
I really enjoyed it and and I'm telling you it's you know you talk about the 1984 syndrome

[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:51.100]
it's really really coming to pass yeah just three years late you notice he kept interchanging

[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:56.960]
of sanity in decency and profanity yep we kept playing with those three words back and forth

[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.480]
and in and out and up and down and all around the mulberry bush you know what the hell is really

[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.800]
the difference you know I mean it's so ridiculous so I'll tell you what I mean maybe I'm stupid but

[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.460]
and you know it didn't seem to me that he'd define any of the three really to my status no and he

[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:14.860]
and he didn't he was no more specific about what it is that they're upset about or what they're

[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:19.320]
going to be looking for all he kept saying is that we're warning we're issuing you a warning

[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:23.640]
and all the broadcast is warning and if children are likely to be listening and he kept repeating

[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.440]
the times when they're most likely to be listening and then when I'd say to them well a three

[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.380]
in the morning can you say that he well it all depends on the intent and how you're channeling it

[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:35.680]
I mean you're right even even Erwin Corey has never given so much double talk

[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.960]
yeah really well you know and then you look at regular television the sitcoms and with the young

[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:46.220]
kids the teenage kids the 12 to 17 year old I mean look at the subject matter on that the only

[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:50.180]
thing they'll admit is the words everything else there's nothing left in your imagination anyway

[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:54.500]
well you see I do again I guess it's okay if you watch him do it but you just can't say it

[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.960]
exactly well you know I'll tell you what what's really bugging me here's the top or all of this

[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:06.120]
stuff you talk about the government fascism is a next year up to get to claim your children for

[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:13.000]
deduction they're going to have to have social security numbers okay it's like you're going to

[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.100]
have a number on you from the time of birth and you know that way the government's going to be

[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:21.880]
able to keep track of everything and I understand that William F. Buckley would like us to tattoo them

[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.320]
on their buttocks the social security number that's what my wife says she says well why don't you just

[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:31.220]
do like the Nazis they just tattoo you know from birth you know right there when the doctor

[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.100]
delivers the kid they just have to tattoo artists right there and put the number right on your

[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:42.900]
wrist you know I mean why not right okay good luck to us sir really okay 1232 at W.I.N.Z we have

[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:48.920]
an open line in brown and 764 07 07 I must say this that when you're not here ordinarily I'm not

[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.400]
quite so paranoid about every call but since you're here in the studio it's like every time we

[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:59.580]
punch a call off it's like touch and go this is the boy if some of these calls today I can't believe

[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:05.180]
this baby it sounds better at home we also want to say good morning to Alan ison son at W.S. News

[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:09.880]
we understand that Alan's suffering from terminal border today does he really call here and crank

[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.880]
he's he's done it before I know yes he's done it before I don't know I'm not asking about his

[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:19.920]
personal life I'm just asking if he is cranked both before yeah really kind of like that movie mass

[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.600]
appeal okay let's go to Pember Cines hello they are just want to raise a question if the

[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.240]
commission is so worried about what broadcast is going to stand here rather than then go after

[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.000]
people are using language that is obviously entertaining due to the ratings the generates what

[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.120]
about all by hate being spewed by most of the Spanish language radio stations here in South Florida

[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.680]
oh see they're not interested in content that would be the answer he would give you they are

[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.580]
not interested and I asked him that question you know Nazis can be on the air and clansmen and

[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:52.680]
hate groups and the most violent rotten obnoxious disgusting subhuman types of people who are whose

[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.080]
views are repugnant to the overwhelming majority of the public they don't care about that and they

[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.840]
don't care about in sight to riot just if you say douchebag it may offend some little lady

[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:09.160]
him exactly okay good luck to you sir okay police what's that you think that the whole F.C.

[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:13.260]
thing is going to be enforced uh you think everybody's going to be running all over the place sending

[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:17.140]
letters to self-help that doesn't go down here you think there's any over here oh man

[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:20.620]
I'm going to tell you they're going to have the other one in century village oh he said douchebag

[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:27.340]
by thimes today and he said chuch-bag six times and his collar is said mong I mean they don't

[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:30.920]
even know what the hell these words mean or how they're being used and right away you know it's the

[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:36.300]
war of the words again this is so juvenile and so embarrassing and so pathetic and as I said

[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.780]
before and I really know I know that almost everybody in this business listen to this show

[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:45.160]
religiously I am going to tell you something anyone in this business and radio or television and

[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:51.100]
any capacity who supports the F.C.C. decision and beyond that who doesn't fight against it with

[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:56.740]
every ounce of energy in his or her body is a moron because again it has nothing to do with what

[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:01.720]
you say in your show or your performance or your newscaster anything else it has to do with allowing

[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.740]
more of our freedoms to be taken away and I got news for you baby once they take them away you're

[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.580]
never going to get them back the F.C.C. should worry about but better things because some of these

[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:15.140]
illegal stations are playing all those words and everything that I played it to display look at

[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:19.880]
this talk about quick action the folks in broward have already called to put me on notice already

[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.940]
this morning in terms of their setting letter I just said so I hope they have a wonderful time I

[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:29.180]
hope you folks I you know again it'll keep you off the streets and probably reduce the crime rate in

[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:34.000]
Broward County because it's going to keep all of them misfits busy inside typing and writing and

[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.700]
how can it wait it'll probably do just as much good is that petition drive to get me off the air

[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.520]
in Helen Dale just like this

[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:49.860]
22 before 1 at W.I. and 0 we're here till 2 o'clock when I'm going to be out running the 440 and

[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:54.100]
Ernie Sochin is going to be here he's going to be broadcasting live from Tel Aviv today on

[01:12:54.100 --> 01:13:00.480]
the satellite let's go to North Miami hello hello mr. Rogers yes sir I just was wondering

[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.100]
if you if you want to spell an objection or word would you be in violation with the new code

[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:12.100]
yes it would be in violation oh sure because they would say that you're only doing it for the

[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:17.660]
purpose of being vulgar so even you know whether you spell it or say it all I say I just I like just

[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:23.520]
want me to take the counter like that could be used well you know it's I enough to law but you see

[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.380]
here's the point the point is and this is the point that you're making is that we're dealing with

[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:34.520]
such nitpicking and somatical games that they're playing now that it's hard to say it who knows exactly

[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.840]
what they're looking for it just gives me the feeling now that they want to be big brother and they're

[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.720]
looking for any excuse they can to stifle free speech wherever they want they know question that

[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.720]
they want to get Howard Stern off the air no question in my mind they want the man off the air

[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.880]
it's probably the other radio station and and you know if they want to get out of the air can you

[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:56.200]
imagine the tombop I mean here's a guy who's the most listened to personality in a in a market of 12

[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.240]
million people can you imagine the public response if they should try to take this guy off the air

[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:07.420]
sure good yep they'll be marching on the FCC they'll towering feather these guys you know in

[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:13.480]
Washington I don't think so well they have to be defined of the law one way or the other someone

[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:18.640]
has to stand up to them and I thought maybe I will suggest and yeah rather than say I'll tell you

[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.260]
I'll tell you one thing nothing is changing on this show and I'm not I don't think that I go over

[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.780]
the line although there's some of the little old bags out there in the audience should do but there's

[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:34.640]
nothing going to change on this show okay thanks for calling okay the mob those are the ones sending

[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.740]
the letters not the mafia but the miserable old bags that's the acronym mob and we've got so many

[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:43.780]
of them done here in South Florida they're the ones who get all bent on a shape about the

[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:49.960]
FCC's address Monday we're gonna do that Monday we're gonna start a barrage the likes of which no

[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:55.340]
one is ever seen maybe even last year will participate in that why are you looking at that phone

[01:14:55.340 --> 01:15:01.480]
like you'd like to impale it with some very sharp bloody object okay let's move on to Hollywood

[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:07.780]
hello hello yes okay I want to bring you up to date on something technically that can be

[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:12.800]
avoided with the FCC and their problems typically that happened a few years back in Holland that only

[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:20.380]
if you're familiar with what's known as radio Veronica no okay their FCC in Europe was also trying

[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:25.220]
to control and what they did was they simply put a transmitter which the FCC actually license here

[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:30.900]
a transmitter they don't license the talk show host or their radio announcers so what can be done

[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:37.100]
it put a transmitter out three miles out the Miami and transmit and they can't have any control

[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:41.100]
over that radio station since it's not there that's that's not true they've done that pie we've had

[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:45.520]
pirate radio stations all over the place and it's just not legal and as soon as they find out who's

[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:51.400]
doing it they put them right out of business not no the FCC is slowing that it's been on for no

[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:56.320]
there's one there's one down here I'm not gonna mention anything about it but uh

[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:03.480]
for just saying the FCC has control oh yes outside of the three mile away the FCC has one guy I

[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:08.820]
spoke to lady over there he works from here all the way for like all the way up to Key West about half

[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:13.200]
the floor to that one guy or if you call in the complaint here there's one guy to check out the

[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.780]
complaints so they're like three times yeah I say as soon as they can find out who's doing it

[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.000]
you know but again how quickly that happens is another story that could take years just slow

[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.760]
well how about uh but what's that like training but one point down on earth yeah well wait a minute

[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:33.580]
one point you're missing is that this is a commercial enterprise okay and it's not very likely

[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:37.820]
that somebody is going to go to the lengths to start a pirate radio station on a ship and sell

[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:43.380]
advertising has been done by the way but I mean it's just such a preposterous notion that somebody

[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.380]
is going to go into a profit making business like this in addition to which all of the people who

[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:52.220]
hold broadcast licenses allegedly are responsible broadcasters and they're not going to you know

[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:56.700]
go out of their way to do something to violate the law and to jeopardize their license

[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.980]
I don't quite understand that if the FCC can control outside of three mile limit today control

[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:10.540]
satellites and all satellite transmissions sure they do phones and they do you bet naturally

[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.500]
internationally no not internationally but we do have international agreements there are cooperative

[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:20.040]
agreements there are some countries like Cuba for example which violates which will not

[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.740]
you know cooperate with international broadcast law but most we are taking up their transmissions

[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:29.780]
right I beg your pardon we are picking up their transmissions sure and they're trying they and they

[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:38.660]
jam American signals the best they can well listen if he has his way he and vana white can

[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:43.120]
start their own station what can I say I can't believe that this is a celebrity caller on this line

[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:50.760]
hello hello yes I need a little bit better build Tanner Tanner in the afternoon or the just barely

[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.640]
past morning I call them twice wait a minute you called him twice when he was on hot one of five

[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.960]
doing mornings yeah yeah but it's very hard to get on your show in the morning 96 well you

[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:06.080]
guys are very entertaining with first of all I want to agree basically with Neil that anybody in

[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.540]
this business and God knows I've been in and got a lot of great hairs through it for 30 years

[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:16.580]
anybody who doesn't agree with what you said about people in this business being alarmed yeah

[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.400]
hoarding you bet your position that you have voiced today and although I didn't hear your show

[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.820]
Friday I did hear from everybody in the broadcast community you all right the broadcast community

[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:33.940]
listens to Neil Rogers you bet and thank God they do well I'm really glad to hear that because I

[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:38.200]
and you know coming from you and I could have predicted your position because I know that you

[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:44.000]
believe as I do that the commission has absolutely no business getting involved in content or language

[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.620]
or any of this and the idea that they're now trying to make more and more restrictions and in

[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:52.720]
fringe upon a freedom we already have is absolutely unacceptable and I keep hearing the word

[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.000]
chilling being used and I would agree with that I think maybe it's an understatement but it is a

[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.140]
chilling ruling because it's you know it's a stroke of fascism it chilled me because I was just

[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:05.940]
thinking about the things that I say and don't say for years I sit on the answer of how are you

[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:12.120]
upset how are yours yeah over folks right yeah well again you know and this is what I tried to get

[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.580]
from James McKinney yesterday I said look what are we talking about when you say sexual in you window

[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:23.640]
or a suggestive material I mean those are such broad nebulous terms that can mean almost anything

[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.320]
and I said hey listen suppose somebody makes a joke about Dolly Parton's boobs with foot that fall

[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.580]
into the category and he says well again it depends upon the context in which it falls what the hell

[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:39.840]
does that mean I know exactly what you're saying my question is how far do you think this will really go

[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:45.720]
I don't I don't have a crystal ball but I do know that now is the time for people to

[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:52.060]
to protest every responsible ballsy person in this business has got to say no way Jose and I know

[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.480]
you know the ACLU has already said that they're gonna you know they're gonna test it and they're

[01:19:55.480 --> 01:20:00.000]
gonna fight it all the way to the Supreme Court and I think we need to do it now because whether

[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.420]
a person likes Howard Stern or Neo-Rongers or Bill Tanner or anybody else is not relevant you

[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:08.520]
know as well as I do there are lots of people out there right now who'd like to get you off the

[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:12.680]
air like to get me off the air and certainly a lot of old prunes who'd love to get Stern off the

[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.700]
air absolutely but that is not the point the point is what it's going to do and exactly what you

[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:20.220]
said a few minutes ago about what happens when the next thing or one of your callers said what

[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:25.600]
happened next thing yeah uh to be regulated is what the president says or what the FCC says or what

[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:30.780]
somebody that you just don't don't like period says yeah that and there are a lot of implications

[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.480]
to go beyond Howard Stern and what they've done here with the Howard Stern in the Pacific

[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:41.200]
cases I think is they're using a bazook if anything to give them the very most that they can have

[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.700]
they're using a bazooka to kill a fly and the fly is our first amendment right but also what they've

[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:50.660]
done and I really believe this firmly in talking to this guy yesterday and listening to the other

[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:55.600]
comments it had been passed they're licking their wounds really because they lost I mean they had

[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.000]
the hearing and they didn't beat Stern and they didn't beat infinity broadcasting on that so now

[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.800]
what they've done is say hey we know that you were clever and we know you didn't say any of the

[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:08.360]
seven words so now we're going to make such a wide generalization and then we'll wait till Monday

[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:11.840]
when you get back on the air and morality and media and all these other jackasses are going to

[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.640]
monitor now we're going to nail you what's also the Reagan administration's legacy they've got years

[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.880]
more of of nothing so they're going to leave us with this no question about it you're a morning

[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:26.820]
showing specific like some of the jokes that you make about the dog six are you going to be

[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:30.960]
changing that or anything like that I'm with Neil I'll of course I'll do with the management

[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.100]
of the radio station ownership absolutely insists on doing because they have to keep their

[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:38.800]
license the old point about this being a commercial business that's the chilling effect right

[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.900]
there but do I want to do I think it's necessary do I think I should absolutely not I might

[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:48.120]
Neil don't change a thing and protest and if you're in this business and you don't take the

[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.500]
stance you're a damn wimp well I really would like to see all of us get together all you know I was

[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:57.660]
disappointed reading Fowler's comments this morning but I guess that's to be predicted but I hope

[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.280]
that a lot of us in this market and I know that people like Jerry Williams I had Jerry on yesterday

[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.500]
and many others will join forces in doing whatever we can to stimulate a lot of letter writing and a

[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:11.340]
lot of phone calls and work with the ACLU and and beat the hell out of this thing because you know

[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:17.780]
to think that just a small handful of people can dictate what is free speech and what is not or

[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.640]
dictate what our contemporary broadcast community standards is ludicrous you know as well as I do

[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.380]
community standards are not definable you know any time you got a community of more than one person

[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.580]
there are no community standards of course well I'll tell you one thing here's one person who

[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:35.960]
stands ready to do whatever I can to help you and you have a standing invitation to be on my

[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.680]
show and promote the cause and tell me what's excellent I'll talk to you next week thank you thanks

[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.660]
a lot Bill Bill Tanner of Power 96 and hopefully I'm sure that our people here of course the problem

[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:49.300]
at Zeta 94.9 they're not talking yet right but I'm sure that we can put some kind of messages on

[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:52.900]
there because everybody in the market really needs to get together everybody with balls that is

[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:57.160]
and say listen you're not going to intimidate us and you're not going to tell us what we can say

[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.560]
and start defining because again the seven words were bad enough I never agreed with that

[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.360]
but okay we can live without them as childish as it was we could live without them and I really

[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.980]
thought that as of the other day they were going to say hey listen it's childish deregulation is

[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:14.900]
gone very far we're just going to be we're going to be babysitters we're going to watch to make

[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:18.460]
sure you don't overmodulate you don't interfere with somebody else's signal we're going to make

[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:22.380]
sure you don't run any phony contest and we're going to make sure that the licenses are held by

[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:26.820]
responsible people and other than that go do your own thing because that really is what free speech

[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:31.420]
in the first amendment is all about and instead of that now they have all of these vague and ambiguous

[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:36.480]
and nebulous contradictory statements and is it going to be sexual material is it Dr. Ruth is

[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:42.180]
it Fred shots you know again it's just an attempt on the part of prudes and prunes in this country

[01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:49.600]
to stamp out sex I guess that's their SOS campaign stamp out sex you can do it but you can't

[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:53.860]
talk about it and of course the moral majoritarians they can do it but nobody else can even think

[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:59.240]
about it and it's just absolutely intolerable and unacceptable and Joseph Girbels is alive and

[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:04.200]
well in the United States today in Washington so I'm really excited that Bill Tanner called

[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.800]
and I'm hoping that we'll get some other people in the business who've got some guts you know we're

[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:13.840]
going to respond exactly the way that he did yes sir the stations that will not say such as Mr.

[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:19.360]
Snues they don't have anybody on there right now we'll even go into that maybe Alwell so basically

[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:25.160]
I think the Alistairn Alistairn Alistairn Alistairn Alistairn they're not going to be worried about

[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.840]
that because nobody on that station will do that so Leo just basically our management over

[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.060]
they'll use that to their advantage yeah but again see the broader point is Tanner pointed out

[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:38.340]
that that isn't really relevant what happens in a couple of years or in the next year before Reagan

[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:42.920]
is out what happens when they say okay and of course keep in mind the new commissioner of the FCC

[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:49.000]
is a right-winger appointed by Reagan what happens when they say okay no more derogatory comments

[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.080]
about politicians they are no longer public figures in the traditional sense that they always have

[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.600]
been and the no longer can you make these outrageous statements etc. about the president about the

[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.580]
vice president who knows what they could say you know they are doing these things arbitrarily they're

[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:08.080]
making out these rules as they go along and as the gentleman who called before who read the first

[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:18.980]
amendment which is very brief very simple there is no asterisk there are no exceptions it doesn't say

[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:24.780]
well you can't yell fire in a crowded theater you know even that even that is marginal all right

[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.700]
and we do understand about the libel and slander laws and there's nobody who debates that because

[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:33.560]
if you defame somebody else and you ruin their reputation in livelihood or life whatever

[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:38.240]
wait nobody would debate that from a legal standpoint but in terms of just being able to speak

[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.300]
what's on your mind and there's another thing that really bugs me too because a lot of people

[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:46.640]
including some in this business and I'm embarrassed by some of the comments including some of Craig

[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.260]
Worthings this morning I'm ashamed of him you know the idea that there are people who come on

[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:55.420]
the air and just want to tell it like it is and just either from a sense of humor or just outrage

[01:25:55.420 --> 01:26:00.280]
or satire whatever it is and just want to speak like real honest to goodness human beings it's got

[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:05.700]
nothing to do with pandering for ratings now stern yes stern does that whole stick for a reason it's

[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:10.880]
an act that attracts an enormous audience it's done very specifically for a reason but I don't think

[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:15.640]
that everybody who comes on the air and makes uses a particular phrase to be expressive or to be

[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.400]
outrageous I don't think it's done the pander for ratings and I'm really getting tired of hearing

[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.980]
that term every time you do something that you think is innovative or interesting or outrageous or

[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:30.080]
different or new he's pandering for ratings well what the hell are we here for are we here to lose

[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:37.060]
are we here to turn off the audience they're looking they're looking they don't like creativity to

[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:42.480]
just want exactly what they want us to go back like Gary Owen's on laughing that he put the hand

[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.080]
over the air and in tone for the audience good afternoon ladies and gentlemen in fact this jerk this

[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:54.720]
a fine who was on Larry King show a couple of nights ago with I'mus he says well you know listening

[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:58.640]
to the content of some of these programs we're discussing it's certainly not edifying or

[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.160]
informative you know as if everything that has to be on the air is edifying or informative is

[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:10.560]
moonlighting informative or edifying is Friday the 13th part three edifying it's entertainment 99

[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.140]
percent of what goes on in radio and television is entertainment even the night the news has become

[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:19.540]
entertainment at the local level me shells there with the earrings and she's winking and blinking and

[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:24.660]
the the weatherman is dancing around like a clown and Lloyd Lindsay Young on W.O.R. is on on on speed

[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:30.960]
or something it's entertainment this not you see here's a group of pseudo intellectuals taffy ought to

[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.640]
love this thing I'm sure she probably agrees with them uh pseudo intellectuals looking down their

[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:40.340]
noses and telling us that we have to look down at the public you know how far down can you look

[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:45.580]
what am I getting excited about it seven before one it wins we'll come right back

[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:51.800]
it's four minutes before one at W.O.R. I'm so positive you have no idea okay let's go to my

[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:58.260]
Emmy next hello hello yes oh Neil this is a long time listener in a first time caller and I have

[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:02.400]
to congratulate you on the stance that you're taking and Mr. Tanner as well I think you hit it

[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:09.120]
right on the head that it's that it's Ronnie Bay's legacy you know leaving us and if anybody is

[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.540]
doing any pandering it's there is administration's pandering to these for the right wing fanatics

[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:17.740]
absolutely you know far right to the religious right all of you they talk with it's dangerous

[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:22.140]
e-dick that they came down with and that these these old cronies over there are nothing more than

[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:27.580]
political hacks and and appointees by the Reagan administration and they're the ones that are

[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:33.420]
trying to tell us what we can listen to what we can see on television instead of allowing us to

[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:38.240]
make up our own minds what's uh... folder what's obscene the supreme court can't decide what's

[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:42.580]
obscene the communities themselves can't decide what's obscene and all of a sudden these guys are

[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:47.160]
going to tell us what's uh... what's vulgar and what we can or what we cannot hear yeah and I'm

[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:51.840]
afraid the only way that uh... that anything is going to change on this without any kind of a

[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.260]
public here which which if people don't raise up on this then they deserve what they get okay

[01:28:56.260 --> 01:29:00.100]
but i want to remind you something when it meets and all those letters out from the department of

[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:04.940]
justice threatening all the you southland corporation seven eleven stores about playboy in pet house

[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:09.060]
there was no i cry from the public and the only people are really got excited about it were all

[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:13.380]
the fundamentalists who were in a feeding frenzy and low and behold southland cave dynne and they

[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:18.040]
took them off the stands and this is just another example of the same kind of thing intimidate intimidate

[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:22.000]
intimidate clean up your act and of course what most of these people are doing behind the scenes like

[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.320]
jim baker and jesse cahana you know that's okay

[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:29.520]
well i think that southland is in a bit of a different position than than people like you because you

[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.460]
have the the public here and if enough of the broadcasters and i think it's absolutely

[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:39.720]
unconscionable that people like leaf hour can go along if anybody goes along with this kind of uh...

[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:43.900]
of a ruling they got to be out of their mind for the other side of the special in his case because

[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:48.460]
his station is in all talks they're a shape of form with a ruling like that yeah okay sir

[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:52.880]
but you know that's really a major point that's an all talk station with the exception of their

[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:57.600]
morning program and for that stations program director to be parroting and kissing the butt

[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:02.180]
of the commission on this is really one of the most gutless acts anyone could imagine

all right you know yes sir how you doing okay you say what you say what sir

[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.220]
i was watching opera yesterday well it obviously affected you

[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:16.560]
first time in my life i got out of school and i sat down and uh because they were talking about

[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:21.740]
the uh we had to say we're going to have some outrageous radio personalities on

[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:25.900]
on Oprah one for sure so i'm thinking oh wow i get to see how it's done right get to see

[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:30.120]
you know somebody really outrageous and i suspect that it would probably you weren't on it because

[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:35.620]
apart from uh your feelings for Oprah uh i i didn't i didn't uh here you mentioned anything but

[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:39.660]
no i heard they had fun it they couldn't find anybody exciting in this market so they put sunny

[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:44.480]
fox on here wouldn't believe it yeah you had sunny the out you know and i guess the people

[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:48.180]
watching the show are thinking these are the most outrageous people on the radio yeah as a matter

[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:51.900]
of fact i heard just a rumor i didn't see the show i heard sunny started eating a banana in the middle

[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:58.760]
of the show and the fdc demanded they get him off camera well i mean this it was on first of all

[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:04.740]
they bleeped out suck can you believe that on the show they bleeped it out with an s yeah okay that

[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:09.800]
that's that's what i thought you said yes i could i first of all that that's and then Oprah was

[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:13.460]
having a nervous breakdown anytime one of the guys will start talking about one of their outrageous

[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:17.460]
things and these are the you know they asked one of the guys what was the most outrageous thing you

[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:23.320]
ever did and he says oh i i put it up for lease report that uh my air air guitar was stolen

[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:27.740]
i mean that is the most out you know that was stupid that wasn't outrageous that's pretty heavy

[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:32.080]
stuff i said i got arrested that was stupid while sunny couldn't get arrested that's his problem

[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.860]
and and uh you know and what do we get as a representative of my amia guy that looks like he's on

[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:42.620]
drugs you know and sounds like he's on drug and it looks like it too and acts like he's on drug can you

[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:47.200]
do his imitation guys again uh you know more and more closed but that's the thing about this

[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:54.640]
scares me the most uh during the the era of the millivorous california case which which is

[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:59.880]
which is by the way a pornography case yes feeling with the airways or anything uh

[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:05.500]
justice potter steward who uh who was one of the three justice who retired recently from the

[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:11.100]
spring court over the next 20 years uh he said they asked him you know how do you how can you tell

[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:15.300]
obscenity yeah he says i don't i can't define it but i know it when i see it right and that's the

[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:19.860]
danger is part about this yeah it's ridiculous i know it when i see it and the fc knows that when

[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:24.560]
they see it or they they know it when they don't like it yeah and they know they know profanity

[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:29.180]
and indecency when they hear it they can't define it because we found out in that incipit

[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:33.560]
interview yesterday that they can't define anything but they know it when they hear it so they're

[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.520]
not going to tell us what it is but when they hear it they'll let us know and they'll come after us

[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.260]
well that that uh that uh that uh mr. mccanley that you were talking to he must have been an

[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:46.020]
attorney because uh William mccanley former president sir president well he might uh

[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:51.880]
hopefully he won't before the same fate as the William mccanley of the past but uh sounded like

[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.860]
he already had yeah uh the thing is you know i i i go to university of my army law school and

[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:05.300]
and that kind of reasoning that he was using uh was was just you know it was just patent legal reasoning

[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:11.460]
it was patently offensive right right as he would say that that guy would have gotten an A in

[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:16.180]
any basic maneuvers in uh you know in trial tactically yeah i think there's probably something

[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:22.980]
Freudian or at least significant otherwise in the fact that both he and uh professor quarry were on

[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:28.980]
you know in the same day well what what tell me what can you say about uh a scholar the guy agrees

[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:33.740]
with this thing i can't i couldn't believe that either well again because he's a professional butt

[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:38.220]
kisser and he just uh and it's interesting to me because there was a caller who questioned him

[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:43.240]
about it the other day when i got off the ear and uh he was dancing all over the place and on the

[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.800]
one hand uh he was saying that there are people to go over the line but on the other hand he was

[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:52.100]
defending his uh childish sex pulls that he's been taking and have you done it on the ceiling and

[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:56.260]
did you do it in the car and in the backyard did you do it on the floor on the wall you know so i

[01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:00.660]
guess that's okay and that's in good taste but if somebody uses a little bit of language in order

[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:05.260]
to be comedic or in order to make a satirical comment and that's uh that's naughty and we ought to

[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:09.920]
you know we ought to applaud the fcc the guy's a hypocrite and a jerk and he ought to be arrested

[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.500]
for imitating a broadcaster what's the problem in here and this this this is this is our whole society

[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:21.660]
especially uh during the Reagan administration that they just don't want the truth because that's

[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:27.060]
your problem you know you you you get down and you say the things the way they are and you say

[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.080]
the truth and i know a lot of people tell you that you do that and and and that's true i feel

[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:37.080]
and that's the problem with this basically this all gets down to let's not let the people know

[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.080]
what's actually going on we're not going to let the people know that most of these kids that they're

[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:46.040]
trying to protect are using words twice as bad as the ones they want to ban and and probably

[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:50.960]
are chaining them together in addition to it let's not even you know i said that to the other day

[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:57.880]
but let's go beyond that words don't hurt anybody words are just they're just what they are they're

[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:02.920]
words and they're only as meaningful as we make them and if we give them this added significance and

[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:08.540]
we we cloak them in all of this gigantic shroud of mystery and vulgarity and all of this other

[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:13.540]
that's when it becomes something beyond what they are words are just means of expression nothing more

[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:19.480]
nothing less right well i think i think uh that that uh there's a little exception to that words

[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:24.620]
don't hurt anybody the words that the Reagan administration and and the all of their cronies are

[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:30.660]
using the words to get out of of responsibility and the lies and and and and and yeah but again

[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:34.820]
that's the intent behind them it's not the words themselves it's the intent behind the rulings

[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:39.100]
and they're they're just getting out of all these you know problem and they can use words but well

[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.160]
i just you know i just think that this whole thing is is it's like you say it's going to happen

[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:48.960]
the ACLU is going to get down on them they're going to have a test case which the ACLU is an expert

[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:54.300]
at doing is is setting up a situation and getting somebody to sue and setting up a test case yeah

[01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:59.640]
and and they're going to take it up there and and the problem is this you got O'Connor you got

[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:08.520]
Rankquest as Chief Justice you got Scalia and you got Justice uh Steven who who all three of these

[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.260]
all four of these guys you know all you need is one more swing boat yeah got you know and then

[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:17.720]
that's the best yes you see is one thing setting up an administrative rule but when the supreme

[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.740]
court comes down and lays down a ruling that they've been itching to lay down since

[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:26.800]
millivirt is California it's gonna it's gonna really it's gonna really affect the market well let's

[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.600]
just cross our fingers yeah okay and get our passports ready too by the way 113 that w and z we have

[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.380]
an open line in brown at 764 all you seven oh seven we start saying that in this hour because

[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:44.620]
Ernie show is less than an hour away plantation hello hello Neil yes sir how you doing good uh had a

[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:51.040]
couple remarks I've written down here I just want to tell it to you in fruit cake the uh the problem

[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:57.940]
this is so widespread that the uh numbers also have a problem like take for it for instance the

[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:04.920]
number 69 which he mentioned several times yesterday yeah that's also could be sexually whatever

[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:12.360]
right no well not in his mind because he's one of those clean period tanical individuals he probably

[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:17.340]
doesn't even know what that means but in somebody's mind is listening to it they could think that

[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:22.180]
and be offended so absolutely it could be certainly suggested if they're offended and that means

[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:26.980]
that they know what the words that's this silly I mean you know the words and I know the words

[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:31.300]
yeah again you know I could I'm painfully offended by what he said on the radio yesterday

[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:38.700]
right you bet right so also that would give the weatherman a big problem because they couldn't say

[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:45.100]
the temperature is 69 they'd have to say it's between 68 and yeah somewhere between 68 and 70

[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:50.320]
and we have another problem because we also have the number eight which could also be sexually

[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:55.660]
thought of and uh he'd have to say what's between seven degrees and nine degrees which would get rid

[01:38:55.660 --> 01:39:01.840]
of kaya ocho also yeah yeah there's so many different things uh in fact I'm thinking of getting

[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:06.340]
a little bleep tone and putting it on a cart well I figured out a name to rename the FCC

[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.640]
is it something we can say on the year sir absolutely but you it might be patently offensive

[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.100]
to somebody as they could think of it as a sexual undertone so yeah you could call it the Richard

[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:23.700]
Craneum communications company or whatever yeah that's okay you could say Richard Craneum

[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:28.660]
but they don't like you to say the other word right so I just forget I bring those up and let you

[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:34.040]
roll them around in the maybe starper rumor that they're gonna change today okay I'll get off the air

[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.400]
good luck to you and of course we certainly and I mentioned this before I could not refer to

[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:42.780]
a president Nixon as tricky dick anymore because that obviously could be patently offensive and be

[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:50.840]
considered as a sexual innuendo or as suggestive material suggestive of what why don't they just

[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.080]
come out and say look can't talk about sex anymore dr. Ruth has got a lot of money goodbye go spend

[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:00.000]
it have a wonderful life Fred shots hey listen it's been nice but goodbye all of you people we just

[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.940]
don't discuss sex on the air anymore because children might be listening and this is the same

[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:10.560]
government where the Neanderthal right wing surgeon general who's like a guy they a lot of a cage

[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:17.280]
see a word coop even he has said that we have to start dealing honestly with kids about sex and

[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:22.820]
AIDS and all of these things at a very early age even on the end of a Creighton like him has said

[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:29.700]
that and the same administration says in essence don't talk about sex because kids might hear about

[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:36.180]
in the countries where they do they don't do not for example in the middle east they they would run

[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:42.620]
the uncut versions of films rated on rated on movies during during primetime like dirty Harry

[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:46.900]
and the pregnancy rate over there I mean where I go to school I mean I you know you know it's like

[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:51.880]
pretty girl pregnant down in the hallways is something common in every day but over there I have

[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:56.980]
not as far as I know and I know a lot of people where I come from in the middle east they don't

[01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:01.440]
have those kind of problems over there the kids are more open with their parents and all this hiding

[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.200]
of it makes them more curious that's at least what I think women did you say middle east oh he's

[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.160]
going to be earnings yesterday no wonder he came in here I wondered okay we got some celebrity

[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:16.920]
caller standing by Ron Harrison good afternoon good morning good evening how you doing good how are

[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:21.580]
you into the conversation and of course I called you yesterday after you got out the yard I didn't

[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:26.180]
want to call and tinkle on you on the air but that was a great piece of radio yesterday thank you

[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:32.000]
and you stood very tall and it's time for the sports casters and the other people in the median not

[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.320]
just the talk show host to get behind this and do something this is the most frightening chilling

[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:43.980]
thing that I can recall in all my years in broadcasting and you know there's a guy named Jerry

[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:48.320]
Thomas of instance an adi who gives the punchlines to dirty jokes at the end of every hour and he

[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.680]
says if you missed some of the jokes this last hour and he hits punchlines which are absolutely

[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:59.000]
you know antiseptic they don't say anything yeah if you know the choke it's a very dirty choke and

[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.720]
it's very funny with those I also be banned you know you take a look at that thing what they're doing

[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:11.440]
is they're probing and they're trying to exercise mind control and it's beyond belief and I heard

[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:17.820]
Tanner say a little bit earlier how far is this going to go and I heard the the idiot McKinney from

[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:24.900]
the FCC on who just barked the the end of the line that they yeah are starting putting down he

[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:28.760]
said well I don't think we're just going to go out and start but the point is this we've had a

[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.760]
breakdown in the search and seizure laws they are now allowed to do roadblocks all of this has

[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:38.440]
come about under the Reagan administration and while they haven't pushed it to the limit they

[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:44.440]
can and that's the scary thing yeah it's unbelievable it's absolutely frightening and by the way

[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.180]
there's a message Kyle just put on the screen dapy's callers yesterday uh said that they

[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:53.780]
thought it was wonderful hearing me be put in my place by mr McKinney of the SEC that's a

[01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:57.640]
giving idea of where that crowd is coming from you know again these pseudo intellectual snobs

[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.940]
and of course we know that they would never use any of their these words in their day in and day

[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:05.740]
out of fears they ought to hear some of the jokes that he's told me off the year would make them

[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:10.100]
grow new hair on their head you know but again you know be a hypocrite I guess is what it's all about

[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:14.260]
when you're off the year speak one way in the real world operates one way and when we're on the

[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:18.760]
year we're supposed to be in fantasy land I guess well what happens is as I told you you really

[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.600]
what you should have done is set the interview up a little bit and said hey here it is again and

[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.880]
plate it back and you ought to do that some time and let the people hear how they see the man was he

[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:31.280]
had no answers yeah the vagueness the vagueness is what's scary because they can interpret anything

[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:35.700]
and that what they're saying is well the government's going to read your mind and if we can read

[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:42.560]
your mind you're in real trouble and it's a America ought to get up I heard another guy say well

[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:46.860]
if we don't do anything about this then we deserve it we know that's a that's a damn poor attitude

[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:51.400]
if we don't do anything about it then we deserve it enough are we going to do something about

[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.460]
I'm on I'm on board with you tell okay we're going to do something about it you watch right we are

[01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:01.800]
and this is something that has to be done this is really an infringement on free speech okay

[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.000]
and as you say you can't get a little bit pregnant you can't infringe a little bit on

[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.880]
free speech are you there infringing or you're not okay Ron thanks a lot see you Monday

[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:13.700]
another celebrity caller G Michael McCay is standing by Mike how you doing pretty good Neil

[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:18.260]
you're right on with this whole subject absolutely I heard Tanner's call before and I won't try

[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:23.100]
to one up and but rather one also every broadcaster in this town should be on the phone with you

[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:28.000]
today and every broadcaster should be lining up behind you we've all got our asterisk can

[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.940]
it say asterisk sure up until we get the letter yeah right until Monday then you can only say

[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:38.480]
to risk the Reagan regime really is coming in at us hard right now and it's time for all the broadcasters

[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:46.120]
to really get behind you something has to be done and that means everybody needs a rally it can't

[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:50.600]
just be like the 7-11 that you pointed out before everybody rolled everybody rolled over and played

[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:54.480]
dead on that and you know again life isn't going to end because you know you can go to

[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.220]
the records and buy playboy or penthouse or whatever but the bottom line is that every time people

[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:04.560]
do roll over and play dead and allow one more nail to be in a coffin it's just it's it's just

[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.160]
it's a pattern that sooner or later is going to become irreversible absolutely I'd like to

[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:13.700]
be access to the hot 105 morning show as well for whatever gets going and please feel free to call

[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:17.540]
and me to help out I hope every broadcaster including the Rick Shaw's and the Lee Fowlers and

[01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:22.240]
everybody gets behind you too when they start to realize that it's their asterisk as well

[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.120]
excellent we're going to do it this week come Monday and I'll be in touch with everybody and we'll

[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:30.360]
say hopefully the majority of the people get on the bandwagon all right and by the way one question

[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:36.580]
is not happy is a sticky gooey substance that gets dragged between the fingers right exactly

[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:40.860]
legitimate to use or will she have to change her name Monday well her show has been rated up

[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:44.840]
seen on this show on this station for a long time but we'll see what happens Monday all right

[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.620]
see you later oh my may have to send her to turkey to West End Bull buddy McCall

[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:55.840]
Turkish Taffy okay it's 21 past 1 at W.I. and Z and it's great to hear from some people in

[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.220]
the business as Jerry Williams would say and hopefully you know what's going to happen with

[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:03.340]
the people over at Fowler station I mean are they all going to have to roll over and play dead

[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:08.160]
too because pop it right now because pop a Lee says hey it's a great ruling in Jefferson pilot

[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:12.100]
says this I mean if we got a lot of cowards out there we're sure going to fight out about it

[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:18.160]
in the next few days who knows what evil lurks in the stelas of embassies find out Saturday at

[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:23.480]
two when we discuss thigh tech with author Graham Yoast this is Ernie Sochin sees that at

[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:31.820]
eight two it's the great spy in the sky with Ernie Sochin this afternoon the Jewish spies of course

[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:39.280]
it's 25 minutes past one at W.I. and Z at Ernie he's incredible he comes in here with tons of

[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:45.220]
halva and I've never seen anything like it in my life okay where we going next to Miami hello hi

[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:50.240]
well this has been a great program and so glad all the professionals have been calling in

[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:56.480]
when I first heard about this ruling it didn't really sink in and I thought so what if

[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.800]
if the student can't say genitals over the radio or something like that you know there's

[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:08.620]
no really threat to anyone well not only that but more he starts thinking about it they might

[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:13.980]
decide you know that it's a downer for kids to hear about nuclear accidents they might feel that

[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:17.220]
you know like assassination uh...

[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:23.760]
helpless at the CIA has printed up like those are very down depressing things and that children

[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:29.180]
might not need to hear about that I mean this thing could go on and on and and what is

[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:38.720]
odd about it it's totally against Reagan's hands off business policy no regulations towards

[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.660]
business let's see but obviously that's the way it's always been with the with a far right

[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:46.440]
in other words right let big business do anything they want to do in their fear but when it comes

[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:51.600]
to individuals and their private lives and personal choices that's when big brother start stepping

[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:57.120]
in into the bedroom into the radio into the tv set anywhere they can get in and when have you ever

[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:04.580]
heard that sixty nine letters could have made an impact to cause an investigation yeah

[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:08.860]
is not incredible in the fourth largest market in the country in fiddle and alfia which has about

[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:14.780]
five or six million people sixty nine letters and again i'm going to check it out but the rumor is

[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:20.820]
that sixty three of them were unsigned uh... are enough to cause them to have a hearing to take action

[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:27.120]
against the broadcast about this meal with all this uh... ptl or pat roberton with their very

[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:33.620]
sophisticated computer i think they take hold of this thing which which this just sounds like it

[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:40.600]
really uh... extra chromosome republican type thing you know uh... they could get their members

[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:45.600]
to start mailing out thousands of letters oh you bet that's a very good point that i can just see

[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:50.900]
fall well especially now that he's got two empires going at the same time so i i want every listener

[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:58.020]
to think about it cause are not going to do any good and i despise writing letters but i will write

[01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:04.000]
a letter on this i mean right to letters once for me once my house and maybe another one for my

[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.800]
son because i think this happens to be a very very important thing well what i want i'm going to do

[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:16.640]
monday i'm going to we're going to draw petition forms and what i would like to see is broadcasters

[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.580]
all over the country these are going to be you know on radio station letterhead they're just going

[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:26.840]
to be petition forms signed by american citizens all over this country absolutely and they are

[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:34.080]
we are going to petition the fcc to reverse that ruling and to stop infringing upon freedom of speech

[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.540]
and stop interfering in content you know again it's freedom of choice if people want a censor

[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:44.240]
it's an individual basis if you don't want to watch something turn it off if you don't want to listen

[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:47.980]
to something turn it off if you don't want to read something turn it off if you don't want your

[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.820]
children to see or hear it take it away from them or turn it off censorship must be individual

[01:49:52.820 --> 01:50:00.540]
it can't be done by the government exactly and if people really want to get smart besides

[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:07.680]
writing to the fcc and going along with your petitions anyone that sponsors any of their favorite

[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:15.680]
radio or television programs they ought to write them i don't care if it's g-e or whatever because

[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:21.980]
letters count to these people say we we like this program keep sponsoring it

[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:26.360]
yeah and of course the sixty-nine letters caused them to have this hearing and we're able to

[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:30.740]
send them hundreds of thousands or even millions of signatures from all over america and they

[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:34.440]
and they ignore it then how are they going to justify that the churches are going to get

[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:40.440]
right behind this yeah you bet and and they all got your credit they're mailing list yeah okay

[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:45.440]
actually nice talking thanks a lot how many people on the fcc commission i think five isn't

[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:50.840]
five five neither thaws there was a unanimous vote well somebody must have some influence over

[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.320]
there i i mean it could be their life maybe they're uh

[01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:00.520]
yeah one five another five of them so it's basically just five this thing those five people's

[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:05.060]
opinions and that what probably i think this is just my opinion i think it's this whole thing

[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:08.140]
is going to be abused and you're going to have everybody who doesn't like so-and-so we're going

[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:11.540]
to write in about him oh no question about it that they're going to i think they're probably

[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:15.420]
going to let go of it without you doing a petition but that would be a good idea well but this

[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:20.320]
is what i told this guy yesterday uh mcennan i said to him look now you're opening up this

[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:25.340]
pandora's box you had 20,000 letters from a country of 250 million people last year which is

[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:30.980]
really nothing now you're going to have perhaps millions of letters and here as you already know

[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:35.820]
the staff is minimal to nonexistent the Reagan you know budget has eliminated most of the staff

[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:40.300]
from the fcc so they really don't have to wear with all of the manpower to deal with most of these

[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:44.880]
complaints how in hell are they egg going to continue monitoring the signals and do the things they

[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:49.640]
ought to be doing at a technical standpoint and be be able to get into the legal ease of handling every

[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:55.000]
single complaint can you imagine the number of logger tapes i mean they're going to have tape

[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.500]
warm at the fcc by the time they get through with the tapes they're going to be tapes of every damn

[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:03.400]
show that's ever been invented and some that haven't even gotten on the air yet by the time they

[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:06.680]
get through with this and how are they going to find and you know what this reminds me of it's

[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:12.120]
like the judges who watch the pornography tapes oh do they have a good time managers they come

[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:18.060]
at wonderful they lock themselves in and when they come out it's unbelievable after they come out

[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:21.880]
about five days in seclusion it's uh...

[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:24.080]
is ready to pass out

[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:28.460]
all those old parts of the man getting their last gas

[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:35.220]
well it's just unbelievable this is going to be the same thing we're going to have a bunch of old

[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:40.720]
senile parts in washington listening to tapes of howard stir and saying dickhead and uh...

[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:44.500]
neorodger saying douchebag whatever else it is they're listening to and they're going to be sitting in

[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:48.640]
it's just going to be like confession in the catholic church man tapes going to be playing on one

[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.500]
side and they're going to be on the other side

[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:59.000]
kindle hello hello yes sir the morning i'd be suggesting one idea they might try i mean uh...

[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.040]
if you use power broadcasting so the kind of large network with a lot of people that call

[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:06.040]
from all over the nation not just broadcast but people who just

[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:08.840]
are out there listening and watching television that have their

[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:13.580]
opinions on racially i mean i'm not sure if you're paying them what they think could be done

[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:18.080]
about pension broadcasting what should what should be done there for the people talk well

[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.000]
because i don't uh... i don't think you should let us know that we're working on

[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.960]
the real reason for everything to be said

[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:29.340]
okay sir well listen we're going to try to interpret that and uh... we'll see if it

[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:33.260]
needs to be censored not i'm sure that the intention was good but i uh... uh...

[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:36.780]
no comprande candle hello this may that's you

[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:41.120]
me all of the listening to you for three years and this is the first time i've crawled

[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.940]
i'm a sports nut and when i'm really desperate nothing on you know when he is

[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:49.660]
t-in is running reruns of the national figure skating championships

[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:54.500]
i will put on tbs and watch the Atlanta braids baseball game right

[01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:59.680]
and those announcers i guess they should be endorsed by the insomniac of america

[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:04.180]
can really put you to sleep and i think that you will apply for the job

[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.420]
of baseball announcer for the uh... tbs network except i have a warning for you

[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:11.600]
because i've heard you on the hurricane games before

[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:15.040]
and and more often than not i've heard you referred to

[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:17.080]
to nine strikes as balls

[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:19.040]
all you can't say that anymore

[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]
especially if the count is two and oh

[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.760]
exactly all boy are you in trouble and about pop up pop up the high-flies

[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:29.920]
just leave appealing to the purine instincts that you

[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:33.540]
period baseball yeah well i'm glad you know as much as i enjoyed doing a

[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:36.840]
hurricane's game in a way i'm relieved i last night was the last telecast as i

[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.040]
can't say the catchers name anymore after i get the letter

[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:40.640]
all that's right

[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.280]
done the

[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.900]
i guess we'll have to change his name to decency or something

[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:48.580]
you have to take the lot off something like that

[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:52.160]
also i've heard i've heard i think on one occasion

[01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:56.040]
i heard you referred to a double is a two-bagger and i almost

[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:01.300]
i know what you would try to say

[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:05.040]
and it didn't i heard you say one of the thing and i don't understand the

[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.720]
in your end i'm not well that's a bit indicated

[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:09.720]
but you were talking about a split-fingered pitch

[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:14.720]
and to me it just smacked the vets and i mean i wasn't sure exactly what that

[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.540]
is but maybe you can explain that to me now no two graphics here would probably

[01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:21.340]
be patently offensive to many of our century village

[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:24.840]
list news if i think that mike scott is going to have to eliminate that

[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:27.240]
pitch from his reputory after monday yeah

[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:29.240]
that it comes out because love is going to be able to say it

[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.000]
it leaves it open to too much connotation

[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.640]
you know one of the advertising agencies in town ran a commercial or put

[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:38.120]
together a commercial in which they say

[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:43.240]
bullspit and uh... we played at once i think and our our people pulled it off

[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:46.160]
the air which you know i can debate one way together i don't really care

[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.740]
but several of the stations in the market have played and continue to play it

[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:53.320]
now again even though it isn't one of the words per se

[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:59.480]
certainly the innuendo is there it's close enough yeah so you know again it

[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:03.120]
gets down to commercials it gets down to comedy it gets into sports it gets

[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.740]
into every single aspect of anything that can be on radio or tv

[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.000]
well i just i just want to alert you to that because if you if you'll be doing

[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.740]
the hurricane games again next year and i hope you will be you will have to

[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:17.740]
those games that you will uh... come up with a new set of uh...

[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:21.220]
of words to describe what's going on in the field okay maybe we'll just give

[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:23.660]
hand signals very good okay thanks a lot

[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:27.880]
if their mind isn't in the gutter they won't pick up on those things now you

[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.860]
want to call it gutter whatever you want to call it but

[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.660]
it's basically what they're thinking of and they're just picking up on it

[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:36.960]
well you see again another part of the problem is that they don't understand the

[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:41.660]
contemporary usage of a lot of these words for example when i was on at night two

[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:45.040]
three years ago i started calling couple of the colors subhuman douchebags and i

[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:48.400]
didn't use the expression a lot but there were some people were just so obnoxious

[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:52.460]
and i thought it's fit perfectly and i understand the way the word is used in

[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:56.640]
contemporary usage especially in new york and it has nothing to do with women

[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.220]
and it has nothing to do with the instrument itself it's just the way of saying

[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:05.260]
somebody's a nerd a jerk and now in the daytime that we have such a so much

[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:08.300]
broader of an audience i guess that was the wrong word broad surely get all of

[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:14.100]
said uh... much wider audience wider also we get surely upset a much more

[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:17.940]
numerous audience uh... the fact is that there are people listening who never

[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:20.500]
heard it before and all of a sudden what was something that was perfectly

[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.460]
acceptable and we got no response to before now we got a whole bunch of little

[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:27.700]
ladies getting hysterical because we use that word on the year and that's

[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:31.300]
exactly what happens even with how it's turned we call somebody a real dick for

[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:35.140]
example in the york that just means a jerk it has nothing to do with any part of

[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:41.720]
the anatomy just means a jerk like james mckinney for example that's what i

[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:45.320]
should have told him yes that she said you know you're a real uh... although i

[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:48.720]
did say dick at a couple of times and he never batted an eyelash she really didn't

[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:51.940]
although i did hear a little tinkling on his leg there i'm not sure what it was

[01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:56.900]
twenty four before two at w i n z we're going to take a little break here and when we

[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:58.600]
come back we'll continue
