[00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.060]
But hey, good luck to you.

[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.360]
You have a very good vacation and don't let birds feel your show.

[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.500]
Thank you, sir. I reordered you.

[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.520]
Okay, and don't let birds feel your show.

[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.600]
Thank you, sir. I reordered you.

[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.860]
Okay, the masked marauder from Kendall. Hello.

[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.720]
Good morning.

[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.920]
Oh, wait a minute. Before we talk to the masked marauder,

[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.540]
you're never going to believe this is a true story.

[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.040]
I think I have the same one.

[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.060]
No, you don't.

[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.560]
I could. Is it about Steve's okay?

[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.020]
No.

[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.720]
Okay.

[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.020]
Yes.

[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.960]
Will you just control yourself for a moment, please?

[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.600]
Oh, is that the one about the restaurant?

[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.160]
Yes.

[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.160]
Oh, that's a great story.

[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.740]
Hold on a minute.

[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.240]
I was in Windixi.

[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.260]
My favorite Windixi yesterday briefly just to get a few items

[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.280]
and I'm, I had to get some bananas, okay?

[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.320]
And I'm, why do you look at me?

[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.460]
What are you going to do to those bananas?

[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.080]
Anyway, I had to get some fruit.

[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.840]
No, that's not any better.

[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.380]
Anyway, I had to get a couple items and I walk into the produce section

[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.400]
and you'll never guess who was there in a million years.

[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.900]
What couple was there?

[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.380]
Half of you McCallum and John Broward.

[00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.740]
Worse.

[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.700]
Not the callers.

[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.420]
Worse.

[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.380]
Oh, God.

[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.740]
The least valorant owl.

[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.420]
Jamie and Marcy.

[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.640]
Jamie and Marcy and Windixi.

[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.460]
I don't think they even have a living plan, please.

[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.400]
They live in Hellendale.

[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.480]
So everybody now is flocking to my Windixi.

[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.100]
I can't believe it.

[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.720]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.620]
What were you doing?

[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.780]
That was worth waiting for.

[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.600]
By the way, where are those numbers?

[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.420]
Well, there is.

[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.900]
I don't know why they say they're still new and I have no idea.

[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.460]
What do you mean they're in there?

[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.980]
Well, we don't want to get there in there, but they...

[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.800]
I don't know why you can't get them till noon.

[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.780]
Do you have any predictions?

[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.740]
Wait a minute.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.920]
Let's put it this way.

[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.480]
I don't want to get your hopes up too high.

[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.760]
No.

[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.320]
But I noticed that both of you are kind of calm

[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.820]
and not mentioning about that tonight because it's a big day for everybody, isn't it?

[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.360]
It is.

[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.100]
Well, it's not that big for us because they're not expecting all that much yet.

[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.120]
How much are they expecting?

[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.340]
And I'll tell you, higher or lower.

[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.820]
Oh, looking somewhere in the twos.

[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.460]
Well, hopefully it would be in the twos.

[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.840]
Yeah, I think I don't think...

[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.820]
What do you mean hopefully it would be in the twos?

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.640]
We had a one-night last time and we inherited that August that was dreads got to be above a two.

[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.000]
Yeah, as far as I see it's at least doubled.

[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.480]
It's at least doubled?

[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.540]
Oh, that'd be great.

[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.580]
See, that whole thing is last time I saw something like that last month

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.060]
and like there was something totally different.

[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.480]
I don't know, I don't know exactly.

[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.840]
If you give me the instructions, I'll just have some instructions over there.

[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.780]
No, I can't go back to the computer and give you the instructions.

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.380]
Mark, you don't have an nervous breakdown.

[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.900]
Well, because I just don't know how to use this thing to its fullest potential.

[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.720]
Well, listen, you've got a lot of things you don't know how to use that are fullest potential, you know?

[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.320]
And hopefully you won't be the one to show.

[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.900]
You can bet your life I won't.

[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.360]
Trust me.

[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.520]
Okay, now, I have some material for you today.

[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.380]
Oh, I hear that one of the board ops from WSNEWS, my scientist.

[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.640]
Oh, none of the trust me.

[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.160]
Okay.

[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.560]
That's for our girlfriend, EVET.

[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.340]
Okay.

[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.760]
Yeah.

[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.880]
Okay, now I have some material for you.

[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.480]
I remember to tell you about the one about Steve Cain.

[00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.920]
Yes.

[00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.440]
The restaurant.

[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.580]
Did you already tell that to the board?

[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.800]
No, I haven't told that yet.

[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.500]
Okay.

[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.140]
Are you going to tell her or just threaten to tell her?

[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.900]
I'll tell it to you.

[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.260]
Anyways, I'm not sure what the name of the restaurant was, but our good friend Steve Cain went to a restaurant.

[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.320]
And he ran up $130 bills.

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.340]
That's the same amount you had?

[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.980]
Yes, it was.

[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.520]
Okay.

[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.860]
I know who you heard this from, too.

[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.320]
And at the end, he wanted, obviously, the leech one.

[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.720]
I told the waitress, I'm Steve Cain.

[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.520]
The guy who talks about rest, the hunt on W, you tell her, the she said so.

[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.380]
So he said, you know, call over your manager.

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.880]
He told the same thing to the manager.

[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.060]
She said so.

[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.200]
And then he left paying the $130 bills to lift the waitress.

[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.640]
Yeah.

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.240]
He was very upset that he had a pay.

[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.580]
In other words, the point is he was looking for a freebie.

[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.120]
And he didn't get it.

[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.580]
So then he left no tip on a $130 check.

[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.380]
How do you like that?

[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.020]
What a guy.

[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.560]
Yeah.

[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.600]
All hard.

[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.880]
Now, I have a treat for you today.

[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.060]
Just don't know where to begin.

[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.080]
Okay.

[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.600]
I just was a joke.

[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.920]
I was at some place and I called up 800 information.

[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.360]
And like, you know how you, when you call these people, you have to tell me you're on the air.

[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.800]
Yep.

[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.180]
And I told him I was jacked from Miami Beach on Zeta.

[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.060]
And we wanted to know why our 800 number wasn't list.

[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.740]
Anyways, that could be real funny, but I know if you wanted to do that.

[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.560]
And they were patching me into the supervisor and she says, oh, I don't want to be on Zeta.

[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.800]
She doesn't like you and all that other kind of stuff.

[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.480]
Oh.

[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.100]
She doesn't like whom he?

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.360]
Yeah, but the supervisor.

[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.960]
Well, let her drop dead, okay?

[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.280]
Okay.

[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.280]
Now, let her stick her where the moan don't shine.

[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.780]
You know you're a good friend of my clients, right?

[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.000]
Mm-hmm.

[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.380]
He wrote you a jingle and I have it on tape.

[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.580]
Okay.

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.840]
But now he says that he's, I have to call him up and see if you want to sing it live or should I play that to you on tape?

[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.860]
Now, play the tape.

[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.460]
Okay.

[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.080]
You shouldn't go.

[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.340]
You ready?

[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.840]
Yeah.

[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.040]
I hope it's more exciting than this call so far.

[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.780]
Well, I have the mother stuff I can't play.

[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.600]
Ah, I can play by Glenn Haraping Barbie.

[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.080]
I have not.

[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.740]
Yes, he is.

[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.200]
She called me up and played with you.

[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.480]
He left 50 trolling messages on her machine.

[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.900]
Well, that's not harassing her if I leave messages on her machine.

[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.300]
Oh, boy.

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.820]
Now, he wanted to know when I come over and all that kind of stuff.

[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.120]
Yeah.

[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.260]
Well, you're the one that instigated it.

[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.920]
I think it's wonderful.

[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.040]
More power to help you.

[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.640]
Yeah.

[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.860]
Okay.

[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.560]
You ready?

[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.020]
Yeah, obviously.

[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.020]

[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.400]
We're ready.

[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.980]
Here you go.

[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.100]
Sounds good so far.

[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.440]
Hold on.

[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.640]
Here it is.

[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.420]
Two, three.

[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.380]
18 to eight.

[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.880]
Oh, how I love you.

[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.880]
In the morning.

[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.160]
You're watching on Maradio.

[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.580]
I'll give you an excuse with all of my rights.

[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.620]
You're watching on Maradio.

[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.300]
Your maintain comes to the answer to every little sweet thing that won't be true.

[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.540]
It's male on 949, the largest on Maradio.

[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.740]
The music, key, Miami Beach, Miami.

[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.360]
Where's J-Michael's when you need it?

[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.800]
That's right.

[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.580]
I'm going to get J-Michael's boom box so they can make sweet music together, okay?

[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.800]
Okay.

[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.780]
Some media instructions.

[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.780]
You have my address.

[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.300]
Okay.

[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.000]
Okay.

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.160]
Have a wonderful life, sir.

[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.180]
The SEC is cracking.

[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.220]
J-Dome.

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.940]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.500]
J-Dome.

[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.620]
J-Dome.

[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.180]
Like my choice of now.

[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.060]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.540]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.100]
J-Dome.

[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.040]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.980]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.020]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.120]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.480]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.980]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.340]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.240]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.240]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.400]

[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.640]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.140]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.100]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.140]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.920]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.680]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.260]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.900]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.260]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.260]

[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.360]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.360]

[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.120]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.380]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.600]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.960]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.320]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.160]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.260]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.980]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.020]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.820]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.060]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.060]

[00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.060]

[00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.060]

[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.740]
You shut my mouth, but I don't care.

[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.000]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.560]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.660]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.020]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.920]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.960]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.100]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.040]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.760]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.020]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.080]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.880]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.240]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.240]

[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.320]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.680]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.120]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.120]

[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.640]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.040]
I'm a J-Dome.

[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.580]
Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster.

[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.800]
It's 744 on Zeta 4.

[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.980]
You have the feeling we lost control of the show last couple of calls.

[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.360]
Is that just my imagination?

[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.440]
Everything is out of control.

[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.640]
Excellent.

[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.220]
That's wonderful.

[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.180]
Okay, and the phones are flashing like crazy.

[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.020]
And those numbers are going to be out later in the day.

[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.320]
Now, what was he talking about?

[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.940]
Like we're supposed to have an apoplectic fit about it on the air?

[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.680]
About what?

[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.640]
About those numbers.

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.100]
I mean, what can we do at this point?

[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.240]
Numbers.

[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.800]
Numbers are numbers.

[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.640]
It's all over.

[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.140]
And his prediction is that they will double.

[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.540]
Wrong.

[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.240]
There's just no chance.

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:04.700]
All right.

[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.600]
If they do, that would be very nice.

[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.560]
But I don't do that.

[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.920]
I think those would be a little high expectations.

[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.720]
Always remember, the set your sights low.

[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.360]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.160]
And anything that happens above that is a bonus.

[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:16.680]
It's a bonus.

[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.160]
That's what Mark Cune has always said.

[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.940]
He sets his sights real low over on the AM.

[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.580]
And I think for this particular rating period,

[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.420]
he probably made the right decision.

[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.920]
You know what I mean?

[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.100]
Like fractions.

[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.460]
That's where he set his sights.

[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.400]
And that morning news.

[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.880]
Now, have we still not heard?

[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.700]
It's a 746 on a Monday morning on Zeta 4.

[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.720]
We have yet to hear.

[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.540]
We've been asking for days from anyone who has ever, I mean,

[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.080]
even by accident, heard just moments of the morning news with Mike and Arlene on WINZ AM.

[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.440]
And we still haven't heard a peep.

[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.740]
Why do you think that is?

[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.800]
I don't know, but there's a problem there.

[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.200]
We don't know for sure what it is.

[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.620]
But now, as I said, we could be wrong.

[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.380]
It could be that they're all very loyal.

[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:07.980]
Sure.

[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.420]
Wins listeners, and they're not turning over to right.

[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.160]
So they're not here.

[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.680]
That's correct, that's a possibility.

[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.320]
It's a logical thing.

[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.980]
Very unlikely.

[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.880]
Very unlikely.

[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.040]
In other words, somebody.

[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.100]
Somebody who was, I mean, they started 530.

[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.940]
Well, now we got a call from Richard Vega.

[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.140]
Now he's heard the show.

[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.940]
Yeah, and you heard what he said about it.

[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.020]
Everybody listens to this show.

[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.420]
Cross section of humanity.

[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.240]
To what show?

[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.500]
Teenagers to old folk.

[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.860]
Listen to this show.

[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.280]
Lawyers, junkies.

[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.740]
Everybody listens.

[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.980]
Yeah, you know about the junk.

[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.720]
Okay, we have an open line today.

[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.160]
Somebody just to drop it off there.

[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.140]
And I can't say that I blame them 620 3600.

[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.960]
620 3600.

[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.920]
After the news, by the way, we're going to hear John, what's his name?

[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.140]
Jonathan King.

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.140]
Yeah, John Broward.

[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:53.660]
John King.

[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.520]
Jonathan King and he's so fine again, because I just got to get that back on.

[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:57.800]
Okay.

[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.760]
And we're also going to hear a bad finger.

[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:00.480]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.700]
You found it?

[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.380]
Isn't it a miracle that we have that in our library?

[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.000]
Oh, I watched the Godfather over the weekend.

[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:08.520]
What did you?

[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.280]
How did you like it?

[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.520]
That reminded me when you said library, because that's one of the lines in the movie that James

[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.180]
Khan says.

[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:14.500]
Yeah.

[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.320]
I tell you, part one is incredible.

[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.620]
Yeah, part two.

[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.620]
It's great.

[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.220]
Yeah, but it's not a big part.

[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.500]
Part one is the definitive movie.

[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.380]
It will.

[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.000]
It's Cosmolar and Brando's and it will have cotton stuffed in his tube.

[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.540]
Somebody stuffed a 50 pound water cotton in your tube.

[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.860]
It's part like you're a constipated tube.

[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.840]
It's the Joseph Goodness.

[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.800]
The opening scene is when he's sitting behind the desk playing with the cat.

[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.500]
Wonderful.

[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.840]
I watched part one Saturday and part two Sunday and wonderful weekend.

[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.120]
Yeah, the one Sunday at the media house for a cup of coffee.

[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.820]
But you were afraid that the city would win.

[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.540]
Movie making at its best.

[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.440]
That my friend, Godfather, he's my ring.

[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.580]
That interesting.

[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.120]
I like the Godfather and the Pope have that in common.

[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.020]
They both want everybody to kiss their ring.

[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.360]
The other coincidence.

[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.320]
Do you think?

[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.540]
I was going to say they're both from Italy, but this Pope is from Poland.

[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.220]
That's your hit.

[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.620]
But lives in Italy.

[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.000]
Do you think he's connected?

[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:46.640]
Anyway, if you can catch it on HBO, part one is a must.

[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.480]
Part two is nice.

[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.780]
Fascinating, but part one is the definitive.

[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.040]
But you got to admit that part two is the best sequel of a movie that was ever made.

[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.740]
Usually part two is a really inferior to the original.

[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.980]
Part two is fascinating.

[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.400]
Was it as good as the Silicon?

[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.000]
Part of a head of an Italian movie set in Silicon Valley in California.

[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.640]
That's strange, isn't it?

[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.120]
Oh my goodness.

[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.240]
Okay, let's take another call.

[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.960]
I will do the news.

[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.040]
And then we've got all kinds of stuff to do here today.

[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.380]
We have an open line in Dave County, which seems to be part of the course this morning.

[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.100]
How come we don't hear from more of our Latin listeners?

[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.520]
I have no idea.

[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.480]
Do you think that Zeta 4 has a big Latin audience?

[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.060]
I don't know.

[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.480]
I don't know.

[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.600]
I just asking for an opinion.

[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.240]
I don't know.

[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.620]
I really can't say.

[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.920]
There isn't any particular reason why we should, is there?

[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.380]
No, there isn't.

[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.380]
In other words, no key out of this question.

[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.260]
No, no, no.

[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.040]
Unlikely.

[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.900]
It's incredibly.

[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:51.480]
It would be incredibly if we did, because we just don't play any music that relates to the Hispanic audience.

[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.060]
It's just like we don't play any music that relates to the Black audience.

[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.620]
What is it?

[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.380]
We want this like wasp audience.

[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.340]
We want all glam too, is that it?

[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.060]
Do we want any Jews just a couple?

[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.280]
Just a few to round it out a little bit?

[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.000]
That's right.

[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.680]
That's right.

[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.460]
We got the soul patrol.

[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.980]
We could have like the Latin quarters.

[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.460]
Yeah, and the kosher corner.

[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:10.960]
Broward County.

[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.320]
Hello.

[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.300]
Hey, same to you.

[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.640]
Happy Chanukah.

[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.120]
Hey, I'd like to commend you on what you're doing for the Camila's house.

[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.220]
I think it's really great.

[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.400]
Yeah, and the mail really picked up today.

[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.420]
I was very happy about that.

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.280]
Yeah, it shows you a really good person behind that cynical exterior.

[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.140]
You got it.

[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:27.680]
That's right.

[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.760]
Well put.

[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.280]
Way deep down inside somewhere, there's something good.

[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.040]
Yeah, even though you try to hide it.

[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.340]
Nobody's founded yet, but when they do, boy, it'll be great.

[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.240]
I was wondering if you had that Christmas song by the McKenzie Brothers.

[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.860]
The one that goes through the Christmas where it gets a beer?

[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.900]
That may be around here somewhere.

[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.680]
Yeah, we'll have to do it, try to dig it up.

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.180]
Not sure.

[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.540]
Great.

[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:48.360]
Yeah.

[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.360]
I like that song.

[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:49.780]
Good.

[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.760]
And listen, I wanted to ask you to quit picking on people from the silly,

[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.880]
just because Joey Reynolds is from there, doesn't mean we're all bad.

[00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.520]
Okay.

[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.780]
Well, listen, there probably one or two good apples in that bunch.

[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.780]
Yeah, it's got a lot of history.

[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.760]
Two hundred years ago, there was a lot going on up there,

[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.900]
and down here was only swamp land.

[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.380]
That's right.

[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.560]
And some of the garbage from two hundred years ago is still lying on the streets there.

[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.180]
It's incredible.

[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:14.760]
Yeah.

[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.620]
And all the Indians are lying under the glades.

[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.800]
Yeah, like I said, Wilson Good had the right idea.

[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.000]
He just stopped too soon.

[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.300]
This Wilson Good.

[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.920]
He'd be the mayor of Philadelphia.

[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.820]
Yeah, right now, well, I haven't been there in about 12 years.

[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.400]
Well, that's good.

[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.660]
Believe me, you don't want to go back.

[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.660]
Okay, just savor those great memories.

[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.340]
Okay.

[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.280]
So, boobs are nice.

[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:33.720]
Right.

[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.180]
Like way out, like Pittsburgh.

[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.100]
Yeah.

[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.300]
And have a food.

[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.240]
And get these burgs.

[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:39.560]
Yeah.

[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.880]
And Utica.

[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.000]
Okay, listen, have a wonderful day, but the news be coming up next.

[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.520]
You know what I mean?

[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.340]
Have a good holiday.

[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:46.880]
You too.

[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:47.880]
Bye, boy.

[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.720]
7.51 at Zeta 4.

[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.400]
Frank Sinatra is playing Santa.

[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.960]
7.56 on Zeta 4.

[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:58.980]
And also remind me, Captain Dave, we have to talk about that picture taking session that was scheduled for tomorrow.

[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.020]
Oh, yeah, we're not going to do that.

[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.300]
No, we're going to take a car wash, man.

[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.640]
Yeah, it is the car wash man.

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.500]
How you doing?

[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.560]
He's doing great.

[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.500]
Anyway, wash my car.

[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.500]
The wind's going to be paintless.

[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.200]
No, that's true.

[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.580]
They don't want to wash mine either because it's too dirty.

[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.080]
Anyway, getting back to where I was only moments ago.

[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:16.620]
Sorry.

[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.420]
What was I saying?

[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.220]
Oh, yeah, something about that picture taking session.

[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.660]
Also, you notice when the news comes on, like we had all the lines lit up.

[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.460]
Look at that phone now.

[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.060]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.000]
Like everybody just disappears.

[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.520]
Think a few had to go to work.

[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.520]
A few of them probably had to go to school or work, which is a pretty damn lame excuse as far as I'm concerned.

[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.980]
Anyway, 620, 3600 and Dave and 7779, 3600 and Broward.

[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.180]
This is the sparsest this phone has ever been since we sat down here.

[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.600]
I can't, they're like two calls on at Bordnock.

[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.360]
I can't believe it.

[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.820]
Is that incredible or what?

[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.880]
And, huh?

[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.680]
Well, yeah, another starting up again.

[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.740]
But, you know, we may have to play something here, like music.

[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.640]
And that sends a boy like crazy what do you know?

[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.600]
All you would be rip off artists.

[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.740]
And that's the end of only living away.

[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.520]
This is just a metal time I see you.

[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.660]
Jesus, don't spoke to God.

[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.040]
What is my life?

[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.080]
You're often seen happy as time.

[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.840]
It makes me want something to find.

[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.060]
You should even give him the drive.

[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.180]
But then again, you can't shine.

[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.440]
You can't shine, wait forever.

[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.620]
And I'm gonna make him mine.

[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.680]
If it takes me forever and ever and ever.

[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.860]
He's so fine, Georgia.

[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.120]
He's gotta think of mine, Georgia.

[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.960]
Sooner or later, Georgia.

[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.960]
I hope it's not for later.

[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.640]
We got together.

[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.220]
Georgia.

[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.120]
The sun and the moon.

[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.260]
Georgia.

[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.720]
I do get wait.

[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.880]
I do get wait.

[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.280]
To be held in his arms.

[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.220]
See a court.

[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.780]
If I were a court.

[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.920]
And he has to leave my place.

[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.260]
I do anything that he has.

[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.760]
And it's a thing to make him tall.

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.600]
For he's so fine, so fine.

[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.400]
So fine, so fine.

[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.220]
So fine, so fine.

[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.020]
So fine, so fine.

[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.340]
So fine, so fine.

[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:47.780]
So fine, so fine.

[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.740]
Jonathan King, that's number two already with six bullets and rising rapidly to the top.

[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.520]
Can you believe that by ten o'clock this morning?

[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.800]
Is there any doubt that that'll be the number one hit on Zeta 4?

[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.340]
It's eight o'clock here on a Monday morning.

[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.180]
It's time for the ID captain, Meng.

[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.020]
You smell that?

[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.240]
I love the smell of Neil Rogers cold in the morning.

[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.780]
It's a smell of an arbitrage victory.

[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:28.100]
This is WZTA, Miami Beach, or Vlada del, or bomb beaches.

[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.580]
Sorry, command of Neil Rogers.

[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.160]
And his attache, Glenn, and Burger Hill.

[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.720]
And your sportsman will turn internal Dave.

[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.040]
Boy, that exciting or what?

[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.440]
I thought that was appropriate for today.

[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.300]
Why is that?

[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.440]
You know, victory.

[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.440]
I don't want you, you know, everybody here is acting like we're going to have an 18 share or something

[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.820]
when he's never, first of all, it's only two thirds of a rating period, number one.

[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.220]
And secondly, you know, we have a lot of work to do here yet.

[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.340]
We started at ground zero.

[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.700]
Everybody is impatient.

[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.000]
Yeah, have you noticed?

[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.020]
This is a whole different ball game, okay?

[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.420]
Yeah, I know that.

[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.440]
And we want your best when things are not running smoothly.

[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.120]
Oh, well, then we have to do great.

[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.140]
Really great, because based on the first few weeks here, especially the last couple of weeks,

[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.420]
man, talk about running smoothly.

[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.400]
Now, wow, I have something to read to you.

[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.520]
Are you sitting down?

[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:25.920]
Yes.

[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.620]
Do I look like I'm sitting down?

[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.500]
Do I look like I shrunk a few inches over the weekend?

[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.360]
Radio highlights for today out of the Miami Herald.

[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.040]
Do they be good?

[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:41.660]
Steve Cain, 2PMWIOD, representative James Burke, and John Broward.

[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.340]
Oh, the Scuss.

[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.300]
Jesse Jackson.

[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.200]
Oh, the Scuss, Jesse Jackson again.

[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.780]
What is there to discuss?

[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.120]
This is the second show he's done this Scuss and Jesse Jackson.

[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.320]
I'm saying there would be one thing if he had Jesse on the show.

[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.760]
That would be bad enough, but the Scussing, Jesse Jackson again.

[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.640]
This man is so desperate for a show.

[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.840]
You know, we owe somebody an apology.

[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:05.820]
You know who it is?

[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:06.980]
Wait a minute.

[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.640]
Like I said, you owe somebody an apology.

[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.800]
You know who it is?

[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.820]
Stan Major.

[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.060]
He's talking about Stan Major.

[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.140]
Because all these, you know, all this crap about how he needs to get a show, okay?

[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.800]
And there's certainly an element of truth in that because he keeps ripping me off and just talking about me.

[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.740]
And if it isn't Miami Vice or Don Johnson, it's Near Rogers, but...

[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.640]
But.

[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.320]
Yeah.

[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.460]
Everything's relative.

[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.500]
Exactly. And at least Stan is listenable and you have some fun with him.

[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:45.900]
I mean, the guy isn't doing the same old, tired, hackneyed crap that he's been doing for years like some other people in this market that we know and love, right?

[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.420]
One of whom you just mentioned.

[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.180]
You know, I'm so sorry last week that I missed the 850th show.

[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.100]
And who was it that he had all last week that killed me at an appleplex?

[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.660]
It's every week, I don't know.

[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.480]
Oh yeah, he had Jack Lieberman on again for the five billionth time.

[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.800]
And that's just this year.

[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.160]
And the year's not over yet.

[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.260]
I wonder what day he's having Michael Desisto on this week.

[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.040]
I'm looking forward to the wrestling show.

[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.000]
Oh, sure.

[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:12.960]
This man.

[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.240]
And they're actually paying this guy.

[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:21.320]
Now here comes another guy who is that Gary Lawrence in his $75,000 BMW at 804.

[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.780]
What the hell is he doing here at this hour the morning?

[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.620]
Let's hear it for Gary, boy.

[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.000]
He really puts in those hours.

[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.320]
Doesn't he'll be gone by three?

[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.600]
He really he puts it his time, man.

[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.660]
And by the time he finishes with his place, he ought to be putting in time.

[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:37.840]
Just in joke, Gary.

[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.740]
It's just a joke.

[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.480]
And who is somebody other these other original people like Alice Rantell,

[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.700]
who was doing that thing with the attorney Richard Essen?

[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:55.580]
Today, Alice's guest is Steve Sonsky, my old TV critic.

[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.180]
And I think back to when I was on at night,

[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:04.460]
in the early days of the daytime, although thank God very quickly I woke up and smelled the flowers and the pansies.

[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.140]
But you know, you come up with Tom,

[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.320]
and I'm not saying these are bad people, but I'm just saying the repetition.

[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.980]
Tom Jicca and the nutritionist.

[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.000]
And then there's Mike Spindell with a veterinarian.

[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.520]
I mean, if he has Jan Bellows on again, one more time, this decade.

[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.380]
Next week.

[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.000]
Oh, no, are you serious?

[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.400]
Oh, no.

[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:32.960]
Overrant, overrant, over the same tried and true boring terminal repetitive guests.

[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.620]
You know, you're right, of course, what you say, you're absolutely right.

[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.040]
But it bothers me.

[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:37.240]
And it bothers me.

[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:45.320]
And Bob Kunst and Ellis Rubin and these Janet Reno and the same monotonous boring Ed Cohen.

[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.880]
My good dear personal friend.

[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.420]
Yeah, right.

[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.880]
Remember who, uh, it's whenever we, you notice, I want to, this is an interesting point.

[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.240]
I'm about, excuse me for interrupting, but I'm worked up to an apoplectic frenzy at this point.

[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.380]
Do you notice how all of a sudden when things change and people know that they're not going to be on your show anymore?

[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.080]
That some of your good friends start turning a little bit.

[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:06.520]
No.

[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.440]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:14.940]
Like on AM when I cut out the guests, all of a sudden my good close personal friend Ed Cohen starts writing hostile things in the,

[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.880]
in such a prestigious journal as the West Kendall, Ben Zet, about the near Rogers show.

[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.840]
What a waste.

[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:29.440]
What, you know, it's such a waste that I'm entertaining people instead of bringing a boring washed out old man on the, like him to put the audience into a coma, right?

[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.220]
And the same over here now that we're not in all of a sudden Tom Jicca.

[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.340]
Oh, I don't get up at six in the morning.

[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.920]
Listen to him.

[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.020]
No, because Tom is too busy listening to Mike Reneerie pick his nose and I OD, okay?

[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.420]
Why did you, as soon as I said that, you started wiping your nose.

[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.020]
Coincidence.

[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.580]
But what, and you notice the pattern, how the, the turn on you, these people?

[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.260]
Yeah, you know, everything you say, all they want to do is use you.

[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.300]
They're all horrors.

[00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:00.500]
Don't you want to understand all of these people are horrors, all these talk show guests, horrors.

[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.360]
And you, and you, you, you nurture them and you develop them and you bring them on and you make them into again.

[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.800]
All of a sudden they're like on every damn show in town, everywhere, like the plague.

[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.440]
Can I get this one more time?

[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.240]
What are they again?

[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.740]
I don't, horrors.

[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.140]
Oh, we got two mobile calls.

[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.320]
Mobile.

[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.240]
Hello.

[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:22.780]
Hello.

[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:23.380]
Hello.

[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:23.480]

[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.760]
Yeah, I just kneel.

[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.100]
Yeah, well, I heard you before you said that you didn't have any Latin, you know, listen.

[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.000]
Well, I didn't say we'd have any, but I was just curious if we have many.

[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.280]
Well, I want to give you a play, a meringue gate for me on here.

[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.860]
Johnny Ventura.

[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.400]
He's a very popular meringue gate player.

[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.060]
And I, you know, we want to get the Latin market.

[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.520]
No, not that bad.

[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.500]
At that bad?

[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:52.920]
No.

[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:58.000]
Well, someone turned me on to you and they said you would do it.

[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.800]
They said I would do what?

[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.500]
I might do it, but not that.

[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.740]
You're a funny man, you know.

[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.140]
I know.

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.560]
Oh, God.

[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.780]
You love the show, don't you?

[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.820]
I really do.

[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:09.920]
I really do.

[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.300]
And how about your other Hispanic friends, my friend?

[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.860]
Oh, when they out of jail, they listen to it.

[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.640]
In jail, they cannot listen to it.

[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.060]
I know it doesn't penetrate those prison walls, does it?

[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.060]
Oh, it doesn't get up to Atlanta.

[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.060]
We've been trying.

[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.100]
Atlanta.

[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.620]
You got to check on Atlanta.

[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.440]
Another radio shack on Tennis, the big ones.

[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.240]
Yeah, I sure do.

[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.740]
Yeah, but we couldn't, we couldn't listen to it.

[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.260]
We tried, but we couldn't, we got Y-100.

[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.260]
Yeah, that'll do it.

[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.960]
Sunny Fox, man, he's big in prison.

[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.680]
Yeah.

[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.300]
He dresses up as a woman.

[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.280]
Yeah, well, he's got a lot of experience, you know.

[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:48.920]
Really?

[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.400]
Listen, Neil, one more thing.

[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:50.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.340]
What do you think about the dolphin yesterday?

[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.380]
How about that?

[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.220]
What a division, huh?

[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.520]
They're seven and six and they're tied for first place.

[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.440]
What a great division.

[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.340]
Is it true that Roby's going to move the team over to Cuba?

[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.540]
Yeah, Roby Young.

[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:02.800]
Yeah.

[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.700]
They're going to build a stadium for him.

[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:04.960]
Right.

[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.960]
Have a wonderful day, sir.

[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.500]
You have a great life, Neil.

[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:08.940]
You too.

[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.440]
Okay.

[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.120]
Boy, boy.

[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.220]
Well, it's too distinctive to see how easily he's convinced.

[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.680]
Now, I just made that up.

[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.000]
Yeah, it's too small.

[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:17.400]
He's gone.

[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.380]
Okay, you know, if you've got a 2-5, that's okay.

[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.040]
Now, we don't know that we got a 2-5.

[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.820]
That's just he just read some numbers off.

[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.320]
But they happen to be 1, 2, 1, 9, 2-5.

[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.000]
That sounds like they fit into this time slot.

[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.580]
Sure it does.

[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.680]
And if that's the case, that means we did over a three in the month of November.

[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.200]
Like maybe well over a three, right?

[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.380]
The decimal point is in the right place.

[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:36.760]

[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.000]
Now, if it's like 0.25, he's used to that.

[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:41.740]
There's no problem.

[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.460]
There's no pressure.

[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.540]
Just like home.

[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.000]
Yeah.

[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.160]
Well, one thing about being consistent, there's something to be said for it.

[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.560]
Okay, it's 947 on Zade and now do we want to take, are you going to do news?

[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.160]
If you, if you, well, one thing about being consistent, there's something to be said for it.

[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.580]
Okay, it's 947 on Zade and now do we want to take, are you going to do news?

[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.940]
If you, if you like, what do we got?

[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.660]
How much do we got left?

[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.580]
Because I have no idea what you're doing in there and I guess that makes two of us, right?

[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.720]
See he's on the phone again.

[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.080]
Should I play that thing on the phone again?

[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.220]
Because he won't get off the phone.

[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.460]
Why are you going to get off the phone?

[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.840]
Because I think what have we got three minutes?

[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.120]
We have three minutes, right?

[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.220]
What is he, he just, he will not pay attention to me now.

[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.480]
Why don't I just do the weather?

[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:25.920]
You don't want to do the news?

[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:26.880]
I'll be glad to.

[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:27.820]
Whatever you want.

[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.000]
We have time for it.

[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:29.440]
Okay.

[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.220]
What?

[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.160]
He's back on the phone again.

[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:37.740]
He's telling me, you know, he was just, you know, so he doesn't know for sure.

[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.460]
I said, I told you that already that you don't know.

[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.060]
We're not going to hold a gun to his head.

[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.120]
I know. I think he's just a little worried that he was.

[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:45.580]
Maybe he was chast.

[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.140]
But not his head.

[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:48.900]
Not to his head.

[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.240]
Because what's there to blow out in his head, right?

[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:52.500]
There's nothing there.

[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.720]
Okay. Don't panic, cake.

[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.340]
Just relax.

[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.300]
Whatever you say.

[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.280]
You know, we're patient.

[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:58.820]
We can wait.

[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.340]
And if that's what it was, that'd be it.

[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:00.860]
That would be great.

[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.100]
That would be just fine with me.

[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.180]
I'm not going to hold you to it.

[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:03.420]
No.

[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.740]
And if it's anything lower than that, then look out.

[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.560]
Because I know where you live.

[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.100]
948 now on state of four.

[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.580]
And the man who used to be bodyguard for it.
