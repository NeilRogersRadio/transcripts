That eight o'clock in the world at her dollar again

[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.140]
Listen, you know, this is kind of tough because you know you want to get to the nitty-gritty, but you're on the radio

[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.340]
Well, you have to learn to a prolong your excitement, sir

[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.940]

Yeah, they could be occupied you think so occupied. Oh, you know what the problem is, but I

[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.380]
Don't think they're open yet. It's only five to eight in California

[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.980]
I bet they're not there yet. I don't think this is a 24 hour number. No, that's called later

[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.980]
Are you following me? I listen to you, but what's the deal? I mean

[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.720]
Well, it's an awful lot to ask you to prolong it for another hour and five minutes, but I'm sure you've got experience

[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.300]
I mean, I mean I know we game at the best shot

I'll bet you this wasn't about a hot dog was it?

[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.520]
I know why do you have to try again later after afternoon

engulfed by a mong of wheel parmesan. I just see it wouldn't it be a great Japanese science fiction movie the vision of the wheel parmesan twins

Take the same elsewhere groupie myself. Oh, right drop them sir

[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.460]
Don't listen to him sir. I thought that was one of the most all-time classic shows they've ever had last night

[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.120]
It's shocked. That wasn't Ronnie Cox who dropped it. No, it wasn't no. Was that Flamers? Dr

Dr. Wester Bendova. Yeah, yeah, I was so shocked. I was shocked. Yeah, I get a question for you

They was disclaimer. Oh, yeah, that's in the paper today. There's some it's too close to

Hemana the name ecumenna is the company that took over the hospital and

[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.500]
Hemana filed suit against in BC saying the name was too similar

[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.880]
And so they ran a disclaimer

[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.220]
Okay, a while, but now it's one of the greatest

[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.420]
San El Suerza ever I think good caller excellent taste

[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:55.800]
Not a quick. He did any of you got the David Letterman last night. No way Jose you'd have to talk to Michael Wolf about that

The head of the FCC was on really you were just sitting in the crowd there and

[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.200]
They were talking about ridiculous things about why you can't show people actually drinking beer on TV

No, you can show them drop their pants and show their

[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.640]
You know, we're on the same network that had a guy drop the drawers and the guy to point in why they can't drink beer on TV

[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.360]

[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.820]
Neil can't handle this TV talk. He doesn't he doesn't buy it doesn't buy it and you are not slanted

[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.780]

[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.380]
That I mean, I

General manager goes up there. He kicks him out.

[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.000]
He didn't say what I thought he said. Now listen, Sandy is going to be very upset to hear that.

[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:29.020]
I'm gonna get accused of all sorts of things. Now listen, I just can't say hello again. Yeah, I'm listening to you guys and I really enjoyed me guys.

[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:06.700]
that, of course, all that crap about saying elsewhere, which is enough to put anybody into a coma. It's serious. I mean, who wants to see Ronnie Cox

[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:13.880]
moaning now? He was running. He was in that show apples way several years ago. Remember that show. And Vince Van Patten was in that show. Now,

[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:22.760]
Vince and Van Patten were moaning. Then I would turn it on. I paid to see that heavy money, serious money. Don't hold your breath.

[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:37.320]

[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:13.720]
Many of the players in all of this have a reason behind it and look off about that on other days.

[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.200]
If you have not heard this entire message, please hold on. It will repeat.

[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.540]
Get on this jamming.

[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.680]
This is Jim, we're so glad you called us today.

[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.960]
You're dispensing the chance to chat just so there's a people I've been here yesterday.

[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.100]
To answer some of your questions.

[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.040]
Yeah.

[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.060]
Speak to us.

[00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.280]
Finally, the 10 records that you've been waiting for.

[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.500]
Tammy Faye's unbelievable new album.

[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.020]
Here's the rock. I crawled out from under.

[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:29.760]
It's all here. The headache. The heartache. The pancake.

[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.220]
Tammy Faye's unbelievable new album.

[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:43.240]
Tammy Faye's unbelievable new album.

[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:43.240]

[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.560]
Here's the rock. I crawled out from under.

[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.300]
You know you're burning hair. You're really really.

[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.600]
Thank you. You got blessed. You do notice in these recordings, there's no religion at all in here.

[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.720]
They have, they have, they're not even playing that game anymore pretending.

[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.840]
But it's worse than a soap opera.

[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.560]
Hmm. It's worse than St.

[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.560]
Elsewhere. I mean, they're just attacking each other.

[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.880]
Visually. Yeah.

[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.440]
We took him off the network because he was attacking other people.

[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.500]
And what are they doing?

[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.820]
Another attacking him and the word attacking them.

[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.500]
So life kind of evens out. It's 11 30.

[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.040]
Oh, okay. Well, we'll work on it for you.

[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.040]
Yeah. We'll work on it.

[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.560]
That guy still hasn't been able. Well, they're like, I guess desperate.

[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.380]
Dave County. Hello.

[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.020]
Hello, W. I. M. C.

[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.480]
W. I. M. C. This is y'all.

[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.920]
Hello.

[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.720]
Yeah, please. You have to pay attention to them.

[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.500]
A very important man. Yeah, you sound like it.

[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.700]
I'm doctor always request from the South Florida Association of Scientific Research.

[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.620]
And I was calling about some report of earthquakes here in Miami.

[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.720]
And it's very true. In fact, most of the people here

[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.320]
are quite eaten.

[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.360]
Heartbeards and deer palm trees.

[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.940]
They feel rumbling in their stomach because of it.

[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.160]
And it's caused. I tell you guys, it's caused by my respire and exertion.

[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.420]
A couple of other nincom books here.

[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.280]
Well, doing a male race with a plenty of posters and guns in their race.

[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.460]
And they'll be shooting up in the air.

[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.840]
You know what you'll this guy's auditioning for?

[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.000]
I recognize that material anyway.

[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.400]
By a buyer.

[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.940]
By a house.

[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:36.760]
Two later.

[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.800]
I see what I love.

[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.320]
I love the way it comes out every day and talks about how some of our materials

[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.820]
really great and some of it sucks.

[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.020]
You know that, that's great.

[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.660]
I love that. That's at least he's a little bit honest.

[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.560]
We tried to warn him about this.

[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.560]
Not part of his reputation that precedes him.

[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.140]
But you know, it's never too late to make your nose shrink.

[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.380]
This is going to be the pay off.

[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.600]
Okay, well, obviously, you know, don't even try to call Jeff Striker is the bottom line.

[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.240]
Which is going to create some very serious problems for some of the people in South Florida, right?

[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.020]
Okay, well, listen, a few hours will pass.

[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.360]
Just control yourselves.

[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.120]
Okay, let's go back to the phone.

[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.560]
We got some day lines not flashing at the moment.

[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:32.560]
6249400.

[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.600]
Broward. Hello.

[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.820]
Hi, Neil. How you doing?

[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.320]
Okay.

[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.000]
I got a question I want to ask.

[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.880]
You know, I'm directing it to maybe some of the police officers or maybe listening.

[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:43.320]
Shoot.

[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:56.560]
How in the air can this state go against federal law or how to state law supersede a federal law to carry a weapon into a bar?

[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.860]
Literal stab.

[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.260]
You can't carry it into a bar.

[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.840]
That's again, that's one of the places you can't do it.

[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.040]
I was I'm listening to TV right here.

[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.940]
No, you can't you can't take it into a bar.

[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:11.460]
If I wanted to try to figure out is if you go into a restaurant that's got a bar, can you take a gun in there?

[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.720]
That's yet to be tested.

[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.460]
The whole thing is crazy.

[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.080]
Don't you understand?

[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.400]
You're trying to make a logical situation not of insanity.

[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.600]
I moved down here 18 months ago.

[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:20.880]
Yeah.

[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.080]
And this 18 months is so state.

[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.620]
It's like an 100 Navy degree.

[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.340]
Well, that's the governor more taxes and the legislature.

[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.360]
I got a bunch of goofballs running this state.

[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.600]
How long have I been saying that?

[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.400]
I mean, I've been knocking myself out for 12 years to try to make these people understand it and they don't care.

[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.080]
That's right.

[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.520]
They don't care.

[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.700]
So we're all wrapped up in this because the people don't give it then.

[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.680]
I've been listening to you for 18 months since I came down here.

[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.220]
And this takes the cake.

[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.100]
You got it.

[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.060]
Well, hey, listen, you ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.840]
Is Reagan would say there's probably more to come.

[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.900]
Oh, I can believe that, but I'm going to run it.

[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:52.420]
Okay.

[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.660]
All right. I have a good one.

[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.300]
Good luck to you.

[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.240]
I mean, does it pay to get upset about all this?

[00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:58.820]
We've done it.

[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.780]
We've had strokes, nervous breakdowns.

[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.740]
It doesn't do any good.

[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.800]
You're living in a Neanderthal state with a bunch of total goofballs.

[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:06.900]
And that's what it is.

[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.460]
You know, that's the price you pay for sunshine.

[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.280]
And of course, the last few days we've seen all this great sunshine.

[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.020]
It's terrific.

[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.240]
18 to 12 at W.I.N.Z.

[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.020]
A caller in Dade County who I'm sure is desperate.

[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.760]
Desperate to speak to us.

[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:18.960]
Hello.

[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.840]
I told you, was I right or what?

[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.220]
Dade County.

[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:23.520]
Hello.

[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.500]
Oh, boy.

[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.340]
They're out there now.

[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:27.660]
Aren't they?

[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.500]
I think the earthquake of the San Andreas fault is just spread.

[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.460]
Dade.

[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:31.800]
Hello.

[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.440]
Hi.

[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:33.020]

[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:33.520]
Neil.

[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.060]
Yes.

[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.560]
Morning.

[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.180]
How are you?

[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:35.600]
Great.

[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.400]
Listen, you were talking about that Rob Lowe movie.

[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.200]
How did you like it?

[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.060]
I thought it was great.

[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.220]
I know.

[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.240]
You didn't go in talking right yesterday and it came on last night.

[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.400]
And you know what, really, I'm glad you brought that up.

[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.940]
You know what really made me sick about that movie was Jim Belushi in a character that he played.

[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:57.840]
In fact, both of the other couple, the morons, the best friends of Rob Lowe and his girlfriend there.

[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.480]
I know people like that.

[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.760]
And that movie was the best proof of that motto that you hear me say all the time.

[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.680]
It's not important in life to choose to succeed, but that your friends fail.

[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.240]
Exactly.

[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:08.840]
Am I right?

[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.340]
I mean, they were doing their damnedest to split them up and screw them up.

[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.320]
And Jim Belushi, I know people like that.

[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:14.800]
I know.

[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:20.060]
Just obnoxious, weird, guzzling, disgusting, scumbag moron.

[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:20.420]
I know.

[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.700]
I didn't like him until this movie, but I thought he did, you know, he did very well.

[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.020]
Oh.

[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.660]
He was, he needed to be sure.

[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.240]
He needed to come to Miami and be shot.

[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.440]
Well, nice talking to you and I've listened to you for a long time.

[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.340]
But I haven't had the courage to call you.

[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:36.580]
Okay.

[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.800]
Okay.

[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.760]
Well, you have good taste.

[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.780]
I'm glad you enjoyed the movie.

[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.180]
Okay.

[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:40.680]
Thanks.

[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:40.780]
Bye.

[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:48.080]
Speaking of which this Saturday on HBO, I'm not going to play the music because then he'll come running back in and get all excited.

[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.500]
Stand by me.

[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.760]
In fact, that's going to be your homework assignment over the weekend.

[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:52.560]
Saturday night.

[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.880]
I don't know what time it is.

[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.380]
We'll find out.

[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.500]
But on HBO is stand by me.

[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.100]
It's also this month that'll be on I think like the movie channel or showtime or cinematics.

[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.420]
It's just all over the place.

[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:07.600]
So those of you who've been hearing somebody we all know, rave and rant and carry on about how great this movie is.

[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.740]
This would be our opportunity.

[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.100]
And on Monday we can all sit around and rip it.

[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:12.580]
Broward.

[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.000]
Broward.

[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:13.220]
Hello.

[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.680]
Let me say it again.

[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:19.780]
Hello.

[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:20.820]
Yes.

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.480]
Yes.

[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.000]
Hi.

[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:22.460]
How are you doing?

[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:22.860]
Okay.

[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.600]
Turn that radio off, sir.

[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.180]
It's off.

[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:26.800]
Okay.

[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.280]
I'm the first time caller.

[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.280]
I think everybody's making a lot of noise over this.

[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.540]
Let's see how it works out.

[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.140]
Sure.

[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:36.760]
Listen.

[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.720]
It makes all the sense in the world to have people walking through the mall with a holster.

[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:40.700]
Let's go back.

[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.140]
In fact, maybe we can go back to a segregation again.

[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.560]
We can go back pre-civil war.

[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.640]
Maybe we can have a slave offering later on in the show today.

[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.080]
I don't think people have a little slave auction on the air.

[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.060]
I think the biggest bomb wouldn't bring Larry Candid to it.

[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:53.880]
I'll trade line.

[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.460]
Get the phones really hot.

[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.960]
One of the bigger bombs I think is our arm.

[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.140]
I've got two slaves and a pop-up coaster.

[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.600]
What's answer I'm sure I'm getting emotional.

[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.280]
I think one of our bigger bombs rather than the arms citizens, but I'm sure it's going to work out.

[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.180]
You're going to have a two.

[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.200]
What do you mean you're sure it's going to work out?

[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.820]
What makes you say such a thing like Americans are really responsible with guns.

[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.940]
I've come full circle and I do.

[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.880]
I'm very nervous about the government making too many laws dealing with guns.

[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.040]
I don't trust the government.

[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.460]
I don't trust the police especially in this town.

[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.420]
I don't believe that they're going to protect this.

[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.800]
On the other hand, the idea that you can just walk around like why it hurt with a holster and a gun.

[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.700]
Just about anywhere you go.

[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.820]
That's really getting a little carried away.

[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.520]
You don't think so?

[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.460]
Yes, I do.

[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.100]
I get, just for a private ownership of guns, I can't see people carrying it.

[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.540]
Well, that's not what we're talking about.

[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.440]
That's not what the law, that's not where it stops.

[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.120]
A lot of people want to be doing that though.

[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.860]
I just think the gun launch is going to provide us a little bit.

[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:55.460]
But what we should also think about, look at what happened down at the airport with the Metro Day tops down there.

[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.960]
The police in South Florida are very aggressive overreacting type people.

[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.780]
That's because there's a great many of them are criminals to begin with.

[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.500]
So what do you want?

[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:14.200]
But has there ever been anybody ever taken on these pistapo that they call themselves police officers?

[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.300]
They're not police officers.

[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.160]
They don't have the public interest in mind.

[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.880]
Well, how do you know which ones are which?

[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]
It's an art to figure out.

[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.800]
Yeah, so the answer, obviously, is to solve it instead of to try to clean it up a little.

[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.340]
See, that's the one thing about this state, like auto inspection.

[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.000]
It wasn't working because we didn't have enough hours and we didn't have enough stations.

[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.660]
So we just threw it out all together and that's the same thing we're doing with the gun law.

[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:42.240]
You know, we just throw things out and instead of cleaning up the police force and instead of finally getting a state's attorney in date,

[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.220]
you can get some convictions instead of sitting there on TV with a stupid look on her face.

[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.700]
You know, the people here love it.

[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.340]
They suck it out.

[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.360]
They love Janet Reno.

[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.100]
I don't know what the thinking state is in dire straits.

[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:53.280]
Yeah.

[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.900]
What's the reason for it?

[00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:00.060]
The only people we can convict here are people who work in video stores who sell Debbie does OGIS.

[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.240]
You know, those people we can convict and that ruling that came down yesterday, you know, just unbelievable, just incredible,

[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.640]
that you might go into it.

[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:13.940]
Now they're even threatening to arrest the customers if you go into your neighborhood, the Joe's video store and you rent, you know,

[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.340]
Mary Poppins in the front and then you go in the back and you rent Sonya the sunrise.

[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:24.480]
If that's not on the approved list, which they're not going to tell them which ones are approved, it's just like the FCC.

[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:30.960]
You know, they don't want to tell you what the rules are and they're out there hovering waiting to nail you for something that you can't identify.

[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.000]
Same thing.

[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.200]
What is the cause of it?

[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.580]
Is this the cause body?

[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.520]
If one word is fascism, that's the cause of it.

[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:44.100]
Fascism. You've got a fascist governor and a fascist president and a fascist supreme court that's on the verge of getting a lot worse.

[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.120]
That's what's going on in America today.

[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.100]
Meanwhile, everybody's sitting back and they're doing entertainment tonight.

[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.860]
That's the nature of the game in America.

[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.920]
That's what you're living in.

[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.620]
Never, never land.

[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.980]
The young people down south, the old people vote.

[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.440]
Listen to the old people vote.

[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.720]
The old people get a card from Annie Akerman and they all march like a bunch of sheep and they go and they vote the same morons

[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.240]
in over and over and over again.

[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:11.900]
I saw that tape of what went on in Tallahassee last night about the stupid tax and I watched Ron Silver and all these other idiots up there.

[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.500]
It's pathetic.

[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.200]
Just pathetic what they're doing.

[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:20.120]
You know, for almost 12 years I busted my guts out on a year thinking that I was going to try to motivate somebody to do something.

[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.360]
Forget it. That's not the nature of the state.

[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.440]
These are all escapists you've got here.

[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.560]
They all came to Florida to escape from reality.

[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.860]
And they've created their own new reality.

[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.660]
It's called the nightmare, a living nightmare.

[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.080]
So what are the real people doing?

[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.840]
They're just laid down.

[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.500]
No, the real people live up north, sir. That's all I can tell you.

[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.440]
Well, I'm getting excited again.

[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.440]
Why did I do that?

[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.340]
After all these months, you know, he's getting me all worked up to a frenzy and there's no point.

[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.160]
I mean, you know, you live with it because you know where you are.

[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.940]
No, no, no.

[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.480]
Tomorrow is the Italian day, though, right?

[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.240]
We're getting Italian from plantation, right?

[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.660]
No, braids.

[00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.280]
No braids.

[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.540]
It's the way we like a dream in an hour.

[00:30:59.700 --> 00:30:59.780]
Yeah.

[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.420]
Several people have dropped off on there.

[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.700]
Well, listen, I got to go eat lunch.

[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.400]
And they know we can't call the West Coast.

[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.780]
So they're not interested in the show anymore, right?

[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.640]
They're fickle, fickle crowd.

[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.840]
Got a nice hate letter from Harold Diamond and Tamarack.

[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.560]
Really?

[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:13.980]
Yeah.

[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.900]
The ship is sinking, he said.

[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.260]
We're not discussing all those wonderful, heavy issues.

[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.700]
I guess Harold doesn't pay too much attention last year, right?

[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.000]
Or the last nine months?

[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.280]
He's another one of those guys who wants to hear me have a stroke on the area.

[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.280]
That's what it's all about.

[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.140]
Good luck to you, Harold.

[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.180]
We love Tamarack.

[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.140]
It's just one step away in my heart from Hallendale, one step.

[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.800]
Boy, and then we got, that can't be a local number.

[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.040]
Can a 258 bird?

[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.300]
Looks like I know.

[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.240]
No, I don't.

[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.620]
Well, I better not dial that up, huh?

[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.500]
By cally square.

[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.340]
Where the hell is that?

[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.620]
Sounds like Boston to me.

[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:53.680]
Really?

[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.380]
That's the only cally square I know.

[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.640]
I don't know the area.

[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:57.960]
I don't know the area.

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.040]

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.040]

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.040]

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.040]

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.040]

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.120]
It's the only cally square you know of.

[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.920]
There might be.

[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.940]
I know of Harvard Square.

[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:03.800]
Yeah.

[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.360]
And I know of all kinds of other squares, but I know I never heard of cally square.

[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.180]
That's just my guess.

[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:13.860]
I have no idea.

[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.720]
Scully square.

[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.900]
All right, I'll try it.

[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.480]
You got to move.

[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.900]
B-I-R-D.

[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.040]
Okay.

[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.300]
Probably wind up on WRK over something.

[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.740]
The dialed Boston?

[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:34.960]
Yeah, 617.

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:35.520]

[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.540]
Maybe whoever sent this into his call and tell us if it's not Boston.

[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.420]
It was a bird lover.

[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.500]
There's no question about that.

[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.960]
I don't think this, wait a minute.

[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.460]
It's ringing.

[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:47.460]
It is.

[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.480]
That's scary.

[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.860]
Oh, oh boy.

[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:54.420]
Hello.

[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.160]
Cally square.

[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.100]
Hey, Vihar.

[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.220]
Okay, I guess they're out of the cage for this hour.

[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.340]
Okay, anyway, it's 10 past noon.

[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.520]
We got a couple of hours to go.

[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.380]
And then we also got their wonderful card from somebody in West Palm Beach.

[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.540]
And that's scraggly writing.

[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.860]
You can always tell by that real scraggly looks like somebody a hundred years old.

[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.120]
They're all upset about my belly aching about working on Saturday.

[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.620]
About, you know, even people are working hospitals work six days.

[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.600]
And it said the, you know, some diabetic moron who eats ice cream

[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.560]
winds up in the hospital.

[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.780]
They have to be there just in case.

[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.680]
Nice card from West Palm Beach.

[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.000]
Boy, those people in Palm Beach County, you know, what a bunch of douche bags they are.

[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.160]
You know, let's do an all-out attack on Palm Beach County.

[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.940]
That is the most mong place I worked there for a year.

[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.640]
And I want to tell you something.

[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.580]
There are, you know, there's some nice people up there.

[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.900]
Yeah, but they're getting what they deserve.

[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:48.620]
Ten or 20.

[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.860]
They got Mike Miller.

[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.400]
Yeah.

[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.860]
They got Daffy McCallum.

[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.080]
They're really, we're taking care of Palm Beach.

[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:54.380]
Yeah.

[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.880]
And we even stuck them with John Brown for a little while, too.

[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.040]

[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.660]
We're trying.

[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.460]
We're trying.

[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.000]
We're going to give them what they deserve.

[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:00.520]
Okay.

[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.600]
Well, listen, you're listening to the Vio Roger show on All Food Radio.

[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.920]
That's an idea.

[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.060]
All food radio.

[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:09.520]
Hmm.

[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.040]
You can have all the hosts coming to eat different kinds of food on here in this private.

[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.740]
All different restaurants could come in and cater it all day.

[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.120]
It's been that way this week anyway.

[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:17.980]
Mr. Food.

[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.780]
Okay, now we've got all the lines flashing now and I have a feeling that this is a fresh bunch.

[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.700]
You know, yeah, well, a whole new bunch.

[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.340]
Watch, you watch.

[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.660]
Keep hitting that same one.

[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.360]
No, I don't.

[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.400]
Well, no, you've hit it a lot, but they, you know, what's different?

[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:30.860]
They count.

[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.560]
Yeah, how you doing?

[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:32.980]
Okay.

[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:33.660]
Good.

[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.460]
First time car.

[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:34.940]
Great.

[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.260]
First time I wanted to say anybody who didn't go Monday night really missed out.

[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.440]
Monday night, you bet.

[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.180]
It's a good time.

[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.380]
Listen, I was wondering if you heard down this morning.

[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.140]
No, I only heard, I only heard Neil Roger's theater at about eight or fifteen times.

[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:49.280]
The movie came up that you were talking about with Rob.

[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.780]
With Donald Sucks.

[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.460]
I'm afraid to end.

[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.300]
Turn off the sound and just watch Rob.

[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.020]
Oh, it's a good time for the great taste Donald shame on you.

[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.260]
Sounds like Donald.

[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.300]
Did he really say that?

[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.700]
A something that is out of fact.

[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.080]
Yeah.

[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.240]
I just, I've let you see Donald come on your show.

[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.080]
I really would.

[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:09.860]
No, thanks.

[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.600]
Boy, he would come.

[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.680]
He'd be on here once and he'd never show his face in public again after that.

[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.760]
After Palm Beach.

[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.580]
You see, first of all, let me say this to you.

[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.960]
You know, Rob Lowe is a nice looking kid and all of that.

[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.620]
Although lately he's getting that Don Johnson scuzzy.

[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.320]
You know, it looks like he doesn't shave good or something.

[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:27.740]
Exactly.

[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.960]
But he's a good looking kid.

[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.120]
But you know, the movie was a good movie.

[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.200]
I mean, it was something you could really get into.

[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.060]
You know, it wasn't one of the all-time great movies.

[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:36.620]
That's great.

[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.300]
But it was a good movie.

[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:37.880]
It's okay.

[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.120]
She look good, but she always plays the same part.

[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.080]
There's something about her though.

[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.860]
I mean, she's nice looking, but she's like.

[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:45.600]
Uh-uh.
