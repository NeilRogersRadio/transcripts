[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.260]
I wonder if the call when the callers start becoming personalities and becoming guests on the shows.

[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.200]
Here's another record.

[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.080]
Maybe we ought to just have Leonard card all this stuff up and we'll play it today instead of talking all these pinheads.

[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.160]
Oh, we can't play this on the air.

[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.360]
What is it?

[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.640]
Well, the name of the group, first of all, is blow flies.

[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.060]
So that should be a pretty good idea.

[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.380]
And the name of the song, well, there are two cuts on here on most 45s that generally are two sides, right?

[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.740]
I got a whole pack of very observant of blow fly right now.

[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.500]
And that's another one on one side, the first black president.

[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.780]
And on the other side, give me that old 69, the number song.

[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.320]
Those ought to be good.

[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.000]
Huh? Play those on Stan's show.

[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.080]
And we'll listen to them.

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.240]
Dave County. Hello.

[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.260]
Hello.

[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.820]
Yes.

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.020]
I'd like to talk to an help.

[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.160]
You're talking to him.

[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.880]
Service is he.

[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.720]
Yes.

[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.060]
Hi.

[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.120]
I wanted to go to him.

[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.080]
I was in the flight of Saudi, but I was away for the week.

[00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.620]
Yeah.

[00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.420]
Who is this?

[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.100]
Wait a minute.

[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.240]
Is this the guy from IMI Vice?

[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.100]
No, sir.

[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.400]
I'm not.

[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.640]
Is this Michael Talbot?

[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.300]
No, sir.

[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.940]
Okay.

[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.540]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.980]
Yep.

[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.520]
I do my family Thursday night with a place to handle fear of the attack.

[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.540]
You want to break the launch on Thursday?

[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.100]
Yeah.

[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.980]
What is that?

[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.040]
You know, the force was excellent.

[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.600]
Yeah.

[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.200]
It was very good.

[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.080]
The service was good and the force and I really recommend that place very highly.

[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.740]
Great.

[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.520]
Okay.

[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.140]
Just let's go.

[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.960]
Thank you.

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.340]
Thank you.

[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.780]
Okay.

[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200]
We'll be sending you your worst alert alarm in the mail, sir.

[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.480]
An entry for the Near Rogers exotic erotic Hawaiian vacation contest.

[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.400]
I told you.

[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.720]
Right.

[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.320]
Is I speak?

[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.740]
Yeah.

[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.900]
Told you today.

[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.460]
I always make a last minute change.

[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.700]
There's not even a picture in this.

[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.420]
Listen to this.

[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.920]
Dearest Neil.

[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.300]
Is that a fain off start for you?

[00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:02.760]
I cannot express the excitement and anticipation that filled my lower body when I heard you announce that you were looking for a companion to accompany you to the beautiful isle of Hawaii.

[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.640]
His name is Jay, but his closer friends call him joy.

[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.420]
I may tell you what you laughing about.

[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.780]
I haven't even got to the good party yet.

[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.960]
I am a 22 year old male flight attendant who loves to go around the world need.

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.680]
I say more.

[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.700]
I am an Anglo Miami native, but love to mix with the different cultures.

[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.260]
I'm five foot 10 inches tall away 150 pounds.

[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.360]
I have long blonde hair and the earring in my right ear.

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.820]
Oh, I've learned what that means.

[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.700]
I've had several layovers in Hawaii.

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.980]
While working flights, but never have had a chance to spend an extended period of time there.

[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.420]
I'm a very party oriented guy would love a chance to do Hawaii with you.

[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.880]
We could go strictly platonic if you wanted to, but from my experience, it can get pretty lonely and cold during the nights there.

[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.320]
Who knows what might happen if we shared a suite together?

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.540]
It doesn't get cold at night.

[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.140]
No, it doesn't get cold at night.

[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.540]
His hobbies are jogging sports hanging around gyms and western oil just kidding.

[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.380]
You believe this?

[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.260]
PSA Hydaglin Hill for me.

[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.340]
Oh, this probably somebody hangs out at the Thai orchid restaurant, which I do hang out at, but we heard with the J.

[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.460]
We know all about you.

[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.840]
Yeah, well, you might as well in the new hour.

[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.820]
Glenn is coming out of the closet on the air.

[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.400]
Don't hold your breath.

[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.840]
Okay.

[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.340]
One o'clock hour.

[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.080]
Boy, then just we're just loaded with stuff.

[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.700]
I beg your pardon.

[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.440]
Okay, Mike Wolf would like J to call him in the newsroom.

[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.020]
Mike wants to go to Hawaii with J.

[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.800]
Is there no hope for anybody in this building?

[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.420]
Questionable.

[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.320]
My dear Mr. Rogers, I tune to you every 10 a.m.

[00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.520]
When you talk about jog strap, et cetera, I tune out when you discuss an issue and nobody does that better than you.

[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.800]
I listen and when you want cooperation, you get it.

[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.840]
You'll be little the early bird participants.

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.920]
How about you?

[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.980]
Codging food.

[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.940]
What is caudging?

[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.000]
Do you ever hear of that before?

[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.640]
No.

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.380]
Is that such a word as caudging?

[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.920]
There is.

[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.660]
Codging food from places just so you can give them a kind word.

[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.960]
Do you ever offer to pay or do you think you are entitled to freebies?

[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.240]
Because you are new Rogers.

[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.200]
I regret your new attitude.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.020]
Your sidekick is in India trying to be your clone.

[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.800]
Go back says Mrs. Irwin Jacobs in point east in North Miami Beach.

[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.000]
Oive in point east.

[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.920]
Well, we'll be doing our show remote tomorrow from Sadie's buffet and plantation or Davey wherever the hell it is.

[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.240]
Look at the phones now.

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.560]
They're finally beginning to light up.

[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.480]
They're finally getting with the program.

[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.020]
You are not in the new issue of people that you're not going to be in any issue of people and you can take that.

[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.500]
Give me that.

[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.640]
The way some factors.

[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.180]
No, any more of that fluff.

[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.700]
We want only substance on this show.

[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.000]
Okay.

[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.300]
No more of that silly stuff with Elvis.

[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.520]
And Don Johnson's chest rubbing his belly with Western oil.

[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.900]
We don't want to hear about that anymore.

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.300]
Okay.

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.460]
Enough of that crap.

[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.600]
Now I don't understand.

[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.700]
We want this station to go back to being the.

[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.440]
Intellectual.

[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.460]
The substance station that it once was.

[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.580]
I don't understand this letter.

[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.040]
What?

[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.720]
I would appreciate.

[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.540]
Dear Mr. Hill.

[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.780]
I would appreciate if you would be good enough to forward.

[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.280]
Look at this.

[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.020]
Here's one that's as boon in debaht.

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.120]
It's my mindless audience.

[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.200]
Those are times no matter what I tell a man.

[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.960]
They do it with one exception.

[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.500]
If you would include if you would forward being closed envelope

[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.860]
addressed to Miss Betty Lee Lombago to me for to her for me.

[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.220]
She appeared as a guest on the U.I. and S.

[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.040]
About a year ago.

[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.540]
At that time, those substantive callers I was talking.

[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.620]
All I see what my color at that time.

[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.700]
Two doctors also were guests on the program.

[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.300]
I see.

[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.860]
She wants me to forward this to a I see what it is to a guest that we had on the show.

[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.960]
Betty Lee Plombaco.

[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.000]
Talking about aches and pains.

[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.620]
No, right.

[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.240]
Now I understand what they want.

[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.720]

[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.920]
Let's take a break here just for the 25 past 11.

[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.920]
It's not going to believe today's male.

[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.480]
I mean, no matter what we've had in the past.

[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.140]
First of all, we have a copy of play girl here from May of I don't know what you're this is.

[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.400]
And there is an arrow Flynn in the box and a you'll Brenner in the box.

[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.560]
I can't believe it.

[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.540]
There's a picture of you old Brenner start naked.

[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.560]
And a picture of a real Flynn.

[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.280]
Start naked.

[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.820]
I can't believe it.

[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.580]
There it is.

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.140]
There are a lot of other pictures in here of people who are less famous start naked like Lauderdale boys.

[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.740]

[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.760]
And these pictures do tend to be a lot more interesting than the Flynn in the box and the Brenner in the box.

[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.940]
But I just thought I would mention that.

[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.460]
And we thank the very entertaining.

[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.580]
But wait till you hear this.

[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.960]
You are not going to believe it.

[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.540]
And you see right in my hand.

[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:14.460]
And the letterhead says Pope John Paul the second addresses the entertainment and media industries universal city California.

[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.400]
You're not going to believe this.

[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.160]

Spisshape of Los Angeles

[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.720]
Unfortunately that doesn't correspond with your when you're gonna be in California. Yeah, wouldn't that be great?

[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.620]
That would be hysterica. Now you gotta open that box or are you afraid?

[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:48.500]
You're afraid hope. Oh here we go. You have a big box here. It's probably a voodoo doll of the moon man. Would that be a moon in the box?

[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.020]
It could be

[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.660]
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Probably cigars or something. No, you know if I get cigars. It's a double

[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.320]
wrap box

[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:12.240]
Could be anything god knows could be anything

[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.440]
Boy is this wrap here we go. All right

[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.320]
I

[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.840]
Think it is a voodoo doll

[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.820]
It's a little oh no oh my god. Oh no

[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.260]
No, no

[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.520]
Direct to you. It should have been addressed to me. You're right. Oh

[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.860]
My

[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.000]
It's an official Pepsi collector series Tweety Bird glass

[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.260]
Do you believe that they're Tweety right on the glass and I present that to you in lieu of this week's paycheck? Yeah

[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.780]
And of course wouldn't you know it also has a cassette of course and

[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.820]
Why would as you want to cassette I you provide me with some of your material

[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.020]
I just agree that he deserves that yeah

[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.600]
So what you could do for him from the water hill is not exciting. Yeah

[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.820]
Boy this male today. I'll throw it in the stack and good luck to you

[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:24.620]
By the way the latest radio rumor founder is out and Sandy Peyton will be surfacing at W snooze in a couple of months

[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:31.940]
We've been saying that for weeks. Yeah, well, that's the rumor Sandy will do that much more much more prominent now than it was for a while

[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.060]
Yeah, so those of you who missed Sandy those of you with bad memories

[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.660]
Oh

Where's the TV repair man?

[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.220]
And the collectibles man he was so wonderful

[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.120]

Pinhead

[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.860]
Okay, another pinhead believe that good call good. Just a little upset. Can you believe that he would do that?

[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.100]
I can't believe he would pull out of us Howard County. Hello. Hi Neil. How are you? Okay?

[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:27.860]
I want to tell you don't be upset with male from pointy. It's the original Century Village. Yeah, I know that okay

[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.260]
Second of all

[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:35.080]
Did you hear on TV or radio that the day the Pope is here that they're gonna block I

[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.340]
From the museum to a hundred and third street

[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.200]
Yeah, yeah

[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.480]
I'm believe on you know separation of church and state

[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.220]
We leave absolutely yes

[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.840]
Absolutely like all over date County everywhere you go

[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.540]
You got all these people even the Jews have bumper stickers. We love John Paul the second

[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.060]
Just become the in thing to do now

[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:05.660]
I don't have to worry about getting around Miami, but just the post I have to go down here that day

[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.240]
Yeah, what do you do forget it? I guess you'll have to go to the Broward Mall instead. I was there yesterday looking for you

[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.540]
Where at the Broward Mall now but you were the

[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.860]
I was it colder. I was plunging my brains out but I thought I never cashed a ticket

[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:27.480]
No, no and in the last race I had four horses boxed in the trifecta and all four of them were in front with the

[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.860]
Less than a half a mile ago and the midway in the final turn all four of my horses were leading one of them was 20 to 1

[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.140]
One was 11 to one and I said I can't lose. There's no way I could lose. You know what I lost

[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:45.580]
Here came that 11 horse on the rail just flying by everybody and winning the race I couldn't believe it

[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.200]
I just have to tell you one more thing. I was how I'm doing some work on Friday would John was on

[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.100]
If you have that tape you could fly out of your chair laughing

[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:03.900]
You mean Chris no, it was John on the phone. John the men Chris. Yeah, it was so funny. It was great. Oh, it was it couldn't have been fun here

[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.960]
We've had no comment on it but it's been great. You're the first one because our audience basically are a bunch of young pinheads

[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.160]
And they have nothing of substance. I was sitting here

[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.400]
Yeah

[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.460]
You too, okay, how do you know? I pointless business

[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.440]
Shebroward

[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.020]
You're welcome

[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.980]
Jim Baker's former bodyguards suggested Thursday that the disgraced ptl founder

[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:37.300]
Was using the ministry's lavish bonus system to pay for homosexual gratification in his studio office

[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.640]
Don

[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:46.300]
Hardest here pardon the name was it raged by a story in time magazine that said he was duped into guarding the door of Baker's office

[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.060]
While men he thought were having a business meeting or actually having sex

[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.860]
Yeah, I heard that on CNN. How do you like that in the last week in the event? I'll see you then

[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.960]
Day in county hello

[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.240]
I think we may have

[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.060]
Move over on to make ways as zuki

[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.080]
We ultimate to wheel experience is here

[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.240]
Yes, 5,000 CCs are claiming pure waiting for a man

[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.180]
Much more enough to tame it

[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:30.440]
It's the kamikaze xs and it'll take you from zero to 200 miles an hour in under six seconds

[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:37.340]
Oh, it's because this phase got everything except grace

[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.880]
The kamikaze accepts it's the last motorcycle you ever run

[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.860]
Oh

[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.440]
Because we still have forgotten world war two young kid dog

[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.920]
Good mining ladies and gentlemen and thank you for flying Delta Airlines

[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.920]
We're presently cruising at an altitude of 35,000 feet

[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.360]
Well our captain has just shut off the main engine

[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:26.260]
So we'll be plunging to 5,000 feet at which time we will be losing lunch in the main cabin

[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.900]
If you look at your windows, you'll notice below us. There's a continental airlines jumbo jet

[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.180]
Which we will miss by mere inches

[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.420]
Our flight time to Chicago is exactly two hours

[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.520]
But that doesn't matter either since we'll be landing in Atlanta and

[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.260]
Incidentally on the wrong runway

[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.580]
Delta is proud to be the new official airline of what Disney World

[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.220]
So when you think Mickey Mouse think Delta

[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.680]
On behalf of captain goofy and the crew

[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.460]
Travis lezens flight

[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.880]
Oh

[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.320]
We said last week W. I. N. Z broadcast in a tutorial concerning gambling and a lottery in Florida

[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.940]
Here with another viewpoint is Barbara Caputman president of the Art Deco societies of America

[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:21.540]
In response to W I and C's editorial on the issue of gambling

[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:29.020]
Gambling is suggested as the only alternative to continued crime poverty and deterioration

[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.760]
Particularly on Miami Beach

[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.100]
But this is not what recent history suggests

[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.940]
And it is a real and easy issue requires the least work and creativity

[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.980]
The editorial also suggested from my m. A. B.

[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.920]
Triple happened to this world famous historic resort

[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.060]
Is that it become a residential area

[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.720]
filled with yuppies from muting to brick or Avenue

[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.900]
This is an old dream of developers who make the real money and I rise development

[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:12.940]
What is needed is a bolder use of what we have our own unparalleled resources to create another error the early 20th century

[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.220]
spend the fortunes proposed for new gambling hotels

[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.520]
On preservation of what we have

[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.160]
We should now ask us out there's Williams very make gambling okay

[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:36.980]
There he goes on his way with those what do they call those snakes that they put in there just made a disgust in

[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.580]
Oh

[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.620]
Give me that oh

[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.700]
But you'll be to my hand and we'll go to bed

[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.220]
In

[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.980]
I'm for weight but over all fly a fall of the

[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.760]
It's all thanks to leave I'd much rather be

[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.360]
leading at

[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.500]
women at oh

[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.560]
tonight and give me yours and you get mine

[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.140]
Won't you let me arrange this even exchange women at oh

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.800]
sex

[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.020]
yeah

[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:07.020]
by my my my man that you might be pleased up with it

[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.580]
It's all over

[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.120]
Sixty-nine, a little bit till how much

[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:32.020]
By the tips of your tongue, and to know what it takes to spell my name

[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:37.680]
It's still been through my face, go not a thing can replace that old

[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.200]
Sixty-nine

[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.580]
Just turn right around here baby

[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.020]
Oh yeah

[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.240]
That'd be blo-

[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.480]
Jackie, behave!

[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.160]
Just what you saw, track goal record couldn't possibly

[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:09.460]
Fons to my comments about the senator and Barbara Kappitman and all of

[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.840]
That other good stuff that we talked about right at the beginning of the show

[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.940]
I haven't even heard this yet, but I understand through the grapevine that this could be a radio classic

[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:26.020]
This is the real By-Britic topic, not one of Neil Raj's work, psychopants

[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:31.460]
That continually mimicked my voice

[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.860]
I hear you playing, I heard you play the tape

[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:43.240]
This morning from almost a year ago that your prize is a collector's item, Neil

[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:52.900]
My listeners response to another of your misguided and unsuccessful efforts that are gambling

[00:20:53.860 --> 00:21:02.100]
Today, as usual, you've come up on the side of no-nothings, sick humor about the echo district

[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.300]
You missed the entire point

[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:12.300]
The senator is threatened not because it is old, ugly, disabled, disabilitated or disgusting

[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.360]
The lab began to be disgusting as you said this morning

[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:22.340]
But because it is what the other act of building some Miami beats

[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:32.800]
Another of a tourist attraction to need private parking for 450 refurbished rooms, 1500 dining rooms, seats

[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:42.380]
Another minute is that the Roy Avril proposes to provide, as soon as five weeks from today

[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:50.820]
The Roy Avril business guided also in focusing on carrying down the common avenue buildings

[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:58.580]
For parking lot, for the heroes, ugly hotels as you see them

[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:07.200]
But not as off the track as in your blindness

[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:16.500]
You have been on what the real issue is that apparently rocking Miami beats by a captain

[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.960]
Oh, that was kind of an abrupt ending there, right? Like signing off over and out

[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.440]
Well, thank you so much, Barbara, what can I say that we haven't said before?

[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.440]
I think the operative words there were old, ugly and disgusting

[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.700]
I'm just so glad she listens to the show

[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.380]
Oh, yeah, she would miss the show for all the art deco on South Beach

[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.400]
The art deco, the senator, well, what a building that is

[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.880]
It's beautiful

[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:52.880]
And of course the beach is just loaded, there are piles on the beach of people who are coming from coast to coast to see those marvelous, those wonderful buildings

[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.700]
Those great buildings from days of your, oh, I ve

[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.220]
When's the last time you were on Miami Beach?

[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.940]
Well, it was about a week after I was on the Century Village tour bus in Deerfield

[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.380]
And you know something, I couldn't even tell the difference

[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.460]
It was incredible, it looked like the same ambiance and the same surroundings

[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.720]
Like some of the people I understand around the phone today

[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.540]
Uh oh, and boy, we'll see how long may stay on here

[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.160]
What is this all of a sudden? Right in midweek we seem to be shifting gears

[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:20.480]
Yeah

[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.840]
Well, in honor of my good friend Howard Kleinberg at the Miami News

[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.720]
Who would like us to go back to those good old days when Howard could

[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:35.300]
Not off as a guest in the middle of the show, you've heard the last guest on this program

[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.380]
Maybe he's ever been official? That is official

[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.800]
Wow

[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.520]
There will never be another guest

[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.800]
So Linda can relax

[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:46.000]
She shouldn't take it personally because I like Linda even though she despises me with a passion now

[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.820]
But she's sensitive

[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.760]
But I like her a lot

[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.460]
I'm not too fond of her boyfriend, but that's another story

[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.100]
Um, and Tom Jicca, Tom's a good friend, he's a great guy, he's a great guest

[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.960]
But you know, we can't disrupt the format of the show for one person, right?

[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.760]
And he does show up around town

[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.380]
Yeah

[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.920]
He touches all of the bass except at the wonderful island dreams

[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.840]
He's been banned

[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.540]
All that true, he has been banned over there because they don't like the truth

[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:10.960]
Right?

[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:17.960]
The truth shall not set you free over at Cox Broadcasting, which just coincidentally Cox happens to own the Miami News

[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.460]
That's true

[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.080]
Cox newspapers, Cox, that incestuous and serious relationship

[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.840]
And they ban, we all know and love

[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.540]
They ban Tom, it's amazing

[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.500]
Exactly, just like the audience would like to ban some individuals on this show, we won't mention any names

[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.520]
But what's the picture you have there?

[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.260]
No, the pictures that I have here are the ones from yesterday

[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.100]
Obviously, I've been so busy with all of that work

[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.500]
The first picture is a picture from...

[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.780]
I don't remember his name, but he's a very nice young man

[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.420]
He's keeping those close to your heart

[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.360]
And he looks a little bit like Alice

[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.900]
Yes, Mike, he's my name is Mikey

[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.580]
And what can I say?

[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.500]
No, Mike's a nice guy, and of course I have...

[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.620]
Here's the other picture of Mikey

[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.020]
Not bad

[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.160]
Oh, he's okay, nice guy

[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.800]
Then I have the picture of John, of course, which I'm humbling for

[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.220]
And John is very, very attractive young man

[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.180]
Who is successful, he's got his own business, he's 22

[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.780]
And I'd be delighted to spend an hour or two with John...

[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.280]
No, I'm just kidding

[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.960]
No, I'm gonna give him a call on these days when he least expects it

[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.920]
And we'll meet, you know, very discreetly in the middle of the middle of the year somewhere

[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.400]
And we'll see what's going on with John

[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.460]
But, you know, just to go over there for a week or ten days with somebody you don't know

[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.460]
And such short notice

[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.200]
Not a good idea

[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.380]
It's not a good idea

[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.260]
I mean, now somebody should happen to come in here from the voice of God's dream

[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.300]
And I shower or two with a...

[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.020]
What is that?

[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.060]
Just wind mail

[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.860]
More hate mail for the bird?
