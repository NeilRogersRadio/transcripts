[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.460]
They have real wacko is just standing by to talk to us here this hour.

[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.560]
I want to remind you again, man, I'm promoing this show like crazy because this could be,

[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.760]
this could be something, and then on the other hand it could be a big bomb, you never know.

[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.400]
But Friday morning at 10 o'clock we're going to talk to James McKinney, Chief of the Mass Media Bureau for the FCC Rock Creek Hill Ode.

[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.280]
Oh Neil, do you love yourself?

[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.940]
Is this another crank?

[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.780]
No.

[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.520]
Is this one of Al's neighbors?

[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.640]
No.

[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.340]
Okay.

[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.200]
Do you love yourself?

[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.860]
I really didn't give much thought about it. Do you love yourself?

[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.800]
Of course.

[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.560]
Oh, okay.

[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.540]
Well you see that's maybe that's why you're so miserable.

[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.660]
Oh, are you related to the guy from Hylia?

[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.480]
No, but he's got a point.

[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.320]
Yeah. You've got a point too. It's right at the top of the head, you jackass.

[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.640]
What up?

[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.040]
What are we getting all these people out?

[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.700]
All the amateur psychologists, they must be getting ready for Steve to come back on here.

[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.200]
Unbelievable. Yeah, that may have to be one of Al's neighbors. That was a setup.

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.300]
Okay, we've got several open lines now.

[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.860]
The last caller seemed to knock the daylight out of the board.

[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.100]
In Dade County, 624-0191, and in Broward, 764-0707.

[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.080]
I'm sure the last caller loves himself because we saw what he was doing.

[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.440]
West Palm, hello.

[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.820]
Hi Neil, how are you?

[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.880]
Okay, I think.

[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.500]
Oh, I hope so. Well, I'm in West 52nd Street, didn't I?

[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.000]
But I'm not surprised that they're carrying up Steve Dallinger and Myers from Chicago.

[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.020]
Yeah, we haven't heard too much about them.

[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.180]
Well, the last I knew when I was in Chicago or near Illinois, they were all

[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.500]
because they had offended somebody who operated the station who was in idiots.

[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.580]
And they took the malls and then they were supposed to go to another station.

[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.960]
Yeah.

[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.640]
And it never happened.

[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.300]
Okay. And they killed two in Illinois because they got people that were good

[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.600]
and then they just one by one took them off.

[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.240]
And really, I'm down in Mayer.

[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.740]
I was about the best thing that was out of there.

[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.860]
I would say they were about a year.

[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.800]
Well, well, if you would accept it.

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.860]
Oh boy, a couple of real degenerates, huh?

[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.020]
Who don't love themselves and are miserable and have nothing to do?

[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.720]
You married his three kids.

[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.840]
Oh my gosh.

[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.020]
He's not a young, single, nice-looking...

[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.160]
But they were interesting.

[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.040]
Every day they came on with something new.

[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.960]
It wasn't the same head.

[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.900]
You get, you know, but really carried on and got people interested.

[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.320]
And they were just shifting up from station to station like they're doing sound years.

[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.680]
Yeah.

[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]
Well, see, that's the problem.

[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.420]
There's a lot of spineless management in this business.

[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.520]
In fact, most management is spineless.

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.620]
And all they got to do was get a little bit of heat and right away, you know,

[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.420]
in the beginning they're usually real supportive and all excited and enthusiastic.

[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.940]
But, boy, inside their stomachs are churning and they're just waiting for the first flack.

[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.500]
And then, you know, most of them start buckling at the knees.

[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.180]
Well, I hope you stay on, because I really,

[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.520]
you're the only one I get to listen to and you're really enjoyable.

[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.600]
You make my day fly.

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.600]
And I enjoy you.

[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.820]
I'm not old. I'm not young.

[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.760]
I'm kind of in between.

[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.020]
Yeah, like most of us.

[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.760]
Oh no, you're young.

[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.240]
Oh really?

[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.700]
Oh yeah, I would think so.

[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.420]
Oh, sure.

[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.380]
Until I come in and do the show every day.

[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.800]
Wow.

[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.820]
I imagine it takes a lot out of you.

[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.440]
Then I start hating myself and getting real bored.

[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.120]
Man, you know, I listen to some of these people out there.

[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.780]
That's one of the things that I find the most amusing is that people who listen in the audience,

[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.820]
a lot of them, they really think they know something and they don't know a damn thing.

[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.700]
And as I said to that jerk before, there are people I know in this business

[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.440]
and, you know, I could just blow the lid off the whole market, but I wouldn't do it to people.

[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.960]
But they think that they're really because they listen to somebody on here.

[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.440]
It's like watching Johnny Carson or watching Bill Cosby.

[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.440]
I mean, Bill Cosby in his personal life might be an SOB.

[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.360]
He might be a nasty guy, you don't know.

[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.260]
Right, that's his mannerful from making his living.

[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.860]
Exactly.

[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.500]
Make a home and kick the dogs.

[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.020]
Right.

[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.660]
Well, it's great talking to you.

[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.280]
I really like that.

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.980]
I had a call collect.

[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.740]
I called once and he said, call the collect.

[00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.400]
Please.

[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.580]
We got loads of money here.

[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.560]
We don't know what to do with it.

[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.900]
Wonderful.

[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.140]
I'm really happy for you, Bill.

[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.960]
Get a nice big raise when your time comes up is...

[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.340]
Enough people say you're the best.

[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.540]
Don't ever eventually admit it.

[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.740]
Who will?

[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.840]
Who are your boss, I hope.

[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.400]
Oh, no.

[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.040]
Well, they only say that on alternate days.

[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.520]
See, one day they say you're the best the next day of the worst and that way they figure it even's out.

[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.480]
We got them all today.

[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.140]
We got all of Bernard Meltzscher's fan.

[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.780]
Hello, Bernard.

[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.840]
I wanted to tell you about Taffy.

[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.840]
You know, it's that same woman.

[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.740]
That's the incredible thing.

[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.600]
There's one woman.

[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.120]
She's about 120 years old.

[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.040]
And she makes all of those calls.

[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.100]
She calls Wichner and she calls Taffy.

[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.780]
And she calls Dr. Uckle Bernard.

[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.620]
Man, I'm telling you.

[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.920]
If we ever lose her half of these people are going to be out of business.

[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.140]
Okay, let's do a little business of our own here.

[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.140]
Does anybody ever see him together?

[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.540]
It's 21 past one.

[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.880]
By the way, speaking of rumors, you know that call we had at the top of the hour that another young misfit

[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.760]
who sounded like Mitch's twin brother who said he was calling from Rock Creek.

[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.860]
Well, I just got a call on the bad line.

[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.820]
You're not going to believe who it is rumored that that caller was.

[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.280]
Now, he was calling from Rock Creek.

[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.120]
And we know that a fairly well-known talk hostess in the market lives in Rock Creek.

[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.140]
And the rumor is that that caller, I mean, I find it hard to believe.

[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.100]
But will this be a story?

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.720]
This would make the Mike Miller rumor pale into one significant.

[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.520]
No one will need my stupid steal.

[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.640]
No one will need my stupid steal.

[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.400]
By the no who it was, man, we'd kept him on little longer.

[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.120]
Okay, 22 minutes past one at WNZ.

[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.640]
That was the WNZ's poster child.

[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.320]
You just turned there.

[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.320]
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale.

[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.600]
Hello.

[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.340]
Dale?

[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.160]
Listen to that.

[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.960]
We had two lines with English and Spanish.

[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.860]
And now they...

[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.400]
Boy, what a foul mouth-old fart he was, wasn't he?

[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.960]
Boy, he was a foul mouth nasty prune, huh?

[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.320]
Unbelievable.
