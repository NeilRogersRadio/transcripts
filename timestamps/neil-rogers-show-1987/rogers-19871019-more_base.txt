[00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.880]
Beautiful and wonderful and lovely and also underage you just want yourself.

[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.160]
Okay, 550, 9490 we do have a line open and brown.

[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.300]
Of course we never know if these people can get through or not because of this wonderful

[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.340]
phone system too right.

[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.780]
We don't want to bitch about that every day.

[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.840]
Most days but not every day.

[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.780]
I'm going to save that hate letter for a little bit later when more people are listening

[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.040]
because it's too good to pass up.

[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.500]
And we have some new little new little things today that Dennis Collins will get upset about

[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.680]
it.

[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.740]
Good morning, 10 to 4.

[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.460]
I'm David Cohen talking about Zeta Studios.

[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.400]
Remember when you wake up at night, terrible or depression, you have to take your radio

[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.660]
at 94.9, Zeta 4, 6 to 10 in the morning to listen to the show The New Rogers, the

[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.160]
best talk show in the world.

[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.620]
It has a good day and a good life.

[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.020]
It's always listening Zeta 4 and relax.

[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.360]
It's incredible.

[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.300]
Relax.

[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.160]
Remindable.

[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.520]
Relax.

[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.660]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.320]
I see there's a lot of carpeting still out there in the hall by the way that hasn't

[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.980]
been laid yet.

[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.020]
Have you noticed that?

[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.260]
That hasn't been what?

[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.620]
They may be back today.

[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.880]
The carpeting crew may be back today and of course you're hoping not.

[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.480]
I'm sure of that.

[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240]
Okay, this caller and Dave was there for a long time.

[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.600]
Am I right?

[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.140]
Oh, look at that.

[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.560]
I keep looking around and it's like on the screen now.

[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.100]
What a what a show this is turning into.

[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.220]
Dave County.

[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.640]
Good morning.

[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.900]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.300]
Yes.

[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.960]
Welcome, my friend.

[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.260]
Keep those levels absurd.

[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.780]
Running world.

[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.340]
Yes.

[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.140]
Welcome to my world.

[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.100]
Glad you joined us.

[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.280]
Yeah.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.740]
Hey, Tiger.

[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660]
Maybe we can cut up a couple of jacks.

[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.760]
On some of your dreams.

[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.280]
Bruce.

[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.000]
This is Bruce Williams.

[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.960]
Wouldn't you recognize him?

[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.020]
Who's that?

[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.220]

[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.620]
What's up, Bruce?

[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.900]
Well, it's real foggy up here and I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it to work

[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.480]
this morning.

[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.560]
So I have to listen to you all the way till 10 o'clock.

[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.300]
Great.

[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.220]
Is this it?

[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.940]
Is this our this is our call the morning?

[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.740]
You're right.

[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.380]
The dolphins and you're setting in again.

[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.020]
I told you.

[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.880]
Okay, listen, by Bruce, I'm going to start being nasty and cutting some of these people

[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.180]
out.

[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.700]
He was terrible.

[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.340]
I tried to warn you.

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.120]
You didn't want to hear me.

[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.440]
You're right.

[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.180]
They're very depressed.

[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.580]
Look at that.

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.200]
It's like only like last week we never had to give the number out, right?

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.280]
But we've been through this before on the A&M.

[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.420]

[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.240]
And you're right.

[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.300]
And I'm absolutely wrong.

[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.960]
When the dolphins pull off a particularly depressing performance.

[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.680]
48 hours.

[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.960]
Those weren't the dolphins yesterday.

[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.060]

[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.480]
It doesn't matter.

[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.500]
They were imposterous.

[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.840]
They found that.

[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.700]
And I got news for you.

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.440]
Having to listen to Marv Albert and Joe Namath.

[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.120]
I mean, Joe has set new lows in the history of illiteracy.

[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.440]
Okay.

[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.620]
And he just any word with the letter, Eleanor.

[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.120]
I wonder if they got him and Tom Brokaw together to do the game.

[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.680]
What would happen?

[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.980]
You know?

[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.300]
I mean, it is just pathetic.

[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.120]
Okay.

[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.160]
And that vocal line is also dormant.

[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.060]
I see the other people are starting to pick up a little bit.

[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.240]
Well, they're sleeping in a little late.

[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.840]
It's Monday.

[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.580]
I told you.

[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.260]
Speaking of Monday, by the way, we also have another thing in the mail.

[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.420]
Which you're going to be very excited about.

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.500]
It's a recipe.

[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.300]
You know what it's for?

[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.800]
For.

[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.440]
Mung bean sprout salad.

[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.360]
Which we'll be reading a little bit later on.

[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.600]
In fact, Marina Polve is going to be here to lay that one on you.

[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.400]
Look at that.

[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.440]
What's happening with the phone this morning, Captain Dave?

[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.060]
They're just a little cranky?

[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.040]
Cranky.

[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.340]
Yeah.

[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.740]
He just shaken his head.

[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.240]
He doesn't know.

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.760]
It's all over.

[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.380]
He said you had one week and you're finished.

[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.140]
You know, that's it.

[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.520]
It's not.

[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.840]
Just like on an AM, man.

[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.380]
I'm telling you.

[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.900]
At the beginning, they give you that little false sense of security.

[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.580]
And that's it.

[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.060]
They'll be this way for 48 hours.

[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.400]
They'll all be back by Wednesday.

[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.520]
I think they're uptight and unfriendly if you ask me.

[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.540]
And like, now I feel great.

[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.060]
You know, I feel like comfortable in here.

[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.320]
And even some of the stuff is working.

[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.720]
Not most of it, but, you know, little bits and pieces.

[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.060]
So you're pulling for the other team in the series.

[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.680]
Not the birds of what Minnesota or whatever the other team is.

[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.120]
Yeah, the Minnesota North Stars.

[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.660]
What do you know about sports?

[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.300]
You could tell them any name.

[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.420]
You know, how the North Star is going.

[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.700]
Yeah.

[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.260]
Yeah, the goal is a little sick, but the catcher is going to like up for it.

[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.600]
Is that the other team in the Minnesota?

[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.740]
Okay, let's take one or two of these call and, uh, Broward.

[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.000]
Hello.

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.860]
Good morning.

[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.360]
I hope you're going to be our first good caller this morning.

[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.180]
Well, I hope so.

[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.120]
I just got back in today from a two week holiday.

[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.180]
And, uh, I don't know what's going on, really.

[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.040]
What do you mean by that?

[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.540]
Well, I just got back from Europe.

[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.600]
I left two weeks ago Friday.

[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.080]
Are you trying to impress us with that?

[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.240]
I mean, like, you know, you were in Europe and we were here?

[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.520]
Well, no, I could have said I was in Peoria, but I was gone for two weeks.

[00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.820]
Yeah.

[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.220]
I turn on and, uh, here we are.

[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.300]
For me?

[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.160]
And here we are.

[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.900]
But, uh, what happened?

[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.240]
You went from AMFM.

[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.340]
I know you're talking about it.

[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.760]
And, uh, all of a sudden, it's happened.

[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.700]
Yes.

[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.760]
It's happened.

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.360]
Here we are.

[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.060]
I mean, like magic.

[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.200]
Well, not like magic.

[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.840]
I'm not going to have to have AM now.

[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.600]
Now that you're gone.

[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.460]
Is it going to fall apart?

[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.080]
Oh, speaking of the AM, by the way, they're running a promo.

[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.940]
I'm glad you mentioned that because they're running the most ridiculous, disgusting promo

[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.580]
that says, and I'm paraphrasing, but it says, uh, join the crowd of FM listeners switching

[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.460]
to AM, tune it to 940WINC.

[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.840]
Well, of course, what she forget, the T-Lady forgets to say, is that that throng of FM

[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.300]
listeners were listening to my show.

[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.800]
Yeah.

[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.300]
And buzzing.

[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.300]
And our computer just went out, by the way, kept in the day, but it was nice for, uh, 15 minutes.

[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.440]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.560]
Yeah, we're here, sir.

[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.160]
And, uh, you found us with no problem.

[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.040]
You were away for two weeks.

[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.660]
Now, how did you, uh, stumble on us?

[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.920]
Well, I called a friend yesterday to find out what was going on at work.

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.520]
Yeah.

[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.040]
And, uh, the friend says, by the way, he holds on FM.

[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.320]
And I said, yeah, what time?

[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.780]
And why, if you said 6 AM, I said, Neil won't get up at 6 AM.

[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.760]
No, Neil gets up at 4 AM, sir.

[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.680]
4 AM.

[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.780]
I can't believe you're doing this.

[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.420]
Sorry to believe.

[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.980]
Uh, how can you get up sorely in the morning and get with it and fight?

[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.120]
It's very, very easy.

[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.220]
You set the alarm clock and get up, you get out of bed, you shave, you get dressed, you

[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.540]
do a couple other little goodies, you get in the car, and here you are.

[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.480]
Just like magic.

[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.460]
I keep saying that.

[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.240]
That's, we're not supposed to say magic anymore.

[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.340]
Look, can you kid the Apple some of the things that we're going on when I left?

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.160]
Like what?

[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.760]
Uh, did you ever go for lasagna?

[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.900]
Uh, no, for real Parmesan, sir.

[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.380]
Would you get it right?

[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.860]
Oh, well.

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.460]
No, Jamie and Marci are now on a work release program in Kendall, and when they get out,

[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.700]
we may get over to their house.

[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.120]
Okay.

[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.660]
Are you still in a 9-7-6 kick?

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.000]
Well, the problem is when they get us some real phones in here, we may be able to dial

[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.420]
out.

[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.360]
Okay.

[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.340]
We can't die alive.

[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.100]
Well, I was one that stopped by to see Eddie McImboliose that night and dropped off the

[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.480]
picture.

[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.880]
The notorious picture that you're going to do the hour on the next day.

[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.760]
Of what?

[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.680]
Uh, Mr.

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.640]
Someone at the copa, I think.

[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.920]
Yeah.

[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240]
Well, we made that legendary.

[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.080]
We made 4,000 copies and passed it all over Dayton, Brown.

[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.180]
What a picture.

[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.600]
Yeah.

[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.520]
Are you mailing them out too?

[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.400]
Like you did.

[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.840]
Well, I'm not sure.

[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.640]
Well, you see, it's not all to do with you though.

[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.360]
No, see.

[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.520]
They just get surly.

[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.360]
They've always got an excuse, but that's the kind of town it is.

[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.500]
Yeah.

[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.400]
Uptight and unfriendly.

[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.940]
Welcome to South Florida, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.460]
Put your gun in your holster and have a wonderful day.

[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.860]
Okay.

[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.880]
Let's go to all the computer screen.

[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.280]
Is that?

[00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.720]
Look at that.

[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]
What happened to it?

[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.520]
It just died?

[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.180]
Yeah.

[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.120]
It just died.

[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.040]
I thought it was a joke.

[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.160]
I thought maybe he shut it off for a second or something.

[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.760]
It's dead.

[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.780]
I want to tell you, the engineering staff in this radio station on the scale of zero.

[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.540]
Okay.

[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.760]
Let's go back to Dave County.

[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.120]
Hello.

[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.820]
Hey, look at that.

[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.800]
Even the phone works today.

[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.100]
Great.

[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.840]
That's a good start.

[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.020]
How are you?

[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.840]
Wonderful.

[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.360]
So what's happening here then?

[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.320]
We're going to, uh, what exactly is the deal with Iran then?

[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.800]
Are we?

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.620]
Oh, come on.

[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.600]
Don't start with Iran.

[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.180]
Will you please?

[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.920]
We don't discuss.

[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.960]
This is FM.

[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.080]
We talk about happy things like Michael Jackson's face lift and stuff like that.

[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.540]
We don't talk about Iran.

[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.380]
I heard you mentioned it briefly.

[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.920]
And Ronald Ray Gunn.

[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.240]
We don't discuss those things.

[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.120]
We've got a bunch of mindless automaton auto-matons out there.

[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.600]
As somebody I know would say.

[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:48.800]
Yeah.

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.100]
The news this morning will concern Don Johnson.

[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.460]
Yup.

[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.320]
Shooting pigeons.

[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.700]
Stand by me.

[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.920]
River Phoenix is 17th birthday coming up.

[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.880]
Stuff like that.

[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.200]
Yeah.

[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.920]
And if they blow up the world, what difference will it make anyway, right?

[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.480]
I've had a couple appointments this afternoon.

[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.300]
I'd like to make.

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.400]
Well, and if you don't make them, what difference will it make?

[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.300]
Nobody will ever know.

[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.800]
Will all be the bombs of the bursting in air.

[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.660]
All right.

[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.880]
Well, it's good to hear you on FM.

[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.900]
You don't sound too enthusiastic this morning.

[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.780]
Sound a little tentative.

[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.700]
Like maybe this is...

[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.760]
Yeah, I'm very tentative.

[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.480]
This whole Iran thing's kind of got me on.

[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.300]
No, no, no, no.

[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.420]
Listen, we don't want you to get depressed.

[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.960]
A little later this hour, though, we are playing a Peter Paul and Mary in the very last day.

[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.020]
That's what we want.

[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.000]
That's what we want to hear.

[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.480]
Okay.

[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.420]
Have a wonderful day.

[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.980]
And listen, make the best of it, you know.

[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.000]
All right, man.

[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.620]
You know why?

[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.440]
Why not?

[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.700]
It could be the last one, right?

[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:35.620]
Okay.

[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.900]
For a wonderful day, and we want to motivate everybody in the audience, we don't want to create chaos

[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.380]
or panic.

[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.380]
But this probably is the last day.

[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.320]
And it's been nice knowing all of you, you know.

[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.960]
But nothing is permanent, right?

[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.700]
Look at the dinosaurs.

[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.540]
What happened to them?

[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.800]
Well, we enjoyed our week in one day on Zeta.

[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.720]
And if it has to come to an end, now we go out on a flourish of glory and excitement, enthusiasm,

[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.620]
all those.

[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.300]
Broward County, good morning.

[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.200]
All right.

[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.340]
Hey, how can you even feel nice last week?

[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.220]
Okay, where we going next?

[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.260]
I'll show you people a thing or two.

[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.880]
Okay, no more of that crap, okay?

[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.940]
We're going to start hanging up on everybody.

[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.460]
We'll get a lot more calls in that way.

[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.020]
That's right.

[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.320]
Okay, if there's any more runs from Piper High or Miramar High, we need to make up with them.

[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.960]
Remember, never say goodbye by Bon Jovi in the principal who's a real idiot over there.

[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.420]
And they wanted to play it at the senior prom and you have censored the record and they couldn't play it.

[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.400]
And they had to play like Mary has a little lamb or something.

[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.000]
And I think they ended up playing stand by me or something like that.

[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.100]
Are you serious?

[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.260]
I know it was considered.

[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.860]
No, they considered it last night on HBO.

[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.800]
That's right.

[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.260]
Remember Phoenix turned nine.

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.020]
You've been talking about the 15-minute promo.

[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.220]
I finally saw that at the very end of it where it fades out where they're starting to amolest each other.

[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.680]
That's my favorite part.

[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.620]
I can't believe that.

[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.580]
That was great.

[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.080]
You know, early.

[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.600]
As I look back at it, I think this is one of my favorite movies of the 80s.

[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.180]
I'm serious.

[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.580]
This movie affected me.

[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.460]
What is the word beyond obsessed?

[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.220]
There must be some word in the dictionary that makes obsessed pale into insignificance

[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.740]
because whatever it is, that's you.

[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.240]
You are way beyond obsessed with that movie.

[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.040]
Those dumb little kids.

[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.280]
It's like everybody growing up in the 50s.

[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.700]
We're all running around looking at dead bodies and jumping off railroad trestles and stuff like that.

[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.860]
That's what life was all about.

[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.440]
You did jump off the road trest.

[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.980]
Oh, sure.

[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.060]
I had leeches all over my body all the time.

[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.900]
It was a commonplace growing up in upstate New York like you know who.

[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.360]
By the way, probably part of the reason the lines may be a little jam this morning.

[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.540]
Joey is taking a contest.

[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.420]
They're having a big giveaway over there.

[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.320]
Who could pick the date when he's going to get canned?

[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.040]
No dates after January 1st, 88 by the way.

[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.280]
Just a little helpful hint to our listeners.

[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:48.980]
Interesting.

[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.280]
Okay.

[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.660]
Captain Avis put the board down there.

[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.260]
You know, the screen doesn't work and the hell with all this business.

[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.080]
We don't care.

[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.280]
We'll just punch him up at random.

[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.340]
Broward County. Good morning.

[00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:58.980]
Morning.

[00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.420]
Hi.

[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.300]
Hi.

[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.420]
I'm from South Planned Paces and you said last week that...

[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.280]
Isn't that where the kids were counter-fitting that money?

[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:06.800]
Yes.

[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.360]
Yeah.

[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.500]
I'm sorry to bring that up.

[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.280]
That was a sore point.

[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.560]
Well, I wasn't a counter-fitter.

[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.980]
Okay. Really? Yeah.

[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.640]
We're not all in one.

[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.520]
I've been listening to you so since you've been on the earth.

[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.100]
So, what are you doing here?

[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.440]
Wait a minute.

[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.100]
When did I ever say South Plantation Kids were more on this island?

[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.620]
I read it because the South kid did call.

[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.740]
Oh, I love South Plantation High.

[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:24.860]
Yeah.

[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.520]
It's my favorite.

[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:25.980]
I do.

[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.100]
Isn't that the one that's got like the soccer ball on the thing?

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.280]

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.820]
They were like the state champions, right?

[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.420]
Yeah.

[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.540]
We love them.

[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:32.920]
You want some South?

[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:33.540]
Huh?

[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.500]
You're eating with here during high school?

[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.240]
No.

[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:36.780]
No.

[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.240]
I lived in the frigid north.

[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:39.700]
Where?

[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.700]
In Rochester.

[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.200]
Oh, no.

[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:42.920]
I lived in Westchester.

[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.620]
In Westchester?

[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.280]
Westchester.

[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:45.940]
Westchester.

[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.660]
Westchester, what? Florida?

[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.920]
Oh, Westchester, New York.

[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.040]
Oh, in Long Island.

[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.300]
Now on the other side.

[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.080]
What do you mean on the other side?

[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:52.900]
The other side of the city.

[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.260]
Westchester County.

[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.260]
It was close to the Greenwich, Connecticut.

[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.580]
Oh, okay.

[00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.400]
God.

[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.760]
Well, I don't know that much about, you know, other than Manhattan and the Bronx,

[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.580]
that's enough for me.

[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.460]
That's right.

[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.500]
Okay, well, I'm Queens.

[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.560]
I'm enjoying your sound.

[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.680]
And Fire Island.

[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.820]
Okay, have a wonderful day.

[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.480]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.200]
Let me ask you this.

[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:10.400]
Yeah.

[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.660]
Does anybody at your high school listen to this show?

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.580]
I almost had station, but that would have been on the field.

[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.040]
I don't push it.

[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.900]
I honestly don't know.

[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.420]
I'm my friend, though, who I take up in the morning, but, you know,

[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.020]
that's not because of the situation.

[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.380]
No, but that's a good start.

[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.300]
That's a good start.

[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.420]
Well, ask around.

[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:27.820]
Yeah.

[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.480]
Oh, okay.

[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.300]
See what you can find out and report back.

[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:30.920]
Oh, okay.

[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.860]
Okay, have a great day.

[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.560]
Bye-bye.

[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.020]
Great.

[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.780]
Captain Dave says he's getting a lot of hangups today.

[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.240]
A lot of little cranky types out there in this Monday.

[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:37.660]
You're right.

[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.560]
It does happen after the dolphins lose.

[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:39.780]
That's right.

[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.300]
This town just goes bananas.

[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.320]
You go into a restaurant.

[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:43.980]
That's what he wants.

[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.460]
Yeah, waiters will be snarly, you know, and you go through, like, say,

[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.140]
Windixie.

[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.140]
And the waiters are only snarly after the dolphins lose.

[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.660]
I thought that was like an everyday occurrence.

[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.160]
Well, more snarly.

[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.300]
And you go through, like, a checkout counter at Windixie and the checkout girl,

[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.360]
you know, will be just in a hospital.

[00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.540]
Possible.

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:00.360]
Yeah.

[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:00.620]
Yeah.

[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.200]
Yeah.

[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.740]
For 48 hours.

[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.980]
We still haven't had a call from anybody from Piper High, 550, 90, 490.

[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.860]
You don't think we'll get one?

[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.980]
Yeah, we'll get one.

[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.340]
I think it's a good possibility.

[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.860]
It'll be a good friendly caller, or they'd be uptighted unfriendly.

[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.920]
Well, we'll have to see.

[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.540]
We're trying to mend our fences.

[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.100]
We're trying to be real friendly with it.

[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.440]
I'll under their radio stations back on the air over there.

[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.060]
K-P-X.

[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:21.860]
K-P-X.

[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.400]
Unlikely.

[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:22.940]
Big 88.

[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.460]
Unlikely.

[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.660]
And if it is, we'll take care of it.

[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.700]
Oh, look at that.

[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.140]
Another deadline there.

[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.380]
Boy, these callers this morning, great.

[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.500]
You guys on a scale of zero minus infinity, you know what I'm saying?

[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.820]
I mean, like you guys are pathetic this morning.

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.340]
There they go.

[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:37.820]
Okay.

[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.480]
Now they're all flashing.

[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.400]
They want to be beaten and whipped, you know what I'm saying?

[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:40.960]
Oh, I know.

[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.320]
They want to be flage-related.

[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.640]
That's what this town is all about.

[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.840]
630 on Zeta 4.

[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.560]
The Neil Rogers show.

[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.460]
Oh, that was excellent.

[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.280]
Boy, you can cut a promo for us anytime.

[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.060]
Okay, here we go.

[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.200]
This is what they want.

[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.140]
All our striker likers in the Zeta audience.

[00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.720]
Here you go.

[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.100]
The moment you've been waiting for.

[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:02.460]
Okay.

[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.920]
For anybody who's been listening to the station must be in a little SNM anyway, right?

[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.740]
Let's take our first call on the Bocala and they just called, but we're desperate.

[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.120]
Hello.

[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.460]
Good morning, this is Bocala.

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.660]
Hey, Bocala, how you be?

[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.440]
Oh, I'd be good.

[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.140]
I'd be real good.

[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:14.820]
I was like the maker.

[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.360]
No, a con-entering last statement.

[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.240]
Those weren't the dolphins.

[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.880]
Those are guys dressed up like them.

[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:19.260]
Yeah.

[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.360]
Yeah, they weren't.

[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.460]
Well, that's a new fetish, now there.

[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.220]
But there's a whole bunch of guys dressing up like football players, you know?

[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.640]
Yeah, the fans keep getting away, though.

[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.020]
Yeah.

[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.400]
Oh, it's like they're making a comment.

[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.360]
I was trying to call for lessons last week.

[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.660]
But you may have mentioned about Dale Reven to Matt Nox.

[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.660]
Yeah, they're hitting me.

[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.980]
If they hit me, Matt Nox, the face gets worse as Dale Reven gets better.

[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.020]
Yeah, they're doing like skin grafts.

[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.100]
I think they're doing some medical regi-ship like Dory and Gray.

[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.340]
I think Michael Jackson is involved in that somehow.

[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:43.960]
Could be.

[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.380]
Well, enjoy the show with the fun and day.

[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.120]
Okay, have a wonderful day, sir.

[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.860]
I'm trying to bet.

[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.140]
Okay, because it could be the last one.

[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.340]
631 on Zeta 4, we don't want to create panic and chaos.

[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.900]
Why did Captain Dave just close the door and lock us in?

[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.540]
Is he trying to tell us something?

[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.260]
I think maybe.

[00:14:59.460 --> 00:14:59.900]
Is this it?

[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.160]
Well, we had a pretty good time here for six days.

[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.560]
I agree.

[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.840]
They said don't go buy a house, don't do anything rash.

[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.840]
And I think they meant what they said.

[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.200]
Brown would count a good morning.

[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.660]
This is our piper called you watch.

[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:12.940]
Hello.

[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:13.780]
You?

[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.300]
Hi.

[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:14.860]
Morning.

[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.500]
Yeah, you don't sound like you're from piper.

[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.500]
No, not from piper.

[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.780]
You sound like the pied piper.

[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.040]
And I'm high.

[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.220]
Miami high.

[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:20.720]
Yes.

[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:21.100]
What?

[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:21.960]
1802?

[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:22.840]
61.

[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.620]
Okay.

[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.240]
Well, let's say 61.

[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.680]
The dolphins play like the dolphins, no matter who's wearing the suit.

[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:28.200]
Yeah.

[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.900]
They lost to the sea hawks who was the dolphin.

[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.480]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.180]
They have no pass rush and no secondary.

[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.060]
So it's still a dolphin.

[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.340]
You know, the same thing.

[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.000]
Absolutely the same thing.

[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.060]
My wife, Leroy, is dying to hear for realty.

[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.220]
Your wife, Leroy?

[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:40.540]
Yes.

[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:42.780]
CB.

[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.400]
CB has the lighter shade.

[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.700]
Her name be Leroy.

[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.180]
Yeah, she be ill in today, sir.

[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.280]
Is that what you try to tell us?

[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.700]
Yeah, she be behind it.

[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.940]
Oh, great.

[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.520]
In other words, you're, this is a request, right?

[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.400]
Is that all we're going to do on the show is have requests?

[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:57.740]
Yes.

[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.760]
We're going to have dumb requests.

[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.860]
Why should this show be different than the previous one?

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.920]
Yeah, than a one on the AM.

[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.940]
Where all the FM listeners are tuning madly to wins.

[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.840]
You know, I mean, who the hell is that broad kidding?

[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.440]
You know, the tea lady.

[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.760]
Is that it, sir?

[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.320]
Did you just, did you expire?

[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:12.880]
No.

[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.760]
Well, I have never heard a call.

[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.280]
Just go so dead in all my life as you did.

[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.120]
I know it's early in the morning.

[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.320]
You can't keep up with this, right?

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:20.760]
No.

[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.520]
Going too fast.

[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.900]
Okay, listen, have a great day.

[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.300]
And we'll see you tomorrow.

[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.760]
Tomorrow will be Monday for you, okay?

[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.560]
Okay.

[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.420]
Okay, that was good.

[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.960]
That time I remembered Gloria.

[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.820]
How are you doing, Gloria?

[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.020]
I'm G-L-O-R-A.

[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.280]
She came up to me in the brown morning yesterday in the patio.

[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.700]
And she said, I'm mad at you.

[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.380]
And I said, for what?

[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.140]
She said, you don't say good morning to me in the morning.

[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.720]
And I said, look at her like, who the hell are you?

[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:40.960]
Huh?

[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.740]
Vogue off, lady.

[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.000]
Now she was nice, Gloria.

[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.760]
And she watched the news.

[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.500]
That's the news.

[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.720]
We look out in the red one area.

[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.060]
And the hotel is very pretty.

[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.400]
But we live in the middle of the birthplace, Larry.

[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:52.800]
Yeah.

[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.360]
And the helicopter comes flying in about 230 yesterday afternoon.

[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:56.960]
Clarence.

[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.720]
15 minutes later, Jonathan Bloss, our layover of the plate.

[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.220]
Well, that's that Don Johnson story that we did earlier.

[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:03.820]
Yeah.

[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.220]
Yeah.

[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.040]
I'm the one that's, I'm the one that call the police.

[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.300]
I didn't know you had it on.

[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.640]
I just got up a little while ago.

[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:09.960]
Yeah.

[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.480]
I got up the I.M.C.

[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.580]
Because when we found out it was Don Johnson out there,

[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.840]
we figured we needed some power to get him out of here.

[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.200]
Yeah.

[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.720]
Stan would be out there in a minute.

[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.360]
That's right.

[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.640]
Did Stan come out?

[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:22.680]
No.

[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.440]
Oh, goodness.

[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.260]
I have to get the nice man's name that came out and interviewed us and everything else.

[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:28.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.160]
Yeah.

[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.060]
Bunky buyer, yeah.

[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:30.520]
No.

[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.480]
What was his birthday?

[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.560]
Bunky.

[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.080]
Bunky.

[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.240]
Smunky Bunky.

[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.480]
Newhall anyway.

[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.040]
Yeah.

[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.940]
I heard your voice on Debbie INZ this morning when I was driving to work.

[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.580]
Oh, you did.

[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.300]
Sure it is.

[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:41.960]
I was online.

[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.840]
I'm going to have to listen.

[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.260]
Yeah.

[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.280]
That was, it was just incredible.

[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.120]
Now my baby has a new thing.

[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.680]
It was incredibly late.

[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.460]
When she goes to bed last night.

[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:50.740]
Yeah.

[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.340]
It was mom and scared of Don Johnson.

[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.280]
We should get that on tape for Stan show.

[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.400]
The entire afternoon in the bathroom.

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.300]
Really?

[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.600]
According to the bodyguard.

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.380]
Hmm.

[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240]
Now what does that tell you?

[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.860]
Probably listen to Stan show Santa miss.

[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.520]
It has that effect on a lot of us.

[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:09.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.160]
I just want to come.

[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:12.680]
Say hello.

[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.240]
Okay.

[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.340]
Have a great day.

[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.860]
Yeah.

[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.300]
Yeah.

[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:13.300]

[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.240]
Yeah.

[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:20.440]

[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:20.500]
Yeah.

[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:23.320]
Yeah.

[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:23.320]

[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:23.320]

[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:23.540]
Yeah.

[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:23.540]

[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:23.540]

[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:23.540]

[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:23.540]

[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:23.540]

[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:23.560]
Yeah.

[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.560]

[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:23.560]

[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.100]
Yeah.

[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.460]
Yeah.

[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:24.960]
Yeah.

[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.680]
Yeah.

[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:26.780]
Yeah.

[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:26.780]

[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.620]
Yeah.

[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.080]
Yeah.

[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.060]
Yeah.

[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:30.940]
Yeah.

[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.580]
Yeah.

[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:33.640]

[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:37.980]
Yeah.

[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:37.980]

[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:37.980]

[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:38.320]

[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:38.320]

[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:40.380]
Yeah.

[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:40.980]

[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:41.480]
Yeah.

[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:42.520]
Yeah.

[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:45.840]

[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:45.840]

[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:45.840]

[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:45.840]

[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:45.840]

[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:48.960]
Yeah.

[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.400]
Yeah.

[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:49.940]
Yeah.

[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:50.360]
Yeah.

[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:50.360]

[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:50.360]

[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.520]
Yeah.

[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.140]
Yeah.

[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:56.380]
Yeah.

[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.380]

[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.560]
Yeah.

[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:57.840]

[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:57.900]
Yeah.

[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:57.920]
Yeah.

[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.840]
Yeah.

[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:00.980]
Yeah.

[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.600]
Yeah.

[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.080]
Oh, good bye.

[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.000]
It's so much fun coming to you.

[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.660]
Thank you very much.

[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.280]
Yeah.

[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.140]
Yeah!

[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.520]
Sorry.

[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.040]
Bye.

[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.300]
I went right down the street, I was black and white,

[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.740]
five and four to work TV said.

[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.160]
You got ripped off, man.

[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.460]
My brother and uncle get it for your own sales.

[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.000]
Give me the money and I'll buy the TV set, man.

[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:35.380]
All right.

[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.760]
Hey, man, come on, baby.

[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.820]
I just wanted to let Glenn know that the fog has burnt away.

[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:40.760]
Oh, yeah, right.

[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.220]
Yeah.

[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.380]
And the other thing is, what would you like in the morning

[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.120]
at 6.30?

[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.420]
Give me your order.

[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.900]
What do you mean, what would I like?

[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.760]
No, listen, we appreciate it, but we can't do with the food.

[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.740]
You know, we just got to stop.

[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.560]
I got to stop.

[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.040]
It's too.

[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.000]
Why not?

[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.460]
Because I can't.

[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.720]
I'm like diabetic and I weigh 800 pounds and we got to stop.

[00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.960]
Down the hill, you're not that big.

[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.180]
I'm telling you, I got to stop doing this.

[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.600]
I mean, do I have to beg and play to your wonderful guy?

[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.580]
We appreciate it, but you're killing me.

[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.360]
You're not that big.

[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.680]
You see this man doesn't want to listen to reason.

[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.280]
So you understand?

[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.680]
So you ever hear of diabetes, you ever hear

[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.500]
like little little things like amputations and blindness

[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.160]
and little stuff like that, you know?

[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:17.560]
All right.

[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.120]
We'll make some special for you that way.

[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.540]
Yeah, right.

[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.260]
Like nothing.

[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.280]
We don't want any food in here in the morning.

[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:22.640]
OK.

[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.220]
I don't feel good when I eat in the morning.

[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:24.700]
OK.

[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.900]
Is that because Peter?

[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.620]
Is that OK?

[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.200]
No.

[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.840]
Bye, Peter.

[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.120]
We want to hear it.

[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:31.880]
Does want to hear it.

[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.160]
Now, there's a classic example.

[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.920]
I beg these people to stop for speeding up a meal.

[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.700]
And they won't do it now.

[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.680]
It's painful.

[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:45.680]
Oh, sorry.

[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.500]
Oh, wait, didn't you have line two up there?

[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.820]
Oh, hi, Captain Dave.

[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.240]
I'm sorry.

[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:49.700]
I'm sorry.

[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.200]

[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.640]
OK, are you?

[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.340]
Well, why does it say two on the board?

[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.300]
It says two.

[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:53.640]
Hello.

[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.320]
Aren't you lucky?

[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.260]
You got out by accident.

[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.000]
I did.

[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.260]
Huh?

[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.020]
I've been trying to call for a while now.

[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.860]
Well, it's your lucky day.

[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.480]
It is.

[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:01.900]
Yeah.

[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.140]
Who is this, please?

[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:03.600]
Neil.

[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.400]
Neil.

[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.080]
Yes, does that mean anything to you?

[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.280]
Yes.

[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.080]
It does mean something to me.

[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.920]
Does it ring a bell?

[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:11.600]
Yes.

[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.320]
Good.

[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.260]
As a matter of fact, I am not very happy with the change

[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.140]
in the morning, so.

[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.000]
Well, that's tough.

[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.400]
I know it's tough.

[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:19.780]
Yeah.

[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.000]
Because I think you are very insulting.

[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.440]
Yeah.

[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.740]
Well, I think you're a douchebag.

[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.700]
How do you like that?

[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.280]
You get off on insulting other people.

[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:30.620]
Yeah.

[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.640]
So what are you listening for?

[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.340]
It's already 840 in the morning.

[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:33.740]
How come?

[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.300]
What time did you get up today?

[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.320]
I got up at 6 o'clock in the morning.

[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.380]
How come you're still listening, my douchebag, friend?

[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.060]
I have not the listening to the radio think 6 o'clock in the morning.

[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.460]
What time did you turn it on?

[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.600]
What time did you turn it on?

[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.800]
My hostile hysterical lunatic, friend?

[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.440]
Listen to me, young man.

[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:50.980]
Young man.

[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:51.920]
How old are you?

[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.120]
How old are you?

[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.120]
I am, I am, I am.

[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:55.380]
I am.

[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:55.460]
I am.

[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:55.740]
I am.

[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.900]
I am.

[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:56.980]
I am.

[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:56.980]

[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:56.980]

[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:03.000]
I am 36 years old.

[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.260]
I am older than you are, so don't call me young man.

[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.060]
You old douchebag?

[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:06.860]
Yes.

[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.480]
I think you are very insulting.

[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:08.900]
Right.

[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:09.740]
Okay.

[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.240]
Yeah.

[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.260]
And I used to listen to data for it.

[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.320]
I keep trying again.

[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.020]
It again.

[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.300]
You keep trying it again.

[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.580]
Well, the practice club has gone.

[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.140]
It's history.

[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.040]
It's a revaderich.

[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.340]
Okay.

[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.320]
If you were filled out your diary, they'd still be on the air.

[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.360]
You sick old bag, you pathetic old douche.

[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.580]
She was nice when she gave diet to the phone.

[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.020]
Yeah, we put her on by accident.

[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.700]
It was an accident.

[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.180]
All right.

[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.160]
I didn't realize what kind.

[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.860]
A near fatality.

[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:34.980]
Hard County.

[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.260]
Hello.

[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.700]
What kind of you after the car, damn telephone?

[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.380]
Okay.

[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.160]
Hey, I was just listening to you talking to Mrs. Doucebag.

[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.420]
What kind of language is that?

[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.280]
I don't want to talk to you.

[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.960]
You're just disgusting, vulgar old man.

[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.480]
Now we're getting there.

[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.160]
Now we're getting the kind of calls we want.

[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:48.660]
The old meal.

[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.000]
Yeah.

[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.220]
Yeah, we're getting the old callers.

[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.960]
They don't put these old parts on the air.

[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.420]
Would you please?

[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:54.860]
Lost.

[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.620]
This is this is data.

[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.280]
This is FM.

[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.240]
We don't want you 90-year-old geriatric douchebag con here.

[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:01.720]
Get lost.

[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.620]
You know what I mean?

[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.080]
They're the ones.

[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.320]
Yeah, they were hostile to me.

[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.880]
And all of a sudden they get upset with me.

[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.360]
I get these horrible letters and death threats.

[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.120]
And you know, you miserable, no good scumbrain, mong head.

[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:13.520]
Boy.

[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.200]
And of course, part of that's probably true.

[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.780]
But who the hell are they to make judges about me, right?

[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:18.700]
Say hello.

[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.360]
Hello, hello, Neil.

[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.060]
Hello.

[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:21.980]
How are you?

[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.340]
I'm fine, darling.

[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.200]
How are you?

[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:24.980]
Wonderful.

[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.000]
Isn't it a great day, darling?

[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:27.720]
Wonderful.

[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.000]
The frog is left to tell Glam.

[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.920]
Yeah, he's full of fog.

[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:32.860]
Oh, I know.

[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:33.520]
I know.

[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:34.680]
By the way, the man.

[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:35.700]
Wait a minute.

[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.660]
Wait a minute.

[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.320]
Wait a minute.

[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.480]
The White House story was old too.

[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.600]
Casper Wine Brain has been on TV giving all the details of what's going on.

[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.160]
And you're sitting here reading what you're probably going to do again in the 10 minutes,

[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.980]
reading this old stuff.

[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:49.780]
It's true.

[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.240]
He's still on television, but what is Glam know?

[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:52.860]
Nothing.

[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.760]
What on playing him?

[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.360]
Play in our newsroom here, man.

[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.860]
No wonder this station is like a, it's like a stepchild.

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.660]
You know, we got all this equipment that doesn't work.

[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.100]
We can't get any of the news.

[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.840]
The phones are like a joke.

[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.600]
You know, we're going to shape this place up real quick, you know?

[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.680]
You're real, darling.

[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.560]
I know you will.

[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.880]
You can say it again, honey.

[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:10.960]
Listen, darling.

[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.580]
Whenever you play something, could you do something for me?

[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.120]
For all the blue spots in the audience.

[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.300]
That's because you maybe talk like Bobba.

[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.940]
I miss her voice a lot.

[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.220]
Barbara.

[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.160]
Wonder what happened.

[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.600]
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:24.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.580]
The peppermint, yeah.

[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.140]
Yeah.

[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.120]
She's around somewhere.

[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.460]
She'll need a couple of words.

[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.140]
Okay.

[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.360]
She'll be around somewhere.

[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.480]
Okay, darling.

[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:31.820]
Bye.

[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.120]
Okay.

[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.500]
Have a wonderful day.

[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.560]
Love to her.

[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.900]
That was my favorite call, the whole program right there.

[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.160]
Remember Phoenix, yeah.

[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:39.980]
Is this a class?

[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.460]
The first grade class one.

[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.320]
It's a Zeta studio.

[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.180]
Oh, my gosh.

[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:45.900]
Are they going to learn a lot?

[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.800]
What school are they from?

[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.860]
It's not a broadcasting school.

[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:49.260]
I don't know.

[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.380]
Found a school of broadcasting.

[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.720]
They don't want to say what school?

[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.920]
What school are you from?

[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:56.640]
School of faculty.

[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:58.440]
What?

[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:58.720]
What?

[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.020]
What?

[00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.100]
What?

[00:25:59.100 --> 00:25:59.840]
What are you talking about?

[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.600]
It's just, just radio.

[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.180]
Sacramento.

[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.280]
Sacramento.

[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.320]
It's a Catholic school.

[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:04.960]
Oh, okay.

[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.420]
Oh, the Archbishop sent these guys over here to a monitor show.

[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:08.980]
Okay.

[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.360]
These are little midget priests over here.

[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.600]
I'm not going to get the guard.

[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.240]
Yeah, one's smoking a joy, I noticed.

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.220]
Unbelievable.

[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.700]
I have a great day.

[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.260]
Feel better.

[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.320]
And you probably back in school in a couple of weeks.

[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.120]
I give it about two more weeks.

[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.520]
Okay.

[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.200]
All right, bye.

[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:23.700]
Take it easy.

[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.760]
My kind of student point.

[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.460]
I mean, I don't want to encourage people to be like.

[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.340]
But too much of a good thing is too much.

[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.180]
Oh.

[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.800]
Is, is need register, see bird health show.

[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:33.560]
Yeah.

[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.520]
This is not a Canadian.

[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:38.620]
Is C4 in Monday?

[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.380]
Is C4 in Monday?

[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:41.500]

[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:41.720]
Yeah.

[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.420]
Yeah, yeah, right.

[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:42.800]
Sure.

[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.840]
I'm going to put that on the air.

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.980]
That's our first sticky from Buckeye, I think.

[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.740]
That was neat.

[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.060]
Yeah.

[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.200]
If we can't understand it, pal, it's not going on the air.

[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:50.780]
I don't understand.

[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.760]
Like, no speaking English, no speaking on this show.

[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.020]
Now, this is better when you hang up on people.

[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:56.760]
We get more calls.

[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.040]
Yeah.

[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.200]
Like that, that bitch.

[00:26:59.340 --> 00:26:59.520]
Oh.

[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.080]
That call from where was she from?

[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:01.760]
I don't know.

[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.360]
Those kids are out of there, aren't they?

[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:04.840]
Are they out of there?

[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:05.920]
Yeah.

[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.080]
I think there's still a couple hiding in the turn.

[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.600]
Well, like I said, that bitch they've called me for, okay?

[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.300]
She really was.

[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.780]
She was disgusting and made my whole day.

[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.920]
She just realized that her call was one of the most productive

[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.760]
of the entire show.

[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:18.100]

[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.060]
It added like kind of a little spark to the show today.

[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.540]
And if anybody needed it, Broward County, hello.

[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.600]
Oh, Neil, how can you say those nasty things?

[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.260]
Is this a lawyer?

[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.280]
This must be a bang boy from public.

[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.460]
This is a lawyer.

[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.000]
Yeah.

[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.840]
One is Diaz, what's Mark's do?

[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.540]
Is this Mr. Carroyo?

[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.500]
I'm Mr. Carroyo.

[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.260]
K-Pasta.

[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.500]
Mr. Raya is listening to us.

[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.420]
K-Pasta, what's that?

[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.920]
K-Pasta, what's that?

[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.180]
What's Mastu?

[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.220]
Born as Telfin in your case, I know.

[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.060]
Yeah, I don't know, Neil.

[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.720]
What the hell are you doing on FM?

[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.660]
I mean, it's really nice, but you know, my boss refused

[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.600]
to put it at their radio in the truck.

[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.220]
Well, tell your boss he's a cheap jerk.

[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.180]
That was good.

[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:00.620]
Yeah, I know.

[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.180]
I thought that'd not do it again.

[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.220]
You'd blame me out there?

[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.000]
Sure.

[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.820]
I'm sorry, it means that.

[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.120]
Are those kids still in there?

[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.720]
Look at Peter, his eyeballs are rolling like a pinball machine.

[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.860]
I am fully aware of that.

[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:14.420]
Just relax.

[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.220]
You know what, play money by pink Floyd if you don't watch it.

[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.100]
And now I heard that.

[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.400]
I'm coming to work this morning and we're playing some record about it.

[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.760]
Let me give you every inch of my lover.

[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.920]
So what is that all about?

[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.340]
You know what?

[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.480]

[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.380]
