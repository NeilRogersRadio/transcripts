[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]
In fact, maybe we'll just take calls for a while from people in mobile phones.

[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.780]
How long do you think we can make that last?

[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.220]
Till about 20 after?

[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.900]
Quarter after?

[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.440]
About 10-13.

[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.320]
But don't call yet because we haven't really said anything yet, right?

[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.420]
Well, although if you want to, that's okay with me because of 35 cents a minute.

[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.220]
Look at all the money we can make for the phone company.

[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.560]
So if there are any of you guys, because I know that we only have one woman who's got a mobile phone,

[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.540]
what a sexist thing that whole business is right about mobile phones.

[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.040]
The men, all the yuppies and all the soothes have the mobile phones, the males, the women's soothes,

[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.520]
they haven't got anything, which is really bizarre.

[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.760]
I don't know what the hell that's all about.

[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.560]
But anyway, one of the other things I really wanted to get into, how many people in the audience just finished watching Donahue this morning.

[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.300]
And I think he taped that about a week ago and I correct something like that a few days ago in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.360]
And boy, I'm telling you just what we need more great publicity, right?

[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.440]
America continues to look down upon us and I'm doing look down and realize what a bunch of aberrant douchebags there are in this community.

[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220]
I mean, we have gotten more per square inch than you're going to find anywhere.

[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.120]
All those brilliant businessmen in Fort Lauderdale, man, they're just brilliant.

[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.360]
Where did everybody go? What happened?

[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.720]
You know, they don't want young people.

[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.500]
They certainly don't want very old people.

[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.200]
They want the perfect demographic.

[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.040]
They want the, it's kind of like the contest they were running.

[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.640]
You know, they want the perfect body and the perfect demographic and all the perfect body parts and how big they're supposed to be.

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640]
And they expect them to all be in the right place.

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.560]
And if you're not in that category, man, don't come to Fort Lauderdale because we don't want you here.

[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.660]
That's the bottom line.

[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:37.320]
And that's why next year in the spring, you know, you'll be able to drive cannonballs up and down A1A because you're not going to be anybody there, including most of those business people because they're all going to be out of business.

[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.160]
Do you think there's anybody in the audience here this morning or are they in a coma again?

[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.060]
I was planning on doing a good show today, but if they're going to be a lethargic trust me, we'll save the good stuff for tomorrow.

[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.120]
And by the way, speaking of tomorrow, is that going to be some kind of a show?

[00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:02.140]
We have that genius from the FCC up in Washington is going to be on the phone with us the first hour and is going to give us the outcome of today's hearings on the Howard Stern Show.

[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.820]
And there are two other shows that are under investigation because of their content or language or something like that.

[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.620]
And we're going to find out about that tomorrow.

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.740]
And also we're going to have delineated for us.

[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.100]
Is that a big enough word for Taffy?

[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.800]
They're going to delineate the guidelines for what we can and cannot say on the year.

[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.700]
That's from 10 to 11.

[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.580]
And then from 11 to 2, we're going to say everything that they tell us that we can say.

[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:35.460]
And I mean that in other words, this guy better really let it all hang out from 10 to 11 because anything that he says is verboten, fine, we'll write it down and we'll put it on the ceiling here and we'll make sure that nobody says it.

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.260]
But anything shy of that, good luck to him.

[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.040]
I think those people in the mobile phone should be calling now, don't you?

[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.640]
No, I'm not asking you to check because there's nobody calling.

[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.300]
But I think they're really they ought to be on the line.

[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:58.960]
The only problem it's going to be with this is that if we put them all on hold, oh I see, I never thought about that because most of our bunch of cheap skates anyway, they just a bunch of sueds trying to impress everybody, but they never use those phones.

[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.100]
But if we put them on hold, then it starts running up at 35 cents a minute while around a hole.

[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.520]
Never thought about that.

[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.840]
Okay, what we might do is if you're in a mobile phone this morning and you want to comment on any of these things that Liberace or on the spring break or Donna,

[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.680]
hear anything you want to talk about or you just want to call in and make a fool of yourself, you can call and just let the line keep ringing.

[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.460]
How's that?

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.160]
We'll do it like Larry King.

[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.900]
Only I'm not quite as ugly as Larry, but we'll try to work on it anyway. We'll use a good imagination.

[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.260]
By the way, did you see Jicke's column the other day in the Miami News about how Larry King may be audio in May in the South Florida?

[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.980]
This is his hometown.

[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.320]
And evidently now that IOD is dropping his show, it would appear that nobody else is going to pick it up.

[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.660]
And that's because he owes everybody here so much money that they don't want anything to do with him. It's incredible.

[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.780]
Okay, let me see those. Look at that. They're flashing like a Hanukkah bush. I can't believe it.

[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.440]
Let me give the numbers out. And what we'll do is we'll answer them one at a time. Now what if they're not in mobile phones?

[00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.820]
Would it just hang up on them? Good. Kyle said absolutely. We're just going to hang up on them and get rid of them.

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.500]
So here the numbers. And again, if you're in a mobile phone, you let it keep ringing. And then what we're ready to get to you?

[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.300]
Boy, this could be a whole new format for a new show on this station.

[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.320]
624-0191. See, I was really impressed because all the lines were ringing. Now everybody in Date County disappeared again.

[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.440]
624-0191. And it's powered 764-0707.

[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.000]
I mean, can you follow this? There's just a little too complicated for you folks. I know that I have to draw a diagram.

[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.300]
And it's hard to do on the radio. Look at that. All the lines are flashing there. It's incredible.

[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.660]
And I'm going to tell you if this is not Liberace, then I'm more sure it's perfect. No question about it.

[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.020]
I can't believe that picture. It's unbelievable. Okay, call her online too. Says he's on a mobile phone. Is that true, sir?

[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.240]
Yes. Okay, and Kyle doesn't believe you. All right. I'll see you guys in a moment.

[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.960]
I'm trying to, you know, for a lot of day, I was sort of running people out, running business out.

[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.680]
They had a plan show here a couple of weeks ago. I tried to call you. No, no vitamins, sir. The plan shows on WIOD on another weekend.

[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.300]
I know. It's your program. I understand the radio doesn't change. It was just something else.

[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.860]
Anyway, they had a plan show at World Memorial, and they were, you know, having people come over and you buy plants, and you put them right here, house, your apartment, etc.

[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:20.000]
The city of Fort Waterdale has come over to where I live, and they say that you can't put any plants outside your apartment or your home or anything like that. You don't have anything outside of your door.

[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:29.260]
How about a welcome, Matt? Is that also illegal? I don't know where they'd like that. That's only all right. If it says kids go away, then it's okay.

[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:41.600]
In other words, you're delivering your apartment like death row. Nothing outside your cell, not exactly. In fact, what they're doing instead of placemats outside, they're having print-as-rushed mats outside the door so that if anybody plans on going out, they'll only do it once.

[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:52.120]
That's it. Well, I had, as a matter of fact, along that line, so that people wouldn't break into, we live up on the second floor, and there's nobody to case any attention in the building that we live in.

[00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:11.240]
I had some metals shelves that were fit up against the wall that I had my plants on, and the purpose, one of the main purposes, was that they couldn't break into the window. In other words, the shelves would be in front of the window, and the plants would be on the shelves, and it would be somewhat discouraging or rattling around with them, which caused some disturbance.

[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:19.640]
Are you really spending $0.35 a minute to tell me this, sir? Absolutely. Well, I'll tell you, you're really a hell of a big time spender. You're the kind of guy they need in Fort Waterdale.

[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:28.720]
Well, I feel so. The city is running me out. I've lived here 27 years, and I feel that living in Fort Waterdale today is like living in that determined a year ago.

[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:44.800]
Exactly. No question about it. Exactly. And I think, even when you talk to people I went to Orlando this weekend, and people there, you couldn't move. The traffic defenders, the kids in the streets were loaded, the citizens were burming.

[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.780]
And I think what it is, is the business that they run away from here has gone to other places such as Daytona or Orlando.

[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.980]
Sir, did you say Orlando didn't you read Bob Rubens' column in the Harold Sports section this morning?

[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:03.680]
Poor Bob is all upset. Orlando's Miami bashing is Mickey Mouse, he says. Poor Bob. They're picking on us, Bobby.

[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.340]
I think this is such a bush-league town here. It's unbelievable. And Bob Rubens epitomizes everything that's bush-league about South Florida.

[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:19.420]
He's just like in Pope. He likes to think that he's writing in New York, and here he is in Miami, where all we have is the dolphins. He likes to think he's a real sports writer.

[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:31.660]
I pick up, I'm a radio freak. I listen to the news on the radio. I don't really read the papers. I must say that I'm not a sports fan. I don't see a number of good sports tonight. I mean, I could watch a fighter or something.

[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.720]
What does that mean to you? You used to skip Jim Klasalad. What are you trying to tell us?

[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:46.340]
I'm not a sports person. I don't read the paper. I listen to the news. I listen to the news. Whenever I want to hear, I watch it on the news media. And I catch moans, but on the radio.

[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.020]
Even late at night, through 3-4 o'clock in the morning, I'm listening to...

[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.060]
What does this have to do with the price of peas and forlotterdales? What does that mean? Why are you trying to do that?

[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.080]
I didn't want to be a dead horse. I didn't want to be a dead horse. I didn't want to be a dead horse.

[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:58.900]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.500]
You're sure you're doing a hell of a job of it. I'll tell you that. I mean, you're at the top of a stretcher. You're going in reverse.

[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.140]
Are you going to be at the quarter pole any second, sir?

[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.880]
I can tell. You're like some of the horses I've been on at Calder.

[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.800]
Don't you ever pick any winners, sir?

[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.500]
Every now and then, I think twice last summer was pretty good.

[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.740]
When you go to the darksack, the horse track, or high-rise, there's no winners. There's no winners.

[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.940]
If you like to gamble and you have money, you want to go for entertainment. I don't think there's many winners.

[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:30.620]
I'm glad you're there. You sure are covering a lot of ground in a short period of time. I mean, you're really tucking all bases.

[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.300]
I think Fort Lauderdale is going to be worse than Miami.

[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.040]
Really?

[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:35.820]
Absolutely.

[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.420]
Yeah. Well, they have that new project called Graveside coming up in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.520]
I'm not aware of that.

[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.840]
Yeah, it's going to compete with Bayside. Graveside.

[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.560]
Well, I can tell you that they outbid Halendale for it.

[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.600]
If the attitude of the city of Fort Lauderdale continues, there's not going to be anybody here.

[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.180]
Okay, sir. Well, listen. I'll see you in the front porch.

[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.340]
All right. Yeah. No front porch for me. They say nothing is going on your porch. Just like Nancy's Germany. Get it out.

[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.620]
Okay. All right. Good luck, dear, sir. Austin. It's 21 minutes past 10 at WINZ. That's pretty good, huh?

[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.980]
See, this is a situation we only need one call at a time, right?

[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.220]
John Hinkley and Bonnie and Clyde in the control room.

[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.780]
Okay. I can't believe that we have a real degenerate on a phone here. Hello?

[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.880]
Hey, how you doing? Marlon, what's going on? Are you in or out?

[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.300]
Well, we're going to get in and we'll get out fast as we can.

[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.780]
All right. We're live in downtown Miami about an hour when the Spurman gets a toss, he's on with myself.

[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.380]
We're going to be passing out the happy storm.

[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.960]
So to speak, you got it. I'm a random 30 to 130.

[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.660]
Okay. Now, where's this going to be downtown?

[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.200]
Downtown Miami, all along Flagler Street around the courthouse, or up the probably farthest distance.

[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.060]
Oh, yeah. Right under that new erection downtown. You got it. Incredible.

[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.600]
And we'll probably check back with you in between the 1131 to let you know how it's going.

[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.960]
Okay. Well, Marlon, we always said around here that you couldn't get arrested, but I think you're out to disprove that today.

[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.500]
Oh, I got a feeling something's going to happen.

[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.260]
Okay. Great.

[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.800]
I'll be dressed as a giant condom.

[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.040]
Really? Yes.

[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.180]
Well, we sent Kathy Weston there to see we gave her a little instruction here the other day, so I'd watch out for her.

[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.060]
She heard she was coming.

[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:00.760]
Two fingers.

[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:01.680]
I hear you.

[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.200]
Okay, Marlon. Good luck to you.

[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:03.660]
I can tell you.

[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.220]
Okay. 25 past 10 at WINZ. There he is, Mr. Eurasperm King himself.

[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.120]
And we have a caller in line four on a mobile phone. We presume. Hello?

[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.020]
Are you there?

[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.260]
Now see a cheap skate. He probably figured we'd put him on hold.

[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:26.900]
Okay. Let me give those numbers again, because this was going to work real well, but I have a feeling like a sinking feeling in a pit of my stomach that we could have just shot the whole deal in date County 624.

[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.980]
I mean, really, this is too complicated for you, isn't it folks? It's much too complex.

[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.140]
When we don't want people in mobile phones, there are pain in the ass. They get on here.

[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.060]
You know, every now and then we got to go to them first because they lay a guilt trip on us, because it's 35 cents a minute.

[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.120]
If we put them on hold, they start getting better out of shape.

[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:50.960]
But when we invite them, when we go to extraordinary lengths and invite them and even set up a whole special deal for them on the phone, they can't figure it out.

[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.560]
Hello?

[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.400]
Hello?

[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.240]
Let me say it again. Hello, sir.

[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.700]
I think I want to speak up, sir.

[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:03.600]
Turn the radio on.

[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.640]
Oh, man, is this guy a winner? Go ahead, sir.

[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:13.960]
I have a little say on radio since the truth is, Dick Bianne, up the air in Chicago in 1964, for telling a joke that probably was pretty bad then.

[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.100]
I remember that. I remember when Dick Bianne disappeared in Buffalo at WKBW.

[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.720]
Well, he was my idol when I was in high school.

[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.340]
Really? Well, that explains your present mental states, sir.

[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:30.520]
Anyway, since I came to Florida, I, that's not what I want to say.

[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.340]
At least a truck a couple of months ago that came with an AM radio.

[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.320]
Wait a minute, you least a truck?

[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.280]
Yes, at least a truck. I put them in a minute truck.

[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.060]
What are you doing? Robbing a bank this morning, sir. What is it that you're doing?

[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.440]
Delivering plants.

[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.720]
Another plant guy. Oh, this is good. The guy from IOD must be looking for a job. Delivering plants?

[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.480]
I, at least a truck that came with an AM radio.

[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:51.920]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.140]
And since that of the Spanish, I went to the dial when that time found your shell.

[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.780]
You were destined to have been a while, this and the river since then.

[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.860]
And if it wasn't for the fact that the Wheaton company screwed me out of an AM radio,

[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.020]
I never would have discovered your shell.

[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.300]
Why are you seeing every, every dark cloud is a little silver lining.

[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.680]
Yes, and I just wanted to let you know that I'm a loyal listener.

[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.920]
And not everybody who has a mobile phone is driving in a BMW 635.

[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.100]
Exactly. Okay, we're impressed, sir.

[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.900]
There he goes. He didn't have much to say to the 28 minutes past 10 at WINZ.

[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.180]
This is going over like a lead balloon in the heat of July.

[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.500]
For a minute there was great, but you know the problem was because the phone kept ringing.

[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.680]
They all got confused. Man, you talk about dumb.

[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.560]
Those people in those cars with the mobile phones, they are so dumb.

[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.960]
Have you ever driven by one of those people?

[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.100]
And they're not paying any attention to what they're doing.

[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.220]
They don't even have time to comb their hair or do their makeup.

[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.620]
Even the guys. It's incredible. You know, they're busy with the phone.

[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.940]
And they're not talking anybody. They just want everybody else going by to watch them

[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.960]
and impress them like they're really talking to somebody on the mobile phone.

[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.980]
Like, look at me. You know, we got Glen again in a mobile phone.

[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.300]
Okay, let me give the numbers on again.

[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.180]
And let me try to explain to you ladies and gentlemen what we're doing this morning

[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.600]
just for a little bit of diversion.

[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.540]
Okay, can you understand this?

[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.700]
If you're on a mobile phone, I know there are thousands of you out there

[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.880]
because when we don't want to hear from you, you're all over the place.

[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.720]
Just dial the number and let it keep ringing.

[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.280]
It won't cost you anything.

[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.760]
That's how we're talking about.

[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.800]
Has anybody seen that picture on 9a in a hero?

[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.400]
You don't have to be in a mobile phone.

[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.540]
Let's get back to the regular show.

[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.960]
Because if I keep pushing this, the rest of the audience is going to be revolting

[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.480]
by 11 o'clock, more so than usual.

[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.760]
In Dave County, 624-0191.

[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.620]
624-0191.

[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.540]
And it's powered 764-0707.

[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.240]
I really do. I think they're all in a coma this morning.

[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.060]
Can that be possible?

[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.860]
Okay, what we're going to do.

[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.520]
We've got some Mondevani that we're going to be playing.

[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.580]
It's part of the new winds format that starts on Monday.

[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.460]
We went previewed for it a little bit early.

[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.640]
But man, you just have to be quick.

[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.140]
You have to be quick.

[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.920]
And the people here are so slow.

[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.640]
It's like they're in first gear.

[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.040]
God Almighty, I can't believe this.

[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.620]
Let me give those numbers one more time.

[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.940]
I can't believe this this morning.

[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.880]
This is embarrassing.

[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.820]
In Dave County, 624-0191.

[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.880]
Did anybody see Donahue?

[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.080]
Are your TV sets working?

[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.340]
Or is the whole audience on work release?

[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.600]
624-0191.

[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.740]
And it's powered 764-0707.

[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.180]
And I'm still waiting for Colodusa.

[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.180]
Well, I'm going to take a break because I can't deal with it.

[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.920]
Right? You want to just take a break and then we'll go home?

[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.960]
Because this audience is morning, man.

[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.960]
I'm telling you, they are really on heavy-duty drugs.

[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.160]
There's no question about it.

[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.220]
It's 1033 at WYNZ when we come back.

[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.200]
Taffy will be here.

[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.440]
Looking at this morning is fix it back there or somebody.

[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.080]
Do we have a real long mic cord?

[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.760]
Because I'm going out on strike today.

[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.820]
I really am. I need to go into the newsroom or I'm going outside

[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:42.820]
if we have one that long.

[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.480]
If we got a long mic cord, must have one back there in engineering, don't we?

[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.280]
I'm not joking. I'm serious. I'm leaving this room.

[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.600]
Because I'm not going to deal with these deadheads on the phone.

[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.660]
They're all flashing and flashing and I look down.

[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.080]
There's like two calls and then they're flashing again.

[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.200]
You know, put away the raincoat.

[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.040]
What do you pal? I mean, let's get serious here already.

[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.360]
I am not going to sit in the studio and be a prisoner of the stupid telephone.

[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.840]
I mean, just out of the clear blue again, here it is, and other Thursday.

[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.420]
And they're all in the twilight zone today.

[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.200]
We had to just pick our brains out to get a couple of calls on mobile phones.

[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.220]
And now we're going through another whole syndrome altogether.

[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.180]
Is there anybody back there in engineering?

[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.340]
I see a little light on.

[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.380]
Is that the Christopher Candle he's got on back there?

[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.080]
Is that a light bulb?

[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.480]
There's anybody back in engineering who I want to those real long mic cords.

[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.780]
And is it decent outside?

[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.080]
It seemed to me it was pretty nice when I came to work Sunday shining.

[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.880]
Maybe we could put a little chair out there in the back.

[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.220]
My watch is right on target. We'll take the log and we'll interview some of the birds in the back.

[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.520]
No, no more mobile phones. Tell the guy to get lost.

[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.140]
Is that you?

[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:41.980]
Yeah.

[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.960]
Are you on your mobile phone? We don't want to talk to you now.

[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.840]
It's 22-4-11 at WINZ.

[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.400]
Where's somebody in engineering?

[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.720]
Are we likely to be the other day?

[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.600]
When the monitors died, there's got to be somebody back there.

[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.500]
They're pretending they don't hear me because they think I'm going to do something irrational.

[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.960]
And they know better than that.

[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.140]
And I keep looking around here.

[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.400]
I think we're going to play music to find somebody in engineering with a long mic cord.

[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.660]
I know it's not at the hallmark. There's no question about that.

[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.860]
The white left town with a banana.

[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.940]
Mouth are rotten deal.

[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.540]
Found that yellow devil hiding in her purse.

[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.420]
He's cold and he's hard, but he's got a peel.

[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.840]
I hope it never happens to you.

[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.920]
Some fruit breaks your marriage into.

[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.420]
The white left town with a banana.

[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.160]
My baby slipped away.

[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.400]
The white left town with a banana.

[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.040]
I'm a jealous man.

[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.320]
Found a six-inch Latin lover.

[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.120]
Now she's a little bit more than you.

[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.120]

[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.120]

[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.120]

[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.120]

[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.120]

[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.820]
The white left town with a banana.

[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.580]
The white left town with a banana.

[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.700]
My baby slipped away.

[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:24.700]

[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.060]
My baby slipped away.

[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.640]
You're going to believe this, but nobody in here.

[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.620]
Is there anybody in this building listening to the show even Kyle has turned it off?

[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.060]
What is this all about?

[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.180]
Is this a surprise today?

[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.060]
This is like the day after income tax deadline, right?

[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.260]
This is going to get even with you.

[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.460]
I don't believe this.

[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.060]
I'm not joking around.

[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.360]
Because if there's nobody going to bring it here, I'll just get up and we'll leave dead air.

[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.040]
Don't answer the phone anymore.

[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.140]
Don't even waste your time with it.

[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.080]
I'll go back and I'll find one myself back there.

[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.620]
See, he's insisting on answering the phone.

[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.620]
He will not listen to the show.

[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.540]
It's like on a different wavelength.

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.040]
I don't think we even on the ear this morning.

[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.980]
This is a dry run.

[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.160]
I'm not going to talk to those nerds.

[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.560]
Screw them.

[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.020]
I've been waiting 35 minutes and they all just can't make up their mind.

[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.560]
They can't get their act together this morning.

[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.620]
They must have a new game or something going on.

[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.460]
I can't believe it.

[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.820]
They're not even calling, oh, you're calling engineering.

[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.520]
Excuse me.

[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.140]
Excuse me.

[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.500]
There's nobody back there.

[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.080]
They're out to lunch.

[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.000]
It's 20 to 11.

[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.920]
They're out to lunch already.

[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.320]
There really is nobody back there.

[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.720]
We've got 200 people wandering around this building.

[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.400]
Wouldn't you think there's somebody with a mic cord?

[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.440]
I mean, not everybody in a building could have had their cords tied this morning.

[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.120]
Where is one?

[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.940]
Is that an engineer?

[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.460]
Who is that?

[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.840]
Oh, no, it's not an engineer.

[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.180]
Well, it's almost an engineer.

[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.300]
He used to be until a portal at T in the board.

[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.640]
Is there anybody back there, Dan?

[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.940]
Nobody is back there?

[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.620]
Well, you can find me along my cord.

[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.320]
I mean, are you in a wrong union or something?

[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.220]
Do something constructive.

[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.280]
Boy, look how fast he's moving.

[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.780]
He just his feet are barely in motion.

[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.380]
Harrison standing in there.

[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.640]
He's in a coma this morning.

[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.480]
Look at that.

[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.600]
I can't believe this.

[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.080]
These people are all on heavy, heavy drugs today.

[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.040]
Is there anybody in the building who's alive?

[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.760]
Is there something that went on during the 1030 break that I didn't know about?

[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.040]
Man, this is incredible.

[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.240]
Is it like I'm asking for them to bring in a halivar or something?

[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.260]
Or just because we missed Purim, they're going to bring in a carton of homeontation?

[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:25.940]
Forget it.

[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.280]
They left me out on Purim.

[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.180]
They're not going to do it now.

[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.520]
How about some stale mots, is anything?

[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.520]
Boys is embarrassing.

[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.500]
We have a live studio audience this morning on work release,

[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.960]
and we can't even get a mic cord in here.

[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.880]
Got a mic cord or what?

[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.260]
Look at, oh, this is the guy with a short cord.

[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:45.860]
Get out of here.

[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.300]
Will you please?

[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.740]
We know how long your cord is.

[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.840]
Gary Lawrence comes in here with about a three-inch cord.

[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.140]
No, that's not a long cord.

[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.020]
Boy, this is the lowest budget station in America, folks.

[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.440]
W-O-F-F, yeah, I know.

[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.980]
We had to sell the mic cords to pay my salary.

[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.100]
That's going to be the next story.

[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.540]
We had to pay Neal's salary by auctioning off all of our equipment.

[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.040]
I know.

[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.580]
How about a pot of tea, at least?

[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.280]
I could spill it in the equipment here or something.

[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.980]
No, they've got a long, they don't have any back there.

[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.300]
They've got them wound up, ADR's long.

[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.640]
Come on, we used them at the hallmark.

[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.260]
No, don't, don't yank my cord.

[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.960]
Will your plays just got to be something back there?

[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.500]
Look at this, we got the whole station running around in the hallway.

[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.900]
This is the most action they've seen since I-95 bit to dust.

[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.660]
I'm telling you.

[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.840]
Since they burned all those 95 INZ bumper stickers,

[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.460]
this is the most action we've had.

[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.380]
Oh my god, look at this, a real honest-to-got engineer with a long cord.

[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.960]
We always knew you had a long cord.

[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.060]
That's what Sandy told us.

[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.800]
That's why she's in hiding.

[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.880]
She is, she's in hiding these days.

[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.420]
But here's fix it now, man.

[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.380]
I'm telling you all you took them, what?

[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.560]
15 minutes to get in here?

[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.720]
Nobody told you.

[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.100]
I know you were listening to IOD.

[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.700]
Caughters not that funny this morning.

[00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.620]
I heard him come into work.

[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.720]
He gave me all this material yesterday and said I could use it.

[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.800]
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.660]
I'll tell you what, let's take our last break a little bit ahead of time.

[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.580]
I know this is going to get somebody in traffic all upset.

[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.480]
But let's take it a little bit ahead of time,

[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.100]
and then we're going to do the whole rest of the show out in the backyard,

[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.960]
and in the hall, I'm not taking these calls today.

[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.480]
No more stits on it.

[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.420]
Let me say it again.

[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.580]
That was exciting.

[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.320]
This is...

[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.100]
Wait a minute, are we on the air?

[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.100]
All of a sudden I feel like Intendola.

[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.640]
Listen to this.

[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.160]
Does this sound as bad on the air as I hear it in my ears?

[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:30.960]
No?

[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.660]
Kill that thing.

[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.560]
Boy, that was pathetic.

[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.620]
Okay, we're up here in front of the atrium.

[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.420]
What we're going to do is go around, find out what the hell all these people do all day.

[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.020]
Look at that.

[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:39.940]
There's a bunkie buyer.

[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.740]
Come on, bunkie.

[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.740]
Let's put you on the air.

[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.100]
First, man, that'll put him to sleep.

[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.220]
That'll put him back to sleep.

[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.360]
Look at bunkie here with a big smile on his face.

[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.420]
If you had that brain transplant yet, bunkie.

[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.480]
Man, you're reading.

[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.080]
What's in the cup?

[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.580]
This is John Brown.

[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.480]
This early in the morning already, huh, man?

[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.160]
That governor will get it to you.

[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:56.980]
That's tidy, boy.

[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:57.900]
Is it really?

[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.200]
I know.

[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.780]
It looks like it just came out of there too.

[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.320]
Look at that.

[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.720]
It's just the right color bunkie.

[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.600]
What are we doing out here in the middle of all this...

[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:03.980]
Humbub.

[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:04.980]
We're taking a show outside.

[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.140]
We're hitting the road with the show.

[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.100]
Here comes Ron Harrison.

[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.000]
He's been hit before.

[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:08.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.940]
Ron Harrison's been all over the road.

[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.260]
Look at that.

[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.220]
He won't speak to us now.

[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.040]
Big sports star.

[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.840]
Look at this.

[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.060]
Look at all of these people out here.

[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.240]
We got the folks on work release.

[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.240]
We got body implied.

[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.020]
And John Hinkley over there.

[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.160]
Ron, is it...

[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.940]
Is that your house yet?

[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.080]
Have I what?

[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.280]
It's sold your house yet.

[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.120]
No, I haven't sold it.

[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.420]
You heard about your big offer in New York.

[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.420]
Yeah, I did get one.

[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.520]
And it's working.

[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.000]
I'm working on it right now, as a matter of fact.

[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100]
And we've got the house up for sale.

[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.580]
And I'm in contract negotiations here to...

[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.180]
You know who any of these people are out here, what they do?

[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.260]
I don't know the names of anybody in this building.

[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.780]
Not one soul, do I know the names.

[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.740]
They changed so fast.

[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.760]
They sent out 422 W2 forms this year.

[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:45.220]
Really?

[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.260]
I'm employees now.

[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.760]
You know, people only show twice a month here every other Friday.

[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.260]
You know, am I the only one who's...

[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.220]
Why am I worrying that you'll do...

[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.820]
You know the interesting thing about where you set phones?

[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.020]
Look what they're connected to.

[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:55.820]
Yeah, nothing.

[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.240]
Nothing.

[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.020]
You know what these people do?

[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.880]
We're going to put it inside a bunkie's brain, though.

[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.080]
You know what these people do?

[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.120]
They pick up a bank.

[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.320]
Are you still living or is your job...

[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:03.820]
Are you stuck?

[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.480]
No, I thought I'd come out here and just act like the rest of the talk showed.

[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.760]
Whether or not you're a demographic.

[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.500]
Yeah, get out of here, bunkie.

[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.360]
And we're going to use the cordless mic now.

[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:14.880]
Get your mail.

[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.260]
I'm going to go get the mail in just a second.

[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.440]
What are you doing with that, Max?

[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.500]
Stop wireless mic.

[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.300]
Yeah, I saw where you got that.

[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.640]
Okay, boy, this is going to be good.

[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.500]
But this hour's a little disorganized.

[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.020]
I think we may get rid of the phone altogether.

[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.060]
How far is this going to reach?

[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.380]
Because I want to go outside on the lawn.

[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.980]
We might go and interview Gary Lawrence before the show is over, too.

[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.460]
Is he in there?

[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.040]
Or is he working on the FM?

[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:35.720]
Oh, that's it.

[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.700]
That's the end of my cord.

[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.340]
No, we'll get you.

[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.020]
Are we going to use the micless mic?

[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.540]
That'll be good.

[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.320]
I'm going to go out on 47th Avenue with that.

[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.200]
How far will that go?

[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.360]
Find out.

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.340]
I'll find out.

[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:46.700]
Okay.

[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.640]
He's listening in two.

[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.560]
Are you hearing me?

[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.020]
It's okay.

[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.060]
Yeah, I'll be.

[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.380]
Yeah.

[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.500]
Yeah.

[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:05.760]
Yeah, we're doing.

[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:14.980]
Yeah.

[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:15.280]
Yeah.

[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.260]
Yeah.

[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:16.320]
Yeah.

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.320]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.540]
Yeah.

[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.440]
Yeah.

[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.180]
Yeah.

[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.120]
Yeah.

[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.400]

[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:22.460]

[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:23.160]
Yeah.

[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:23.640]
Yeah.

[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.180]

[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.180]

[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.240]
Yeah.

[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:24.260]
Yeah.

[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:26.500]
Yeah.

[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.300]
Yeah.

[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:27.840]
Yeah.

[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:28.400]

[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.220]
Yeah.

[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:29.500]

[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:29.500]

[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:31.560]
Yeah.

[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.080]

[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.080]

[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.800]
Yeah.

[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:35.520]
Yeah.

[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:35.520]

[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:35.940]
Yeah.

[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:35.940]

[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:36.800]
Yeah.

[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:37.860]
Yeah.

[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:38.160]
Yeah.

[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.680]
We're out here.

[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.800]
This is what it's all about.

[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.520]
Hello.

[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.620]
Good day.

[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:48.520]
Hi.

[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.080]
For how about now how far can I go?

[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.160]
We get a chair out here.

[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.300]
Can I do the show under the chair?

[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.420]
Yeah.

[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.360]
Bring a chair out here.

[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:02.820]
Now get a little.

[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:16.980]
Is it?

[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.540]
Any way you like in the sun?

[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.880]
Is it sound okay in there or what?

[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.860]
Go back to the other light.

[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.440]
This is incredible isn't it? Just like going out and doing a remote. Hello? Hello?

[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.600]
Tash? Hello? Hello? Do you hear me?

[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.180]
Look at that. There's Harrison. He just stole this one from the keys.

[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.820]
I can't believe it. Isn't it more like it?

[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.580]
I feel just like I'm on live at 5 all of a sudden. Isn't that great if we can get some long furniture out here?

[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.060]
And we can get that what's your name? That token black that they have on there on Channel 7?

[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.940]
Really? I believe it. In fact, he's working on your hood right now. He's working on your new grill.

[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.400]
Prentice is a hell of a... he's a lot of fun at a party, Ron. He works the barbecue like a master. It's incredible.

[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.180]
There he goes. He got some people out there stealing a couple of cars. This goes on every day and the wind's parking lot.

[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.860]
They got that sign that says, a jiffy car wash and you give them the keys and man, you never see it again. It's incredible.

[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:25.380]
This is great. You know all we need now? All we need are a few horse races here. A couple of windows inside we haven't made. This would be heaven.

[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.620]
Don't you think I could do the show from call to every day once it gets to be the end of May? That would be incredible.

[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:37.160]
That would be great. And the best part of it is that I have my back. Oh look at this. We even got our own little table.

[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:44.740]
I can't believe it. We got our own little studio out here in the sun. What is that for Midgets? What is that for the Mike Spindell show?

[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:51.140]
It's about a foot and a half off the ground. That's good. Thank you gentlemen. That's great. Got my log here for the next hour.

[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.780]
We're going to do something a little bit new here this morning because the audience is definitely they just don't want to participate.

[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.280]
Wait a minute Harrison. Don't go away for one second. Did you see Liberace's picture in a paper?

[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:10.700]
Come here a minute. I hope I didn't lose it. Now I want to see if I'm losing my mind or if the Marines were in a lot of trouble.

[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:17.320]
You do realize that don't you? Now wait a minute. Did you see the headline on the story in a hairless morning?

[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:23.880]
Soviets lure men into honey trap women urged to kiss and tell. Right. Now who is that looks like Liberace?

[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:30.900]
He's not dead. He's a member of the KGB. I'm telling you. I'll be darned. Well you you get into all this. We ferret it out.

[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:37.680]
The sanding still over there? Sandi nobody can find sandi. She's over with the KGB now. Sandi is the kissing and telling.

[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.660]
A honey trap. Exactly. Now do you know any human being that would get close to anything that looked like that? No. No chance.

[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:51.720]
Okay now we don't need a win guard. This is not one of those you know pansy shows where we have to have a lot of accessories. This is great.

[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:59.920]
Wouldn't you like to exactly I'll do the play by play. Wouldn't you like to be out here every morning doing the sports instead of clogged inside there with all those stuffy boring people?

[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:13.020]
We got a plant out here. Look at that. Eat your heart out live at five. Man oh man. Oh it's fakers of Channel 7. What do they know? Now all we need. All we need to have now is IOD right across the way.

[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:19.980]
And we can get all the inside scoop Mike Miller could hang out here just in case. That would be good. Look at all these people out here. Thank you.

[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:26.960]
Here's a little barrage. He's picked you back again. Great. This is good. This is going to be a great show today.

[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.900]
We're going to have three hours the likes of which nobody we got a couple of our guests are waxing that car over there.

[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:37.260]
What are you laughing about? I'm serious. They're going to be good. We're going to go out and interview some of the neighborhood up here on 47th Avenue.

[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.280]
Several of our neighbors are on work release. We're going to find out what they've been doing the last couple of months.

[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.400]
It's going to be really good. Then we're going to go up to school. You know there's no school today. Easter vacation.

[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:50.800]
And we're going to find out what really goes on inside all the schools in day county when school is out.

[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.860]
And you know the interesting part of it is you see all these people who are driving up now.

[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.220]
Who think that it's Friday. They came a day early tomorrow's payday. They don't know what the hell's going on. Do they?

[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.360]
Because they're listening to Zeta. What is it? Zeta 94 point something.

[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.040]
And they haven't got any idea what's going on. A mic muff.

[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.860]
Excuse us. Oh, that looks disgusting. That looks obscene. Is that disgusting or what?

[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.740]
Man, I'm telling you we got the most perverted engineering staff in the history of mankind.

[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:22.080]
If there's anybody from hell and now this would be good if there any folks who want to drive out and say hello.

[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.320]
We're out here in the middle of nowhere. So don't even think about it. You know.

[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.080]
But that would be great. Having drive right into the parking lot below the horn. Take a little shot or two out the window. That would be good.

[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:36.280]
Good morning. What would you like to tell us this morning? Sure. Have you been out there hustling the streets?

[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.660]
That's right. Do you need me to sign a petition? Yeah. We're trying to get Neil off the air this morning.

[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.980]
And in fact, we're getting signatures, which is the best part. We're getting a lot of signatures. Here's a little cap.

[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.320]
Look at that. Laurie is here with my animal bag. That's good. And boy, I feel...

[00:29:52.180 --> 00:30:00.540]
Come on back here a second, Ron. We want to check you out a little bit on the wind's laugh meter here this morning. Is that good? Yeah, Mark Tune has got a gun.

[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:07.560]
Mark is already used this, by the way. Have you noticed that? He didn't clean it well, but you know those PDs. They got a great sense of humor.

[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:14.400]
Or this is just like being at home. In fact, I might do the show from home tomorrow. We might kind of improve on this every day.

[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:20.280]
Why don't you do this exactly? Do the sports from Don and the Keys until they take your house away? Yeah.

[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.320]
They're coming next week. And next week they take the house. Well, you know, these radio people, man, are like a bunch of gypsies.

[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:33.280]
I've got to get going. I've got to go get drunk. Eat out lunch. Good. Well, Rinner is waiting for you down there at his bar. He says that you and he have a good time every day.

[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:39.500]
These guys that are waxing the car by the way, keep your eye on that one, because that's the one that's going to be missing in a parking lot at around one o'clock.

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.900]
No, seriously, every day we have one car that disappears in a parking lot. These guys come out with that truck and they say, man, we do a great job.

[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:51.240]
You know, like 20 bucks. And that's not bad, right? You give them 20 bucks and then they steal a car, which is really good.

[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:59.460]
It's incredible. Look at how peaceful and tranquil it is. We're going to go out in the transmitter, Shaq, by the way, in the 11 o'clock hour Rick Edwards is out there in the transmitter.

[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:09.120]
Shaq, he's nailing microphones to the ceiling out there. They're hanging upside down. He's nailing boom likes to the same. Edwards has never been the same since we left Alan Berks old studio, man.

[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:15.600]
He just has never been the same. He keeps going in there and rolling around on the floor. Alan, Alan keeps making these guttural sounds. It's incredible.

[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:22.940]
What are you doing there, Ron? Are you leaving or are you just threatening to leave? But you're just transfixed with this.

[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.200]
Good. Well, good luck to you, Ron. Have a great life and have a good time in the keys with all those fishermen and all those fakers down there.

[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:38.860]
And you're doing your show tomorrow night? You are. Where was kind of like a, oh, you saved that show. Great.

[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:48.720]
Now, I know what time it is here. What do you think I am? Some kind of a cheap skater. I got a time X watch here. Here, we're going to time. Look at the time. Time is wasting. Don't sweat it at all.

[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:58.180]
Mike Wolf is sitting there in the news booth right now. We're right on it. We've got our atomic clock going by time X. And Mike has got the headlines and we're going to go to CBS at the top of the hour.

[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:04.000]
They do the news inside there at CBS. And then we'll come back. Listen to that. That's Ron's Toyota. By the way, there he goes.

[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:12.020]
At a boy, Ron. Watch out, that one. Okay. And then we'll come back with our number two from the wins lawn at 1106.

[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:24.200]
To Neil Rogers on 94 news wins. If you'd like to call Neil, dial 7640707 in Broward or 624-0191 in day. And now here again is Neil Rogers.

[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:30.740]
I want to tell you something. This engineering department is sharp as a motsable. It's incredible. They bring a clock out here in the front lawn.

[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:38.660]
And the minute was perfect. The only problem was it was on standard time. But we don't nitpick here at WNC. We don't get into all of that.

[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:46.260]
All of those intricate excellent fix it. It's so good that it's beyond believe that's it. Bring it down to Mike Spindells level about two feet off the ground. That's perfect.

[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:56.520]
And we're broadcasting from the front lawn. And as soon as these guys get through washing the car, we're going to interview them. Is that the, is that other Mike working? Not too well.

[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:06.220]
It'll work. Because I want to kind of, but how far will I go? All the way out there like I on 47th Avenue. That would be great. I want to go out and see if I can get mugged on here today like Jerry Williams.

[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:14.060]
Look what it did for Jerry. Anyway, we got rid of all those painting-ass callers today. We had dumped the telephone. Who is this guy driving in here now? This ought to be good.

[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:20.840]
But this would give you some real insight into the business here at WNC because we've got like 400 people at work here. We don't know who the hell any of Mar.

[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.300]
And like every other Friday they show up and they collect a paycheck and we, hey, look at that guy. We saw him a couple of weeks ago.

[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.920]
Yeah, what does he do here? Nobody knows, you know, goes all through the building. And then a little bit later we'll go into Gary Lawrence's office.

[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:41.100]
And we'll hear Gary. Gary is probably getting the latest breakdown on the FM numbers. And that's why he looked like he had tears in his eyes when I saw him in the atrium this morning.

[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:49.940]
But you know, it takes a long time. Another engineer, I can't believe it. Look at this. Another engine. We got like 40 engineers here at WNC.

[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:58.220]
It's we got engineers from WSNEWS and from IOD. We have engineers from every station in the market. In fact, some of them I think are still working for the other stations.

[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:08.020]
Very good morning, Richard. Nice to see you. Areas with his briefcase. Got a little bomb and Gary's going to put in the FM transmitter before the end of the day. Good thinking. Excellent. That had given some attention anyway.

[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:14.140]
So a little bit of press and that we're just going to kind of sit here out in the front lawn and talk about the weather. This is great. Is this great?

[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:23.220]
Do you want to give a little plug to sunrise? Sure. Good morning, Neil. We've really enjoyed watching your show. What do you mean watching my show? It's on a radio.

[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:34.220]
Watching your show is better than listening to it, especially this morning. Well, that isn't any plug for sunrise. I want you to say something positive about sunrise. This is what is your position again?

[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:44.740]
I'm the administrative assistant to the mayor and sunrise mayor Hoffman. I am so impressed. You have no idea. I just don't know what to say. And sunrise is solvent since you got John Lamello out of there.

[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:53.900]
Boy, is it ever it is in an exceptional fine city and where everyone would want to move? I wouldn't go that far, but boy, that's good PR excellent.

[00:34:54.320 --> 00:35:02.960]
Neil, where do you live? I'm not, no, not talking into that on the air. I keep moving around to be anonymous. No way, Jose. I'll pass on that. Look at that. Got a little soda here.

[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.660]
I haven't had service like this since the diplomat mall since sunny Rosenberg tinkled all over my knee. That was incredible.

[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.700]
And look at that. Ten minutes after 11, we got our own clock. We have a plant out here. I think it's a fake, but it looks pretty good.

[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:22.180]
And the birds are chirping and the dogs are barking out into parking lot. This is what we've needed at Winds for a long time.

[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:30.560]
And I think maybe starting tomorrow in the 11 in the 11 o'clock hour, we've been saying the shows for the birds for a long time. That's true.

[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:36.020]
Is this working now? I don't know. How about if we use two of them in stereo on compact disc?

[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.860]
Kyle's going to get all upset because he doesn't know which one we're using, right? Well, we're going to go to this hand-held mic.

[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:47.020]
We're going to do like Oprah and we're going to go up and down the block saying you say what? You say what?

[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.820]
Up to 47. That's good.

[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:56.140]
I killed the other one. Are we still on the air? Well, Tom, pretty, it sounds pretty lucky to me. I'm getting off of it.

[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.700]
It was an ice-eyed deal while I lasted, but I don't want to start doing one of these short wave shows.

[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:08.320]
When we get down into the ones again, then we'll start doing like short wave. That sounded like we were on a mobile phone or something.

[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.680]
What happened to Dan Slay? Dan was going to come out and do some of his stick here. What did he disappear?

[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:20.760]
Oh, it's the rush that you just came out here. I can't believe it. Who's that then? Yeah, Dan hides in those dark caves. When is this?

[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:21.800]
Come on, brother.

[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:35.900]
You notice how far he runs away from dogma? He won't come near this microphone. Why not? He's got his mizuzan. He's eating his pants over mots. He's got the only black mots in the whole building. I can't believe it.

[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:40.440]
Hey, God, nothing to say to you, man. Nothing to say to me, man. Oh, okay.

[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.740]
Boy, oh, boy. These are Jamaicans, man. They are so sensitive. They're so testy. It's unbelievable.

[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.540]
I'll go in and smoke a spliff and he'll come back and be all right. He'll be okay. Who is this? Look at this crazy driver we got into parking lot. Who is that?

[00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:01.040]
Yeah, man. Mike is right over here. Say hello to Mike. How you doing, man?

[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:13.000]
Who is that? Is that a microneer? He looks like a microneer. I swear to you. He's bombed out of his skull to top it off. How you doing, Mike?

[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:21.680]
Look at that. He's got Sandy in the trunk. I don't believe it. Listen to her. Sandy, let her out of there. I hear her pounding on a truck. Mike, Mike. My sugar cookies, Mike.

[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:32.760]
Is that incredible or what? Did you really? Good morning. Well, listen, let's get a parade going up here. Let's see if we can't get some other people going to go up and down the block, blow it a horn.

[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:45.140]
You're probably getting shot in this block, but they're good luck to you, sir. Okay. Look at that. We got a live drive in audience. You heard of drive-throughs at McDonald's and Burger King. This is the only drive-through talk show in America.

[00:37:46.620 --> 00:38:01.260]
I'm serious. Look at that. Just like Howard Stern over here. I can't believe this. We got a drive-through. That was like a legitimate listener. Does anybody know him? Does anybody know any of the people in here? That's a question. Okay, Dan. This is your big chance in the sunlight.

[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:16.680]
Mike, would you like me to talk about anything you want? Anything that will kill some good time? I tell you one thing, no matter what, come hell or high water. We're not going back in here today. I mean, between now and two, if we have to make guttable sounds, in fact, we might attract a pretty good crowd out here if we make guttable sounds.

[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:26.420]
Well, we have plenty of people to do it. I think we should do our next Thursday show. It is Thursday today, I guess, from a mobile phone going down 9.95. What do you think? That's a good idea.

[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:50.920]
We could go out to Dauphin Expressway. Look at this. It looks like a Mario Andrade coming in here. Oh, no, that's one of the news cars. It's done. Andrade, who is that? Oh, it's Jim Loney. Oh, he doesn't speak to us. Jim Loney just came in. We better get serious now. He pays the insurance for the news car personally since he did that series. He's very attached to that. Come on, Dan. Get serious.

[00:38:51.340 --> 00:39:20.900]
Wouldn't it be great? Are there any neighbors? Now these people out here can't take anything else up. You do realize that, don't you? We even come in under on their fillings, under golden fillings. I'm serious. We come in on the fillings on 47th Avenue. I have a feeling that clock just stopped. I think that's what I think that's when your retainers came out the clock just stopped. If there's anybody listening up here on 47th Avenue, we invite you to come on. Well, I'm not so sure about that. You saw we saw the burglar bars, haven't you? My gutter, more burglar bars on this street. I'm

[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:50.880]
actually, in fact, you almost get the feeling that they're in business that they're selling them. Now, who is that that just drove out of here? I notice she's listening to Zeta, I guess. She doesn't even know where we are in the dial. Does she work here? That I don't know. You think she's a salesperson? Oh, she's definitely a salesperson. AM or FM? B.M. I can't put the who might actually find out who the hell some of these people are that work in here and pick up a paycheck every other week. As I started to say, if there's anybody on 47th Avenue,

[00:39:50.880 --> 00:40:20.860]
right up here in front of the station, I know you can't pick up anything else. I think some of these people are listening to QBA, don't you? Do you have some Cuban neighbors? That's a good possibility. We are in Miami. No, we're not in Miami. We're in Carroll City. No, we do not be in Miami. We be in Carroll City. That's no question about that. There's a lot of black neighbors up here in this neighborhood. That's why Taffy comes by helicopter every day. A brera. There is somebody approaching the gate, ladies and gentlemen, right now, even as we see.

[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:50.840]
I'm not going to speak. Look at that. It's Sandy Payton. Sandy is coming in. Boy, this ought to be exciting. We're going to get the story behind the story. Who is that, that just... Oh, that's the... That's part of the W.I.N.Z. Post Office there on the way. Somebody's coming up here on a bicycle. Look at that. It's John Hinckley, Jr. and James R.O. Ray. I can't believe it. Along with Ted Bundy, baby. And Ted Bundy. Okay, that's our kind of crowd. They only got as far as the gate. They're still looking for Ryan. I need to go.

[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:20.820]
I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go.

I need to go. I need to go. I

[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:50.800]
need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go.

I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I need

[00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:20.780]
going on this. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go too. I need to go. I need to go. I need to go. I have built in

[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.620]
look on your face like I'm going to say something dirty or something now all I'm saying is that what we'll do is we'll give them away

[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.620]
That's when Marlon gave him to a sport and give us

[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.400]
Candles to take home and do disgusting things with he gave us those candles to give away to some of the listeners

[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.900]
So what we'll do is I'll get him out. I think I got about a dozen of them during the commercial break and

[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.760]
We'll give him away to the first dozen people are coming and drive through art

[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.660]
Now see there's one good thing about being out here, and that is we're almost anonymous

[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.380]
We're in the middle of nowhere and there's a lot to be said for that

[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.120]
They're sure is and Neil just to follow up on that there is a car out at the gate

[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.140]
They're now getting out of the car. They now slam the door on the car

[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:02.740]
They could possibly come in they could be our first happy. Why are they why are they parking about 400 yards away?

[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.860]
Is there some reason for that and why are they slinking as they're approaching the parking lot?

[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.020]
Looks like they're afraid of the radiation from the transmitter

[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.560]
We'll get towards to the transmitter too if you come on out here

[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.000]
This could be Dan's big chance

[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.400]
He always wanted to do play by play

[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.100]
He can do the play by play of my being assassinated out here this morning probably get an 80 share the fascination of

[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.860]
Exactly, but was that some kind of a racial slur I think about our neighborhood?

[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.020]
Camp I can't believe that you said that okay

[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:35.280]
There is a car and they just took off and Stanley J Cohen just got out of the car. I can't believe it look at that

[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:35.940]
Stanley

[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:41.700]
He's hopping up toward the HM right now Mickey finally got him. She threatened to turn him into a frog Mickey Dane

[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:47.700]
And I think that she finally got to him and look at that the engineering staff is going out and feeding flies to Stanley now

[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:53.640]
Stanley of course never met a fly. He didn't like but that's another story is there somebody just hanging around the edge there

[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.940]
Is that just my imagination?

[00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:00.100]
bunch of kids on a motorcycle and looks like a go-kart from here. Now you do remember the date

[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:05.720]
Is anybody here remember the day that some kids went or somebody went in the back here and shot a bullet hole through the kitchen window?

[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.440]
several times

[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:13.420]
Okay, now at our AM sales staff gee I would I would have helped him out on that one

[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.960]
But seriously if there's anybody wants to come by today

[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.640]
We'll show him right where the general managers window is and

[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.880]
Now we're only kidding come on and there I heard that that was disgusting

[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.380]
This is a joke out here and they're serious. They're really they're gunning for him today

[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:33.120]
I'll tell you for Gary and we're gonna go in a little later and talk to Gary Lawrence here comes somebody on it

[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.140]
Look at that. It's Jesus on a motorcycle. I can't believe it

[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:39.680]
Turned back. Oh, he turned back man. All these people are like chicken

[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.040]
They come up to the gate and it gets to a certain point and they turn around and they go back

[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.640]
What is it that they're looking for up here? I can't believe that we've got like I think that actually what's gonna happen is

[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.620]
We're being hijacked you folks don't realize it

[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:57.920]
But I think that we're gonna be taken for ransom these look like a mean surly bunch at the gate up there

[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.800]
Okay, what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a little break here

[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.600]
It's 22 past 11 at wins on the orange is we're broadcasting out in the front lawn

[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.700]
What?

[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.340]
same to you guys and

[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.340]
After we take our break I'm gonna run over and get our happy

[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:16.880]
Happy sperm you can't say that on a radio get our happy sperm candles and we'll come right back

[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.280]
So we have some degenerates in the front lawn here, but before that

[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.060]
Mike Wolf has an outside news bulletin

[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.640]
All right, and he'll we've just gotten worried that a jury in Broward County

[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:33.220]
It's found Michael Rivera guilty of the abduction and murder of 11 year old Stacy Jansvac and Broward last year

[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:39.220]
The jury deliberated for only an hour and a half before returning the verdict during the nearly two-week-old trial

[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:43.380]
The jury heard testimony from cellmates one of whom said Rivera talked about the crime

[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:48.540]
The other said Rivera admitted to the killing the defense had maintained the stories were jailhouse fantasies

[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.560]
Rivera already faces a life prison term and the abduction and near killing of another young girl in Broward

[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.380]
Your second bulletin in the morning by noon. I'll tell you that and

[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.440]
I don't know who some of these people are. We have some real strange looking people anybody want to come

[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.800]
We're giving the candles away only if you'll speak on the air

[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:09.960]

But I gotta go to court. Well, you're going to court. Well, good luck to you sir when they put you inside

[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.000]

Probably take this away from me probably yeah, there'd probably be a whole line waiting to take it away from good luck to you, sir

[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.240]
I can't believe that who is this guy here from a pure later career

[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.640]
We could put him on your do you notice he saw the microphone zip Oh man

[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.780]
Which is then my band is stiff Richard

[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.220]
Stiff Richard

[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:37.560]
Is that like little Richard? No, no, that's like stiff as in you know, if it ain't stiff

[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:43.340]
Like I said like little Richard great, and where are you guys playing? Anyway, that'll pay us

[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.420]
Don't they have a word for them

[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.020]
We're cheap. Yeah, no that's prostitute. I think that's what that is

[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.720]
Well good luck to you, sir. I'm sure that'll come in handy. You can use that as your logo

I can't wait for you. I already said big old stop. You heard we were giving away something free

[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.280]
Isn't that the real reason sir?

[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:11.320]
Definitely not question about it. That's the point if we were giving away sweet and low you would be stopping by wouldn't you?

[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.800]
Most likely

[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.640]
Use it in good help

[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.140]
Okay, okay, there goes our folks at work release they have the ball and chainback governments the nice tab you folks out and

[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.360]
A guy from pure later career is zippin by he doesn't want anything to do with this because he knows we would put him on the air

[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:32.220]
And look at that we're giving away wins mug's man. This is a high budget show today

I can't believe it. It does say we kill now that you mentioned it. No, no, this is just the

[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.480]
Now this isn't just the guy who does the spring inside right?

The yard's right the yard sprayer. So he's gonna spray the show

Look at that outfit. He's got on today the blue shirt coat with the brown pants man. He looks about a sharp

[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.700]

For these people all these people in trucks are coming in here looks like a pickup

[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.800]
It looks like a 7-eleven store

[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:23.480]
Have we got any bottles of pickled eggs inside man? We could we could attract a brown bag lunch crowd by noon here

[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:27.200]
That would put everybody to shame at Tom's thumb. Wait a minute. We don't have insurance for that

We've only got a couple of them left but Marlin Bailey's bringing a whole lot more. There's a little uh something

[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:41.420]
Do they allow those in Boka? Uh we try to sometimes on the weekends only only on a weekend

[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.200]
That's good. We don't want to overpopulate Boka

[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:49.600]
Excellent. And you have something you want to plug? Uh I work for Plain Air Electronics with a distributor for a state of Florida

[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.980]

What's that? How we be okay? This is no cameras around. I don't know. It's the eye in the sky

[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.820]
Haven't you ever heard of the live eye on channel seven?

[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.660]
No, I have it either. That's good

[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.340]
That's great. We're on here in our studio at a son

[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:59.920]
This is just like live at five on the channel seven and here's a young lady who uh, how you doing?

[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.700]

[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:14.800]
I'm a box sail

[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.480]
For a gay to talk oh boy

[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:21.860]
Boy you talk about restraint folks. Are you serious? You sell boxes?

[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.000]

[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.240]
Well, who do you sell me just go up it down the street yelling is anybody need a box?

[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.840]
You need a box why?

[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:34.260]
Want to be so box-flexes anybody inside need a box?

[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.380]
Oh look at that all the women just came out of the building. I can't pull

[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:45.440]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, she has sky boxes

[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:50.220]
She has sky boxes for Joe Robby. No doubt when you know I wish oh, we ought to give her a cap

[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:54.820]
We don't have any more the candles right now. We're gonna give you a winds cap just for being a good sport

[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.720]
Thank you, and if we need any boxes

[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.140]
Then you could sell boxes to have a biscuit air conditioning

[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.940]
I think I think some of their customers wind up in a box when the air goes out

[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:12.480]
But uh not really not off hand but if anybody stops by we'll give me your uh you want to give your number?

You want to give me your card that would be great. Yeah, we're giving free plugs for business. Thank you

[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:21.480]
That's a good looking card, isn't it? Red, white and blue. That's all American John Brown would be proud of that wouldn't they?

[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.820]
That's great. Oh in Zillenoid your Jane

[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:25.180]
Thank you Jane

[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:26.320]
You bet

[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:32.740]
Just got worried that Linda Thornton is listening so we want to say hello. I guess right? Well that means Joe Johnson must be listening to huh?

[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:37.840]
That's right good old gel. Are they awake yet? Oh, I shouldn't have said that should I?

[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:39.320]
I guess not

[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.160]
But I did well Linda how you doing this morning Linda? We're trying to break new ground here

[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.920]
We're always doing new ground and this could be part of a long standing phone out

[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:53.040]
Now who is this strange guy in the uh oh in the fatigues and the camouflage outfit

[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.260]
He looks like one of Taffy's guests

[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:01.860]
Could be or could be a you and football player. We don't know that could be a you and football player with a puppet like that come on now

[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.580]
Let's get serious. This guy's got a bigger

[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:11.100]
Ah yeah, that's true. He's on a mission. He's definitely on a mission. He's coming up with a right yet. He could be serious here

[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:18.760]
Well, what you'll have to do is either come back later or take a cap and do you say that?

[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:22.660]
No, wait a minute. This can't be all the stuff. We got left to give away. Yes

[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:27.320]
How about some equipment?

[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.980]
Oh wait a minute. Do we have some of that stuff?

[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.920]
What are you doing? Are you serious?

[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.460]
No, now those could be worth something someday. Can we give them away or would they get upset?

[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.000]
Why? Why would he get upset? We can't do anything with them. They're they're pass A

[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.700]
Well, that's the idea. We want to give them away because they're going to be collectors at him

[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:51.040]
Don't you understand Zeta license plates are legendary?

[00:59:53.880 --> 01:00:00.360]
But neither was Zeta for years it went off the air honey. Don't you understand things come back things come back

[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.960]
Just like Carol Citi had died. We brought it back to life

[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:11.980]
Don't ask him tell him we have a chance to get a little recognition here for that FM for crying out loud that would be great

[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:18.760]
Those things could be it could be like baseball cards. They could be we have maybe a few of them on the cars here in the parking lot and

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.060]
Maybe a few of the old Zeta 4

[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:27.520]
Not 94.0 even Bill Calder has one of those Zeta things on his car couldn't believe it the other day

[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.440]
I was at Bill's house when I was waiting for a big meeting last night and man. Okay. Thank you

[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.380]
Wait a minute. Are we giving away some of those?

[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.460]
You still haven't found out for these guys slow back here

[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:42.040]
Don't you see you're nervous go in there and tell them Neil wants to give him away

[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:47.200]
And we don't want to put a lot of pressure on you, but if we can't give away Neil's gonna leave. Okay. Nothing exciting

[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:55.260]
What were we saying before we got to rudely interrupted license plate the 90 i 95 light. I tell you one thing some of the guys

[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.320]
We've had come by here. I think they make license plates

[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.400]
If you asked me all the state hospitals right down the street

[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.680]
Florida state hospital it is

[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:11.060]
For the criminal. Oh come on. Oh, you think I would give these away to somebody. What are the what is this?

[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:16.420]
Are we on welfare and here or what? Oh, you know those aren't those are 94 news wins the podatory. Oh, yeah

[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.180]
That's right. These are the wins the podatories. I can't believe it

[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.960]
These are the only suppositories in the world that double is a ballpoint pen

[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:28.260]
And if you really are acrobatic what you can do is you can use them and write a message at the same time

[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:31.160]
It's incredible. I'm serious. I'm serious

[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.100]
Or it could be one of those we put some little numbers on and I've heard these people have drove up in a pickup truck

[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.840]
Look at that. They look friendly, but man at shotgun. He's got

[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.900]
Looks real. You know what I'm saying? He wants to pretend that it's like a prop

[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.520]
But it looks very real to me anyway

[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.900]
It's 17 before noon at w.i.nz

[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.300]
And we're broadcasting on the front lawn. This is uh, not so live in the morning

[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.660]
How you doing?

[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.100]
If you come by for something free is that what brought you by or do you really come by to say hello

[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.280]
Can buy to say hello and see if you have something free, you know both

[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.500]
But not necessarily in that order

[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.340]
Well, I'll tell you what how about a 94 news wins cap

[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:13.640]
Which is you know, I'm not exciting, but it's is that what I'm wearing? I don't even know what this is. This a IOD honor something

[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:14.700]
IUD

[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.580]
It does really oh gee

[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.880]
Well, that's it. Where did you folks?

[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.940]
A self-lovercated sperm bank oh a sperm candle she wanted the sperm bank. Okay. Well, that tells us a lot about your marriage

[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.660]
Good luck to you folks. Okay, great. Okay, I think things have kind of calmed down

[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:39.640]
But when oh now we're talking you know the crowd we're gonna get out here now. Don't you?

[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.720]
We got one the mug

[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.900]
Boy, we got one the mug

[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.400]
Man, I'm telling you how many of these are we got?

[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.180]
One two three four got about a half a dozen nine

[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.480]
That's great. So don't you can't you know give up folks once you get out here

[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.140]
We'll give away anything to people do anything to bring people out here the fact that people are coming out here

[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:06.520]
Though is miraculous. I mean if we were like IUD there on a 79th street causeway

[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.280]
It'll be no problem because they have you know traffic going by and there'd be five or ten people listening

[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:16.280]
But to get people to come out here look at this here comes another truck an ominous looking vehicle

[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.720]
Of the 47th Avenue cause winners another one behind it. We have a caravan

[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.420]
O federal Express

[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.240]
That's probably the book

[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.580]
Well, once once the book comes in and we're all gonna have to hit the road

[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:34.180]
What does this one say it says modern electronics ink moody electronics ink in Miami 891

[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.520]
1374

[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:44.080]
Is there some special message what the clock it's like Linda Blair why did the clock just turn itself out

[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:51.140]
By itself. Oh, that's good. Okay. Let's take our last break here Kyle and then we'll come back because I think federal Express is bringing in our pink slip

[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.800]
It's 1145 and wins

[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.700]
But a stuff that we're giving away. How this one is Lee Fowler. Do you ever say anything so foul looking in your life?

[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.480]
Unbelievable goofy now. That's pretty cute. Isn't it how many of those are we got?

[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:08.820]
About a half a dozen and it's great. Okay. I'll tell you what all of these people

[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.020]
Well, wait a minute some of these people work here

[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.360]
Even the people at work here are looking for the free. You know that they just stay in here these people from the FM

[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.480]
What are we getting now? Okay? No seriously? We have incredible stuff here

[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.820]
We even have one thing here this lorry-out stuff that makes hair grow on your

[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.780]
somewhere, yeah, right?

[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.040]
What you did you spray that right over the over the suppository

[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:35.940]
That's right that area right there and that'll let bro hair really fantastic for those of the folks

[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.780]
I can't look at this

[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.820]
For all of these people

[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:44.920]
This is the whole win staff out here today. I can't believe it

[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:50.120]
Okay, this gentleman looks like he would be a good candidate for one of these goofy lilies

[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.700]

[01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:00.120]
Thanks very much. Where did you come from today? I was at Parkway Hospital. I'm a pharmaceutical salesman and then I

[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.340]
Well, you're one of those pill pushers

[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.840]
Exactly you got it not any good stuff when I was trying to get some happy sperm

[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.500]
But I understand I missed that on out other some folks here would like to help you out here

[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:14.980]
Some of the FM folks, but you know that they got a great sense of humor exactly no problem

[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.120]
Maybe I can help them out

[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.300]
Yeah, with the pills I'm not touching that line. Okay. Good luck to you sir

[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.340]
Okay, we're not touching any of that line about drugs in FM because we all know it's true

[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:31.980]
Anyway, we got some old i95 t-shirts and we got some hair stuff and some mong and uh

One of these notepads w-i-n-z notepads. How come the employees never get the good stuff?

[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.540]
Never got a pad three years here, and I never got a pad. Who is this degenerate?

Okay, never stole a freight train. Where did you hear that? Dan. Dan is now using my material

[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.180]
Dan is but you want to hold that because I'm not strong enough to pull that open with one finger

[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:24.360]
There's probably one of those underground albums that we're playing on the FM

[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.320]
Oh

[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.240]
I look at this see look at this it's Frank Zappa

[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.380]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's Tom Petty in a heartbreakers

[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.560]
But does it feel a little broken D-Rulike maybe like in the corners?

[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:38.060]
No

[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.300]
It feels pretty broken to me

[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.760]
It's the brand new Tom Petty album. We're gonna give these away. No, we're not

[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.060]
No, we're not a player. I know. Well, how many can you play? There's one

At least we can speak you know that's something what about the budget here outdoor studio?

[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:09.260]
Exactly well that's because we can't afford to pay the electric on the inside

[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.620]
Now who is this guy now here is a very interesting looking guy

[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:19.240]
Looks like it looks like Ernie's guest from Saturday. That's right. He's walking on air

[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.780]
Well, he sure don't want Tom Petty in the heartbreakers. I'll tell you that

[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:37.300]

Unbelievable. What else have we got that we're gonna give away here? We got these pads and pens

[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.000]

Well, what does that have to do with i95? It must be on the back. What does it say on the back?

[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:11.980]
Boy now listen. I'm serious. These could be worth something someday. I'm very serious

[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:20.680]
Kids don't do what at home what we're doing now. Well, we don't want to tell them what we're doing now

[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:26.140]
Look at that. It just says i95 FM on the back. I'm telling you these are gonna be worth something someday

[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:32.100]

[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.960]
We got a great proud of the generates here. They're all on a work release and

[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:07.120]
The name by here no John Hinkley. He'll be coming by a little bit later

[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.860]
Mike Mike Wolf has got those headlines CBS has the news at noon and we'll come back at about ten after the hour

[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:17.100]
And we're gonna have a massive proud here and the brown baggers will be here for lunch

[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:23.860]
Seven and Howard or six two four oh one nine one in day and now here again is neo-ruggers

[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.440]
Okay, premise where our sheets stop by and he's doing a little barbecue and during the new hour out here

[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.480]
I can't believe that we have a great crowd around the lawn in front of the W I and C commissary and

[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.920]
The given away all kinds of stuff to anybody and everybody who wants to come by eat your heart out Alice

[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.960]
And we've got happy sperms that we're giving out. We've also got these incredible goofy Louis dials by the way save one of those for me

[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.320]
We're the place I like to get something out of this and

[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.180]
Who is this guy now? We had the guy with a coffee truck out here, but we have had nobody with food

[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.100]
Now can you imagine seriously? Can you imagine we're giving away wonder mugs and all this other foolishness?

[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.360]
But can you imagine if we could get some oh you wanted to give a plug and

[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:05.980]
I didn't know rotor rudder and hi alia 888-58-3-6 that sounds obscene. I don't know what that is, but

[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.160]
Okay, we also have a little voodoo dollar taffy here

[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.780]
Anybody like to stick a couple of pins in the taffy McCallum voodoo down?

[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:15.740]
I were ever wanted to stick a couple of pins in here and

[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.680]
Maybe the brick oven pizza rear that's not too far away or somebody in the area one of our sponsors

[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.520]
I know it's getting a little late. It's like 11 after noon

[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.920]
But I'm sure that they could be here by like one o'clock and whip up a whole batch of

[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.340]
Of what do you laugh about

[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.400]
Marlon Bayley the following what happened and he just inhale a happy sperm what happened to Marlon

[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:41.020]
I haven't seen him so animated since I know the guy what just happened to him

[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.340]
No, I'm serious. They could bring up a whole batch of lunch for the people out here

[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:48.760]
Either that or one of the convenient stores could deliver a couple of jars with the ambionic fluid out here

[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.660]
Wouldn't that be good with a happy sperm or we could have two of those big jars of the pickled eggs?

[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.900]
And the sausages

[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.980]
Boy that would put it that would put it rich on a diet for a long time. I'll tell you that

[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.680]
Look at that. We got

[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:05.440]
Joe Thysman just came in here man. He's not looking too good these days. Joe tell you a little an an activity

[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.160]
Yeah, he is limping a little bit

[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.900]
He is limp. You're you're right about that

[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.400]
Faith now they just gave him a happy sperm

[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.480]
Exactly well Joe will be back in those spots again before you know

[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.760]
We got old i95 t-shirts, which are gonna be worth something one of these days

[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.660]
In fact, hopefully i95 might be worth something

[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:28.500]
Well soon one of these days, but that's another story and we just had an incredible crowd now

[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:32.260]
Who is this guy who looks like a mafia he looks like a mafia hitman Tony Orlando?

[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:33.780]
Where's Dawn?

[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.300]
Tony Orlando without dawn that's right. He's dressed in I guess

[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:43.360]
Olive green pants and a yellow shirt with a bag for all those viewing listeners

[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.580]
For all those who are watching inside your little speakers

[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.280]
See this is better the people these are all the people who didn't have the mobile phones who couldn't call this morning

[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.580]
They just drove out here instead

[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:54.940]
What is this?

[01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:01.200]
Isn't that great they're sending over a lunch from the diva restaurant they're sending food over here

[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.780]
Why we'll never get rid of this crowd now will we?

[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:06.580]
Oh

[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.760]
Kathy oh, I can't believe it look at that mic Miller just came in here too. He heard lunch was free today

[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.160]
Poor mic, man. He just is having an identity crisis over there. He can't control himself. By the way

[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.040]
Marlon oh there he goes Marlon had some good mic Miller stories

[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.140]
But he chickened out and the guys from the FM were gonna tell us some David Cassidy stories too, but they

[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:29.680]
They ran back in there with that Tom Petty album now. Who is this guy with the bag?

[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.000]
Boy there's something there's something ticking in that bag

[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.880]
Stripe shirt and white pants with white shoes

[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.980]
There's the beef stew that we threw out yesterday incredible chef boy already you know what happened to him?

[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:50.620]
That's good. Okay, I can't drink any of these but some of our degenerates can't pass them out

[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.420]
Pass those out

[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:53.940]
Jerry who?

[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.480]
Williams and Jerry Williams. Oh, not very yeah

[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:05.200]
Which which him and some lady who's about 85 she was saying uh with Shirley Peters? No, not surely

[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:10.540]
They're older than Shirley, but they were really tearing you up, you know, making fruit jokes and stuff like that

[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.840]
Great was Allison and I broke two or one. No, Allison's been taking on you yesterday. She's taking on you today. Oh good

[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:19.180]
That's good. Allison jealous because they don't have a lawn over there on 441

[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:23.740]
Now that's a good idea when Fowler comes on today. Maybe he can do the show in traffic on 441

[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:27.960]
Stand right in the middle of street. It'd be like how and now exactly boy that would be good for Lee

[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.880]
Could take a poll is the traffic. Hey, thanks guys. That's part of the

[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.120]
Miami Stadium crew the new Dolphin Stadium just came over here. They're goofing off

[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.400]
That's why the stadium won't be ready in time for the first game

[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:44.520]
So don't blame Joe Robby folks. It's gonna be the crew that came over here for the freebies. No, that stadium looks great

[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.720]
Everybody does every time I go buy an attorney pipe. I see the stadium

[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.020]
It looks great and I wish for Calder to be back open again

[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:54.780]
Here's Florida fire and rescue just came by because they heard that we're giving away the wonder mugs

[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.280]
And they know that the crowd from winmores gonna be coming down from coconut creek any minute

[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:05.740]
We're gonna close the gate and watch them jump off in by the way for the rest of the folks who come by valley parking only

[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:12.180]
At the by order of Gary Lawrence Gary said we might as well make a money while the sun shines

[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:16.360]
There they go there are these troops on their way back to the stadium

[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.980]
What happened is the neighbors are gonna start selling parking spaces like down at the hospital exactly

[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:23.900]
Might away and get some close spots for about 10 bucks

[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:28.460]
Right up close on 47th out and look at this caravan. What the hell is this?

[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.220]
This must because they heard the food was coming

[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:33.700]
I can't believe this we're being inundated

[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.120]

[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.040]

These people can be the Russians will be George. So those are green by the way

[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:26.440]
I guess that's some significance to those look green to you

[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.780]
We're asking for lime lime yeah

[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:33.160]
Guy from Southern Belle brought us two line balls and

[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.340]
Uh boy wait till Kathy West comes out here man. She's gonna go nuts

[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.720]
They are boy no wonder Kathy has that effervescent personality. I can't believe it

[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:50.160]
And in return we look at that they got wonder mugs and happy sperms many guys got more than they bargained for too

[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.560]
To Birmingham well, you have to have a passport to bring that into Birmingham

[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.500]
You understand that a visa or a master card one of the other

[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.600]
Okay, and we got any

[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.700]
What have you got here man?

[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.400]
One of our thank you. What is this?

[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:11.000]
That's the coffee Stein that must be Larry Stein's brother-in-law

[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:14.420]
This is one of the products we sell it for consultation

[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.540]
Well listen ma'am

[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.260]
Are you serious it's for constipation? Where do you put it?

[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:31.300]
Look at that man

[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.000]
Can you read that? Silly am hydrophilic musaloid? I don't think we can say that on the air

[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.320]
No read row

[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:47.160]
It looks like I think that's what you used to catch it in or something. I don't know what that is

[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.020]
I mean, you try to fill it to measure it to you

[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:55.100]
Okay, well, thank you. That was really more than I bargained for for sure. I'll tell you that

[01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:00.300]
By the minute they're coming now. This is probably good to inspire a lot of real freeloaders to come in

[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:01.880]
but uh

[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:08.380]
We have we have a crowd of winds employees on a way to the brick-covered pizza rhea and food

[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:12.120]
Food will be on the way in a little while in just a few minutes

[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.580]
Now you watch the freeloaders come burrowling in here man. I be here from Kendall. I'll be here from sunrise

[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.060]
Even from halloween day. I'll be coming in

[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.900]
Do we have those boxes of sweet and low or did they take we do all man bring those out here?

[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.220]
Somebody's got to bring those out

[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:32.540]
Because all of these people seem to be under the age of 100 so far. Have you noticed that?

[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.420]
We don't have any proves here yet. Everybody seems to be under the age of 100

[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.380]
And just now camper pulled up. I think that's uh oh

[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.240]
That's one of the people who works here look up far away. He had a part

[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:48.580]
That's good. Chris needs the exercise anyway. I can't believe this

[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:55.020]
So anyway, and there goes the rest of the phone company if there any folks in the audience by the way waiting for the repairman forget it

[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.460]
Because they're all and the cable man is also out here

[01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.940]
So I would probably wait till tomorrow

[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:06.000]
But brick-covering is going to be sending some food over and devise going to send some food then not a really be good huh

[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.260]
How come rich didn't bring any food here?

[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:14.100]
Well, Neil I was out at face side signing Neil Roger's autographs and

[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:17.440]
The only thing that people have been asking me for eight by ten glossies

[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:22.540]
But the only one I have of you is the eight by ten glossy of you blowing up a balloon in the Chattanooga police station

[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:23.520]
so

[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:28.360]
You are in Tennessee right now. Oh, yeah, not in Chattanooga though in Nashville

[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.620]
You know how they practice breath control in Tennessee don't you know? New to D

[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.080]
Oh

[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:35.440]
Oh

[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.480]
Are we in delay no chance

[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:44.800]
Well, that's all right. We got the guy from the FCC on tomorrow. We'll ask we'll ask him if any of this stuff was objectionable

[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:50.380]
Okay, again when you drive in here turn your headlights on because we got a couple of guys in the bank who are

[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.920]
Charging ten bucks to charge your battery on a way out

[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:57.700]
There's a traffic jam coming up from the south on the way here. No, come on traffic jam

[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.760]
Anyway, uh, we had some of our geniuses inside. I suggest that we give directions

[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.300]
We don't want to do that because it's already like 1230

[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:10.080]
Exactly we don't want you to find a place we like to remain anonymous

[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.160]
You know what we ought to do we ought to give him directions to to W snooze

[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:14.900]
Is that a good idea?

[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:17.320]
Do you know?

[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:18.780]
2

[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.500]
So we're out of the bank 243. Yeah, just look for a place with a lot of satellite dishes

[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.960]
And this guy's an expert on renery on W snooze. Where do you work?

[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.140]
for glow

[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.420]
The globe I thought you said for WGL. Oh, I thought that was that religious station

[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.120]
Boy, you came to the wrong place. I'll tell you that

[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.340]
I wonder these guys doing out here

[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.400]
What are we doing having a band? Are we doing a roster band out here with Richard Taylor?

[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.520]
What are these guys doing out here many engineers are crawling around on the ground?

[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.520]
I can't believe it. They're putting on a show that I haven't even seen

[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.080]
Ha ha ha

[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.620]
Zadie 94 is back there

[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:07.880]
Yeah, we're gonna put the FM on see if we can't put everybody to sleep when lunch gets here

[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.640]
So we'll have something left over

[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.360]
Is that I guess that's it huh? This is it

[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.640]
This could be the end. Yeah, I think we find me a reach star peak

[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:22.740]
Oh wait a minute. We just have holy cow

[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:23.980]
Whoo

[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:31.940]
The federal communications commission gave notice to broadcasters today that it will expand its definition of obscenity

[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:35.680]
Beyond the traditional seven dirty words

[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:43.540]
In a major policy decision today the FCC said it will increasingly enforce

[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:47.600]
It's prohibition on indecent and offensive material

[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:50.600]
Oh

[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.160]
Looks like we're not gonna have a lot of bunch of douchebags, huh?

[01:29:55.260 --> 01:30:01.940]
You believe that the cop up boy. Oh boy. Are they in for a surprise tomorrow when I have this old fart on the air

[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:05.060]
I'm telling you we got the guy from the FCC on tomorrow at 10 o'clock

[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:11.440]
And am I gonna give him what for I'm gonna I'm gonna ask him you know what I want him to define all of the words on the air that we can't say

[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.840]
Is there anything wrong with that in other words if we can't say him

[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.320]
He's gotta tell us which one now the guy with a fishing pole here. What the hell is that all about?

[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.280]
What a u-fishing for?

[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.180]
Ron Harrison. Where did he steal it?

[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.520]
Man at Harrison. He's in the fishing tackle business. He's our final locations and we're sitting with someone

[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:34.060]
Please don't disturb us. We could have a bullet in here more from the FCC

[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.240]
Howard Cern

[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.380]
What Edward Mark Cune upset

[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.920]
Okay, leaving off with offensive and don't you love the way they do this

[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:48.020]
XXX offensive material. I think there's something symbolic about that. Don't you

[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:54.300]
Once public once published in the federal register the decision will apply to once published to another words

[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.800]
It hasn't been published yet

[01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:03.040]
We can still do anything you like outside of those seven words the decision will apply to radio and TV stations

[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:07.200]
Officials said violators will be subject to fines and loss

[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.260]
Lights and theory larynx between great

[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:16.320]
What is this man doing over here the whole show is just for two lousy towels. They've lost the whole audience

[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:19.560]
What is that tell you man if it's for free

[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.480]
Forget it

[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:28.260]
Of let me say it again official said violators would be subject to fines and loss of licenses are they listing inside?

[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.900]
The decision is expected to be at least as famous as the 1975

[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:35.040]
Pacifica ruling it responds to a series of complaints

[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:43.440]
Against radio stations including WISP FM in Philadelphia and the non-commercial stations KCSB FM in Santa Barbara, California

[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.960]
That's a biggie and KPFK

[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:48.200]
Whoo FM in Los Angeles

[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.480]
Most of the complaint centered around New York City radio personality Howard Stern

[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:56.780]
Host of a morning show carried on WISP and a play

[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:02.920]
Jerker broadcast in August 1986 over KPFA owned by the Pacifica Foundation

[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:08.960]
In three separate unanimous votes today the commission said it will send warning letters to the stations in question

[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.320]
In the future all broadcasters will be held to stricter standards

[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:19.260]
FCC commissioner Dennis Patrick who's expected to take over his chairman of the agency next week said

[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:23.920]
What we are doing here today is to correct an altogether two narrow interpretation of decency

[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:30.560]
FCC general counsel Diane Kilroy or Kiljoy said the agency will now enforce the prohibition on

[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:34.100]
Indicent and obscene transmissions in a broader fashion

[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:39.300]
It includes robin what's your name along the lines of its original

[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:46.940]
Quivers along the lines of its original Pacifica decision stations will be barred from using patently offensive material

[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.300]
Not just the seven dirty words. Well, what the hell is patently offensive?

[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.580]
Exactly I use a lot of words that aren't patented like douchebag

[01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:03.240]
The US Supreme Court upheld the Pacifica case in 1978 ruling that the FCC could curb obscene and profane language

[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:09.300]
Kilroy said the change in policy is warranted because there's no way to restrict children from hearing such broadcast

[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.060]
For that's always the good excuse in it

[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:16.880]
Several commissioners said the policy will not chill free speech because obscene speech is not protected by the first amendment

[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:22.320]
They said the new policy is consistent with first amendment rights afforded to the print media

[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:26.780]
Well, wait a minute does that mean that we can say anything on the air that we see written print

[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:33.880]
Anybody got the village voice after right everything that has anybody got the village voice in here or mother Jones

[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:37.720]
What's that?

[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.000]
Who does

[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.980]
Yeah, yeah, well, that's what I'm that's what I'm going to ask the guy to do on the ear tomorrow

[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:52.020]
Tell us the words that we can't say on the ear

[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:52.920]
Yeah, if he didn't

[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.300]
If he doesn't want to tell us how the hell do we know what they are?

[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.260]
It's a good point

[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:06.580]
Exactly you ought to hear these little kids like this little guy down here man you ought to hear what he just said right a little while ago to his mom

[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:10.080]
I couldn't believe it was on but even my ears were burning it was unreal

[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.740]
Now the bad part about this is there's just a little this is great by the way the food from diva I said it again

[01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:17.760]
It's sensational diva diva

[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:16.060]

[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:44.640]
Weiss thing away in hell and down

[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.160]
I

[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:53.720]
It's a long and of course the the man behind it all mr. Miami Marlin and we're calling that right

[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:58.020]
Miami Marlin. No, it's martin daily of superstar creations

[01:49:58.540 --> 01:49:59.780]
Looking and take the mic

[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:03.320]
Here we go

[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:09.960]
In hell and hell I couldn't get him to say two words and you notice all of a sudden slowly but surely they all become

[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:13.360]
They evolve as Taffy would say in the superstar

[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.980]
That's true. I don't blame him

[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:23.100]
Wait a minute. What is this stuff? There's oh my god. There's loads of pizza from brick oven just showed

[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:25.760]
Let's go bring that pizza here, bud

[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:29.900]
Come on. Oh wait a minute. Where are the garlic slices? I might

[01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:34.080]
Dive into one of those if they're those in the audience listening getting hungry. That's tough, you know

[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.940]
That's about him like go over yourself to the brick oven and spring for a few bucks and get yourself some good food

[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.040]
Now look at this

[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:47.700]
You know what I think we might do we might do like a whole week out here like next week or something out on the lawn

[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:50.300]
You can we can play a game you can do play by play

[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.680]
Well here you see the only problem with that is you can't do great play by playing less somebody scores

[01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:00.580]
And in his place nobody ever scores at the rumor we have the happy sperm canals here

[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.920]
Yeah, well, that's a good start

[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:06.200]
Oh, you notice the interns are still like what is this why don't we what is this far?

[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.080]
He's selling her cone drive here Neil

This is from Bassets in the Lurias Plaza 112 82 Pines Boulevard in Pembert Pines oh yeah

[01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:25.920]

[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:27.300]
half off

[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:34.140]
And the New York Times that communist newspapers says that Bassets is the world's finest ice cream. I'll open it up already

[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:35.180]
Let's find out

[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:41.500]
Boy oh boy. This is great. This could be the marketplace of South Florida and Carroll City

[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:47.600]
You know we don't have any imitations. We let you come for the merchandise here. You don't have to do it on the phone

[01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:52.700]
But if the mountain won't come to

[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:57.200]
Whatever will come to the mountain I know listen to that shot. What a shot

[01:51:59.240 --> 01:51:59.700]

[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:06.740]
Believe me

[01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:11.160]
The French vanilla is for tap. Give that to her for her trip will you please?

[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:13.660]
Anything that'll help her go away fast

[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:18.380]
When it's gonna melt fast too it'll temper to that incredible texture

[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:23.780]
Look at this they're flipping underpants and everything out here man. This is getting to be wild

[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:27.360]
No wonder Gary doesn't want to come out here. He doesn't want to spoil his image

[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.020]
Okay, that's great. Well, I'm gonna taste this when we do our break and if you don't have spoons

[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:36.200]
It would be embarrassing for me to eat it to gum it right out of thank you very much

It's kosher La Paisa and this is Bassets in the Luria's Plas I know where that is in Pembert Pine

[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:55.900]
I know it gets a sterile if I got ice cream on my hat now

[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:57.840]

[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:03.280]

Oh, we've got no I don't want them let's give them away to these people

[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:13.360]
I mean they be kind enough to a shrewd job here. Okay Kyle. Let's do a little break here

[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:15.320]
It's 119 at W.I. and C. We'll be right back

[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:20.260]
You learn me out. I must admit the crowd the overwhelming the chanting

[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.340]
The placards it was just overwhelming yet the embarrassment

[01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:29.580]
In my admitess you'll embarrass me. Plus they had his car locked in he couldn't get out for lunch

[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:34.100]
And I wanted to come earlier, but I was talking to Mark Fowler who is the chair

[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:39.880]
Of the FCC and he wanted to know he said what in the hell are you doing down there?

[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.920]
So I said what the hell are you douchebags doing down there?

[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:47.520]
Well, I don't want to say what he said exactly you having a good time. We're having a great time

[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.040]
By the way, we have this

[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:52.880]
Wait a minute. What the hell is this thermo king is just brought in

[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:59.780]
Tons or look at that much herella ricotta. They brought in enough Italian food to feed Venice for six weeks

[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:04.920]
Now we have a little advisory here. I want everybody to quiet down for just a second

[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.740]
We have an advisory from the FCC

[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:15.960]
The famous seven-dirty words which the FCC has used in the past in defining obscenity are

[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:18.680]
On that piece of paper exactly

[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:27.280]
Exactly that was good. That was quick too and that was what called save the license is what it was called

[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:30.840]
But we're gonna get the guy tomorrow morning and we're gonna make him define now. I got him on paper

[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:36.380]
And we're gonna make sure he spells them all out with one with an s one with an f and a couple of with a c

[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:39.240]
But that's an other story now. What is this guy out here?

[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:43.640]
What is this guy doing is Alice in that truck?

[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:46.380]
It's refrigerated truck

[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.940]
All wait a minute maybe Sandy's body is in a back of that truck wouldn't that be something?

[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:55.120]
I can't believe it. Is there anybody getting out

[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:03.100]
No save it for me don't give that to anybody. We're out doing community ice cream

[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:05.840]
Where did the guy go?

[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:09.600]
Oh

[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.640]
This guy did you bring us food sir?

[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:17.140]
So we got a kitchen in there with a microwave

[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:22.140]
See another false alarm we thought this guy was bringing a truckload of food

[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:27.700]
That's all right. We got plenty of food. They're doing a job on the baked ziti and on the pizzas and the ice cream

[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.780]
By the way some of my audience has got some wild diseases

[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:32.800]
So I would just be very eyed watch that guy

[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:36.400]
Before we do the communal ice cream eating man. We got an incredible crowd

[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.820]
This is bigger than some of the audiences or some of the other shows into it's bigger than a lot of the rock concerts

[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:45.060]
I've been to lately. Well, you know those FM stations they're great. I think

[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.380]
By the way, we were thinking of going in there on the FM

[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:53.480]
Wouldn't it be good? We could take the log mic we could go in the FM see if there's anybody alive in there

[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.600]
Yeah, I mean it they're looking for free publicity. Did you really did you really hire back Alan Fried?

[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:04.400]
We've heard you stuffed them and you put them in the in a controlling McLean has to come on to raise Alan Fried back to

[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.220]
The bring him back. I love Alan Fried Alan Fried was one of the

[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:13.540]
First radio personalities I ever listened to but he's way past any of it your audience here

[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:19.440]
Because none of your audience here over 35 and I imagine that's amazed and I really think if you took a

[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:26.060]
A poll. I don't think you'd find anybody 50 years old in this audience with wrong. Where was that one lady that was here?

[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:28.000]
Come on did she go away

[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.940]
Neon we're just spelling a myth right here right now today

[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:37.260]
When she left you mean that prune that was here because she was an ice lady come on she was really nice

[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:38.780]
Is there anybody here over?

[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:47.620]
Oh wait a minute here she comes you asked you asked for it and you've got it

[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:52.460]
Here she comes all right. This is what we've been waiting for

[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:59.420]
I can't believe it she came all the way you want to do a little play by playing purple and white shirt with black

[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:01.700]
knickers and black shoes

[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:05.460]
And she's gay walking she walks a little like Oprah Winfrey

[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:09.220]
She's walking like Jay and here comes her husband here

[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.880]
And flat pants on a white shirt he's about 20 yards behind and he's gonna come up here and talk

[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:20.360]
All right, he looks a little like sunny Rosenberg's brother is a matter of fact. I can't believe it

[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:25.040]
This is great come on ma'am step right up here and say hello to America

[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:29.200]

Well, you know prostitution is legal in Carson City do you trust your husband?

[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:54.920]
By the way, I think I'd assure her this card

[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:58.740]
I have to show her this card you might want to think a second time

[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:06.680]

[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:27.840]
Look at that I can't believe it taffy bleached her face white before coming in here today. I can't believe it

[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.220]
Well, she got a sense of humor or what?

[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:33.280]
Okay, thank you so much. Here goes Gary Lawrence

My mother would wash my mouth out with soap

[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:20.680]
Well, I've heard some of the jokes you've told off the ear

[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:25.320]
If she heard some of the material you use she'd wash more than your mouth out with soap up. It doesn't matter a fact

[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:25.820]
Taffy
