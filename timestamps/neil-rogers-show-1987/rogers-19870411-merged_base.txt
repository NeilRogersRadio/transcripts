[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140]
I knew some of these people would start dropping off because they really wanted to talk to Miss hot pants and

[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.640]
She's long gone. We have two. Oh look at that all the browards gone

[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.260]
See broward knows that this station is right near the line and they were all prepared to come down and

[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.160]
meet Cathy's baby today

[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.980]
Up close and personal, but they're all gone. So let me give that broward number out 764

[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.380]
0707 did anybody hear Tom jicca on a great worthy show yesterday?

[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.340]
Now that was an interesting show see jicca is one of those guests and that's the only reason that we keep him on the show

[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.780]
We have very few guests now, but he is riveting no matter who show he's on

[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.220]
And I was fascinated because there were parts of that show when it sounded like he and Craig were debating and

[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.260]
Then when Lee Fowler and Dennis Collins came in at five o'clock

[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.580]
I thought they were gonna kind of like take over the show luckily that didn't happen

[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.600]
But who the hell needed them in there, right?

[00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.460]
Boy talk about a couple of nervous Nellies Opalaka. Hello. Wow. I want to know if

[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.140]
Cathy is white or black who?

[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.680]
Taffy McCallum

[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.440]
Wonder just left white

[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.620]
Cathy West Cathy West is very white. She's pale as a matter of fact

[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.280]
Is that is that good or bad? It doesn't I don't care. I'm still like her show. Oh, okay

[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.880]
Okay, bye. Okay

[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.640]
It's 1118 at W Y and Z and we've really fallen off almost nothing

[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.980]
What's that Ken's mother's name is sandy?

[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.440]
Well, yeah, I've heard her show

[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.040]
Okay, let me give that brown number out again. What that'll happen in Broward County?

[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.300]
Can't believe it 764

[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.140]
O's 7

[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.100]
O's 7 is there anybody alive or we picking up where we left off yesterday?

[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.740]
See I felt guilty yesterday because we had pretty boring show yesterday

[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.820]
But not my fault because as I even in fact Fowler was doing part two of his sex pole and

[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.460]
asking questions about elephant organisms and things like that and he had no calls. He was asking questions of the board ops

[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.660]
And of course if you knew some of the board ops over there

[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.680]
Obviously they weren't qualified to answer most of those questions either but in as I begin

[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.340]
Feeling my way through the day. I realized that until jicke came on later and of course he always gets a lot of calls because he's

[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.880]
One of the few guesters got any idea what he's talking about until then it was like death Valley days

[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.000]
And even one of the merchants in one of the malls talked to me yesterday called up and he said man

[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.120]
If you could be here right now. It's like a ghost town like everybody left

[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.740]
And that's probably because Passover is coming up the beginning of the week, right?

[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.400]
I mean in this town even the Gentile celebrate Passover

[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.240]
It's 19th listen if it was good enough for Jesus. It's good enough for them 19 past 11 at W.I. and Z

[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.160]
We're gonna do a little break here. We'll come right back

[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.020]
Well, leave it for a minute. There's nobody in this market on AM who's gonna get paid that kind of money

[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.180]
Well, you know, that's what I wanted to say something about and this is not a thankful call

[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.500]
But I don't know what you're paid, but you know you do something that the other talkos don't do for instance

[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.680]
When not listening to you and then when you bled over with with callers

[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.220]
I used to bleed a lot on callers show you because his callers you show that we had a good time in the callers

[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.120]
Now I know this is like a one-man serve. I realize that's no scientific validity, but I started

[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.040]
Listening to John Broward after you guys started getting into it. Well, don't blame don't blame me for that. No, I understand but

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.460]
now I

[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.740]
With the Kathy Westers is you're really making her a star. I get up

[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.200]
Before I used to switch around. I used to listen to Al at mine

[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.480]
on Saturdays now when I get up I turn on

[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.160]
I can turn on Kathy at eight or whatever it is eight thirty because maybe there's gonna be something going on there

[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.580]
That you guys are gonna get on to later

[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.720]
I don't think anybody else does that. I think that you're able to take other talkos on your

[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.500]
on your station and

[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.300]
Improve their ratings. I don't know how you could test that though

[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.360]
Well, I'll tell you one thing not only on this station

[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.040]
I think at a whole market when the traffic magazine did that piece couple of years ago

[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:15.460]
You'll notice in the back they had little profiles at Mark Fisher wrote of many of the other talkos and for two solid days in this market

[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.520]
That was the only topic of conversation and you know when when

[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.940]
Discussion about talk radio comes up. It's generally generated on this show

[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.900]
So those people out there who say oh what he talks about other talkos double time and it's bush league and it's this and so on and so forth

[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.360]
The fact is I think this program generates more interest and more controversy and more

[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.580]
Stimulation about the whole talk radio business than anything else in town certainly more than the promotion because I heard somebody talking to

[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.520]
Jika about that yesterday

[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.540]
Why don't they promote this show more the bottom line is they don't promote it at all?

[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.600]
zero

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.920]
So any promotion that's been done on this show has been stimulated from right here and believe me just with a

[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.560]
Halendale thing alone, you know people magazines coming here on Monday

[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.420]
That's got nothing to do with the promotion department here. That's all stimulated right here

[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.280]
Well, I go once that further when when you listening to jika yesterday it almost sounded like he was talking to you

[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.100]
Out in the audience like he had you in mind

[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.680]
A lot of things that he was saying so it's very interesting. No, it's only it's only Bill Caltor who does that

[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.640]
Listen, you know

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.280]
There's a star and then when he goes back on nights

[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.280]
I'm gonna listen to him on nights. I you know it's listen. What can you say you make people stars?

[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.740]
Have a good day. He makes people want you make people stars. Oh stars. I thought he said starve

[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.360]
No, no

[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.140]
Stars, okay, because Jerry Wichner once said that there's been a famine and he said he's the after resultant on the one who caused it

[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.260]
Jerry Wichner. Oh my god. I mean, I you know, I turn him on but he's better than a valium

[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.240]
You want to go to sleep at night turn him on exactly? That's why he belongs back on a midnight

[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.280]
Crawley and saw me X man 30 seconds of Jerry and you're in a deep sleep

[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.620]
Exactly. It's not coming to us. Okay. See you later

[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.660]
1136 at W. I. N. C. We have a caller in Hallendale right after our break who wants to talk about Howard Sterns

[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.900]
Probably his mother-in-law and we do have a couple of open lines in date

[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.160]
If you'd like to join us here things have slowed down a little bit since can't be left

[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.360]
But I'm not gonna take it personally because I noticed that starting yesterday the town is in a blue funk

[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.940]
It's kind of

[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.900]
And depressing and we're all just gonna kind of leave

[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.500]
Not

[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.140]
Oh, I thought you were gonna say you don't like it when she's on my show

[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.840]
Wait a year this letter

[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.820]
Dear Uncle Neil even as I'm writing this you are talking with Kathy West

[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.640]
Enough already

[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:13.020]
So I turn off my radio until I figure she's gone all of us here at work look forward to hearing you every morning

[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.860]
But not when Kathy is on she may be a wonderful person

[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.920]
But she needs to get more education or something she has her own show so let her stay on it at least then

[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.840]
She is not cutting it on your time. I hate to complain

[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.140]
But what can I do Martha in wherever

[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.900]
Martha Washington

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.860]
See you take her way down from Mount Garda dolly Madison

[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.180]
Oh the other thing I want to mention you have this guy on

[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:50.900]
To be for you talk all that in radio talk which is terribly interesting to you. I'm sure but not to the audience I know

[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:51.980]
Okay

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.440]
Of the

[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:09.080]
Was dropping something

[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.360]
Do what's robbing?

[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.640]
Robbing I said robbing. What did you say?

[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.900]
I know I keep on

[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.600]
Okay

[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.740]
Okay, see you later

[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.080]
Okay, listen we can't have Kathy on the show we can't talk radio

[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.880]
We don't want to talk about the FM certainly because that isn't radio

[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.260]
All of their doing better. They really are there sounding better. What's they get those guys with the big balls?

[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.320]
He voices on the air man. That's gonna be great

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.680]
Satan 94.9. No, they really do. They sound much better. They are going places

[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.520]
And that's a thing man once those people who remember to get off drugs for a day or two and they discover it's back on the year

[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.100]
They're gonna really go somewhere. Okay. We have an open line in brown. It's 764. Oh apartment and I sleep here. Okay

[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.440]
One day in the kitchen one day in the

[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.920]
In the foyer

[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.040]
Has been on a sleep in the newsroom. She slept around in there a little bit

[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.060]
But now it's got Walter Mendoe. No, no, he was before my time actually he was between my time

[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.480]
It was between your while I was here in 1791 and I left so he was in between

[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.640]
No, no, no, no, let me be the first to war

[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.440]
That's for you

[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:38.200]
Yes, so if you look at them real closely if you grab them real quick before they swim up street that it

[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.600]
Has a little wick you know, I've been going to wick since six all these years and buying candles you realize I'm what I could have

[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.220]
Oh boy, I'm not gonna uh, I'm not gonna pursue that. I'm not tropeing into that for one second

[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.800]
That's very sweet. We have a lot of ladies in our audience who spend a lot of time at wicks and sticks

[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.120]
Sniffing

[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:02.000]
Well see she's I don't know what her story is. I really don't I think she's been sticking their glue in the newsroom Kyle knows

[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.100]
Kyle in our very close

[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.280]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.640]
It's not what he said you wouldn't believe what he told me about you, but that's another story

[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.000]
I'll tell you during the next break. Thank you. Well Arlene Ross is here

[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.700]
She's trying to fulfill the void that Kathy West left here so to speak and can we move on now?

[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.860]
Did you have something you want to do? I was just lonely in my little cage by myself. I got to come in and say good morning

[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.160]
Good morning, Arlene. Good morning, you

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.620]
How are you doing? How it's staring again? Oh god

[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.720]
We're gonna report you to Howard

[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.060]
He's New Yorkers, man. I'm telling you there are so many douchebags from New York not all of them some of them are really great

[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.580]
About 200 of them I think

[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:52.320]
It's not a good batting average out of 15 million, you know Miami. Hello. I knew how you do it for one at w i and z

[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.180]
Arlene Ross is here if there's anybody in the audience who has any idea who our lean is

[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.060]
I'd like to remain anonymous

[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.820]
Why? Because I can guess because he's not a lot you can't be very anonymous

[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.940]
See he's been telling if he used a better name every time I saw my style was changed. Or is that it?

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.480]
He used a different name. I don't look anything like my driver's license picture

[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.020]
It has my married name on it, you know, I can get a lot done

[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.160]
Okay as a matter of fact, she's been posing as Kathy West all week, which is why

[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.300]
Did you notice what Kathy was in here were you listening when she was in here this morning?

[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.240]
And all these guys who have been allegedly salivating all week, you know

[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.740]
I just having a nervous breakdown and getting moist over the thought of Kathy's breasts

[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.340]
They didn't call her. I mean, this is a stiff town so to speak

[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:58.860]
Speak for yourself honey only figuratively speaking but as a matter of fact, Kathy left a picture of one of her boyfriend's

[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.300]
Really young well, hey listen Kathy likes to a spread her love around, you know

[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.000]
Met you bring sunshine into many lives exactly North Miami. Hello. Yeah, hi, Neil. Yes

[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.020]
Only sounds pretty good, but not good at Kathy now. How do you know that so much?

[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.840]
I'm so sweet

[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.980]
I don't know how your blood pressure remains calm when you talk to that idiot can walk

[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.340]
I think I have to call a couple of the guys who medley and have been painless

[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:34.340]
The man's total idiot. Oh, are you smoking? No, but every time I hear him and I don't know how he gets through making those

[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.700]
Holy voices up

[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.220]
Uh, my daughter and I were both listening and he haven't even got pissed off

[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.740]
Hey here that moron

[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:48.760]
There's nothing you can do about it. You can't screen him out somehow. You know that this guy has been cranking

[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.720]
Talk shows in this market for 15 years

[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.940]
Well, I mean, isn't anybody wise to him? Oh, yeah

[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.940]
Well, Southern Bell, of course, is so aggressive, you know, I mean, they just they don't want to do anything

[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:05.240]
You can the guy doesn't even deny it. I mean, he admits it. We've got he's getting out his own talk to you

[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.000]
He's getting more calls than we are now and

[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.160]
uh, he just

[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.440]
insists that these compulsory can't control himself

[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.380]
Well, he needs medical care. Well, maybe you ought to call his parents. They live in the same house their number is 932

[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.960]
4192 saw and sandy block 932

[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.400]
4192 and maybe someone ought to suggest to the block family that Kenneth needs a little bit of help. Yeah. Yeah

[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:35.900]
He definitely needs help also listen. I tied up that record of us week that the goalfanger goalfaker. Oh, yeah

Anyway, listen keep up. Kathy is just great and

[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.100]
All in listen. What can I tell you? Maybe you'll become a big league star or all that well if Neil keeps telling everyone that

[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.680]
I'm sleeping around. I'm sure that my time will come to your time

[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.600]
No question about it

[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.720]
See you later. In fact, we heard that our leanstime comes 24 hours a day

[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.700]
But that's only an ugly rule. I'm really lucky

[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.300]
Okay, it's 25 before 1 at w.i.n.z

[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:11.340]
We've got a lot of hot young ladies walking around the building here unfortunately none of them will come on here with us

[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.800]
We have an open line in day. It's 624

[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.900]
0191 and if we can bring back one of the former FM dish jockeys

[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.240]
I'm sure we could have a lot of these people in here too, man. I'm trying it. We could uh

[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.980]
Anybody seem willy-be lately?

[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.400]
You know him

[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.140]
Really? Well, we'll talk about him during the break

[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.980]
And I see Maroon. Yeah, like military intelligence jumbo shrimp team stuff

[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.180]
Think about when you were a teenager

[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.380]
Was like fire fire I sure would know but it could have been if I didn't know the animal I know now. Yeah, wow

[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.120]
I had a hell of a high school class. I'll tell you that

[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.000]
Did you who was in your high school class?

[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.840]
Lot of interesting people

[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.240]
I read this the other day and of course in this market it means nothing you sh-

[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.420]
Then this article and people sherry 17

[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.300]
What the hell am I sitting here holding the microphone for?

[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.840]
A senior in a suburban Atlanta high school says our parents just know we're out there screwing our little buns off

[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.000]
But they can't bring themselves to talk to us about it

[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.000]

[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.380]
Now wait till you hear this parents who believe they get honest answers when talking to their teens about sex

[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.020]
81 percent

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.260]
Teens who say they are totally honest when talking to their parents about sex high school 22 percent college

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.060]
27 percent so that means somewhere in between 60 percent of the kids are lying

[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:39.580]
Well, most kids don't ever they can't picture their parents ever having done it despite the evidence

[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.840]
So they there's no question

[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.060]
They don't want to really shock like they think maybe it happened once by accident and they're the product of it

[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.300]
Right is that what you thought?

[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:56.560]
I think when I told my parents obviously they only did it twice real good and in your case it had to be an accident

[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.760]
Thank you so much, but who what's that? That's an old

[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.260]
Cat in the hot tin roof. Let's hear it

[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.960]
Nothing about Paul Newman to get anybody excited

[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.320]
Oh

[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:12.000]
The picture of these what would you say they are about 16?

[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.940]
Yeah, he's got her backed up against the lockers there. I mean, that's kind of a provocative pose for people isn't it?

[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:18.780]
Got a padlock

[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.700]
This is how I was going to be kind of white

[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.600]
Kind of a fluffy

[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:23.800]
magazine

[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:31.200]
Because I I pulled this out so to speak I pulled us out to bring you here to talk to

[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.020]
What's it right after?

[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.820]
But after hearing a leaf powder doing another sex pool yesterday. There's no way that I'm gonna do it

[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.820]
He's been off for quite a while. Yeah, yeah

[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.520]
Oh

[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.380]
Ken Black I guess you believe in the freedom of expression and

[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.300]
So the last night two o'clock in the morning I call him to tell him

[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.280]
How I thought the bottle did he answer the phone?

[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.200]
Huh did he answer the phone?

[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.840]
Yes, I asked

[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.940]
I call him about two in the morning to see what he wanted to say and what do he say?

[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.020]
That's too much enough for letter words that I think the seven words you're not allowed to say

[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.060]
Unbelievable. Well, listen, maybe he can use his own show

[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:05.900]
He hit the critical

[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.160]
He doesn't mind you know freedom of expression, but he wouldn't even you know talk to us

[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.060]
So it's terrible. Well, we'd want to spread it around where if he wants to change, you know

[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.260]
To be a star. He's got to take the good one with the bad the better with the sweet

[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.940]
That's for sure. Okay. See you

[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.560]
You too, it wouldn't be better than that call yesterday. Is there any way we can

[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:25.620]

[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.340]
