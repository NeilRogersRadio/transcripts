[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340]
There's my friend cheerin' on for all.

[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.960]
I'm an 80s woman just like you and I've discovered a new pantyhose that really fits my crazy

[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.260]
lifestyle, not to mention my tremendous rear end.

[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.320]
It's the only pantyhose that tightens your tummy, flattens your thighs and whitens your

[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.540]
teeth.

[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.520]
It's made with natural fiber, calcium, iron and leaves your whole bathroom smelling fresh.

[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.540]
I demand a lot from life and I expect just as much from my hosery.

[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.720]
So I'm glad to know that this pantyhose can coat my stomach and turn hamburgers into

[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.800]
steakburgers while it reduces my tax burden.

[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.840]
What do you call a pantyhose that can do all this?

[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.420]
Sheer nonsense!

[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.300]
So on your next shopping trip, pick up the cracked egg with the picture of Pozo on the

[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.560]
front.

[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.820]
Because if you buy Sheer nonsense, you'll know you got hosed.

[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.840]
Well that's certainly a good point at which to start to show this morning and I think so

[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.280]
108 at WYNZ, well I'm getting choked up from the cigar.

[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.500]
Somebody sent over all these big Cuban cigars the other day and I'm going to smoke all

[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.780]
of them.

[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.380]
There are about 30 of them in the box.

[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.880]
I'm going to smoke them all today just to get ready for tapyhose.

[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.780]
Anyway, Bill Cosford, the movie critic, not okay hysterical because we're not going

[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.820]
to talk a lot about movies.

[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.000]
He doesn't know that yet but while I'm sure he probably does.

[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.380]
But he's going to be here at 11 o'clock for the last three hours of the show.

[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.420]
But in this first hour, I don't know how to say this.

[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.980]
I really don't but it's just so depressing and so morbid.

[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.740]
Now we're not going to talk about Westinghouse and the station being sold today.

[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.740]
That's depressing enough.

[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.440]
But Saturday show that we did here and I want to say these things in the right way because

[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.180]
I don't want to sound ungrateful to the people who came here on Saturday and who at least

[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.720]
had the guts to stand up for something.

[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.340]
Mike McKay and Bill Tanner and Irene Richard and Jeff Gonser and Jeff Chase.

[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.460]
At least we had five people from FM Radio in this market who had the guts to come here

[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.580]
and speak out on our so far campaign and speak out about free speech.

[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.960]
And I thought they did an excellent job.

[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.920]
Tanner in particular really was very articulate and knew the issues and laid it all out there.

[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.180]
The problem is that since that show, the response that we've had has been so minimal as to be

[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.520]
embarrassing.

[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.820]
I mean, I really was not even up to believe that that four hour show was going to be a catalyst

[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.480]
for just a monumental response, that the money was going to be pouring in here and that people

[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.920]
would be sending in their names and addresses.

[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.760]
And you know, the bottom line is, and I hate to say this because again, it makes me sound

[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.960]
like an in grade and I don't mean it in that respect.

[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.780]
But the bottom line is that the people who listen to those radio stations don't do anything.

[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.940]
The people who listen to FM in this market are like, they're just takers.

[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.600]
You know, they're button pushers and if they like the music at a given time, they punch it up.

[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.160]
And they listen, then as soon as somebody starts talking, they punch up something else.

[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.940]
And if you really believe that somebody who's listening to music is going to be an activist,

[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.620]
they're going to be involved or send their name and address it unless they can win something,

[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.640]
you're dreaming.

[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.820]
It just isn't going to happen.

[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.400]
And what can I say?

[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.260]
And what makes it even more frustrating is that the cowards in AM radio around this country,

[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.080]
they won't touch this thing with a 10 foot mizuza.

[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.400]
Okay, they just won't touch it.

[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.860]
They won't get involved.

[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.380]
And I keep, people keep giving me names and phone numbers and we keep calling the producers

[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.180]
of these shows all over the country, Zipity Duda.

[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.860]
Okay?

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.560]
I mean, the big deal that we had so far was the two and a half hours I did with Bob Lasseter over at WPLP in Tampa.

[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.720]
And about 15 minutes that I did with a station in Adelboro, Massachusetts, okay?

[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.000]
Those are the two biggies.

[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.420]
And the rest of the people that we've contacted plenty of them, they don't want anything to do with this.

[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.080]
All of these courageous, balsy broadcasters, you know, if they add in New York that appeared in the New York Times on Saturday,

[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.140]
if the day before Howard Stern Friday morning would have come on here and said,

[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.900]
hey, listen, pick up the times tomorrow morning and there's going to be an ad in there with, you know,

[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.880]
about free speech and about the FCC and fill out the coupon.

[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.260]
We could have had mail bags full of those coupons with names and addresses.

[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.720]
We could have really gotten it off the ground.

[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.880]
But Howard and his people operate in a vacuum and the other people in this business, most of them,

[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.980]
they're just prostitutes.

[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.740]
That's all I've told you that for years. They're just horrors. They're just taking.

[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.940]
And isn't it pathetic that a medium where we can exercise, at least to a great degree free speech

[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.360]
and try to get people involved in something, we just can't accomplish much of anything?

[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.880]
And it's really a tribute to the people in my audience into this show because from Tampa,

[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.000]
what do we get a $5 check from some guy in Clearwater out of a two and a half hour show?

[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.280]
Needless to say, from the show in Adelboro, Mass, we didn't get, and you know, we've gotten a quarter.

[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.160]
There was some guy taped a quarter to the coupon in the New York Times.

[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.380]
So we've gotten $5.25 from outside of the day, Broward Palm Beach area,

[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.880]
and the rest of it is all come from right here from my audience, which again is a great tribute to the people who listen to this show.

[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.120]
And I guess in a way, it tribute to the fact that I've gone, run with this thing since the 16th or 17th of April, the last month,

[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.060]
since the FCC came out with this ruling.

[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.340]
And I was naive enough to believe that other people in this business are going to really get on the bandwagon and fight.

[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.040]
And they don't know how to fight, they don't have the guts to do it.

[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.540]
They just sit back and, hey, I'm going to do whatever I want, and then when somebody gets taken off the ear,

[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.200]
or when this decision goes all the way to the Supreme Court and those senile right wingers up there say, hey, listen, we think this is great.

[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.880]
Then there'll be too late.

[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.500]
I mean, we've raised $13,000. We have, I think, over 10,000 signatures.

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.940]
Now, and it's all from the show, 99% of it is from this show.

[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.700]
As you know, the other AEM broadcasters in this market are too paranoid, they're not going to get involved.

[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.920]
The ones who have an opportunity to really speak to their audience and to try to motivate them.

[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.380]
We did have the one guy who's out there in San Diego today, you know, Mike Miller, with this 43,000 signatures or whatever it is,

[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:30.880]
to get the Super Bowl game here in 1990. Now, that's important. And that's really going to be, you know, very effective, too, I'm sure.

[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:40.020]
The rumor has it that about 25,000 of those signatures allegedly, you know, were gotten in one little bar where they have like 20 people a day come in.

[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.880]
So, you know, you figure that out for yourself.

[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.760]
But even assuming that it's accurate and that they got 43,000 signatures, you know what it reminds me of?

[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:55.220]
It reminds me of the first three or four months of this year when we were doing all the business with Halendale and the sweet and low and the early bird dinner.

[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:02.080]
And the man I'm telling you, we couldn't get enough media coverage. I mean, all the way around the world to the Philippines, to China,

[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.940]
AP, UPI, everybody, all the wire services wanted it. Everybody was here taking pictures.

[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.260]
All the local TV stations were just all over it. Newspapers, big spreads in the papers.

[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.480]
Halendale Vice. Did you see the amount of coverage we got in the herald this morning?

[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.620]
I mean, Linda Thornton was here almost the entire show on Saturday. And again, I don't want to sound ungrateful.

[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.300]
But here's a big article, Linda's Weekly Wednesday column about radio.

[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.700]
Seahawks hopes to make WOC and the voice of Miami again. And it's all about Spanish language radio.

[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.580]
Well, who the hell who reads the English language herald gives a damn about Spanish language radio?

[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:57.640]
And the answer is virtually nobody. Then we got Roger so far soars and we have two little paragraphs about the fact that Tanner, McKay, Gonsor, Chase and Richard joined me on Saturday,

[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:05.840]
et cetera, and so on and that, that's it. That's the coverage. The Sun Sentinel at least gave us a little bit more on Sunday.

[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:14.080]
And Channel 4 and Channel 6, I will say, did very nice job. They gave us a lot of coverage. The other channels in the market, 7 and 10, they didn't feel it was important enough to cover.

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:26.200]
They did feel it was important enough to come to the diplomat mall. That was a big stimulus. That was a big deal to come to the diplomat mall to see if a bunch of old farts were going to attack Neil. That was big news. That was important.

[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:35.260]
You see, this is the kind of world that we live in. And I can't change it and that's the sad part because the things that are important, you can't motivate people to do anything about.

[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.740]
And I guess it's a minor miracle that I've been able to motivate enough people to do what we've done so far.

[00:08:42.180 --> 00:09:00.160]
But rather than waste your money on another newspaper, rad that nobody's going to pay any attention to what we're going to do is spend most of that money to print the postcards that I talked about last week for people to send to the members of Congress, the House and the Senate, and ask them to use the port censorship and to get them involved in this.

[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.140]
And we do have Larry Smith, Congressman Larry Smith, coming on the show tomorrow for half an hour. And this is exclusively what we're going to talk about.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:18.380]
Because I'm just not going to throw in the towel. First of all, too many people have given too much money and made too much effort. And if I have to do it myself, I'll do it. But it's pretty pathetic. It's embarrassing.

[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:29.400]
And people, you know, there's another station in this town that once upon a time, I don't have to mention snooze as call letters, once upon a time, they fancy themselves. I should say we, because I was there the first six years it was on here.

[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:44.440]
We fancy ourselves as the real catalyst in the community. I mean, we were involved in every kind of campaign and try to get people involved. And isn't it amazing that not one person over there, even Winnie Ron Sacks, who is, you know, sent the letters over here about his journalism organization.

[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:55.980]
And they're all behind me. And he gave his little Laurel on channel 10 on his darts and laurels before he left over there. There isn't anybody over there who's got the guts to come on here and try to get people involved in this.

[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:07.660]
But again, it's not a South Florida issue. We shouldn't be the only ones getting people involved in this around the country. It should be every major market, every minor market ought to be involved in this. They don't want to do it.

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:21.580]
They're either not interested. They don't think it's sexy or exciting enough or they're scared or a combination of the above. I mean, God forbid that we should actually take on the FCC and bring focus attention on ourselves.

[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.820]
Like waving a red flag. Hey, look at us. We're troublemakers. It's really pathetic.

[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:45.300]
So when you think about the Gary Hart business and Tom Fiedler and McGee standing outside, you know, his townhouse in their raincoats and you think about all of that, it shouldn't surprise you at all now because the media is obviously mass media in this country are just totally in the sensation.

[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.400]
Lism and yellow journalism.

[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.940]
Things that are important like preserving our rights or preserving the democracy. Hey, who cares about that? It doesn't sell.

[00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:04.540]
That's why when you turn on that great journalist head copulate night, most of the time, you know, you've got a jury fall well on there or a Jesse Jackson or some outrageous figure in the news who gets people crazy.

[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.420]
It's 1018 at W.I.N.Z. Let's do our first break and we'll come back after this.

[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.500]
Are you looking for a new way of decorating your home or office? Then listen to this.

[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:25.660]
22 minutes past 10 at W.I.N.Z. You're on fire with it till 2 and daffy will be along and don't forget Bill Cosford of the Herald is going to be here from 11 to 2.

[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:31.240]
We'll talk a little bit about movies and a lot more about free speech and about the Miami Herald and good journalism.

[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.560]
I wonder if Cosford is going to be wearing a trench coat. Now, I don't think so.

[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.660]
I know that comes as a great disappointment to some of the people in the audience, but there actually are a few people at the Herald.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:48.480]
I really like a lot like Carl Hyerson and Cosford and Linda Thornton in spite of Linda's very minimal coverage that we got this.

[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.900]
I was really bitterly disappointed to see that.

[00:11:52.180 --> 00:12:00.640]
And maybe it's not all her fault because I did get it through the grapevine that she is under a lot of pressure to write more about Spanish language radio at the Herald.

[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.160]
So we can't really blame it on Linda directly.

[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.720]
The Herald is continuing with their bending over backward, their pandering desperately thing.

[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.820]
Remember a few months ago we were talking about the radio listings in the Herald and I think we cured them of that.

[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.720]
Remember the radio highlights had all those Palm Beach County stations that nobody can hear in Daden Broward and all those guests on the talk shows.

[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.060]
In fact, they had more Palm Beach stations than they did Daden Broward.

[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.500]
And lately since we've been screaming about that, they've stopped doing it.

[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.040]
And of course, that was part of their desperation to pander to Palm Beach County.

[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:46.320]
But now they've drawn in. Now we start out with Tomas Garcia Fusté, whose topic this morning was the anniversary of the Republic of Cuba in Esponiole of course, who's always got the first listing there every day.

[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:52.260]
I mean, you can go to the bank on it. He could be talking to Porquie Pig in Esponiole and that's going to be the first listing in the radio highlights.

[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:58.240]
And it's just a game. The whole thing, just a game. Nobody really cares about things that ought to count.

[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.720]
And the one thing about the American people, they may not be good, but at least they're consistent.

[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:09.340]
Oh, yeah, Daffy was on 23 this morning. I forgot to watch that. There was at 9 o'clock was it? Maybe some of our people, well, how would they have watched it?

[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.820]
It probably was all in Spanish, right? They must have interpreted what she said or was she doing it in Spanish?

[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:24.040]
God only knows and even he can't be sure. Well, at any rate, you know, Daffy's involved again in this very divisive business, this English only thing.

[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.640]
And I can, this is also going to disappoint some of the real hate mongers out there.

[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.360]
But I absolutely refuse to get involved in that again. You know, here we are battling for the First Amendment for the right of free speech.

[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:42.040]
The Constitution doesn't say Congress shall make no law regarding freedom of speech in English.

[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:52.800]
It just says they shouldn't make any law a bridging free speech period. You can't legislate what language people are going to speak.

[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.840]
You can't legislate common decency and courtesy. That's the real issue.

[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:09.040]
Is whether people are going to be courteous and whether they're going to try to accommodate each other and be a little bit more neighborly or whether they're going to keep using language as a weapon, which is going on in this community for years.

[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:16.860]
And the one way to guarantee that they're going to keep going on and using language as a weapon is to continue with these English only amendments.

[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:26.660]
Back when we started the thing in 1980, in Dade County, there was a reason for that. There was a message. It was a safety valve because of the Mary L. Bolivt and the other things that were going on in the community.

[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.640]
We were ready to have riots in this town.

[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:38.080]
But to continue bringing it back and rubbing salt in the old wounds over and over again and opening the community up and dividing it is so counterproductive.

[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:49.400]
And when I sit back and I watch the way this individual continues to conduct herself and continues to be involved in every kind of racial and ethnic slur, I don't understand it.

[00:14:49.700 --> 00:15:01.280]
Well, I do understand it. I'm nauseated by it. I'm revolted by it. Let's pick these poor black people up by their bootstraps. It's a big joke. This is them against us kind of mentality.

[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:15.600]
And then I begin to wonder if it's only an accident that all of these bigots get through on the air on that particular program and are given an almost unlimited amount of time to spew their hatred. I don't think it's an accident. I think it's by design.

[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:35.480]
And we ought to go back to those good days of the restrictive clauses again where all the Jews would have to be jammed into one place and all the Cubans have to be jammed into another one and certainly the blacks if we have to put up with any of them, you know, we have to jam them into some part of town where nobody would ever have to go.

[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.940]
I'm sure that there are some folks of that ilk who would love to do that. Put a big wall up. Yeah.

[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:53.140]
But God forbid that somebody should come on the air and try to give people involved in something productive and positive. See, there's a line that you draw or at least that I do.

[00:15:54.580 --> 00:16:02.380]
And I'm beginning to realize that in this community, this show is like a total vacuum. This show is unrelated to anything else that's going on in this community, even in this business.

[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:21.120]
And again, while I appreciate the enthusiasm and the financial help and the time that they gave the people from the FM coming on this show Saturday, you know, people who listen to sandpaper scraping together on a radio in the name of music aren't going to get involved in defending the First Amendment. They don't even understand it.

[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:29.860]
In addition to which, you know, I sat here and I really believe that this shows you how stupid I am at this late stage of my life.

[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:41.600]
I really believe that we had this enormous audience on Saturday that all the audiences of Tanner and Mike McCain, all these other people were tuned in and listening because they've been promoting this that we were going to do that show.

[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:50.840]
And I realize now that that's fantasy. There's no way in the world that it was going to be. Those same people who listen to them on FM were listening to FM on Saturday and listening to their music.

[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.560]
They're not going to listen to what talk show.

[00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:06.920]
And that's one of the reasons in the last four or five months we've had so many people call the show who are former FM listeners and who say, hey, we're listening to your show now because they're tired of listening to a jukebox.

[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:16.000]
Nobody has anything to say on FM. I don't think anybody's really allowed to say anything on FM. Just play the hits and shot up. That's the bottom line.

[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:26.880]
And about the only time anybody does say anything is in the morning with a given little jokes and little sexual innuendo, which the FCC is very concerned about, by the way, that's the only time you hear anybody say anything.

[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:39.640]
And that's what I've been telling you for so long is that the problem with this business is nobody has anything to say. And if they do, most of them don't have the guts to say it.

[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:54.860]
And in a lot of cases, those who might fall into neither one of those categories work for management, whether or not permitted to say what they might want to say and even have the guts to say, but they're just not permitted to say it.

[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:13.800]
And that's why if this radio station winds up being sold to a Westinghouse or a capital cities, it's very good chance you won't hear neo-roggers on this radio station because those kind of corporations don't like somebody getting on here and saying what they think and rocking the boat. They like contrived radio.

[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:26.240]
They've spent too many years in places like Pittsburgh. So you just stop and think for yourselves the difference between the enthusiasm and excitement of the media when it came to Halendale.

[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:35.860]
And even the enthusiasm of part of the audience, I mean, man, there were people just foaming at them off falling all over each other. Like this is the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of America.

[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:56.620]
I mean, here's somebody on the air actually talking about crabby old people stealing sweet and low in restaurants and J walking and pointing their canes at the traffic. Hey, it was great. It was a good time and it was fun and it was all true. And it had its place, but to think that the people in the media, my fellow colleagues, so-called journalists, were just falling all over each other.

[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:16.300]
They couldn't get in here. There were days when we had a half a dozen people in here. Over at the diplomat, Ma, man, we had AP, we had UP, we had PP. I mean, we had it all. All of TV stations were there rolling their cameras. This was a big deal. And during all of it, I kept asking myself, I don't understand this. I still don't understand it.

[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:24.840]
I mean, I think if they took the breakdown in the last rating, they would find in the month of February we had about a 10 share in midday.

[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:42.060]
I don't think that's ever happened in this market before, except maybe when there were three stations 30 years ago. I don't think it's ever happened. And why? Because we were talking about Halondale and crabby old people and playing Halondale vice.

[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:53.220]
But when somebody comes knocking on your door in the middle of the morning to find out who you're sleeping with or to take you away, don't ask me why.

[00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:02.040]
I've been talking about this for eight, nine, ten years now about the creeping fascism. In 1980, we put the rubber stamp on it.

[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:16.040]
Now everywhere we look, we've got people who want to censor books and burn books and burn phonograph records and self-appointed moralist like Tipper Gore who want to censor lyrics and records. The guy up in Bay County wants to censor the red bread badge of courage and Fahrenheit 451.

[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.900]
And we got to take Playboy and Penthouse out of the 711 stores because Ed Mies writes a threatening letter to Southland Corporation.

[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.840]
And we got a lunatic state senator up in Tallahassee who wants to ban obscene bumper stickers.

[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:36.380]
And a bunch of old bags up in Hollywood who get all bent out of shape because somebody wears a t-shirt on the beach that says life is a beach.

[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.560]
And now we got a group of nuts in Washington who want to tell us that they're going to sit and determine what we can say on the air.

[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.680]
And the majority of the people in this country couldn't give a good god damn less.

[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:58.020]
And the majority of the people in this business couldn't give a damn less. And that's the thing that makes me want to puke. This business stinks. This business is full of cowards.

[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:05.280]
And the business is full of morons who have absolutely no creativity, not an original thought in their minds.

[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:13.240]
I don't want to mention Alice again. I mean the performance he put on the air yesterday for four hours was the most intimate I only heard minutes of it off and on.

[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:26.380]
The most embarrassing crap I've ever heard in my life. I mean there are plenty of gay bars around town. If somebody wants to be a professional queen they can go into a bar and sit around and laugh and mince and titter. I've never heard anything like it in my life.

[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:34.460]
Sure we've done it. We do a lot of humor on this show. We've had a lot of laughs and all kinds of things that we do. We tell plenty of jokes but my god.

[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:44.400]
Listening to some wild lunatic mincing for four hours about rabble and time cruise and this is radio. This is somebody's idea of doing a talk show.

[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:55.760]
Boy. And Jack's 30s upset with us over here right. He put on a performance yesterday that even the Diana Ross drag queens would have been embarrassed by. I've never heard anything like it in my life.

[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:06.740]
And that's big balls radio over there. That's the the mover and shaker the talk station news and talk. Kind of like fish and chips now it's news and talk.

[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:13.880]
You can change the slogan every day follow it doesn't make any difference what you're doing is pathetic. It's embarrassing. It's humiliating.

[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:26.360]
Really involved in the community. But boy when they wanted to contrive a story about some poor bastard who had AIDS that they wouldn't allow in her studio because Mike Thompson and Lee Fowler.

[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:38.560]
The scholar were homophobic and hysterical. All the media was there the weekly news was there all the little guys with the moustaches the silly little clones were there and channel 10 was there and bishop was there.

[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:51.940]
And Dwight Lauderdale and whoever else all those silly people were there. That was big news. So instead of doing something that you believe in instead of doing anything. I mean you know we do a lot less serious subject on the show. We do almost none of it.

[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.620]
Because I know that you can't operate in a vacuum but when something does come along that's so desperately important that you care about.

[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:14.940]
You find that you're all alone out there on the limb. And the people who want to join you the few like we had here on Saturday as helpful as they might like to be the problem is that they're basically impotent because they're talking to a bunch of morons. They're talking to a bunch of automatons.

[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:31.620]
Can't you just see the little kids who listen to power 96 sending in their petitions. And again that's not a knockout Tanner because he was excellent here on Saturday and I really appreciate his being here. He means something in this market.

[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:44.780]
But unfortunately he's talking to a bunch of doodle birds. A bunch of people who don't understand it or won't understand it.

[00:23:45.640 --> 00:24:05.880]
1035 at W.I. and Z. Let's take another break here. We'll come right back. 22 minutes before 11 at W.I. and Z. Me. A. Rogers with it till 2 bill cost for it will be along from 11 to 2. And we'll see what happens. We'll see if Bill is still working at the Harold when we finish. Hey listen you know misery loves company. We might as well all go down together. Maybe he can get a job with Westinghouse opening refrigerators.

[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:17.420]
Huh? He's a Red Sox. Fanny let go and back up the boss to he can work for W.I. Z. Yeah they also make ovens. That's something to think about. I wonder what kind. Big ones.

[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:26.680]
Taffy's probably hoping that that sale does go through. How she loved the work for Westinghouse. They could make some of those extra large microwaves.

[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.660]
Could fry everybody on death row just in one trip. You know with one press into button.

[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:42.200]
Let me get the numbers out see if we got anybody that wants to say anything in the last 20 minutes of the hour. Probably not.

[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:54.360]
But we are going to go ahead and print up thousands and thousands of those postcards that are going to be sent to the members of the House in the Senate. At least I hope they're going to be sent because it's going to depend on the people who are going to fill them out.

[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.780]
But I'm not going to a back off on this you know it reminds me of calls like it every now and then well we're not going to get involved again. You started so many things and you've given up.

[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:14.280]
Well again you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink and you can't force the gutless people in this industry around the country to try to protect their own livelihoods and to protect the Constitution.

[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:24.720]
You can't you know you can't convince people at CNN or USA today or anyplace else that this is an important issue or evidently the people of Channel 7 or Channel 10. It's not really an important issue.

[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:39.760]
And you can't convince a guy like Howard Stern and his agent that it's important enough you know not not to operate in a vacuum and go out and hold a couple of rallies and have some movie star and celebrities you know show up. That doesn't get the job done.

[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:52.000]
The FCC is not impressed by that. And the members of Congress are not impressed unless of course the movie stars come in to testify like Woody Allen about colorization then they're duly impressed.

[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:02.400]
And you begin to see that a lot of these people are nothing more like a Howard Stern for example. He's nothing more than a guy who reads somebody else's material and he does it very well and he is very funny.

[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:20.060]
But he just isn't capable of doing any more than that. In fact the rally that he had in New York drew a couple of thousand people in the city of 1215 million people. He drew 2,000 2,500 people. What the hell is that? We had that many people at the diplomat mall. Hollywood hello.

[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:48.580]
Hi. I got a calm down a little bit. You will make it through the day. Oh I'm very calm. I'm in a coma. You have hit the thing on the head so close and so so quick in this program. I took my breath away. The audiences of radio music stations are like they're out of it. Yeah they're out of it. I don't even know why anybody would advertise on one of those stations because they're not listening to commercials anyway.

[00:26:48.580 --> 00:27:18.560]
As soon as the spot comes on they punch the button. I know I do. Right. Right. But but you've said something that a lot of people have thought and have left unsaid and that's that it's just they put their head in the sand. They don't want to hear anything that I want to be bothered. They have enough trouble making it through the day with their everyday problems and music is an escape. As long as they have their boom boom box and their Konga and their crying cowboy music and their bumper stickers on their trucks and

[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:48.240]
yeah that's their life and you are have become you know it's the truth but they view it as entertainment and that's I think why Howard Stern up there in New York hasn't been able to to muster up the support that he felt he had like like the people that came on your program from the FM stations. Yeah. Well you have to know how to do it. You have to know how to mobilize people and how to motivate them and do something other than sit around and say dickhead 50 times. It doesn't take a lot of talent to do that. They they are under an illusion.

[00:27:48.640 --> 00:28:02.660]
That those people are dedicated to them and they love them. They're only listening to the music beyond that they don't care about any of that. Stern doesn't play any music but the bottom line they're listening to hear you know the words that he uses and what it gets away with on the air and to get a good laugh which is fine.

[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:17.880]
But if that's all you can do and you can't you can't mobilize anybody or do anything then you're really impotent. Yes well you know I don't know what I'm going to do. When you've got when you've got the public airwaves you know when you realize the whole FM band in this country is impotent all it is is just a jukebox.

[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:30.000]
There is I can't think of anybody on FM in this country anywhere who says anything who has an audience that will do anything. Well even on unless they're you know given away a quarter of a million dollars yeah then they can get a lot of phone calls.

[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:41.700]
Even TMI radio and some of the other stations they say nothing either. Correct that's right. The news the different kind of music. Yeah but the you know the masses are asses. I don't know if I can say that.

[00:28:42.820 --> 00:29:06.020]
Well look if we if in one radio program here we can get 13 thousand dollars in about a month and we could put them add in a major newspaper in the you know the New York Times and we could you know get 10 15 thousand signatures on petitions you can imagine if we had out just a hundred there are 12 thousand radio stations if we had a hundred of them around the country would be participating we could have a million signatures that was the idea the whole thing to begin with.

[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:27.220]
I have to say something that's not intended as to you directly but but causes sometimes have to be fought with with different people pushing that cause rather than the person concerned you you find us in every industry I'm in an industry we have the same kind of problem with with trying to do away with it.

[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:43.000]
And we found the only spokesman that we get behind our cause were those people in the industry no one else cared yeah they were sympathetic they listened they agreed on and everybody says it'll never happen and and unfortunately it nearly did happen.

[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:49.120]
Well all I can say is that it just doesn't have to do with the industry and again that is a perfect example. Yeah.

[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:58.980]
I thought it mean it's not meaningful and now all of a sudden everybody's realizing it's going to take big den out of their pocket book and there's not much they can do about it is there.

[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:05.220]
Well not much they're going to do about it that's about online they're not much they're going to do that's a sad thing Miami hello.

[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:14.380]
No yes. I'm glad I wasn't the only one listening to Alice yesterday I was just mesmerized I could not believe what I was hearing.

[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:44.360]
I am so appalled I can't even put it into words because he has reached a new low and we're not even on at the same time anymore so there's no competitive factor but I'm so disappointed and so disillusioned I mean you know again some there has to be a point in your life when you grow up and instead of just being a copycat instead of just trying to do something more outrageously and be childish you've got to know where to draw the line and when when there's a time to do certain things and when there's a time to use your time usefully and this guy I don't know what I'm doing.

[00:30:44.360 --> 00:31:05.180]
So what he's thinking about I have no idea he just he's just become a a simple thing. Well I think that show was apropos one of our Navy ships was just hit and yeah there's famine going on so I think that was that was an apropos but about an hour to show was spent with Jack Sturdy talking about the moose in Alice's hair I don't know if you were listening to that.

[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:14.640]
I didn't hear that but it was just unbelievable I was mesmerized I'm glad that you got to listen to a little bit of it. I couldn't believe it I really and truly couldn't believe it.

[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:30.400]
And you know the weekly news the gay newspaper in this community the people over there who are so upset with me those petulant queens over there who are so upset they ought to hang their heads in shame because I guarantee that they're the first ones that the right wingers are going to come after if they continue to hold power in this in this country.

[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:53.620]
They're the first ones they're going to come after and ship off to the oven just like they didn't Germany but O'Neal said something that you rubbed somebody over there the wrong way evidently so they don't send me to paper anymore and they're not they're not involved in our free speech campaign at all they're more they're more interested in coming on and acting like professional queens on somebody else's talk show then coming on here and discussing things that are important like survival.

[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:12.100]
And I'm I just can't even begin to put into words the nausea that I feel for people who just refuse to help themselves who refuse to stand up and have any balls pathetic it's like we're dealing with some kind of a juvenile game.

[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:34.740]
Well the Constitution what's that what's that CNN has been running this thing during the bicentennial this year is the bicentennial the Constitution and they've been running these features I'm sure many of you have seen about the founding fathers and on the various amendments and the first amendment is one that to keep showing over and over again Congress shall make no law.

[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:43.980]
Well I tell you the founding fathers are rolling over in their graves right now North Miami hello.

[00:32:43.980 --> 00:33:04.220]
Good morning to you yes and we got to the lack of motivation in this area I think you missed a little item on the news and your station last week farewell came on the air complaining that they preach the unneeded nine million dollars seven million.

[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:14.840]
I didn't miss it but the open calling to the news report this morning Monday's mail guarding over one million.

[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:25.820]
Yeah I saw it on the news last night and this is the most ever because one day they can take it in the pocket for something as ridiculous as that.

[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:42.500]
And this is after they've already been shown where their money is going we've seen a Mercedes and we see all the jewelry and we see all the other the big screen TVs and the mansions and all of this other business and these people still want to be con man there's nothing you can do to insult those people.

[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:50.820]
But boys say hey listen you know there are a bunch of right wing fascists who are trying to destroy our freedoms and make this into a fascist state.

[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:55.280]
Oh yeah he's overreacting let's you know we want to be entertained.

[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:18.800]
I'm embarrassed to be in this business I really am I'm humiliated and I'm embarrassed and as I said the other day when when serious journalists in quotes consider buffoons like Sam Donaldson to be a journalist to be legitimate and talk about him is you know it even legitimize him by talking about him.

[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.180]
And what the hell are we talking about it's a big joke.

[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.540]
Miami hello.

[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.860]
Hi Neil. Yes.

[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:46.000]
I'm gay and I'm really depressed over the weekly news what they're doing they're not helping the gay community at all they're more or less.

[00:34:46.000 --> 00:35:05.900]
They're not helping anybody all they're doing is putting a lot of advertising in what it's right writing about Joe McCoy and his pet cat and all those other super silliest childish things that they write about but when they when they have the opportunity to really step forward really get involved in something you know meaningful against the group of people are always the first one to be oppressed in this society I don't see anything going on.

[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:30.360]
Yeah which is the latest findings of the blood and age of the nation actually having blood on a on a worker you know that worker get aids but excuse me who nervous here but I'm trying to act this now I'm trying to act with way back when we started to engage in having disease mostly so that's not what I have to say.

[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.600]
Okay. Thank you.

[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:48.320]
10 minutes before 11 at W.I. and Z let's take our last break at the our bill cost for it will be here at 11 a clud it because first of almost people aren't gay and secondly most gay people don't even have access to it or ever come across it.

[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:59.580]
But the bottom line is I think if nothing else they're perfect for this market they fitted perfectly with the media in this market because they're more interested in playing personalities and being childish than they are in really dealing with the important issues.

[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.760]
What if you bought their oxen?

[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:12.560]
No it's really amazing everybody that wants to call in now wants to tell me that Barbara Studdley is testifying me for the the wrong gate hearings which I already know and I did hear her name mentioned last week and it came as no surprise.

[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:27.780]
See I said for at least two years on the air every night desperately trying to tell the public in this community what a fraud she was she was nothing but a front for a group of right wing fanatics Dr Joe Chirba up there in his right wing whatever they call that organization of his.

[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:43.720]
And when she left the radio air the air waves they got a nice push job nice honest job selling arms to third world countries and I told you that couple of years ago and boy did she have people in this community snuckered and she did she have much of the Jewish community snuckered.

[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:54.280]
Oh my dear friends the Jewish people that you I love my love my friend Monocca Megan I mean here's this little idiotic Gentile out of Nashville with an IQ of minus 500.

[00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:05.360]
And boy all she's got to do is come on the air and go running around and speaking at a Dosa and speaking at this temple you see you can't tell the people the truth because they don't want to hear the truth don't confuse them with the facts.

[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:16.280]
All they want to see is a face man or woman is the case maybe somebody who comes up with a good glib tongue and tells a good story and whispers all the things in their ear that they want to hear and all of a sudden man they're mesmerized.

[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.940]
That's how we got Ronald Reagan that's how we got a moron like Jimmy Carter.

[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.940]
That's why we get the kind of leadership that we get that's why we got a Bob Martinez in Tallahassee.

[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.380]
I mean this man on a scale of zero is minus infinity.

[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:39.340]
This man is is he makes Bob Graham and Ruben ask you look like God okay like Jesus re incarnate but boy we sure loved him didn't we?

[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:48.580]
We couldn't get enough of him because he came on television with those ads showing Steve Pagik with the spectacles on looking like a goon.

[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.360]
And boy we shouldn't want a governor who looked like that did we know we wanted a governor who looked like Dracula.

[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.180]
Only this one isn't just a blood sucker he sucks the money out of the taxpayers in the state.

[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.640]
I'm not going to elaborate on it line I could but I won't.

[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:14.280]
So those of you who are just so mesmerized that Barbara Studdlies on your TV said if you're watching cable news network today during the Iran gate hearings don't be surprised.

[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:21.000]
Oh yes a good patriotic American selling weapons to third world countries terrific.

[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:31.880]
And boy I'll tell you that the frustration night after night after I think I think today is going to be D day for me it's going to be the day I declare my own independence.

[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.840]
Independence day on the Neil Rogers show.

[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.200]
The emancipation proclamation.

[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:48.640]
We might as well just do our thing you know that we've been doing the last four or five months and I'm going to continue with the postcard effort on so far.

[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:55.960]
But that's it man I mean this is strictly it's strictly a it's a nursery school this whole country.

[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.180]
It's a nursery school for adults.

[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:07.480]
And that's what you want that's what you're going to get and yeah you hear a lot of people in fact if a Westinghouse or Cap City buys this station.

[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.500]
If they don't do news all day they'll put some people on the arrow come in and read the front page headlines.

[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:20.520]
Oh my gosh isn't it terrible about the Stark and the Iraqis and oh boy how do you think the families feel of those 37 young Americans who are dead.

[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:33.640]
Does it take a genius to know to figure out how the families feel of those 37 kids who died for no reason at all just like the 260 Marines and the hostages and Leon Klinghofer and you know so many others.

[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:39.820]
Robby Steedham Americans are dying all over the world under Ronald Reagan but don't you know connect it to it's all disconnected.

[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.380]
The American people I think we've come full cycle I think we finally have reached that point.

[00:39:49.420 --> 00:40:00.320]
At which the American people have been so desensitized to reality and so desensitized the horror and the nightmares and the war and the death and everything that they're just it's you know I don't know if there's any turning back.

[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:07.460]
It's like we're all falling out of a spaceship and I you know I'd hate to think that I'm going to have to be around when we finally hit the bottom.

[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:20.860]
Anyway we're out of time for this hour real uplifting first hour Bill Cosford's coming along from the Miami Herald which is always uplifting and Bill will be here to talk a little bit about movies and hopefully we're not going to get into movie gossip barway.

[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:29.180]
I mean we're not going to do that today and talk about you know Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise Alice I want to tell you because I know you're listening right now.

[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:33.900]
Look in the mirror. Look in the mirror Alice. Do you like what you see?

[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.520]
Run out of news whether sports or something worth talking about check in here.

[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.520]
They do really support a lot of the causes like this.

[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.880]
We've got 23 of those jackets are already grabbed up. I told you see you have little faith Glenn always runs around.

[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:58.320]
Now let it happen like the add in the times here it is right in my hot little hand is our add in the prestigious New York Times and people said it could never happen.

[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.700]
Do you buy it in the post in the Washington past? That's coming.

[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.380]
Good one paper a week with your permission. Yeah one paper a week. I mean unless of course it is my favorite.

[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:14.580]
I'm going to buy some humongous amount of money. But anyway so we've got two of the jackets left. It might be vice jackets monogram with your name or obscene word or whatever.

[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:24.700]
So if you want to call real quick like look at those brow lines started already day 624 0191 and inbrowards 764 0707.

[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:33.040]
Something else I want to make sure I do every hour give the address for so far for the petitions or because I know that all of you your vast audience is our listening day.

[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:43.640]
Half past audience. That's Glenn's audience. All you got to do is write on a postcard or in a letter if you can't afford donation you know first of all you're probably cheap but if you can't afford it that's okay.

[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:53.860]
Just write on a postcard or in letter I support so far and free speech that's all is that asking a lot. We ought to be inundated we ought to be up to our puppets in letters right by Monday.

[00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:06.960]
I think we need to say several times for the folks who just tune in that this is more ominous than it sounds a lot of people say well what is the need for Neil Rogers to be able to say douchebag on there.

[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.720]
What is the need for how it's during the day.

[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:19.140]
They don't understand a real issue. This is the beginning of a very dangerous precedent which is against the fundamental freedoms guaranteed does by our constitution by the first amendment to the constitution.

[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:47.860]
Okay we'll pick up on that right after the news let me give you address again for your donations and for your name and address so far that's S.O.F.A.R. Save our first amendment rights so far P.O. Box 2214 Miami 33055 that was much too fast wasn't it so far P.O. Box 2214 Miami 33055 Jeff Braze here with the headlines world news from CBS 11 and we'll come back with our cast of thousands here at 1106.

[00:42:47.860 --> 00:43:10.040]
This morning got a big spread on the FM AM jockies that make any sense AM jocking FM radio I don't understand it and it's got a big huge spread here on all of these important people study Fox and Herman and McBean and Kevin Kitchens definitely one of my favorites but you can only listen to him in the kitchen.

[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:39.840]
But boy that's what it's all about Bill Cosford is here the cryptic movie editor movie critic whatever the hell he is for the Miami Harold and no you're that's not what it is anymore though isn't entertainment editor did I confuse the two of them I mixed them there I think you know it's it's in the paper almost every day right under my name I don't read your page don't read that paper now you will again won't you know you've gone through this cycle before no way I won't subscribe to it again I read it for example I read Linda Thornton's little piece about Spanish language radio this morning in the little

[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:54.240]
tiny blurb that she gave us on our campaign for the site for the first amendment yes I heard you discussing that yeah was great well you felt this should have been more on so far unless if not nothing on Spanish language

[00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:09.700]
no I think the reverse would have been perfect I think if the rest of the article would have been on the first amendment and what we're doing and on what we had here Saturday and the little couple of paragraphs would have been on WOC and I think that would have been more appropriate because most of the people who read the Harold those who are remaining

[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:21.800]
who read the Harold speak English don't listen to WOC and or WRHC or WQBA that's the radio mom B except that the we have long had a problem as has every other

[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:31.580]
English language media may think in the entire area that there's this whole other thing out there as you well know that this thing that operates in Spanish that we've never known

[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:37.180]
what do you mean by thing well it this whole other spank you know combination of Spanish language media but doesn't

[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:49.240]
which really seem logical or that that would have belonged in L Harold because the people who get their news in Spanish and correct me if I'm wrong our most likely to read it in Spanish also wouldn't want

[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:56.320]
there's no some logic to that and L Harold has its own radio TV column sure but we we need to know we went 10 years without reporting very much of

[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:03.460]
anything what was going on if for no other reason than we didn't have a radio TV reporter who spoke Spanish which is a real problem but you know

[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:10.500]
as well as I do that stuff goes on at those stations but you're not reporting what really goes on see that's the thing that's frustrating oh I think you'll find

[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:17.600]
increasingly that we are but at least reporting you know what now reporting about the managed news control news and the pandering to the

[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:24.260]
astro mentality I think to the industry of the Rogers and other people in the market on I don't know Spanish language

[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:29.040]
radio report to smearing of New York Rogers that might be just something we'd let slide for a while both been going on for

[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:37.800]
a year so I guess you've been letting it slide who's going to fill the silence that was not just a listen you're the one who you started right

[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:43.120]
off on this I was trying to get your title right and all of a sudden you started defensively well no no I don't think I'll

[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.760]
say for Linda Thornton when she was here last Friday at least she wasn't defensive I wanted to encourage you may have been

[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:54.400]
offensive but you was in your old again only kidding when the don't get sensitive now you know that Joe Johnson and its Linda

[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:59.960]
and they're both going to get upset you know that those of us who can you know round up some Harold's descriptions get free

[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.860]
prizes and stuff like it mugs visors oh I wish I had saved that did you see the card that they've ever just no

[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:10.460]
I've been pressed on it and you know one thing brought stars in the mail yesterday from the station he really had no no place for your

[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:17.540]
name and address no well someone so they just have a card and they paint for the postage and I checked all the boxes you know send me all

[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:22.860]
the free gifts you'll meet my favorite thing about those cards I would have enclosed my payment but there was no envelope but

[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:27.160]
there's no you get that a lot I get it from magazines to checking close you know how do you close it check it

[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:32.640]
post post on postcard right now apparently what they want you to do is put that in an envelope put your own stamp on it

[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:38.940]
that way they save some money I don't know but what they do by putting it on a postcard they discourage you from paying

[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:44.320]
now they encourage you to check bill me well the way newspapers working but I get a couple months with the free

[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:50.420]
papers that way great sure good idea did you hear that folks and takes them at least that long to catch up with you

[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:56.700]
good so just check it off on your bill me and then when to get the bill throw it in the waste basket now that's illegal

[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:04.060]
you're the one that advocated though is that a legal your own news I think that's just that's just sure it's you when you order something

[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:10.660]
and you don't pay for well maybe you're dissatisfied with it I'm not going to sit here and get strategy for people to beat the

[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:14.260]
hero that's ridiculous you're the one who just came up with it he said here's a good way to get a couple of

[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:19.000]
months of free papers I told you when he leaves here today cost for it will be working for the West Kendall

[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.580]
Gazette well if that you know or sturdy maybe looking for a job after yesterday you might rightfully

[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:29.780]
knew I remember when I was in college that was the trick you'd always send away for trial subscriptions

[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.960]
of magazines you get through whole semester I thought the jack sturdy was a movie critic I didn't realize

[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:39.240]
that he was the loo well apartions of uh... south florida he said he's apparently his

[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:45.820]
he had a problem this not to his in dish right he's in what dish dishing people he seems to know more

[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.220]
about the inner workings of uh...

[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:53.360]
effective degree heart tip may have come from jack sturdy i don't know yeah they said it was a woman

[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.780]
but i'm a friend of the whole he knows more about uh... more of the kinds of things that shouldn't be any of our

[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.640]
business about how the stars and the paper but he and he has an encyclopedia knowledge of it

[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.380]
to the man's life i heard some of the things that he said yesterday i think most of it was swishful thinking

[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.540]
what kind of thinking was that

[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.220]
uh...

[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:17.600]
anyway of one of the amazing things i said we were going to talk a lot about movies today and i don't know

[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.040]
you know if that disturbs you but you really don't ever want to talk about movies i always want to talk about

[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.660]
no you don't know you that doesn't want to and your audience doesn't want to know we're not interested in

[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:28.740]
but i thought you are usually more interesting things going on

[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:33.780]
well you wrote that you know i'm a couple weeks ago in fact they've written two really good columns in a row which is incredible

[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:38.800]
which is stagering stagering the one that is um... colorization which i thought was great this last Sunday

[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:43.280]
see i did go on i bought the herald not specifically to read that but i did happen to look at it

[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.000]
in self defense rather than going out and buying the herald you should subscribe because it don't know

[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.640]
change money that way no chance zero chance

[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.120]
and uh... the previous week you wrote one was it the week before

[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:59.200]
about this uh... so far camp two weeks before and we need a reem of petitions and hurry and i read it on the air

[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.980]
and it was great well and we think of all over you for it and uh... in the meantime

[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:08.420]
uh... you know we could send fifty reams of petitions out of the bottom line is that nobody in the

[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.980]
media rewants to get involved in this thing that's the other half of what i was saying i i understand why we cover a

[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.580]
latin spanish language broadcasting and i think we probably ought to do more and deeper

[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:23.800]
of that kind of coverage but what i don't i'm not so happy about is that we reduce the two barat

[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.720]
paragraphs this particular crusade um...

[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.220]
but talking first amendment to american people is just it's not

[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.940]
it ought to be a really easy thing to do but most people don't see any problem

[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.900]
but what people believe the first amendment is

[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:44.060]
a freedom of speech means you can say whatever they want you want as long as they like it

[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.480]
yes and then you say something they don't like the thing well you should be allowed to say that

[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.860]
a classic example of that is that you know there's a there's a tacit

[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:56.240]
uh... reluctance by anyone in public essentially to uh...

[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.880]
to discuss religion you just don't

[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.880]
you know there's this idea that you there are some things you don't make fun of religious beliefs or one well

[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:08.020]
why not well we live in a society in which people who believe one way are constantly

[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:12.560]
bombarding us with the reasons that we should join them but on the other hand in mainstream media

[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.840]
you will very rarely find anybody commounts and uh... and do the kind of the hero that you do here

[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:22.160]
well you're not going to find the hero lining up against uh... against organized religions certainly not

[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.540]
why not because the hero like uh... i would guess virtually all the newspapers still lives by

[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:31.540]
that particular dictum that there are some things quote that you don't say good counts there are

[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:32.640]
sacred cows and that is

[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:38.340]
and if religion religion is going to be the last sacred cow essentially but note how thing you know barriers are breaking

[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.320]
you can now say come to me anywhere you want

[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.840]
and six months ago no one would say come to me yeah even bob cocks the mayor for a lot of the i came on the

[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.060]
uh... station here some time ago a couple of months ago

[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.560]
and uh... i think it was one day i was out he was on with her and he's so chan and he said condom

[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.340]
on the air and he couldn't believe it that he'd actually said it that he just bought one

[00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:00.080]
you didn't know what it meant he moving into one of your field you didn't know what it meant but he said it

[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.340]
so that's a step in the right

[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:02.420]
direction

[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.100]
for the mayor for a lot of the localists uh... pretty soon there won't be anybody young enough to wear one

[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.160]
in for a lot of the because all of the people remaining will be impotent so it doesn't really make much

[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.520]
different less the headquarters the weekly news to be very careful always it really i believe it's in for a lot of

[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:20.360]
like i said most of the people remaining will be but that's another story anyway before we get into the

[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.980]
really the heart of the matter here

[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.600]
the astonishing news and i don't know how many months it's been that we've been prodding you

[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.160]
to watch this movie and it and it would seem as though we're making much about nothing we just

[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.700]
mentioned religion because it's not a major movie

[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:38.260]
not the end of the world but mass appeal with jack lemon and it's it i've asked you about

[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:42.760]
several different times because i thought it was a pretty uh... honest movie i thought that was the

[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.440]
thing that i liked i guess the catholic church wouldn't appreciate that and you finally

[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:51.760]
sought through the intercession of your uh... spanking new producer uh...

[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.100]
are spanking producer giggling glenda what it is that makes him like that he he produced

[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.460]
or he produced for me a tape of this and actually made it you know this show is getting

[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:05.720]
kind of rising in its professionalism and ability to get things done now oh yeah you actually

[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:10.340]
service your guest only to see your we service our guests and it's not what glenda for i

[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:15.960]
provided this tape uh... exchange for a useful ever get what consideration you know really

[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.380]
wasn't interesting movie was better than i thought it was going to be for one thing and had about

[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:23.620]
the only tolerable performance by jack lemon i've seen in twenty years he was not playing that

[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:27.600]
that's why we got rid of our last producer she wouldn't service the gas no he's still back on

[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.800]
that one are you know she didn't as a matter of fact i don't think i ever met her either

[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:31.720]
today

[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.160]
now who knows who cares

[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:39.560]
she's a really mobile service operative is just got a resume that's going to be incredible i'm sorry

[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.520]
i interrupted you and you were telling us about having seen the movie but i think we'll do

[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:48.200]
the commercial break first and then while i'm stealing your lighter one thing we ought to tell glen

[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.900]
is if we're going to have guests on a show let's make sure that there are people who bring lighters

[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.160]
every new industry

[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.540]
or you just think about howl and i'll

[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.700]
i said nothing about howl and i'll find city by the bay

[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.500]
bill cost for this year we're going to be joined later by howl and they'll may or sonny rosinberg

[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.760]
but uh... you were starting to talk about the mass appeal with jack lemon

[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.620]
which is another one of those movies that i like and you probably didn't because you have a bias

[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:14.720]
against jack lemon to begin with well i do have a bias against jack lemon he's a piece

[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:19.140]
whiny and creepy and he's played the same part over and over and over he can't help himself and

[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:23.160]
he's like ron sex he's um...

[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.680]
i see you're going to get one of those brickpats if he ever gets back

[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:31.480]
i don't think he will no i don't think after he's gone on that show i don't think i don't think he's

[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.740]
moving in an upward direction he's not upwardly mobile he's downwardly mobile we prefer

[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:40.720]
to have him as a distinctive new voice yeah radio okay now what were you saying about jack lemon

[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:47.860]
but the guy he's like jimmy steward only on this like a mouse in his throat so he just he can't

[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.620]
he can't see things normally all he can do is infuriate you he's

[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.440]
ordinarily now in missing he was different missing he just played the part of a father whose

[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.820]
yeah kid was missing great the guy can really act in this he plays the part of this priest

[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.980]
who's been jiving his congregation because he wants to like him all the time

[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:12.100]
it's a hell of a performance they really really yeah boy no i enjoy staggering i enjoyed the movie

[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:16.180]
thoroughly i had i racked it up and uh... because it's been a busy week and i'd expected okay i'll do

[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:21.300]
half an hour this see what's going and then uh... by the now i have an author you know if i've

[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.680]
done an hour of it then i'll be able to go and say nila seen half of it and that will produce some

[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.460]
humor but in fact i i couldn't turn it off so i watched the whole it's i think it's more than two

[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:33.540]
hours long it's not a short movie did not get good reviews when it came out why not i think because

[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:39.620]
a lot of uh... movies that are based on plays often get mediocre reviews because most in

[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:44.920]
New York critics see all the plays and one state seen the play um they kind of have a way they

[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:49.000]
want to come to the movies in this never that way it's always somebody else's way so they invariably

[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.300]
get better reviews and i not having seen the play i thought the movie was fine it was interesting

[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.260]
and it did not go in the direction you thought i was going to i don't think that'd be a big threat

[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:01.720]
to the Catholic Church i mean if they're going to know we kept saying all through the movie about

[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.320]
if you want to be a priest you've got a line well yeah that's that's a problem i was an awful lot

[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:09.660]
of talk about priests you know in fact the best line in the movie what's the fat guy who plays

[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:14.380]
the mon senior he's a dirty charles during yeah charles during and he said you know he said it's

[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.160]
not bad enough that we have enough priests who are in the closet he said now we've got one who's

[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.160]
been in now he's out and now he wants to go back in again or some some who i'm forgetting exactly

[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.400]
what the line was but it was a great line and of course bearing out what i've said all along is

[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:31.080]
that anybody who meets a straight priest is you know obviously fantasizing but uh...

[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.760]
well far be it for me to comment on that i'm not trying to get you involved in that conversation

[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:39.440]
i'm not catholic see i'm uh... i'm non evangelical Protestant which meet which is the easiest thing to be

[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.300]
in the world i mean all you do is that's like almost being neutered well you go on sunday and you

[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:47.340]
kind of not off and you come home yeah and and are any other like there's no other these duties

[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.820]
that you have to do you don't have to worry you can't say that word on here anymore please do these no

[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.680]
no this i might pronounce you in fact the last two years here you were the one you were the one last

[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:00.360]
time talking about the two guys named dick at the mimey herald there i'm not even going to repeat

[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.240]
what you said probably more than two men named dick at the mimey herald there are there maybe

[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:08.820]
dozens or even a hundred because i'm just different plays a great many people in the church it's a

[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:12.240]
common so you can quote cost for just saying that there are a lot of dicks who work at the mimey herald

[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.560]
what is that what you just said i'm sure that's true

[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:19.180]
yeah i'm i'm sure it's and i'm sure the james mccinny is probably monitoring right now would be very

[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:23.800]
upset want to probably miss and thirpid what you said well in that case you know he will uh... have

[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.700]
observed it sometimes in the last week a number of people have said frigate on the air all over

[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:32.560]
these united states and i wonder you know to see if there's going to be any fallout on that

[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.020]
you know well that's why i haven't touched that story because i don't think you can say that you

[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:40.020]
can't say frigate now i've done it now twice you have to just take with him name the star your problems

[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.640]
and he will well i don't i don't want to dump mass appeal now you got me thinking about the fcc thing again

[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:51.020]
but um no i miss appeal is a better movie than not given a credit for i think it's a solid three

[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.960]
star good movie i think anybody was in chance to see it on the sea it so in other words it wasn't

[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.980]
like jinks there wasn't a movie that only neo-rodgers like nobody else in the world it was not an

[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:05.260]
example of the movie for which you are the soul fan even i watched it again since you were here last

[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:10.180]
time i think i'm asking you jinks that's even people they move out of the jinks about it

[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:14.400]
even people on the crew won't admit that they did it see this is the problem with guys like you

[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:20.260]
is that you you're kind of like the fcc and your own mind you've set yourself up kind of like

[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:27.180]
judge and jury and you decide what is good and what is not good and with you don't give an opinion

[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:32.240]
you don't just write and say hey in my opinion this is great this was fantastic where it was

[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:37.240]
garbage which is usually what you're right that it was garbage but you write it as fact and if

[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.900]
you are the barometer you're the judge and and the jury and you decide what's good and all movie

[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:49.480]
critics do that yes they do well no the some of the worst ones will say now i think now i teach

[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.340]
a course this university miming this the first our first lesson with repeat over and over again

[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:58.120]
we never say i think or in my opinion no it is stated as fact it is great and so alzy movie

[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:02.100]
or this is a great movie yeah well the only one that doesn't do that of course is their own don

[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.720]
stutter i thought i'd give donna plug because he's listening now getting very upset because you're on

[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.820]
the show and which is his problem is is done out there agitated oh don is always when you're on

[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:15.340]
the show he goes nuts he can't handle it i saw don he just has an nervous breakdown almost there

[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:20.800]
he does with these little shades of the lights like a yellow and amber and puse and whatever walk

[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.860]
don't worry which is a way of lawfully i guess and not making a definitive statement

[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:32.540]
well i did my favorite don stutter story tellable on the air that is is the time he was on him was

[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.920]
and was ripping us for giving stars and i don't give those little stars you know a one star two

[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:41.080]
star three star well no in fact he gives red light green light yellow light um

[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:48.080]
but there are a few of us who like giving up those little designations that's just that those

[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:52.120]
are gimmicks those are designed for people who we assume don't read but the bit yes when we

[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:58.000]
give our opinion we don't say well i think and yet any more than you do when you come on to

[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.900]
someone that you know you don't say you know this program you do i appear wrong i've always said

[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.920]
that this program is a program of opinions they pay me to come on here and give my opinion well

[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.080]
and that's what i'm paid to do too but i take it as if i mean i would make jokes about this but

[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:15.800]
the serious truth is we take it as a given that people understand in a review you're just getting

[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:21.560]
one opinion i would never want anyone to act conclusively on one of my reviews conclusively enough to

[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:25.800]
make a difference in the box office for instance me read the review and you make up your own mind you

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:31.020]
don't that's why i never say don't go or sysklin hebert periodically will come across a film and

[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:35.120]
say this should be burned yeah and and and they're being cute but a lot of people think that they

[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:40.480]
should be burned they well Roger would make quite a bonfire that man would he would go up like a

[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:46.900]
human torch no question about it he is packing some poundage there yeah and he he makes you as a

[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:51.620]
matter of fact look quite similar like Mickey Mouse definitely but the roger gets good press he was in

[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:56.380]
uh... in the USA today the other day commenting on video discs of something they did a big feature

[00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:00.380]
and here's this man mountain in front of his display on the guy makes about a million dollars a year

[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.880]
on because easy for him you know he's unbelievable i think this is the highest in my first hour this

[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:12.900]
is what america has degenerated into vano white and sysklin ebert or a bearer well however we

[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:17.440]
pronounce his name this week i think this is what we've become is entertainment tonight i predicted that

[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.460]
a long time ago in fact i've now predicted one night you'll turn on the network news and it'll be

[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.400]
just like in the movie network instead of having a regular newscast it'll be just like entertainment

[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.520]
tonight and there'll be a fortune teller and there'll be you know box popular i think it's on the movie

[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.980]
network we're already seen the beginnings of it uh... you uh... note that the ABC nightly news has

[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:41.140]
person of the week once we know this is one of the dumbest features that ever come across person of

[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:45.420]
the week is uh... and you know this begin promoting it on wednesday and coming up the other week

[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.920]
our person of the week

[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.220]
well who gives up uh...

[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:54.420]
a mark fowler or whatever who ate you know who ABC thinks is person of the week in it and they

[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:59.100]
it's never the person who may have done the most interesting thing or or contributed something it's

[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.740]
always the most notorious person or you know i mean i don't think that i've been president

[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:06.520]
uh... it's just a ridiculous thing it's it's a complete gimmick

[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.480]
designed to hype you know be sure to tune in and that kind of thing it's absurd and the

[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.760]
and i was really the other day that

[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:17.740]
ruin all of his all-up set cuz abc is moving twenty twenty to a time slot where he's afraid to show my go off the air

[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.080]
which strikes me as the first

[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.380]
single movement toward good taste at abc is done in years because if we can just get twenty twenty

[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.080]
off the air or the if i have to watch barber walkers treated as a real news person one was not

[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:34.080]
incredible at you know my skin wants to crawl off and i see that president wagon today say you know here

[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.500]
she is writing letters you know if i'm your and the president and she can't even put

[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.500]
pronounce it you know i mean this is what a joke you know our lives have been reduced to such

[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:48.900]
bayonality that it's unbelievable it's incredible and the the the most frightening part of it is is

[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.640]
that most people are too stupid to understand that it's happening and even if they do understand

[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.060]
it's happening they don't seem to care

[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.920]
no well what we in the news business of a problem i mean it's a big problem all the little problems we

[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:07.020]
think we have the biggest one is that people's conception of the news continues to change it

[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:11.440]
continues to get softer and uh... we have to follow or at least we think we have to follow

[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:12.820]
uh...

[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.260]
the new york times about the only institution i can think of

[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.060]
it seems able to resist the press happen to have this morning's right here

[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:23.920]
and yet right to my door and it's blue container and it's blue container they do they do deliver it

[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:27.220]
unfortunately the national edition of the times is a big disappointment compared to the

[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:32.520]
the metro edition in york but doesn't think you can do everything but even the times uh... ten years ago

[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.480]
did launch those soft sections that for a while that everybody saying all the time is gone soft

[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.160]
they did launch uh... you know the home section the science section all the rest and some of those

[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:47.100]
sections are really pretty creepy if you look at the home and living sections uh... you discover

[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:53.880]
the times gives a tremendous news hole to telling people who make more than most people in this building

[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:59.440]
combined um... how to throw parties on the upper side and how to pick uh... you know the proper

[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.480]
maid in this kind of interest

[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:05.800]
you isn't news at all it's to aim to the specific demographic in the demographic story

[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.200]
right now but apparently very rich anyway but if you take a look at a context by itself

[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.420]
that's one thing but you have to judge a newspaper

[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.020]
by looking at the entire newspaper

[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.000]
for example if you take just the editorial page of the mime here old

[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.700]
there would be a lot of people who would gauge it is being even a lot lower than some of us already do

[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.920]
well of course this is another problem we have the one of the things i uh...

[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.560]
was listening to one of your room

[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.820]
temperate discussions tirades last week on the herald

[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:42.040]
and it occurred to me that to the extent that your man at the editorial page

[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.300]
you know telling people cancel this with gippance of the herald is kind of like me saying

[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:50.420]
on tired of taffing the calum so don't anybody listen to w.i.n.z ever

[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:54.800]
uh... you don't have to agree with the editorial page as it happens a lot of the time i don't

[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.240]
as i think you know

[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.980]
the editorial page

[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.640]
yeah like the other one the fcc marches to their own

[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.620]
which you said which you had a great line

[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.780]
that was your highest moment in history

[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.800]
well that to me was a dismaying at a throw when you said in one of the saddest

[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.660]
sentences i have ever read in this newspaper

[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.300]
and it went on you know i'm paraphrasing but they had said that the fcc ruling

[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.280]
perhaps can help us

[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.560]
better determined good taste and this is the same newspaper that a few days later

[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.060]
and since your friends tom fiedler and jim ma magee and all these other creeps

[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.720]
uh... you know hiding in the bushes and trench coats uh... casing out

[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.460]
gary hearts townhouse and they're talking about determining good taste

[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.400]
well there's a fundamental contradiction there to begin with the editorial page

[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.440]
thinks it can concern itself with good taste news reporters cannot concern

[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.020]
themselves with good taste you can't mean the tradition of news reporting

[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.440]
it's only in the last

[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.500]
ten or fifteen years that uh... this uh...

[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.280]
not quite myth that the reporter who goes to a death scene and

[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.520]
you know steals the picture out of the victims house they can have a picture for

[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.880]
the paper that kind of thing used to happen

[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.600]
this paper is i mean newspaper reporters don't

[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.560]
if they can send themselves over much with good taste and i'll report anything

[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:03.520]
uh... but the editorial page is a whole different story they don't report news

[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.720]
they report opinions there like

[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.540]
movie critics only they have more serious tasks but

[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.340]
uh... on that particular tutorial

[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.660]
might only assume that they

[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.040]
they just missed

[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.500]
completely they have an only missed because they're the only that's the only

[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.120]
publication of any of any

[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:17.720]
note

[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.500]
in the country that supported the fcc rule and even chat new good times i mean

[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.320]
newspapers in the underthal places

[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:29.460]
came out with lead editorials supporting my position and taking the fcc the

[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.100]
task well i mean the lesson here is it even the most ardent defenders of the

[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:33.640]
first amendment

[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.760]
will come up against it all the time the speech we need to protect is not the

[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.500]
popular speech no one needs to

[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.900]
it to have their right to agree with the mayor of the city of my any or to

[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.500]
each yell go dolphins protected that's not the problem the problem is to protect

[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.420]
speech that people hate

[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.420]
i mean that's why there's an amendment there wouldn't need to be an amendment

[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.340]
everybody said yeah we

[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:55.600]
we all love George Washington is great then why would you write in a specific

[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.040]
thing

[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.560]
saying by the way you get to say you hate George Washington while you do you

[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.180]
get to do that but

[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.480]
it's easy to lose that because sometimes people say things that

[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.320]
are really

[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.560]
egregiously stupid

[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.620]
even how it's done is said such thing

[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.240]
he gets to do it right

[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.680]
are you one of those people listens to how it's turned tapes because we there's

[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.160]
like an epidemic i even heard the team i'm not i must confess to you people are

[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.760]
bringing me how it's turned tapes all the time and i don't listen to many more

[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.540]
because i do find a guy funny but after you hear him a few times

[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.840]
there's no need to listen to him anymore because he does the same thing every

[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.220]
morning

[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.880]
yeah well he's not always on but i i know i've never heard tapes but i

[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.480]
was best

[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.180]
days

[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.840]
and i have some tapes that are some of his best days i'm enough of a

[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.700]
clod so that i i really enjoy it when i go to the northeast

[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.040]
matter fact when he moved

[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.720]
to early morning shift it really threw off my balance because i usually spend

[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.280]
a couple weeks in the jersey shore and that's

[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.360]
i just go out put my beach chair out there

[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.440]
put it launch a kite up in the air

[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.080]
grab a beer and put on Howard in the afternoon that would kill four hours

[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.140]
right there i mean Howard would mesmerize me yeah because the man is just

[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.740]
just i don't think you could pick him up there now

[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.120]
no i don't not on the FM no no i'll go on that get it from Philadelphia which is

[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.780]
possible because that's only like 60 miles away

[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.720]
but Howard is so is disgusting and hence intriguing

[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.020]
uh... you don't usually hear that kind of thing on radio

[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:14.460]
of course the fcc misses the obvious point which is that if this is a

[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.340]
profusion of howards the novelty will wear off and i don't think people

[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:21.640]
will be no big time but this whole the the most disgusting part of this

[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.600]
business from their perspective is again laying it on the children and this

[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.500]
uh... this really gets to you if you're grown up in the society you look

[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.860]
around you see the number of times a number of ways

[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:38.080]
people want to tell you what you can do because otherwise the children will be

[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.800]
this is absurd this is not a children's world it's an adult world and not

[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.100]
the purpose of adults and the parents is to protect children

[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:49.200]
purpose of parents specifically but it's not to reshape the world in

[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:53.320]
she had to be neat if this could be a lollipop world but it obviously isn't

[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.760]
going to be and this idea that in order to make sure no kid ever hears

[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.620]
anything that some but he thinks it's in bad taste we should not have anything

[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.800]
on the air that somebody thinks it's in bad taste is just absurd

[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.060]
yeah many of you guys are all making it illegal for children to listen to

[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.940]
radio no it could start with that that's a better

[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.460]
well and then make it illegal for them to watch television just think about a

[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.200]
service we would do to our kids if we made it illegal for them to watch

[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.880]
television till or eighteen because it certainly is lethal as boos

[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.760]
we make them wait till their twenty one to drink boos we might make them wait

[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.380]
forever to watch television for that honor be doing a tremendous

[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:31.380]
close service Tom and jitja would be out of a job and steves i heard somebody

[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.940]
calling about time jitja the other day

[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:36.340]
it's deep down to be out of a job it was a jitka yeah

[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.660]
they just can't get his name right by way speaking at jitka

[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.860]
i haven't noticed because i don't get the Miami news where i live i don't think

[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:46.020]
anybody can buy the Miami news anymore but have they been uh they didn't

[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.220]
send anybody here's Saturday on so far did they

[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.740]
on the first amendment jitka's been in the paper but uh

[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.260]
i haven't seen anything about that yeah i guess this isn't this isn't important

[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:59.640]
enough twenty four before noon at w i n z bill cost for this here from the

[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.520]
prestigious Miami Herald and uh we're going to come back you'll find it in the

[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.020]
yellow boxes all over time we'll come back after this

[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.020]
was that tom feeder was on nightline on the viewpoint segment yeah he's just a

[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:16.860]
bdi little creep he's not bdi he is bdi oh come on how he's serious he's got

[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:21.620]
those horn rims glass makes the page look like but um well silvestre still

[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.880]
alone but now see if we had steve page we wouldn't be in the trouble we're in

[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.840]
right i voted for page of what we're playing as well as well by the way you're

[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.120]
up in on history here now i wouldn't read that this is a memory do you want to

[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.920]
read this or you you can read that but i was going to say that uh ever since i

[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.440]
read in the paper and then heard your follow up that there was a rumor

[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:42.400]
this station is going to be purchased that i myself was on stake out

[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:47.120]
and uh yeah i i have reasons to believe that there will be no sale of this radio

[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.460]
we just have a memo and of course we don't read memoranda on the air but i

[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.320]
guess i can read the you know i guess i can read the two paragraphs because our

[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.480]
programming department just gave me permission i want to make sure that i

[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.240]
cloak this you know wrap it around in the flag

[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.060]
and it says this is from our general manager so it must be true just like if it's

[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.880]
in a herald it must be true i've just been informed by bob gilbert's and executive

[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.280]
vice president of guy granite broadcasting services

[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.920]
that all negotiations for the sale of win z and w zta have been stopped

[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.620]

[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:37.540]

[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.000]
memorandum which is going to be shredding during the news is this the woman that

[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.820]
some people refer to as mama i sure don't refer to her as that i refer to

[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:51.220]

disparaging remark to me i i i did i have done my own investigative work on this

and i i have been on state another one of those ugly rumors spawned by those yellow

[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.780]
journalists at the mimey herald and their yellow trench coats now the fact that we

[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:20.360]
have yellow boxes sale of our papers should not be allowed to impune our larger

[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.960]
reputation the reason i read this on the air is because i think that you know

[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.600]
in light of the fact that these rumors have gone public which is why

[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:29.080]
disgusted on here yesterday would be nice you know kind of reassuring

[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.460]
to the listeners into our sponsors and to the people who work here in the

[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:36.440]
building that they don't have to go out looking for a job tomorrow it is next

[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:40.040]
week that's another story it's a terrible thing working for a bad business

[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.120]
it really is a bad business that way people you just get fired and you just

[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:47.200]
a new management comes in they will always say we plan no changes yeah they'll

[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.740]
always be the first to say that boy you run out look for a job the way that you

[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.380]
know that they're going to be unbelievable changes is when they say we plan no

[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:58.660]
changes because that is the code word for me that's okay i'll let's see a show on

[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.520]
the phone here of all those little old ladies who are disappointed because it

[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.360]
means that i'm not going anywhere for almost two years

[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.680]
now let's see all the people in the audience who are upset let's see a show on

[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.060]
the phones over the fact that i'm not leaving

[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:21.120]
the phones are there's one dark two three three four five

[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.700]
those are six that's the wrong people who we think leave seven that wasn't

[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:29.820]
really that quick was it now that wasn't too good very mediocre response

[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.640]
of course those people take some a long time to give to the phone and these

[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:37.460]
are all people who wish you leave now are crawling on their hands and knees to

[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:41.140]
i got to ask you why are they listening yeah that's an interesting and

[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.740]
hurt isn't it there was a woman calling the other day who said

[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:48.760]
um i'm you asked her why are you listening because you wanted you off the

[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.400]
earth she said because you're a jerk which is a great ration yeah i'm told

[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.800]
that very often and they like jerks well of course they like jerks and as a

[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.940]
matter of fact you i wonder what to put on even meant to being a jerk how do

[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:04.100]
you like that so it takes their thunder away see i won't go that far oh yeah

[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.840]
i would not have meant to be injured well you are well well thank you you know i

[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.880]
i didn't want to speak up for myself i didn't you know if it's good enough for me it's good

[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.440]
enough for you okay now getting back to colorization of movies which is where we were going next

[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:21.240]
because i really enjoyed your column on sunday i almost feel like i'm tinkling today which i

[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.200]
just don't do on this show be careful it was a lot of time i'm so much in that column that i

[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.940]
guess so it's long overdue those days are over i the word went out through all out yeah i'm sure

[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:33.060]
all might ridder no more taking if memo out no more tinkling on roger that's probably why linda

[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:37.820]
only got two short paragraphs about so far actually you'd think there would be one but um no

[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:41.840]
that there isn't even my listings are getting in a herald now because we know the hero doesn't

[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.840]
discriminate against those people who take are they upset are they angry at me now lindus is no

[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.000]
i don't hear anybody angry at you i i can't imagine that there aren't some people who are upset

[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.940]
i mean if you work for a newspaper and and like dick capen wine in the most powerful radio voice

[01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:02.160]
in town is saying cancel your newspaper you know somebody get a few cancelation while they got

[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:06.360]
several hundred which is pretty much several hundred yeah really well i mean that's that's what

[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.700]
they're saying uh... which means it could have been several thousand well i don't i don't know

[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.820]
anyone's circulation so i don't know if they're attempted to uh... jive but uh... no i i suspect

[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:20.100]
the several hundred that's a pretty good number isn't circulation figures are figures that we

[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.400]
have to stand behind legally it you know several times a year so if they say several hundred i'd buy

[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.500]
several hundred and that well that doesn't surprise me you mean there are people who really agree with

[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:32.920]
you made your case i'm not i wasn't here during the height of this i was on a uh...

[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.240]
an amtrak uh... train from us and i was to chicago

[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.820]
um... which is how i came back into alia in business and i came back by train a little bedroom

[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.900]
everything i was you know in the lap of luxury when this is all going on i got on the train

[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:49.860]
her to radio broadcast in the cab that the herald of broken some story about gary heart but then

[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:54.220]
i'm on the train all i have was us a today for the next two days so all i have is what what us a

[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.100]
today's first day coverage is once a little a bunch of those of the crazy and still was with the

[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:02.720]
issue you could fill into blank spaces i did color in some parts right i did cut out some the

[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.000]
weather map in the back that was funny it was fun making florida green and main red yeah it changed

[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.260]
the things around but uh... so i didn't know what was going on and i my mom was the first one in

[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:18.180]
new jersey to tell me there's some radio host who's leading a campaign against herald circulation

[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:23.040]
you know how she found out in the jersey i don't know maybe you called her but she found out

[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:29.200]
you jersey oh she saw it on cnn i think well i think i know or it may actually have been picked

[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.840]
up in report on the art radio that there was a host after the herald but we made the wire

[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.040]
services to what uh... well and that that that's how what i didn't know at the time was what it

[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.940]
specifically was you were objecting to the editorial stance of the herald which is one thing

[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:45.400]
or the actual gary heart story which is another altogether to do with one another

[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.580]
i wasn't sure which it was that you were most deemed about and now you know well which is it

[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:53.460]
or you don't know no i still know this had to do with the gary heart thing this is a very good

[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.140]
you don't like the story in the words

[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:59.240]
no it's not a question whether i like the story it's a question whether it's a legitimate story

[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.360]
whether it's really the purview of reporters from a newspaper

[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:08.480]
to follow politicians around candidates around and you know snoop on their personal lives i don't

[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.420]
believe it is if somebody had given a tip to the herald that the guy was going to take graph he was

[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:16.640]
going to take a bribe then of course it's a legitimate story to then you wouldn't mind the

[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.340]
exactly there was what you might take out but they can somebody out and watching who he's

[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:24.500]
shacking up with allegedly and make all this in your window and and have giant gaping holes in

[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.920]
a story and be so desperate to rush to get it you know to beat the deadline to get in the newspaper

[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.220]
was very irresponsible journalism i think that's the consensus in fact all of the polls now

[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:39.000]
show that at least two thirds some of the polls three quarters of the people think that the herald

[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.500]
did a lousy job that it was not good journalism to anybody's business it's not a good sounding

[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.660]
story that was my first reaction to him and i first of all i was a gary heart man

[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:51.920]
well i wasn't so i can't be accused of attacking the herald because i like gary heart

[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.880]
because i think the guys have vacuist fool i didn't think that i didn't think that but the one

[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:02.240]
thing i didn't expect that he would not to be was a decimbler and and and and man so essentially

[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.440]
corrupt in one way that he was he would be lined with his own campaign staff about what he was up to

[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.000]
but you know i didn't know that until i get back when i'm first thinking about the story it's not

[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.740]
a good sounding story it's like any other a surp tichestine you're gonna pick up like when cops

[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:21.720]
wiretap and i can't think just you know it kind of makes you feel uneasy but in in this country as

[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.520]
long as politicians are gonna drag their their families around to present themselves as family people

[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.220]
i think they're gonna get looked at and i think they ought to be if you know what you mean you

[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:34.520]
can look that well their private parts next thing we're out we do we have to know how big it is

[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.780]
the problem here that none of the herald or any other press institution has been able to fully

[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:44.960]
get across the people is it this was not new news about gary no this way gary heart was the same

[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.400]
as jack kennedy up to a point in the neighborhood the i was you know cnn did a great piece and they

[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.820]
show they're going all the way back to george washington and jeferson and franklin and all the way

[01:17:54.820 --> 01:18:00.720]
through war and hearting uh... ison hower kennedy you name it we've had a lot of presidents and candidates

[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.040]
who have been womanizers in it right i mean as puritanical as we were back then how in the world

[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:10.860]
can it be major news now and worthy of stakeouts and all kinds of wild rumour in any window when it

[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:15.060]
wasn't worth that two hundred years ago no then that for that you got to ask some sociological

[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:18.900]
questions because it turned out was major news and people went nuts over it and they jumped up

[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.260]
and down the guy dropped out of the race because he didn't think he was gonna ask any other question

[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:27.140]
but that for the right but again it goes to show you what happens when the press is irresponsible

[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:31.840]
now i'm certainly not going to disagree with the right to print because you know i can't be a hypocrite

[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.640]
on the one hand i'm arguing for our first amendment rights to speak and i'm not going to you know

[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:40.880]
argue against uh... the right of a free press but it is a question of what's responsible journalism

[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.140]
and i don't think that that was well we what i think you're objecting to more than anything else is

[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:50.860]
the puritanical aspects of it in other words this is a sex thing and we're just leave sex alone

[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:55.560]
the difficulty is this is what i mean by things that we haven't gotten a good job of getting across

[01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:00.380]
the people's it carried out was notorious for this and he also had become arrogant enough

[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.440]
so he was denying it and all these absurd ways well

[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.620]
you have a real interesting situation here reporters throughout washington who don't who don't

[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:13.460]
want to come out with uh... rumor and speculation know the guys uh...

[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:16.820]
fooling around uh... he's dipping the wick whatever and we know that nobody at the

[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.640]
herald would do that and uh... well i can we know of course that

[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.940]
probably a handful of people at that newspaper have fallen from grace

[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:28.960]
in their lives but uh... we know this and but you're not going to go and print that because it's

[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.180]
just kind of smart me but then why not candidate let's read about the people at the

[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:36.860]
heraldu fallen from grace well but see the people from the herald aren't running for the highest

[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:40.860]
to watch differences in the way they're controlling one of the most powerful institutions in a state

[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:44.680]
and indeed in the country i'm trolling a monopoly in the newspaper business i'd be

[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:49.360]
great to come out about my own pecadillo's but really i'm not sure they'll put anybody's

[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.260]
well i don't want to say i don't want to do that all sound just like jack stewardy yesterday

[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:57.900]
yes well i'm gonna i can't get that out of my mind because i just uh... i can't begin to tell you

[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:03.120]
i think that the problem always have been the history of this industry yesterday the problem became

[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.040]
um...

[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.620]
at first memory remember people were saying how could heart be so stupid you know he's wanting

[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:13.940]
or he's very much in a point and very good quite he's and it's how could he be such a mora well

[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:18.400]
and you know he's calling down a rice from the campaign trail he but he isn't stupid that's the

[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.400]
thing and this is where the story i think became of great interest to reporters who hadn't laid

[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:28.120]
the groundwork because and they feel it's inside watching the inside the boatway stuff but in fact

[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.180]
hearts not stupid he's arrogant and that is a different story well in this case he apparently

[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:38.360]
thought he could get away with anything i mean the idea that on the very day his big sunday times

[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:42.820]
profile appears and he tells people he go ahead follow me that he's got the asignation is just

[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:47.160]
unbelievable that's what i think made a legitimate story i feel sorry for um...

[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:52.380]
for him that he had people looking outside his house and i feel sorry for the lurkers

[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:55.620]
but i can tell you this that the people we sent to lurk were

[01:20:55.620 --> 01:21:00.080]
the kind of newsmen you'd want them to be these are not you know for you now feel

[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.040]
learned McGee and chim's average or not you know you know he's american's these aren't torps

[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.560]
out to make their big story long nor are they people or i've had them on the show many times

[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:14.440]
work as the definitive word nor i couldn't have come up with a better term myself tom feeler

[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:18.520]
you had a very little discourse with him that that many times he's been on the show several times

[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.040]
and i don't dislike him personally but professionally he's a twerp

[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:27.400]
no i personally maybe a tour by don't know well you i mean whether or not you like his column i guess

[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.780]
you know now you're talking about his column at all i'm talking about him as a reporter but he's

[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:35.800]
a tour these are it's not just a duke you know for the term i think we ought to give you credit

[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:40.180]
but these are major these work but these aren't people out looking at the phone if there are people

[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:44.920]
in the audience who think that tom feeler is a twerp when i just see a show on the phone okay let's

[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:49.560]
see if this is as quick as the recent you get this once with it before a line come on let's

[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:54.440]
see some people on this telephone people who think that tom feeler is a major twerp six lines

[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:59.340]
lit already seven within like no it's like the azusa thing i mean the previous i can promise you

[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:04.120]
they're walking off the art even there are no lines livenessy you could ask you know lines lit

[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.760]
there are there are no lines lit about every other second there's no lines lit you know what has

[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.680]
that one in the intervals in between the flashes you could ask people to call in how many lines

[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.040]
are left if you have the honest is that they're all left now but the point is if you asked people

[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.840]
to hold their breath until they turn purple and then to call you would say oh come on you would do

[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:28.940]
it and none of these people are not as feeler you have to take my word to it he certainly is not

[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:35.260]
looking for his first big scoop nor does he know it's not just a great news in the future of our

[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:40.420]
republic and very concerned about they think probably national security i think that's true

[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:45.100]
yeah i think it is because what what ultimately was going on what has been going on here is you

[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:50.340]
got a press corps in Washington and throughout the country let's head Reagan now for six years

[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:54.800]
going on seven and hasn't been able to do anything about it even though the man is egregiously

[01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:00.580]
ignorant uh he's many of us feel he's saying the country right into the toilet but we have not

[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:05.880]
been able to get at him in any way because there's there are real limits to what you can do with

[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.000]
straight report a lot of people who think that Reagan should have had the tidie bull man his

[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.220]
vice president because every was going to push the country into the toilet at least have an

[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:16.060]
advisor who knows what he's going to do and do to get in the course one right okay it's six

[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:20.040]
minutes before noon at w.i.n.c the cryptic bill cost for it who came up with a great

it is with us till two and we'll come right back now we don't have time for any displainers

[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:34.740]
about that issue the audience who reported it's out and that's it you know it's taken me out of

[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:38.680]
content no i haven't the audience specifically said for themselves they heard you talk not

[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.640]

[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.680]
in Washington no doubt preparing you say it's a twerp uh i agree with you i'm trying to be

[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.180]
agreeable to let it work and yet then now the thing is tom is actually a friend of yours you've

[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:59.300]
hit him a new one i like to have probably will never come back and just again is any sensible

[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:03.980]
of you turning is a sensitive twerp turning on your own pals and the way you turn on clen hill

[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:09.220]
is you don't turn on him just as we tell him that we tell it like it is even you're even

[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:14.120]
knocking on the thorn in this morning and of course she's done yeoman work in reporting on radio

[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:23.560]
her last week and i came to her defense but what's in a stinky little two paragraphs about a

[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:28.160]
major issue i feel they know but i did do a disclaimer denied did not say that probably the people

[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:33.080]
at the herald are more concerned about the story on ocn in the spanish language station because

[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.320]
he has told me off the air that she is under duress from the powers that be to do more on spanish

[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:14.600]
mention somebody sent me this it's a great great piece from the sunday new sun sentinel in

[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:21.040]
Fort Lauderdale jone christy or john christy well we just made john in the jone instant operation a

[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.160]
lexicon of lame loonies and it's about driving in south florida and the first one is the cigar

[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.760]
smoker which i mentioned first because i'm sitting here with a cigar vehicle link in continental

[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:38.320]
destination the country club bumper sticker i got mine habits retired now the cigar smoker drives

[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:44.440]
like he ran his plumbing supply business in bayon oblivious to everyone around him he takes

[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:50.760]
corners wide and slow the long nose of the link in preceding him like the baton-sized stogie clamped

[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:55.520]
between his teeth he is the master of double parking parking in two spaces and the rolling stop

[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:04.260]
always wears a hat now we have the condo commando vehicle generic sedan white destination early bird

[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:12.200]
dinner bumper sticker i break for bingo and habits the commando's car is mysteriously always full

[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:18.620]
three men three women the men are in pastels the women freshly quaffed and iron beehives if a woman

[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:23.980]
is driving she's hunched forward and peering through the steering wheel for male driving habits

[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:31.020]
see the cigar smoker for either sex maximum speed 40 miles an hour now that was in a sun sentinel

[01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:35.880]
i think you're not a thing hurled about lane loonies though typical of the way journalism works in

[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:40.420]
this community sometime ago the hero launched a feature launched a feature called the lane ranger

[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:46.900]
oh yeah i'm sure you're familiar of course in which a a predominantly anonymous member of the staff

[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:52.780]
reports on road conditions and does so in a flip in the entertaining style not unlike the style of

[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:58.160]
the show and of course this turns out to be a big success so right away when we got inbroward

[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.020]
at the sunset old lane loonies now that we have the lane ranger i guess there's the lane grain

[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:08.560]
yeah or the well we know that there's no imitation that goes on in this market now none of that no

[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:14.500]
but now to lay the twerk issue to wrap the ones and pursue that at all is it possible that you're

[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.440]
going to be appearing on a certain show in town that you don't want to mention because i notice

[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:23.500]
you didn't follow up on that when we know i have no other uh no other radio obligation scheduled

[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:29.140]
oh okay far into the future my country that you've been a lot of people i've been allowed to be

[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:32.820]
implemented by jacks during the show now the hero insists that i come on only this show

[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:40.620]
yeah because they're plans to buy uh the station now going ahead and they want to show that there's

[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:47.400]
a gradual erosion of the you know could we turn this place on its ear could be a lot of fun night

[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:51.220]
redder newspapers they just well well first of all it's illegal they can't buy the radio studio

[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:55.460]
it's too bad that there's an FCC regulation for you do you think that if the hero bought this

[01:29:55.460 --> 01:30:04.420]
newspaper i'd still be on the ear um yes yeah because we're no fools either with those numbers you

[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:09.700]
would be yeah sure now i'm not you just full a little cutie yeah first of all is tom fielor at

[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:15.920]
twerp and now he's you know tom little cuties on the air buried in my unilateral condemnation of tom

[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:22.460]
um was the the issue that i'm gonna be here only speaking spanish is what Kyle said can you speak

[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:29.040]
Spanish can you say royal see caroio caroio caroio caroio goio see cuban cigar with the bed of them see no you can

[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:35.260]
do with them okay you can have a job anywhere on this town uh buried in all this is that whole business

[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:40.180]
i think that heart apparently had long been behaving in ways those of us it's all he was great

[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:47.240]
can they didn't know and so when they when they get a way to say look we can report this is

[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:51.840]
supposed to say all the something about gary hurt has always bugged us which is exactly the

[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:57.580]
kind of reporting we don't want to play on words or if you can actually catch him in his

[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:04.600]
hypocritical act then do it and in fact um we were done a service by that story i i know that it um

[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:10.220]
no one likes that kind of story i i doubt that you that feedler or savage or magee would say this

[01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:16.740]
this was a neat story to do i'm sure they didn't like it nonetheless um finally we we got to

[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:20.020]
someone and expose the thing people needed to know about in a way that never happened with

[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:26.060]
Ronald Reagan and as we're now finding out from the Reagan administration the layers of duplicity

[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:31.280]
and deceit are incredible and now we've just had a ship attacked successfully and the person

[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.060]
golf that it turns out its defenses weren't on yeah and we're going to find out probably that

[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:39.200]
the defenses didn't work and if that doesn't sound like the whole leaven thing all over again with

[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:44.200]
these people who cannot learn the lesson human sacrifices exactly nobody cares uh but we don't

[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:47.760]
you understand nobody cares we couldn't get to that guy and i'll guarantee you there'll be more

[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.660]
efforts by all newspapers and very few people care about the hearings that are going on but boy

[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:56.900]
they sure cared about the gary heart story well and i forget how many days in a row it was that

[01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:01.600]
your newspaper on the front page in fact there was even one day when there were some really wild

[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:07.540]
revelations i think it was when McFarland was testifying or maybe it was um the general

[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:14.840]
ccord ccord one of the two there was i forget exactly what it was but there was a major revelation

[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:18.860]
which in essence said that Reagan knew everything all along etc and so on and i was like little

[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:23.140]
little bitty news off in the bottom left hand corner of the page and the gary heart thing which by

[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.840]
now was several days old was still prominent and made center front with big picture in the whole

[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:33.120]
business in the Miami herald well i don't think anyone pretend either that the herald is uh

[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:40.220]
immune from quote human interest stories and quote the Donna rice angle gave it a human interest

[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:44.140]
okay why don't we all just admit one thing okay because i've done it the last four or five

[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:48.880]
months i've changed the format of the show we do very little topical talk you i mean we make no

[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.260]
secret of it and the ratings have soared and the demographics are better and everything is great

[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:58.440]
think the listings listeners are leaving now what today yeah because no it's topical no this is not

[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:04.960]
topical top right we're discussing it like from a third party okay situation like we're not

[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:09.340]
involved and we're looking at it from the outside why don't we just all the men instead of pretending

[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:12.940]
like at the herald to be great journalist and bragging about their Pulitzer prizes why don't they

[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:16.380]
admit they're only in a business selling newspapers just like we're in a business of getting ratings

[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:22.140]
and selling commercials we're all horrors okay why don't we just admit that and whatever you people

[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:25.840]
want we're gonna give it to you and forget about all the rest it will suffer the consequences

[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:30.980]
well that that is we will suffer the consequences you know that that's the guiding principle of

[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:37.060]
uh of media they they exist to make money yeah because they can't exist if they don't but yeah

[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:41.120]
the same thing is true of this show it's true of the herald and that is it's large enough to

[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.340]
encompass a number of different things i mean you it may not have been topical last couple

[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:48.820]
months but you've had serious issues that you've dealt with the herald runs funnies and it runs

[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:52.560]
analyses of what Reagan is doing why did they run their funnies on the front page

[01:33:55.060 --> 01:34:00.200]
well now see if you left the hard thing i didn't laugh at the hard thing i didn't i laughed at it i

[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:05.260]
didn't find it a funny at all no no because as i say it was a heart-backer i was dismayed i didn't

[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:09.240]
laugh at it i thought was disgusting are you holding an nauseating i still i didn't like him then

[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.900]
i don't like him now i don't like him any more or less because i don't care who he's sleeping

[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:16.540]
i was not my bed i was deeply disillusioned and frankly i don't care and i think his lawyer

[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:20.460]
calmo is going to open field now all he's got to do is say hey i want it he's got it

[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:24.760]
so all he's got to do is say it i mean when jesse jackson is shown in the polls to be leading and you

[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:29.320]
know jesse couldn't get arrested if his life depended upon it you know that if calmo wants it he's

[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.860]
got it but in fact you've made a good point we do run funnies to be running against parpers

[01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:37.740]
studly we run little jokes while we get to run them on the page two now but we for a long time ran

[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:41.700]
today's chuckle which was rarely funny on the front page and every now and then we'll have a picture

[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:45.440]
of a puppy or a kitten or something but that but i mean nowhere is a written that a newspaper

[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:52.140]
has got to be a theoretical abstract or a phd thesis a newspaper is aimed at a wide spectrum of

[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:57.180]
people and presumably if you have a deep interest in politics for instance you buy your daily

[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:00.780]
newspaper you may also buy the new york times and you get your magazines in the week you get the

[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:05.480]
nation new republic or commentary or whatever or national review got forbidden but national review

[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:11.180]
you know people do read it me not people who listen to this show how people who might know either

[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:15.420]
maybe people listen to daffy should we have a spotlight spotlight well not a hundred percent

[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:19.080]
serious if we were i wouldn't have a job means something's going to talk about you wrote a column

[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:23.540]
about colorization which incidentally we're like a couple of days after i've been talking about it

[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.680]
but i don't want to you know sound is the way planted the seeds in your mind because i'm sure you

[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:31.840]
didn't even hear me discuss it that's right did but my point was that i don't know if congress has

[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:38.220]
the time to deal i mean here we've got you know americans been killed in the middle east again

[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:43.380]
we've got all of these hearings going on in washing and the president is a compulsive psychopath liar

[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:47.820]
and in the meantime we have nothing more important to be concerned with as to whether we're colorizing

[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:52.320]
old movies and you know congress is sitting there listening to woody alan i have the feeling that

[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.500]
people in hollywood and show business can request to come before congress on anything no matter how

[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:04.220]
species it is like should we pass a law limiting the number of what are they called the blocks the stars

[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:09.320]
at hollywood you know where they put the star yeah limiting the number of stars that can be put

[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:16.420]
there and i'm sure that congress would find the time yeah i suspect they would be and that works

[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:20.700]
on the main level as well they're overwhelmed by gray and spence i don't know how many years

[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:25.220]
uh... in the throw all of burnt rentals bird could show up and everything stopped you know when

[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:30.460]
burnt rentals came uh... the wheels of government talazzy ground to a halt what's going on

[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:34.340]
you're taking your head out just as here are called put on the screen they wanted his autograph who wanted

[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:39.400]
his autograph wait a minute those must be some of the guys at tom fielerson over here

[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:46.560]
oh congress i see congress wanted woody alan's autograph well yeah of course of course that really

[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.980]
is not a good with his nose we're dealing with the same you know with with human beings

[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.500]
in presumably exalted positions but they have the same drives and lusts we find out from not

[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.260]
just gary but is anyone else they want to meet stars they want to hang out with big people all boy

[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:04.740]
uh... they want to meet him at the russian t-room and i think sure you get woody in

[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.400]
you get you get him on the diester you get him testifying for that's fun that's a good way to kill

[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:13.260]
a couple of hours what i just the whole thing amazed me because what congress thinks is going to do

[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:17.420]
about colorization i don't know i'm going to pass a law and sit at ted turner

[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:22.900]
can't color films me what what is it all about all is all is about is that the stars are coming

[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:24.280]
that's it

[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.860]
and it was no part of the hearings that they had with uh... with the people from the

[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:28.260]
networks

[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:32.960]
well david brinkley had the accurate comedy said first of all there's no reason for any of these

[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:36.100]
network people to be here and the ones who are here know nothing about the news

[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.660]
business anyway he said if they want to have a hearing they can go ahead and have one but if

[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:43.900]
we're up to me i wouldn't have shown up i mean what business is congress god calling the heads

[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:48.180]
of the networks to washington saying we want to talk about the way you're covering the news that

[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:53.260]
to me is far more troublesome and colorization is merely a waste of time and and a signal that

[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:58.920]
congress can be as fatuous as ever in times of real trouble uh... the whole business about the

[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:04.060]
networks being interrogated is there's supposed to be uh... an amendment to between the networks

[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:07.780]
and the sort of congressional action i mean what on earth were they going to do suppose uh...

[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:12.380]
tishets that up there and said yes i'm shutting down cbs news altogether no more news were they

[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:16.660]
going to do say no you can't do that uh...

[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:21.980]
but again there was the you'll rather might have something going on there uh... and but of course

[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:24.940]
actually the networks play pretty kagy abc kimon and said

[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:28.880]
we remain deeply committed to news and public affairs to give our world as an example

[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.960]
that of course all right they went out and canceled our world it's pretty cute but they can't

[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.600]
tell our world after the hearings so they got they got credit both ways congresses yeah these

[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:40.920]
guys are deeply committed and then they go back and they get rid of the show which is actually

[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.500]
fine and they keep twenty twenty which remains a scandal

[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:49.620]
but there's no uh... there's no underestimating what kind these guys need a break apparently

[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:55.060]
congress needs a break if your pat lay he out of Vermont and you know you know you're it's it's

[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:59.940]
tough the contrast up is going on and and you're not uh... deeply involved in that so you're losing

[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:05.400]
headlines and uh... besides it'll be nice to shmuz and you know your life is tough because

[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:09.700]
you got a commute back and forth from brodington and wherever to watch and tenon you don't have

[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:13.380]
the connections the looks of gary hearts so you're not able to have as good a time you need a little

[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:17.280]
relaxation you know that awesome steam so you have the woodman command that's it and said he

[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.840]
pocket jimmy steward rice you a letter and you do get his autograph in the letter you can do that

[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:24.520]
in ten years the bill he probably didn't really sign it

[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.380]
but again there's been we we are we i think we've seen the last six years a complete breakdown media

[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:33.420]
and congressional in being able to control what's going on

[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:39.660]
in in the serious side of life so we make a lot of what's you know we laugh at it well we we make a

[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:44.980]
lot of what's going on in consequently but no one could get to ragan not congress and not the media

[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:51.880]
so g might as well have what he on terrific twenty minutes past twelve at w i n z bill cost for

[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:56.040]
this here we're going to talk just a little bit about movies and then we'll open the phones up and

[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:00.180]
see what they want to talk to you about let's turn the tables on you this time let's see what they

[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:03.980]
want to talk to you about now maybe you've got a lot of those young sueds planted to call in about

[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:09.760]
the movies who are re who really pretend to be all in to film you know really uh... i never i never

[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.220]
plant my suits they just they know by radar they can tell we'll come back with bill cost for it right

[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:21.500]
after this so vester still on stars in his most challenging role since rinestone

[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:27.800]
your maddy and you came and you gave without taking and you're your friend yeah

[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.440]
so long is manalo in barry first went part one

[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.800]
it's a miracle

[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:43.380]
yeah the copa absolutely joe copica vena with my

[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:52.840]
rex reed says i love the costumes jesuskelec claims four stars yo absolutely

[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:56.080]
Roger ebert says past the popcorn

[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:03.860]
so vester still on as the lamp arm of the law barry first went part one you of the disease

[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:06.000]
did i'm the cure

[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.680]
that's your and coming this summer i know you are but what a boy

[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:19.820]
rudger hower in i know you're a boy what he was last adventure i know you're a boy

[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:30.280]
i thought that would get us in the right right frame of mind to get into the movies wonderful

[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:34.540]
stuff is that good where we're that one come from where did it come from is it local from

[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:39.760]
somebody's a bizarre imagination yeah but we're not tracing this one back no this was not stolen

[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.880]
oh this is not this is not subrole style black mark no this is right out of the open

[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:48.980]
oh this is that's hot i like that a lot he was last adventure yeah with ruck or hower no less

[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:52.420]
which brings us right back to the hit your record the way for the sequel to come out by the way

[01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:56.720]
i don't think there'll be a sequel but then now you see ciscle and ebert that was one of the

[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:00.900]
films this had to be burned i think which one the hit your should be burned are you serious

[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:05.720]
i was violent classic uh the boys that they're special then they have collocating it to all the

[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:12.920]
movie's i always uh now interviewing war and bady invest in hopman for this movie ishtar and we're

[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.880]
sitting around a table waiting for the interview to start and ciscle was supposed to be there but

[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:21.140]
a woman comes in at the last minute and says i'm sorry jen's had a call from his office uh he won't

[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:25.580]
be able to make the interview you'll have to now here's a guy who's rearranging war and bd's schedule

[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:30.840]
this is the critic out of control of course also i'd want to know who from the office would call you

[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:34.800]
out of an interview with war and bady doesn't gives him every probably same version but your

[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:39.460]
critic at large might have been uh Roger ebert calling him uh Roger may have uh

[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:43.680]
gone into a food frenzy you can't tell you may have needed genes help with them well you know

[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:48.340]
he'd as much popcorn as he does and uh pretty soon it's gonna go to your head you've seen those big bags

[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:53.060]
they um they'll sometimes begin they don't you know pre cook it now that's what they just ham

[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:57.780]
our best of roger and he just drags into the theater with him he'd be great at one of those film

[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:03.000]
festivals that you like uh hey they're all over it can now everybody but me isn't isn't kind

[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.780]
good thank you and that we don't have to read anymore about that sued stuff oh my god getting

[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:12.900]
one of the other things we want to do before we take any calls is talk about another fantasy of

[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:16.140]
yours because cost for you know having been at the heralds so long and down there

[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.120]
cloaked at one herald plaz at least when he's in town for so many years it's not part of the

[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.520]
establishment and the last time you're here you were talking about the people mover and how exciting

[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:32.980]
it was to get out of people mover and you were just you were swept up in the people i thought you

[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:37.340]
it's just an adorable little and now the base side is open since you were here the last time

[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:42.840]
during every break cost for keeps just going even his lighter that he's got here today is a

[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:47.620]
base i lighter base side right on it and you can help the basketball team coming in of course

[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:53.560]
a no question about it mike miller is going to get us to super bowl in 1990 and our hockey team and

[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:57.860]
a baseball team i mean and all of it's going to be downtown that's the amazing thing what is it

[01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:02.180]
with those guys over on that station anyway would this this poor slump is out there with these

[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:08.440]
with this petition is if i mean is an eighty percent of him came from joe's bar that has about six

[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:13.060]
customers every day and they got like twenty five thousand signatures in joe's bar but is there

[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:17.980]
is the reasoning that this is something surprising that my amie is the only city in the country in

[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:22.220]
which forty five thousand people even allowing all the signatures were genuine want the super bowl

[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:25.700]
to come there i mean you could get that from corral gables yeah i i guess i should have thought of

[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:29.800]
that or we could have done for nirangia you know get every single person's name on the thing

[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.960]
that's a good idea let's go super bowl for nirangia the hell with the you know the how would joe

[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.780]
robby stadium that's mr. robby to you if you didn't see you don't listen to that station quiet

[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:43.400]
i bag the mic i've listened to the sports segment of that station and it's and this guy weaver

[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:48.600]
just i mean talk about giving you the creeps this mr. robby stuff after a while he just everyone

[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:53.620]
the world calls this guy joe and if you've ever met him not mr. no not rick weaver i mean he's a real

[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:58.280]
joe lazy ship yeah you know this is really a world that's a one thing about iod you know that

[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.420]
they're really objective about all this because uh... like robby owns rick weaver i mean personally

[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:08.100]
he even has his socks in his underwear and a drawer somewhere and one of these days he's going to

[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:12.600]
give him to him uh apparently he's gonna borrow soap one day rick is legitimately a strange man

[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.840]
he successes a strange phenomenon yeah this is a strange town there's a stranger almost surrounding

[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:20.500]
mr. weaver there's no that's what all the people to work with him tell me but that's another story

[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:24.360]
when they you ever catch him when he was on the super bowl preview show and they were

[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:28.540]
they were talking about Brent musburger somebody was interviewing weaver for some reason the dolphins

[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:33.920]
were in the super bowl i guess that was uh... when was the last time we were in when we were crushed by

[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:38.660]
a whole two three years ago uh... forty nine years and out of nowhere weaver tears up with this

[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:42.920]
on national television and no races you know i made Brent musburger's career i gave him his first

[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.500]
art they don't even ask him about it they're asking about the dolphins don't arrest this is a strange

[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:52.700]
man yeah but uh... he's not quite so uh... egotistical when it comes to mr. robby

[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.840]
anyway mr. robby owns mr. weaver you can go to the bank on that well it'll

[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:02.600]
be stock and barrel it'll be mr. robby to me if he succeeds in bringing baseball to this town

[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.100]
which i mean the nba thing i think it's great we'll get into that in a second but uh... if you

[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:11.680]
get baseball here he will be mr. robby to me but what i don't get uh... we're gonna lose every

[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:17.000]
listener on the whole across the spectrum now but what i don't get is how you brought can say over

[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.000]
and over and over again we don't want multi-year stadiums we only want parks we want baseball

[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.900]
parks which is a great idea we want more fennelies more rigglies and a few were what arrowhead

[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:30.560]
stadiums over those things are what you know we rivers right three rivers um... and meanwhile

[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:34.020]
joe just because i don't know yet we'll have a bit of the decade no problem because we're going to

[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:39.680]
put baseball in here yeah by folding up a bunch of chairs uh... on one side we'll have a 370

[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:46.020]
foot left you know uh... left field and i forget we're gonna tell you we made it wide enough so we'll

[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:49.540]
we got room to plop it in there i can't wait to sit in this place first of all watching football

[01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:53.600]
and stadium designed also for baseballs of pan the neck because the field is too wide and

[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:59.240]
but if he can get baseball there then he'll be mr. robby to me for the several years until a team

[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:04.320]
flees and a church gate receipts for about a dollar and a half it i i know this should be the

[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:08.400]
perfect time for baseball now the truth comes well i just know i have to see the stadium is it lake

[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.300]
lucerne it's not in downtown Miami so you're willing to predict the failure of anything like

[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:17.980]
lake lucerne or nirangia any place else but if it's in downtown Miami like the metro rail and the

[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:22.440]
people move her and the basketball team that you alluded to only moments ago and i can't wait to hear

[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:28.040]
this if it's downtown then you know it's gonna be great and no one is gonna come flocking from

[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:35.300]
air to go to over town i just went nuts listening to rick horro who was on i think an iod of course

[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:41.560]
oh no he was on with ron sacks excuse me it was with ron sacks that he was on and rick horro who's

[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.760]
probably got one of the best scams going in history keeps getting paid to be the sports what is

[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:50.700]
that title sports um i don't know what we said or something or other now something or other he's

[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.600]
on and off the sport sports authority chairman or whatever and nothing ever happens you don't nobody

[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:00.140]
ever gets a team now we finally got another team so now he can almost legitimize another five

[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:05.640]
years of the salary that he gets and he was telling us about all the great things and trying to

[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.280]
tell us well it's not really in over town it's park west it's not over just go down there and look

[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.020]
you know walk around there at night it's safe it's great of course he's not gonna walk around

[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:18.940]
there because a guy wants to stay alive people are not gonna go there well a certain kind of

[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:22.160]
person certainly isn't gonna go there because a lot of people who still won't go to parts of

[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.320]
downtown Miami that are certifiably safe their parts of downtown Miami that are safer at night

[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.380]
and coral cables the reason maybe because there's no one there there's not enough foot traffic to

[01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:35.340]
support a mugger nonetheless it's true that there are parts of downtown Miami that are very safe

[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:40.340]
and i you know whenever the film like around the herald for example that's no the herald's not

[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:45.460]
is good a place as for instance the access between guzzman cultural center and the intercontinental

[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:50.660]
hotel which during the season is an access many of us sued travel because whatever is a

[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:54.380]
guzzman film festival or maybe uh... maybe city ballet or something like that and then of course

[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:57.660]
maybe a reception afterwards or you just go to the bar at the intercontinental because it has to be

[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:03.300]
open and nice i've walked that many a time looking helpless in my tux you know or or you know

[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:08.880]
dressed in anyway but looking like a you know a helpless walking car he just sued a walking target

[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.220]
in a way that i would never comport myself in new york walking from broadway to my hotel no way i mean

[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:17.600]
you you walk carefully there you do the get shuffled when you when you're coming from a theater in the

[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.860]
york and i i get into furious arguments with people even you know good friends over just this issue

[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:25.900]
because people who think nothing of going to new york is to her saying oh honey we'll take in a

[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:29.280]
show again tonight yeah and then they walk back to the ol gunk one of the milford plaza they're coming

[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.380]
down 44th street across you know eight seven hundred Broadway no long enough you pay attention to

[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:38.680]
what's going on in those situations you can watch the guys that you work in teams you can watch

[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:42.500]
one up the block spotting you and isn't that all of a sudden to be another one behind you this is

[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:45.920]
happening a couple of times there you got to be really careful that kind of stuff doesn't happen

[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:50.300]
where i travel in downtown mami but yeah but you see what's going on in new york is almost worth

[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:54.800]
getting mugged for what's going on here it's just not worth well that's an interesting nuance that

[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.260]
i had never thought about it was it's you just you in other words the risk factor has to be

[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:04.320]
justified are you willing to put your life on the line to go see a Broadway play or to go to Madison

[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.860]
square garden as opposed to going downtown where there's nothing basically going on you just

[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:13.920]
give up your wallet as an additional cost of the ticket right well no i don't think the very

[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.920]
fact that the mba thing is downtown makes it good as a matter of fact it's going to make it harder

[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:21.660]
clearly because people have that perception they don't want to go there and there are some

[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:25.900]
reasons for that i mean overtown is a troubled area and it has been since they built a building

[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:31.140]
there and split the neighborhood and have very profound but on the other hand nba basketball

[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:38.340]
does have a a younger i think clientele for the most part and say baseball or football

[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:43.140]
and it tends to be a more ethnic clientele so they're going to get some people who aren't afraid to

[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:48.340]
be there oh yeah all those middle-class blacks and upper-class blacks who live in south florida both

[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:52.760]
of them i mean where do we have this large middle and upper-class black pop you may not be a middle

[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:58.520]
class thing i'm i'm counting on on some of those tickets going to people who just people who

[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:02.860]
just fans of sports period people can't afford the dolphins should be able to afford the heat right

[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:07.300]
the dolphins tickets have gotten pretty expensive but the heat plays a lot more games in the dolphins do

[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.840]
well that's the problem and that's why i've always been scared to plug scuff maybe if we had a basketball

[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:15.200]
team that played only like a 14 game season that might work because we know they'll never make

[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:20.580]
the playoffs anyway well you know how what a funny town this is over over the case of those what

[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:24.360]
is it seven games or seven or eight games we're going to get from the dolphins each year

[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:30.440]
this is what people focus on they and they there's the perception of tremendous unified community

[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:34.760]
enthusiasm for the dolphins except you will not find the stadium sold out after the second

[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:38.960]
last the season unless it's against the jets of the raiders uh that suggests to me yeah there's

[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:43.620]
some enthusiasm but it's not what we think we have everything focused in on this one little

[01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:48.560]
enterprise the Miami dolphins eight times a year if they're lucky and meanwhile the hurricanes can

[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:51.440]
go begging doesn't make any difference what our national ranking is it's making any difference

[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.340]
about vinytas test of liberty they can't fill a stadium for anybody but gainsville another day

[01:51:55.340 --> 01:52:01.220]
and now gainsville has turned tail so what what happens with the NBA is actually they're coming in and

[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:05.260]
and you know the team is is hoping that people are going to adopt this particular franchise and see

[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:10.380]
it through yeah his lean years which Miami has not traditionally done yeah but they won't the other

[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:14.040]
side of it is he won't say he's just tipped owing on the edges but you know they won't why have a

[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:18.700]
problem i would make a guess about baseball but i i don't know enough about basketball to make the

[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:24.360]
guess i'm not a big basketball fan i certainly will go but that i'll do out of sued civic duty

[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:28.580]
you know i'll go to a couple games a year just see what they're under people mover but yes and

[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:33.020]
i will go on the people mover because boy is it convenient and handy and you know for only 25 cents

[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:38.860]
it's your self-flod a transportation bargain but you forced that out of me well i'm talking to this

[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:43.240]
man he's part of his brain i think he had a little bit of the same operation they gave Bill Casey

[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:48.620]
just just a partial and at the herald you know they take all the employees at the herald they take

[01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:52.360]
the employees and they give them the psychological tests and they scream at them and they shout they

[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:59.240]
really do that don't they actually they they do have a testing battery yeah but um i've heard that

[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:02.680]
the test that they do now are just incredible and they take these poor bastards and they put them

[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:07.200]
in a room with some lunatic and he screams and yells and insults them and they just do all kinds of

[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.620]
wild tests that's just part of your weekly process you go in and you meet your editor and that's

[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:17.380]
just the performance review is that what he likes performance review 24 before one at w i and z i

[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:20.940]
think we have to take some calls for cost for because he's backed himself into an up quarters now i

[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:24.340]
just i didn't want to say what might say something about movies before we're finished about the

[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:29.720]
NBA i want to say oh yeah and that is who knows what really will happen because for the first time

[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:34.780]
we have two seasons of professional sports that's going to be very yeah but you've also got

[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:38.840]
to some other hurricanes basketball and you notice even though they sold it out to corporations

[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:42.940]
got all the tickets sold you saw how many people showed up for those what is it tonight's session

[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:47.540]
what i twelve hundred fourteen hundred and what's going to happen to them when we have a pro basket

[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:53.640]
ball team playing at the same time good question yeah excellent questions anybody thought about that

[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:58.680]
i don't know if mr. ho that question he didn't have a very satisfactory answer well no

[01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:05.940]
zev buffman a a prime mover not the but a prime mover in the real franchise does come from my

[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:11.280]
beat as it were my principal beat which is the culture and pseudo intellectual areas and tell what

[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:17.400]
you see now you've convinced me that this is true it is true um i am confident that the i mean

[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:23.380]
this guy sometimes it doesn't always succeed but it's pretty shrewd guy usually studies the stuff

[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:30.700]
and they i've got a figure as base i did base i had all kinds of marketing surveys in which they

[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:34.840]
predicted precisely what many people said wouldn't happen which was a gangbusters opening i got

[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:39.140]
a figure that zev's got a line on the same thing he's got reason to believe that a lot of people

[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:44.660]
are going to come um and certainly if it works at all this team works just within a couple of

[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:50.380]
years that will bring the entire community around it's back baseball very much so i don't know if

[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:56.340]
it'll bring baseball but it will bring overtown back with semblance of decency as a community

[01:54:56.340 --> 01:55:01.420]
bullfighting the same way that base i just bringing this game boulevard back lacrosse to at least

[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:06.820]
the semblance of badminton promise okay bill cost for it is here let's give those numbers down

[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:10.480]
see if the audience wants to talk to them or if they're just a terminal at this point in date

[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:15.260]
county six and you can ask about movies because that's really why he's here but uh you know we like

[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:21.700]
to kill a lot of time in date county six two four oh one nine one let me say it again six two four

[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:28.120]
oh one nine one and inbroward seven six four oh seven oh seven seven seven seven oh seven it's

[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:32.560]
twenty one before one at wion z we're up against sax now so it could be a little bit tough we'll come

[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:38.440]
back right after this okay nineteen before one at wion z neal rangers with my guest bill cost for

[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:43.720]
the movie critic almost at radio critic i guess you're trying to move into that area a little bit for

[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:47.760]
the mimey herald and not too many people want to talk to you bill that's about them lying got very

[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:51.820]
limited number of calls on the board i told you first of all they're not interested in movies they

[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:56.040]
don't care about the basketball team they know it's going to be a flop uh colorization they couldn't

[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.620]
give it damn less they feel they don't like Woody Allen but hey i'll give the numbers out one more

[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:03.020]
time if they will don't want to talk to you that's their business i'm surprised they don't want

[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:07.020]
to talk to you they have a herald target three lines lit on the board i mean that's embarrassing

[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:11.900]
but i'm a barber cap it man get better response and then i'm surprised with all the vitriol about

[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:17.220]
the herald since they have a captive exactly and if you want to rip costs for the hero i mean lend

[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:21.180]
to thorn we wouldn't let you do that too because she's not responsible but he's in here defending

[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:24.900]
it well because she's a decent human being exactly i am not some kind of a suit i'm

[01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:28.700]
defend this kind of yellow journalism i am typical to kind of scum who would not only

[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:33.220]
do one of these stories but would defend it yeah i'm relish it safer it relish it okay i'll give

[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:37.940]
the numbers one more time and if not we'll just say goodbye to the audience in date county six two four

[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:42.360]
of course i guess they heard everything and they needed to know about movies yesterday six two four

[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:48.180]
oh one nine one and date and one open line and brow art at seven six four oh seven oh seven

[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.860]
and bill has promised if you're real nice to him that just before two o'clock he'll tell you why

[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:57.240]
roblow wears the earring okay we don't want to leave it all the sturdy doing i think roblow may be

[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:04.160]
the greatest single talent in motion pictures today my amy hello hello i don't care to know about

[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:10.720]
roblow too much but i might ask a question about movies i believe it or not first of all math

[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:15.120]
appeal i'm glad you mentioned that it it was a fine film a lot was about there enjoyed it excellent

[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:20.360]
yep especially young catholics i think you raised a lot of questions with them good second of all

[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:26.700]
i think basketball is going to bomb but baseball you got a point there well i just mentioned

[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:30.740]
baseball because it's a personal preference and i i'd be really skeptical of that one too it

[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:36.400]
worries me about the my amy audience is are they good over an eighty one home game schedule and

[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:41.320]
that's another question with the NBA are they good how many home games is an NBA team play too many

[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:46.720]
40 something 40 so i mean it could be hockey could be worse could be hockey go down you see the

[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:51.620]
orals and you see the angst up in waterdale they sell it out every week every day they do draw

[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:56.100]
the orals i've actually have noticed are drawing better than they used to i have no

[01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:59.300]
explanation for that because they haven't been doing well in the regular season but the last

[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:04.180]
couple years even at my amy stadium which is in the famous bad neighborhood they're drawing better

[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:09.560]
yeah what i really want to talk about is this colorization thing believe it or not great i'm

[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:15.280]
interested to know if the people who are colorizing these films did they not purchase the rights

[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:21.100]
to do that yes indeed they did so and i've heard neil talking all morning i guess about the

[01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:27.760]
the first amendment rights which are guaranteed and which cannot be bought or sold but we're getting

[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:33.240]
into the debate about someone who actually purchased the rights and therefore probably has the

[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:38.940]
right to colorize the film whether the director or the actor has something to say about it or not

[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:42.640]
well i i think it's one of the reasons why the congressional hearings were such a farce there's

[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:47.760]
a legal issue here i mean that they uh... ted turn has the right to put color on videotapes of

[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:52.500]
movies in the same way that uh... any director who's whose producer has bought a script has a right

[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:56.760]
to make modifications in the script it happens every time it's the way movies are made uh... what it

[01:58:56.760 --> 01:59:02.940]
is is a it's an aesthetic and maybe moral question but what that's doing being debated in congress

[01:59:02.940 --> 01:59:07.220]
i don't have the slightest idea because there's no legal problem for ted turner at all here opinion

[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:12.180]
it is a move point right now yeah the only thing about the surprises me is apparently

[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:17.160]
uh... it is turning out to be true maybe assist a novelty effect but it is turning out to be true that

[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:22.240]
people would rather watch color versions in black and white and maybe i'm just old enough to remember

[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:27.080]
having watched a lot of films in black and white but it seems to me when you turn on the tv it

[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:30.720]
doesn't make a heck of a lot of difference but i guess some of these pictures like it's a wonderful

[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:35.200]
life that i think of as being in black and white are actually drawing a bigger audience because they're

[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:40.120]
in these ridiculous ice cream colors and that surprises me i don't know why it is but uh... they're

[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:45.520]
out there those people have been do you think the same uh... problem applies when you turn on tv and

[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:49.700]
you get a nike commercial with uh... john lenin's revolution in the background

[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:56.560]
that's kind of bastardizing those songs it is to the extent that you uh... to the extent that they

[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:01.480]
once meant something to you and i'm of the generation that bites were sold yeah i am excellent

[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:05.340]
and he sold them uh... unfortunately uh...

[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:09.800]
as pure as michael would like us to think that he is he does a lot of things for money and that was

[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:15.580]
one and and that's kind of a said deal a yes like hearing a bob dilland ballad being used to pedal

[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:21.440]
arms or something it's the whole business of rock sell out is a said one but but you know rock groups

[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:26.920]
by and large sold out a long time ago there've been sponsored tours for years uh... and um...

[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.920]
you know popular music is no longer the force for social change at once was and even if it were

[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:36.960]
given the tenor of the times i think if rock groups are going to make a social statement would

[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:42.300]
probably make a lot of money and do it now because that's that's the social thrust of today as opposed

[02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:46.800]
to the sixties when it was we don't care about money we want uh... you know an idealistic life for

[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:51.060]
that kind of thing frankly yes it annoys me a great deal when i see venerated popular songs that

[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:56.980]
once had political meaning being used to pedal shoes uh... what i do then is i and i really do do this

[02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:03.180]
i i do i do do this i don't buy the product then i mean the products i won't buy you said several

[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:06.000]
things on a show today by the way which i'm not so sure are acceptable

[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:10.780]
we'll check with standards and practices after the show so you can come back as radio being

[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:16.800]
pervasive my words of already sunk exactly the very too of self-love like the newspaper we did

[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:20.720]
would just shows up on your doorstep these words even if you don't order it these words

[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:26.100]
sit in the homes now like PCBs are read on and they'll come up to infect the young

[02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:29.760]
fm inspector come in once a month to spray the walls to get them out

[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:36.460]
we have an open-line in date six to four oh nine one point and beach hello i know hi i have a question

[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:43.080]
about movies uh... yes car yes i'm just a hot one which i would go to see in a way because i like him

[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:48.420]
warm baby i don't understand what the big deal is but he'll probably okay it's gotten terrible

[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:53.060]
you but i plan on seeing it anyways what did you think about it well i didn't think it was terrible

[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:57.680]
i i don't think it's very funny uh... i i'm writing about this for this for this sunday one of the sad

[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:03.360]
things uh... about our our obsession these days with money is in lists and rankings and ratings

[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.280]
and all the rest is that no one can get away from the i'd been the knowledge that ished our cost

[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:13.280]
between forty and fifty million dollars to make hence although it's not a very funny movie now it's

[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:18.820]
being called a colossal uh... dud their colossally dunder headed or an unbelievably big failure well

[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:23.340]
it's not that if you didn't know how much it cost you'd walk in i think you'd chuckle enjoy it and

[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:27.820]
you'd walk out but unfortunately now that we know and made a big deal of how much it cost people are

[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:32.180]
judging it in terms of its money it certainly doesn't look as if it should have cost fifty million dollars

[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:37.960]
on the other hand uh... yeah it's a chuckle movie but given the salaries of war and baby and dust and

[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:42.660]
hopman and the director of the movie cost fourteen million dollars before they've done anything these are very

[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:47.460]
high-paid people so uh... it's not a big movie it's going to lose somebody a tremendous amount of money

[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:51.580]
and the odd thing is i'm in agreement with you in one interesting statement which is i've never

[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:56.440]
understood with the big deal is about one baby either he has not made that many films most of them

[02:02:56.440 --> 02:03:02.240]
have been successes but he's one of the most powerful and popular men in hollywood and um...

[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:07.160]
uh... i guess because he's long been thought of as being a guaranteed box office draw ishtar is about

[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:11.360]
to prove that that is not true well it's his money and it's so he's the one is going to lose it

[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.280]
well actually columbia pictures is going to lose the fifty million dollars but he's the producer

[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.520]
he's the producer but he produced in the real sense not the executive producer sense that is

[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:27.620]
he was for a five hundred thousand dollar fee the man who ran the operation uh... he uh...

[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:32.480]
supervised the hiring of people made sure they were on schedule and assisted director in any way

[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:38.600]
he could but he has he told me he gave the director free hand for the most part uh... and in this

[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.440]
case producer does not mean that he put up the money the money came from columbia pictures twenty

[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:46.620]
eight million dollars and they went over that budget by about as much as twenty three more

[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:50.520]
well i would have done a fifty one hundred fifty thousand yeah i would have done it for a hundred

[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:53.000]
and fifty i i would have to get okay

[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.140]
what is called to be great somebody in a pay phone in hollywood wants to talk about the herald hello

[02:03:58.140 --> 02:04:04.820]
a male yes first time call here good and uh... i just thought this is the perfect opportunity to

[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:09.780]
colon with this uh... musing and a good i have for you uh... last month on what then i was

[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:13.060]
taking a vacation out in calirato and we're on a flight out to denver

[02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:18.240]
and we notice in the seats in front of us was this young attractable and sitting there reading

[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:23.740]
a book mining for business and then the seat next to her was vacant but then on the out seat was

[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:30.300]
this uh... twelfth of a guy and it was so obvious that he was annoying and testing her as he kept

[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:36.640]
wrapping and hawking her and and trying to press her what he does and for living and trying to

[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:40.960]
pick up and she was very polite and was just trying to ignore him but this was going on for the

[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:46.180]
entire flight out to denver guess who that was sitting next to her

[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:49.160]
carry heart no

[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:56.000]

feeler and we were listening he's dropping in on the conversation and it turns out to be so

[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:05.640]
ironic that uh... you know people in class have a shouldn't go how do you like that

[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.200]
actually i've never known feeler to be boastful at all

[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:12.860]
but there are some people who get off on their role as reporters but i've never known

[02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:16.660]
tealer to do that he's very quiet soft spoken man but maybe he leads a double life

[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:21.580]
and i would like to get his the car can't of the mimey her old well now that this is out

[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:25.620]

ishtar uh... six two four oh one nine one bay harbour island hello hello yes i'd like to ask mr

[02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:11.900]
comfort about two pictures one picture was beyond therapy

[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:19.380]
why did that only last one week in the city i don't know i i really like to be on therapy a lot

[02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:25.360]
really nice next journey in a profound sense yeah uh it was the robert alton uh

[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:29.840]
adaptation of the deranged play about people in their and their therapist and of course the

[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:34.380]
therapist wound up being crazy and they were it was a it was a farce never fails it was

[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:39.120]
thought you know ten times the the farce the dishtie is for instance very funny movie a lot of

[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:44.540]
people just hated it and i got some mean mail on that and also got some bad reviews and people just

[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:50.640]
wouldn't go we were far people in the in the movie sometimes they just don't work uh

[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:56.580]
alton is a perfect example he's the same guy who made nashville and a wedding in mash right uh... but

[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:02.060]
people are forgotten that and he had a he's he's been on a downhill slide people don't go to see his

[02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:07.240]
movies anymore uh... i have no explanation for that one there there are times when people have radar

[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:13.240]
for quality movies and it's it's a better radar than the u.s.s stark head like anti radar they

[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:17.000]
detect a good movie and they won't go we have another great movie call coming up next it says the

[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:21.040]
owner of the pussycat theater is online three could this be the roigriff at the

[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:25.900]
reeling calling in it could be hello yes it is i can't believe it i'm calling my car the reason i'm

[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:31.920]
calling is the about a month ago the city of Miami police department of as a total of eleven

[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:38.960]
officers to lieutenant the mimey fire department came to the theater and confiscated a film which they

[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:45.640]
said was obscene at the time confiscated all the equipment tucked down the screen and uh... there

[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:51.060]
was a lot of time and effort on the film the mimey here all for four week straight they were once

[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:55.860]
paid they run for complete pages in the neighbor section photographs and everything

[02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:02.340]
yesterday we were in court with the same film and judge client rule that the film was not

[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:07.800]
obscene i haven't seen anything missing the hell about that at all this is the first time hearing of it

[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:12.800]
although uh... since we've got people covering courts like i can't imagine that that someone else

[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:18.040]
isn't aware of it uh... and i would expect we we'd have a story on that uh... uh... this but the law

[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:23.760]
there also trying to charge us with now is the racketeering law uh... which they went back uh...

[02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:29.460]
seventeen years or eleven years i think it was not trying to take the eighteen films out of the uh...

[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:34.600]
five thousand something we have ran and those they did take and make a rest of eighteen of

[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:40.660]
the cell of eighteen films were declared uh... with just with health eudication not guilty and they're

[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:45.140]
trying to make a racketeering act uh... with it which they can make it sick they could confiscate

[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:51.340]
all the properties that are on my gated here in the cooperators the voters uh... also anything

[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:56.960]
i own and put us right out of business this is an intriguing approach uh... that this been kicked

[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:02.500]
around for years now to uh... uh... restricting so-called obscene films is the racketeering statute but

[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:08.080]
what's bad about this law is that anyone that profits are it takes money from this corporation

[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:14.160]
can also be a code of film and that it yeah the idea being that uh... uh... uh...

[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:18.280]
for not for a graphic films presumably are all manufactured by organized crime which is a statement

[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:24.000]
that is uh... transparently false but beyond that it's amazing case of selective enforcement because

[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.920]
if we were to go after every uh... legitimate business that beneath it had some sort of organized

[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:35.920]
crime tie we could start with uh... nightclub and cabaret acts and and just we could fold down all

[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.640]
live entertainment by the same uh... criterion because i mean you got the comedian such as don

[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:45.600]
rickles who will openly joke about their mob agents and the guys who are booking them uh... it's

[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:49.620]
it's in it's not even a secret in the industry the fact is there are a number of uh... glossy

[02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:53.580]
industries that are mobbed up to one extent or another i mean if we were going to worry much about

[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:57.780]
racketeering behind enterprises we should shut down truck drivers because the teamsters and

[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:04.020]
see every past it's another example of a little scam being run for a moralistic purpose uh... actually

[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:09.300]
people who worry about the pussycat theater ought to feel uh... happy that my amy has so few of these

[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:13.320]
that i i'm toying with the idea in the back of my mind to pussycat and that one on my me beach

[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:17.220]
i think it's the Roosevelt or whatever ought to be declared like some sort of historic monuments in my

[02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:21.540]
because so far it has very few of them in the videotape business is almost eviscerated them we

[02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:25.900]
should treasure the couple that we have and the whole idea of them uh... what we should uh... you know

[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:30.140]
kind of protect because they're a they're in disappearing species right the reason i'm caught also

[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:37.780]
this law is so loose so bad that the my amy harrow could be a co-dependent in this lawsuit and

[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:42.060]
they could actually bring them in the fact is that they've taken over to me and dollars of my money

[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:47.440]
in advertising and they certainly know what type of films we run we run extra to theaters they

[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:52.280]
advertise they've did articles on it and where this law reads at anyone that's profits from it

[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:57.260]
could be brought in the co-dependent uh... this is the first time they've tried this type of

[02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:03.680]
law and a state of florida uh... so far judge we want to find judge fuller and he issue would not

[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:09.220]
issue a temporary restraining order against the uh... for the city for the theaters and they have

[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:14.880]
sixty days to answer and they could appeal to the decision meantime we're still tied up in court

[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:19.960]
uh... with this hanging over our heads that they could come and confiscate the properties and uh...

[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:24.480]
put it in complete out of business just because of these films they uh... that was absolutely

[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:29.060]
well that i think that we're up to somewhere we want even if you have one the case okay i'm out of

[02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:32.340]
time here later but uh... hopefully you bill will get to the right people at the

[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:36.860]
here another good scam here to involve in this in that they've been doing this to the video shops a lot

[02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:40.880]
okay that is that you pick up when we come back at michael fives the headline cbs with the world

[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:46.140]
news at one will come back to any more news wins if you'd like to call me all down one oh seven

[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:50.600]
of w i and c that story about urie geller was really uh... little more in a new realize because

[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:54.340]
the man's been proven to be a fraud to begin with so what difference is it make what he's

[02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:59.280]
eating right at this age of the game but don't confuse cbs with the tales okay we have an open

[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:03.160]
line somebody passed out and they when they heard about that they were busy bending their spoon at

[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.420]
lunchtime and it couldn't handle it uh... six two four oh one nine one now before we go back to the

[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:12.860]
calls you were right in the midst of a uh... about the pussy cat theater and about the great scam about

[02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:19.220]
exquisite x rated videotape prosecutions is what they do they um... they get some judgments

[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:22.360]
here and there yeah that session such movie as obscene

[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:27.920]
then they don't go to the videotape store and say you better look out for such as such movie

[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:35.980]
they go and give them a long list of movies that might be obscene on there will be the titles that

[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:40.400]
they know they have a judgment on somewhere else so the videotape people are there in the situation

[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:45.340]
where if the law are really designed to call out that you know really mean they don't specific

[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:50.360]
the title and the people you know it's a okay that's out that's out what they do instead is tell

[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:55.760]
them you may have one and they have no choice but to either get rid of all their their sex videos

[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:59.960]
or be busted and you'll note that the bus are routinely against only one kind of person

[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:04.420]
poor eighteen and nineteen year old clerk who's in their work is never gets any other kind of

[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:08.780]
person in the bus to click it is the most is really a savage and it's like for a long time

[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:14.600]
busted up in bay county because he sold a cassette an album to a fourteen year old boy without a

[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:21.120]
sticker on it didn't have a tipper sticker on by the way i now again i know that we're all supposed to be

[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:26.880]
rational about this uh... and i think of myself as a serious political thinker but there's no way

[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:31.000]
Albert Gore and i keep hearing more and more about him is getting my vote now any circumstances

[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.380]
and it's because of his wife you know because of him but it's because of her she's a lunatic and

[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:38.960]
i don't want anything to do with those people how about if he gets divorced divorced and runs away

[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.240]
down a right for men this okay to my any hello

[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:44.940]
all i know

[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:46.940]
that you guys are a bit

[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:50.060]
i'm sitting here in my office at my door close

[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:52.340]
that's what hysterical laughing at you

[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.180]
that couple of questions for you bill i read your column consistently

[02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.360]
love disagreeing with you

[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:03.400]
paper health but it's unfortunately it's the only game in town

[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:06.820]
and i've been a subscriber from more than fifteen years and that horrible

[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:11.460]
well it is it's it's just mangan depressing i've been a subscriber only a little bit longer but

[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:15.900]
they've got the only game in town but it is um... the major game in time

[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:21.780]
i bet it's really frustrating but i still get the time to find out what's really going on

[02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:25.860]
before i hold good for you well i get the times every day two for a different perspective

[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:30.460]
oh do you really well yeah but there's an interesting you know we well not course i i

[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:33.720]
i wouldn't miss the times each day either but the national edition of the times has so much

[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:36.780]
earlier deadlines and in fact your national news will be more up to date in the

[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:40.940]
herald every day the only time you'll get a break on the times as if they have a scoop

[02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:44.680]
a story that a herald doesn't have absolutely right but if you really want to know what's

[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:49.300]
happening in town and you care about your community you've got to read your local newspaper

[02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:54.700]
yes you do and you don't have to agree with the newspaper oh oh no i love disagreeing with it

[02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:59.100]
yeah i happen to be another one who adores what he allen

[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:05.100]
i'm a big whaty allen fan do you know what his next movie is going to be and when it's coming out

[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:10.900]
i can confidently tell you um... that the title of it is woody allen's untitled because that's always

[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:17.900]
the title at this point in his working uh... then uh... after a while it will probably become woody

[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:23.280]
allen's fall movie will be on the second working title and i would expect that once again we will

[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:28.900]
see it in january or february of eighty eight what it is about and who's in it i don't know

[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:34.200]
some people may but this is usually a closely guarded secret uh... in this time again apparently it is

[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:41.860]
i did hear that um... he will be in his next one as opposed to not uh... in all how terrific

[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:46.400]
you know you will be in the new one uh... i i had heard that but there's never any telling you

[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:51.260]
know he does keep them under wraps uh... and uh... we're considering staking out the set up we

[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:54.320]
i can't believe he's going to finally be a daddy

[02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:59.180]
yeah i think that's an amazing thing fifty one years old and and they've no plans to marry of course

[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:01.940]
but he says you know this will be an interesting experience the weird thing about is

[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:07.380]
it even uh... mea has said woody doesn't much like kids so this will be intriguing

[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:11.740]
they are intriguing couple i really think they're really a perfect match quite honest

[02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:18.720]
there they are one other question uh... i'm going to see ishtar i happen to remember a lame

[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:22.920]
when they were nickels in the way with the big fan of their yeah i'm a very big

[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:29.320]
best in hotman so my uh... one dd i can take a leave mostly i can leave except i

[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:31.560]
have to like shampoo very very much

[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:36.940]
but i will see it well i would encourage everyone to see it i you know i didn't like the film very

[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:42.540]
much i gave it uh... a two star review but uh... i never think of the purpose of those is

[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:47.900]
giving people an excuse not to go to a movie uh... anybody with any curiosity about any of the

[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:53.540]
participants ought to go definitely and my last question basically is uh... about rich

[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:58.600]
a chamberlain he has done so well on t.v. how come he's never made it on the big screen

[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:03.480]
uh... a number of people are that way uh... david janssen with the same way that's another

[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:08.140]
one that i really liked very talented yeah the best definition i've heard of that is that

[02:17:08.140 --> 02:17:13.200]
these were these were figures who were essentially uh... to hot or depending on who you believe

[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:18.180]
to cool for the big screen they were small screen you know that the small screen is the cool

[02:17:18.180 --> 02:17:24.020]
medium they were perfect for the uh... for the smaller screen and they just don't blow up very well

[02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:29.560]
there are a number of them who are like that i don't have any more profound um... explanation for

[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:34.440]
that except that whenever i see Richard chamberlain uh... in big close-up for instance i'm aware

[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:38.700]
that i don't think he's a very good actor whenever i see him on television i never i never think that

[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:42.960]
i always think that he's you know perfectly adequate to the role uh... janssen is very much the

[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:47.340]
same way i thought he was a marvelous television actor uh... in the few films that i saw him in

[02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:49.740]
i just was never impressed one way or the other

[02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:52.700]
if his play life berth jell on broodway has a close

[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:58.160]
who's uh... i wrote to chamberlain oh um... i don't know i don't know i'm sorry to say

[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:02.760]
trip up to new york and i just wondering if you have the information uh... no but i do know this is not a

[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:07.740]
plug that uh... we we run the uh... you know the broadway listings in the in the sunday hero virtually every

[02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:12.840]
sunday it would be in there okay again thank you and you i am so glad that you are on in the

[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:18.000]
morning and during the day me too i you have no idea how happy i am okay thanks a lot thank you

[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.560]
bye speaking of band videos let's take a call from margate hello

[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:28.560]
oh gee whizno we don't like to ban videos here in margate uh... it's unfair um... i was going to

[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:33.080]
ask um... bill about colorization but then when you got the call from

[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:37.580]
leroy griffith it opened up a whole new avenue of my conversation

[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:42.420]
i used to be one of the prosecutors that worked to get a persecutor's that worked

[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:49.200]
against leroy and a number of his films that we confiscated from the fussy cat you were one of

[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:54.160]
those people who is wasting taxpayers dollars you're absolutely right we're wasting the tax payers

[02:18:54.160 --> 02:19:00.020]
dollars um... going against this guy who had in my opinion every right to show whatever he wanted

[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:06.820]
to show because you couldn't let kids under 18 into the theater and these were adults who wanted

[02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:11.820]
to pay to see the stop so i saw absolutely no reason why that's one of the reasons i left

[02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:19.000]
absolutely no reason why he couldn't show his film uh... bill said that there was uh... or

[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:25.280]
you did say that what we would do is going with a list of mom and pop video and say you may have

[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:31.820]
some point out we wouldn't go in with a list we send in an undercover guy he got the x-rated

[02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:38.760]
section it says clearly x-rated adults only no one under 18 admitted uh... closed off with a

[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:44.440]
door they go in they pick some of the raunchies looking to take a home you know buy him

[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:50.580]
few four five times get their jolly's write them down take them to a judge and it depended on

[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:56.680]
which judge he went to is to whether he decided it was obscene or not yeah yeah and jerry

[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:02.760]
client since he left his wife or his life left him has never has has yet to find something

[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:09.120]
obscene while he was married everything was obscene uh... it depends on your judge and it depends

[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:14.680]
on what happens during the day with them as to whether they're going to go and go along with uh...

[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:20.200]
determining something is not to be seen by the general public that's an interesting nuance that

[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:24.000]
yeah you you wait for your judge or wait for your judge to go through change of life for something

[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.280]
and then when you got it that's true uh... in in some video stories have been into

[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:33.280]
they get a list but only after the the tapes have been read only after the bust has been made

[02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:39.260]
well yeah well it was that before five days they take all those days down you know uh...

[02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:44.320]
and the older judges that don't want to make uh... or make uh... these movies are seen

[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:50.200]
the younger ones won't go near it i mean i used to walk around with one of the cops trying to find

[02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:56.300]
a judge that was in who i knew with the clear something of scene when we had to get a warrant out

[02:20:56.300 --> 02:21:01.460]
and it was it was ridiculous it's about which one is here to well this one is off the list here

[02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:05.380]
and let's see judge that one no we don't want to go to him he's going to get in the heart but what

[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:09.540]
is the what is the purpose of this though i mean of the exercise other than the continued

[02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:17.220]
posturing for the public well thanks rocker fellow operato yeah way out there in Miami and uh...

[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:20.600]
basically they're saying we don't want to see no this district

[02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:25.960]
and that's why they're doing it i mean why else did they post the post the drama

[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:31.280]
on the board when they have better things to go after it's something that's very visible

[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:37.700]
very public and makes a big splash you know like when the herald wanted to print the name or when

[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.040]
the herald did print the names of the john it makes a big

[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:48.500]
splash everyone knows the constant doing something that we asked them to do and that's why they're

[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:54.900]
doing it i mean they they busted a couple of the stores and it made made all the local news stories

[02:21:54.900 --> 02:22:00.580]
uh... about a year and a half ago because wow gee what we know leo are you were going to go

[02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:05.740]
we go and we're going to do all this wonderful stuff against them and then we find it just doesn't

[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:11.800]
fly later on and when the judges come back with no disease not obscene after i've

[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:12.780]
viewed it three times

[02:22:12.780 --> 02:22:21.580]
of course it's you know we go into uh... uh... try out these guys and you show in sixteen films

[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:24.940]
and after the first film the jury of judges like

[02:22:24.940 --> 02:22:29.680]
give me a break they're tired they're bored they don't see it they sleep

[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:33.920]
and then they only judge the first film of scene all the rest of the work because i didn't see him

[02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:35.960]
or they're snows right yeah

[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:39.400]
so that's that's what i had to say well i lost it on polarization

[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:43.820]
i had to get the pornography off my chest because leo is right

[02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:48.880]
you know in in so many ways well again a big problem we have to is that uh...

[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:52.520]
uh... x-rated materials don't have many defenders you know you get a broad first

[02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:55.400]
amendment defense often that will say now i don't like this kind of thing but

[02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:58.080]
you could very few people come out and say i like it

[02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:02.800]
and it and you know and it's defensible on these grounds uh... most people take the

[02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:06.300]
more timid approach uh... and it's too bad andrew sarah's film critic for the

[02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:11.120]
village voice periodically uh... comes out and writes unqualified defenses

[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:15.660]
openography he likes it he enjoys it and and he will actually discuss it

[02:23:15.660 --> 02:23:16.220]
uh... but

[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:19.620]
you know most people don't want to defend this kind of thing is again it's the

[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:22.660]
unpopular speech who wants to defend unpopular speech it's like that

[02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:24.280]
nazi's marching in scoki

[02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:28.340]
sorry the same thing when the government starts making these definitions of what

[02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:28.960]
is

[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:33.320]
and what is not obscene is you know we we lost it we blew it right there how many

[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:35.520]
years ago is that fifteen years ago whatever was

[02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:37.660]
uh... when we allowed the government

[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:41.020]
to say what is obscene and what is not try to define it

[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:43.380]
that was the beginning of the end and other road just keeps getting

[02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:47.060]
deeper and longer and we're i don't know if we're going to get out of it

[02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:49.580]
well the assumption that most people don't seem to grasp the government is

[02:23:49.580 --> 02:23:53.100]
making is that we cannot for ourselves in a determination exactly we can't do

[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:55.980]
it we've got to have them do it and if somebody doesn't want to see it nobody is

[02:23:55.980 --> 02:23:58.440]
dragging them off the street no matter what it is

[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:01.320]
and we're now in a period of supposedly is the most conservative government has

[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:04.220]
been always likely to be in some time and we know the conservatives are

[02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:07.260]
nearly want less government but in fact is nothing conservative about this

[02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:10.540]
no no all that the conservatives only want less government when it comes

[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:13.520]
to regulating big business the people that they represent

[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:17.000]
they want more government when it comes to regulating public private

[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.960]
morality that's when they want to really step in this really this really

[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.660]
meets these two things clash completely in the fcc business because all this

[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:28.300]
talk about the marketplace will decide the marketplace has

[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:31.860]
decided on how it's done in the ariders there's no question about community

[02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:35.440]
standards the community standard is the ariders the other stuff is off to

[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:38.460]
the side because the most in the community standard is how it's turned that's

[02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:41.920]
what people are listening to it is come you know come when the marketplace

[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:45.480]
meets the desire to regulate morally it's great well you know wonderful

[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:46.740]
explosion for these people

[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:49.140]
uh... the thing is do we have to live with this now

[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:52.340]
as reagan is in grassy disappear we have to live with it for ten or twenty

[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:52.660]
years

[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:56.340]
more of this haven't helped us twenty minutes passed one at w i n z bill

[02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:57.980]
cost for this year the movie

[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:03.840]
twenty two minutes passed one of w i n z i didn't want to i wanted to make you

[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.080]
feel a little insecure of course you did but what we see i purposely open the

[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:09.680]
phones in the middle of the lunch hour in the new hour which is always the

[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:13.380]
impossible hour to start the phones that we're on the first comes on to

[02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:15.680]
well he does have uh...

[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:17.400]
let's go to hollywood next hello

[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:19.220]
hollywood

[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:22.460]
nothing must be just left to call ron sacks is a matter of fact

[02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:23.620]
boka hello

[02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:24.840]
hello are you doing okay

[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:28.400]
yet let's make a comment about what you know i have a you said it next movies

[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:30.200]
on title i have a title for it

[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:32.120]
and it is a row c's of the rich and privileged

[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:35.660]
okay uh... what was the first part of the row c's

[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:37.800]
neuroses of the rich in privilege

[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:41.220]
i have a lot of time what you know i feel he's very smart in his movies

[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:45.440]
his movies all about his rich and privileged friends is very insulated

[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:47.600]
this is how i don't know i don't know

[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:50.920]
he's a he lives in a fantasy land because he's in his own world

[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:54.100]
it all over the world you have to make like a white movies you know let him

[02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:56.760]
make them but i don't want to see him well he does live in his own world i

[02:25:56.760 --> 02:25:59.720]
i think increasingly you'd find him willing to admit that although one of the

[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:01.040]
things he takes a knock for

[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:06.280]
uh... that is shooting almost exclusively in the york uh... and and placing

[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:07.140]
everything in the york

[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:11.900]
there's a less those are more prosaic answer for and that is that that would

[02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:12.240]
eat

[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:15.660]
just likes to shoot location as over sets

[02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:17.580]
largely because

[02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:19.780]
he knows he can do so on a lower budget

[02:26:19.780 --> 02:26:22.620]
uh... and he knows new york it feels comfortable there he's admitted

[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:25.300]
he doesn't like to believe the city that's where he lives

[02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:27.960]
and basically he should things there just because it's easy

[02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:32.100]
why why i can understand that however he doesn't like to leave it mentally

[02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:34.000]
you know it was with his uh...

[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.440]
close uh... circle friends and all

[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:39.160]
all of them are very neurotic the very privilege

[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:41.520]
they live in a fantasy world of Manhattan

[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:45.860]
and if you if you're ready to read of new york a magazine it seems like you

[02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:47.620]
could take any story in new york magazine

[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:50.560]
and it would be what he owns script at the same attitude

[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:53.000]
i would point out though that uh...

[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:56.580]
for instance uh... purple rose of kaira was a film that

[02:26:57.140 --> 02:27:00.100]
had nothing to do with anybody or privilege there was uh... it was a fantasy

[02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:01.020]
about uh...

[02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:04.240]
a woman during the depression that would have bad marriage and movie actor

[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:06.860]
actually stepped out of the screen and fell in love with her

[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:09.800]
and in her life now everybody and that was poor except for the actor

[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:12.320]
uh... but uh... in an interesting reversal he had

[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.220]
the rich swells frozen up on the screen while their actor was out having

[02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:19.560]
an affair in real life the rest of the people who were in this uh...

[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:21.320]
in a rich uh... setting

[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:23.960]
couldn't they couldn't go on with their scene and there was simply frozen

[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:26.960]
there and kind of immobilized but for the most part you're right alan does that

[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:28.960]
kind of thing i happen to still find him very funny

[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:32.440]
i love radio days which was only half and half about rich folks

[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:33.560]
visit period peace

[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:36.520]
and the family in radio days was uh...

[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:38.860]
was you know lower middle class uh...

[02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:40.260]
right and poor and

[02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:44.200]
you know he isn't acquired taste not everybody goes for it

[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:46.520]
uh... some people are turned off by new york humor but

[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:47.640]
but some other people

[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:49.140]
simply don't

[02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:52.280]
like the whole idea they don't buy the constant erotic business and i can

[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:54.160]
understand that i can grasp it actually

[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:56.680]
what he alons films are never that popular

[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:00.380]
and also is most popular film uh... any hall was not a big money maker

[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:01.400]
you agree with that you

[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:05.120]
and also on colorization i just want to say that i think it does work well with

[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:05.540]
all musical

[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:09.160]
i think yaki doodan did actually uh... with chiming cagney

[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:11.320]
i think it actually added to that movie

[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:15.460]
well the flash movie to begin with a number of people uh... uh... think that

[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:17.500]
well although there are no minority at least

[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:20.780]
no they're not the minority obviously most people think colorization is neat

[02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:21.940]
because they're watching it but

[02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:25.440]
some critics have even made the point that

[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:29.260]
cheerleys some of these movies do look better uh... the best example i've seen

[02:28:29.260 --> 02:28:31.040]
is some old lower than hearty to real is

[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:32.140]
that have been

[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:35.200]
colored and the color is still bad enough so that

[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:39.000]
it's not very good color and all our two real is almost looks like one of

[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:39.620]
those old colored

[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:43.320]
postcards where people used to put the pastel photo colors on top of postcards

[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:46.680]
uh... and they have a real antique flavor because of that and they do they

[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:47.240]
look fine

[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:49.400]
yaki doodan i guess is not a piece

[02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:51.020]
not a piece of fluff so that

[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:55.120]
right now i think really what has people most upset is the idea that

[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:58.340]
ted turner the ultimate fillist in can do what he wants

[02:28:58.340 --> 02:28:59.120]
with

[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:02.800]
those movies it's the same thing the uh... the earlier color mentioned you know

[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:03.520]
michael jackson

[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:06.640]
owns the beetle songs and you can do with them what he wants and

[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:09.740]
frankly i don't trust michael jackson i'm not happy about really

[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:13.180]
no i don't think i don't trust michael jackson is a strange you know he keeps

[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:16.760]
your abs and weasel's and stuff and talks to snakes the guy is just as you know

[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:18.260]
he's a wonderful scandal because

[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:21.840]
pepsy apparently is this whole generation of ads that can't release with michael

[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:22.240]
jackson

[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:24.700]
uh... just because he's he's too odd

[02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:26.260]
they're afraid that people who drink pepsy

[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:27.860]
here comes good

[02:29:29.700 --> 02:29:30.180]
hello

[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:31.960]
this is michael jackson

[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:34.880]
urgent you to help stop the spread of social disease

[02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:36.420]
don't risk your life

[02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:38.960]
but having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar queen

[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:41.140]
i heard you to do like i do

[02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:42.120]
go alone

[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:44.140]
but make sure you were protection

[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:47.140]
that's why i recommend the michael jackson glove

[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:48.800]
one on either hand

[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:50.080]
the michael jackson glove

[02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:53.320]
add the security piece of mind that i need to do it myself

[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:54.840]
so remember

[02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:57.260]
before you put it out put it on

[02:29:57.260 --> 02:29:57.700]
and

[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:01.580]
michael jackson glove

[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:05.100]
proving once again that a bird in the hand is better than one in the bush

[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:07.680]
a better than sequin models for extra stimulation

[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:10.360]
now i have to always wanted to live in a uh... glass bubble

[02:30:10.860 --> 02:30:14.500]
i mean isn't that just what every and it's a bit of a still i still enjoy

[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:17.320]
this particular spot this is the best one of the short things to do it

[02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:20.500]
joe johnson while listening to do something redeeming his life before he

[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:21.720]
try to become a talk show host

[02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:23.260]
joe was not ordinarily that funny

[02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:27.100]
now but if i should if you want to fight out to them in some night on

[02:30:27.100 --> 02:30:27.580]
saturday

[02:30:27.580 --> 02:30:29.040]
he showed a rare night sky

[02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:31.100]
he is an ice guy but not funny

[02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:34.680]
you know i'm saying joe and this is like uh... you know if he would have

[02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:37.540]
dealt with this thing properly if you would have sold it or something

[02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:40.740]
uh... he could probably live the rest of his life of that

[02:30:40.740 --> 02:30:44.720]
and see people don't mind stakeouts of uh... michael jackson or madonna and

[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:47.160]
shan ten that's interesting they don't mind that kind of thing at all

[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:49.980]
you've never seen michael jackson he doesn't come out you don't see michael

[02:30:49.980 --> 02:30:53.620]
although i know there's a paparazzi even now outside the uh... disney attraction

[02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:56.780]
in his backyard you know working in hope in the catch michael walking around

[02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:57.800]
the uh...

[02:30:57.800 --> 02:30:58.760]
the oxygen tenor

[02:30:59.320 --> 02:30:59.700]
wait a minute

[02:30:59.700 --> 02:31:02.240]
we're being kind of something really good is coming up here

[02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:03.740]
something is happening

[02:31:05.340 --> 02:31:06.560]
what is that sunny fox

[02:31:07.300 --> 02:31:08.580]
sunny is playing sunny fox

[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:10.500]
who was that

[02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:14.740]
although sunny fox calling i thought somebody was playing a tape of sunny fox

[02:31:14.740 --> 02:31:15.800]
what was he saying

[02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:19.260]
he was but i don't even care what he was saying you believe the sunny fox called

[02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:23.040]

[02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:26.020]

[02:31:26.660 --> 02:31:29.520]
i don't even know sunny well i don't have any city itself lucky

[02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:30.780]
fortwaterdale hello

[02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:32.740]
are you there

[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:35.500]
how are you great

[02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:38.700]
we haven't spoken for many many years how come

[02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:42.540]
the last time i called you we were speculating on the possibility of richer

[02:31:42.540 --> 02:31:45.520]
cennets uh... breaking into the clean spedroom

[02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:53.320]
and since then uh... from what i hear he probably has

[02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:56.760]
values you recall we we were talking about the fact perhaps he was uh... trying

[02:31:56.760 --> 02:31:59.600]
to find out how real clean decorators hit the boot well

[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:01.080]
exactly i do remember that

[02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:02.220]
it's a long time

[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:05.820]
yeah since then it closed up most of his uh... joints so what is that

[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:07.060]
yes indeed

[02:32:07.060 --> 02:32:09.900]
good talking to you and uh... i'm back

[02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:12.560]
with you again i'm glad that you're under the day

[02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:14.160]
and i've enjoyed you thoroughly

[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:17.040]
uh... bill how are you okay yourself

[02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:21.320]
very well thank you i have enjoyed your column for a long long time

[02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:23.380]
that to questions for you

[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:26.400]
what is care over net doing these days

[02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:28.800]
i don't have the answer to that

[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:32.460]
that was a hit sounds to hear sounds could know these things yeah but or maybe

[02:32:32.460 --> 02:32:34.980]
jack sturdie or jack sturdie might i you know

[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:37.540]
have not heard

[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:41.560]
word one about what she's doing since about a year ago she was involved with

[02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:44.180]
some benefit might have been one of the aids benefits in hollywood i haven't

[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:44.740]
heard a thing

[02:32:45.340 --> 02:32:48.420]
uh... and certainly no movie plan that i know i'm that's for sure

[02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:51.680]
okay uh... how about lily tom when she planning to do a movie

[02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:55.000]
in the near future no she's apparently going to go back

[02:32:55.640 --> 02:32:59.240]
uh... on the stage with uh... the one-woman show the search for intelligent

[02:32:59.240 --> 02:33:02.500]
life in the universe uh... the movie is now out

[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:06.680]
uh... that the documentary on how she put together that show with Jane Wagner

[02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:10.560]
and this was the movie that that lily sued the filmmakers for after having

[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:11.660]
agreed to you know

[02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:15.620]
uh... let them film her part of her act she sued them for taking too much of the

[02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:15.940]
act

[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:18.660]
uh... and the suit eventually was thrown out

[02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:21.940]
uh... because the judge ruled that the film was you know that they had not

[02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:23.720]
trespassed their agreement but meanwhile the

[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:27.900]
the the publicity over that and the good reception the film has received

[02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:30.420]
uh... has caused her to think that she

[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:34.240]
kind of uh... closed the broadway show too soon so you can go back to New York

[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:34.820]
and do that

[02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:36.760]
uh... and i would get you to do it for a year so

[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:39.980]
which i'm glad for cuz i've not seen seen it in the supposed to be marvelous

[02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:40.620]
show

[02:33:41.060 --> 02:33:44.740]
uh... i know you're not jack sturdie and i wouldn't even presume to ask this

[02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:48.380]
question however it has been served me for quite some time how is bernell

[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:48.760]
health

[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:50.820]
but we'll tell apparently is excellent

[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:54.480]
uh... he is you notice he's being seen more in public

[02:33:55.260 --> 02:33:58.920]
uh... he uh... has been on more talk shows he's added some of the weight back

[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:01.940]
and he's older than he was five years ago and you can tell that but aside from

[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:02.220]
that

[02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:04.880]
he's also done a string of films right now boom boom

[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:08.160]
his taste is still no better at least in picking scripts and directors

[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:12.000]
never has been quite good no i well it was once he did a film called starting

[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.400]
over that in which he was marvelous

[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:15.120]
uh... but uh...

[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:17.840]
it it does appear uh... as i think

[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:20.400]
i suggest that a year or so ago that

[02:34:21.140 --> 02:34:26.300]
the business about tmj the trans mandibular joint uh... disorder

[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:28.420]
that isn't the uh...

[02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:32.000]
uh... disorder of the jaw that can really disrupt your equilibrium and require

[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.080]
surgery and extensive

[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:37.540]
recuperation was exactly what bernell did have at least it's what caused him to

[02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:38.360]
lose a lot of weight

[02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:42.040]
you know that there was a big aids rumor but i gotta tell you

[02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:44.900]
if he had aids at one point he doesn't seem to have it now

[02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:48.320]
he's the first if he has a is the first aid space and i've seen

[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:51.380]
to to you know put thirty pounds back on the back to work

[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:55.660]
i was really alluding to that although i was quite concerned about it's health

[02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:56.220]
because i

[02:34:56.840 --> 02:35:00.240]
had seen him around for a while i know he did as you said made a couple of

[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:04.060]
movies recently and has been i have not seen him locally on television so

[02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:07.960]
apparently i'm missing him when he's on uh... he's uh...

[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:09.700]
he's turned up on uh...

[02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:12.160]
on carcin and a couple of the others

[02:35:12.820 --> 02:35:15.640]
uh... and every now and then you'll see him in some sort of uh... another

[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:18.280]
Hollywood tribute spending more time in california i think but

[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:22.180]
but he went through a strange pretty was sick for a while for for at least a

[02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:25.300]
year so it was a disabling thing that affected his balance

[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:29.760]
then we had the surgery apparently he was unable to uh... eat salad food for

[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.560]
a good six months

[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:35.000]
uh... but the other thing to cut up at the same time was he made one too many

[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.600]
cannonball runs and one too many smoking the bandits

[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:41.520]
uh... and his box office appeal had declined while he was still healthy

[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:44.060]
so combine the two a couple of your layoff

[02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:47.280]
when he came back he found that it really weren't many offers

[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:50.700]
uh... and they weren't real good offers so now he's

[02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:54.020]
uh... i you know he's going to throw together as many films as he can because he

[02:35:54.020 --> 02:35:57.380]
wants to work again but it's a very sad story and one respect and that he was

[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.320]
at one point a number one box office traction the country

[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:03.320]
and he essentially squandered at himself by doing lousy movies

[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:06.360]
yes indeed you can ask you questions sure

[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:10.380]
this is out of bills pervue since he i know is uh... into the movie thing

[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:13.140]
tell me about your thoughts on uh...

[02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:14.940]
jone rivers being uh... fired

[02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:18.180]
well i'm glad you ask that question i think it was one of the most incredible

[02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:21.440]
premature if i can still say that word on the air

[02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:26.620]
uh... premature movements uh... by fox i mean she had just been here just be

[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:28.220]
carcin for the third time

[02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:30.080]
you can't say movement either

[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:30.680]
on okay

[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:34.800]
well anyway i think it was premature how's that you know she just being

[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:37.600]
carcin for the third time in the york she'd be to my thing and watching for

[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:38.420]
the first time

[02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:41.160]
i mean the show is only on for a few months

[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:44.720]
and here's a guy who's a legend who's just going through the motions i'm

[02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:46.980]
talking about carcin not funny at all anymore

[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:51.000]
you're not expect to put her on first of all she's on in a lot of markets on

[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.940]
fringe stations on u. h.f. stations and independence

[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:57.740]
that have minimal viewership and i think that they really need to give her time

[02:36:57.740 --> 02:37:00.300]
to grow i didn't watch it that much but i certainly think she says and

[02:37:00.300 --> 02:37:01.280]
shoulders about carcin

[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:04.480]
as you say i couldn't agree with you more you put it very succinctly

[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:07.120]
carcin is doing nothing more now than going

[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:08.880]
well yeah he just shows up

[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:12.620]
they just shows up that's all his guest or no go here every now and then he'll

[02:37:12.620 --> 02:37:15.620]
try to do a letterman thing but letterman has so completely eclipsed him

[02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:18.260]
unfortunately that you know and what does that say well

[02:37:19.380 --> 02:37:23.020]
uh... no no no no not in the least i don't think letterman's even mildly

[02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:23.500]
amusing

[02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:26.800]
the only thing it's amusing on his shows every when they bring those animals out

[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:28.220]
on the dog will think a lot of stage

[02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:31.420]
and i don't think letterman can take much credit for that you know unless he's

[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:34.560]
feeding it before the show but he can take much credit for the kind of thing you

[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:35.620]
don't see very often yeah

[02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:37.500]
i gotta say the decision to go with

[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:38.700]
guest hosts

[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:42.080]
it if that if they think that's gonna be the solution to that

[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:42.720]
yeah

[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:45.640]
to the box i mean that's loonacee can do that

[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:47.580]
new yeah

[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:49.480]
okay thanks a lot

[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:53.080]
who was it though who was rumored as a possible host for that show somebody

[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:55.800]
how it's done yeah how it's done right

[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:58.080]
howard allegedly is so gonna be on that

[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:01.220]
that could be after that show somewhere i don't know he allegedly is getting a

[02:38:01.220 --> 02:38:04.980]
show on fox that could work but the problem is there you're beginning with

[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:06.160]
essentially two markets

[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:08.960]
he's starting with new york and philadelphia we'll have a decent audience and

[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:12.660]
yeah he'd have to be given question is is he gonna be allowed to do the things

[02:38:12.660 --> 02:38:15.600]
that he does on a radio and i think no certainly which is interesting

[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:17.520]
it's very interesting because on television

[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:21.280]
sexual in the window and all of this other stuff is rampant it's an almost

[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:23.240]
every show it's in the commercials it's everywhere

[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:27.060]
and we in radio are the ones that they keep sticking the thumb down on but

[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:30.140]
interestingly enough if he were to try to go on television

[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:34.060]
and do what he does on radio they never let it go standards in practices would

[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:36.920]
never let the language go no i think the lesson there is that network

[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:40.940]
television far more regulated than you know the number of radio is carefully

[02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:43.100]
regulated to but uh...

[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:46.660]
individual radio stations may allow some latitude i mean network television is

[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:49.620]
is absurd and they but they know but it

[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:53.000]
no i don't agree with the idea that i'm not a great no i don't agree with the

[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.380]
regulated theoretically they are right i don't mean regulated in a legal sense

[02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:59.300]
i mean with from within all i say that how the whole stand-ins and practices

[02:38:59.300 --> 02:38:59.860]
i mean

[02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:03.020]
because they can be really if the commission were looking at them the way they're

[02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:04.760]
looking at how it's done or a radio now

[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:08.760]
uh... eighty percent of the shows to be off the air but even the sitcoms all

[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:10.960]
those cute little family ties and all of those shows

[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:15.540]
the amount of sexual in the window and cute little uh... jokes and snickering

[02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:17.740]
it goes on if you took it out of there there's no script left

[02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:21.340]
but there's no way that uh... the fcc's gonna go after that because i think they

[02:39:21.340 --> 02:39:24.740]
widely regard radio's constituency is powerless or i think

[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:28.360]
uh... and i think probably when they when they look at radio they think fm

[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:32.160]
anyway it's kids you know it's all kids in all folks you know who cares about

[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:33.040]
either one of them

[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:35.880]
tv star must not prime time and all of a sudden then you'll have a real

[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:36.480]
uproar

[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:41.420]
presumably will have one thirty seven and w twenty one before two and w i g

[02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:42.300]
and uh...

[02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:45.780]
phones are for you've had a great response here today ought to feel really uh...

[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:46.280]
full of it

[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:46.680]
you get

[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:48.360]
and i certainly do

[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:50.380]
i think you i do feel full of it

[02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:53.020]
i want to have one of the one that made me think of this we're just talking about

[02:39:53.020 --> 02:39:53.900]
radio during the break

[02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:57.540]
but i am deeply disappointed that appears that larry king

[02:39:57.540 --> 02:39:59.800]
is clinging is coming back up yeah

[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:01.220]
uh... because for

[02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:05.120]
for a while the prospect that he would be all together off the air in this market

[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:06.180]
was just

[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:07.880]
yeah wonderful great if i'm not

[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:09.180]
get this one question

[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:13.140]
we get it all off the air and keep them off would be great well yeah the reason

[02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:16.120]
that he he bounces around here so much is that the people in this market

[02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:18.280]
know better than anywhere else in the city through them

[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:21.680]
and i can listen and they know he's just a stumble bump from brooklyn or whatever

[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:25.040]
and he's just uh... you know owes everybody money and he guys just a gun a little

[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:27.960]
bit of luck which i don't be grudging but i just don't want to listen to him

[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:31.380]
i was i think we could have a great guest on the show we don't have a lot of

[02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:32.760]
guests so you ought to feel honored

[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:37.300]
that you're among the select few but how about angie dickensons optometrist

[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:38.780]
uh...

[02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:40.040]
we're seriously we could plumb

[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:43.460]
we could definitely plumb the depths of the human psyche exactly if we knew

[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:46.040]
exactly what he is put on her contact no question about

[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:48.080]
it or elsewhere my any hello

[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:49.100]
i know yeah

[02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:51.920]
like the ask about uh...

[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:54.480]
you know you're talking with the first the herald a little

[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:57.320]
my favorite columnist uh...

[02:40:57.320 --> 02:40:59.180]
like the agon is usually poop but

[02:40:59.180 --> 02:41:00.460]
i'd like to know

[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:04.080]
that she worked with a herald that she worked for independent restaurants

[02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:09.560]
what if you feel on the part time i thought you have to have some kind of uh...

[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:10.080]
credibility

[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:14.300]
well she does work for the herald and uh...

[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:16.740]
although i don't always agree with her restaurant reviews

[02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:19.700]
uh... and he has quite a bit in that she's a

[02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:22.960]
uh... splendid cook herself and knows food very well

[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:26.140]
and she does visit the restaurants anonymously it sounds like the call

[02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:29.260]
or his disagree with lucy on more occasions that i have others on balance i

[02:41:29.260 --> 02:41:29.680]
find her

[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:31.100]
very dependable

[02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:35.040]
i hear uh... advertising on other radio stations that they're gonna hold a

[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:37.480]
party at a certain restaurant and uh...

[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:38.940]
he'd want to be there with some

[02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:40.460]
radio host

[02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:42.440]
now is wondering did you think that's

[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:45.300]
yeah that's certainly uh... i have a credibility

[02:41:45.300 --> 02:41:46.200]
i haven't heard about that

[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:49.320]
that quite a credibility like another restaurant critic in town i want to

[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:50.120]
mention his name

[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:51.840]
but uh...

[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:55.460]
you know when these people start shelling for certain uh...

[02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:58.160]
establishments where is the credibility this one i really don't know anything

[02:41:58.160 --> 02:41:58.500]
about

[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:01.640]
yeah you'll check into it uh... well i mean to be standing outside the next

[02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:03.500]
restaurant that she goes to an orange code

[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:07.680]
certainly when that to stake it out you in that twerp will be standing outside

[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:09.400]
north my amy hello

[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:11.100]
home uh... mister copper yes

[02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:13.200]
i'll tell you the uh...

[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.880]
little complain i have about these colorization films

[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:20.360]
uh... i don't believe they're colorizing the the films that are colorful enough to

[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:23.060]
to colorize you follow them in

[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:26.040]
like the other night they had on the fighty sixty ninth

[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:28.020]
it's a drab

[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:30.260]
type of uh... picture you know

[02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:32.960]
just wasn't colorful enough

[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:36.680]
and uh... it was it was more brown than anything

[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:38.800]
and i've had turned her

[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:42.060]
has access to all the mgm library

[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:45.360]
plus the pre-1948 Warner Brothers films

[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:48.640]
he could do a lot of these old bus b-bark the musicals

[02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:51.640]
captain courageous beauty on the bounties

[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:53.480]
and uh...

[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:57.120]
he's not using the right discretion i think i feel that i would guess he's

[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:01.180]
he'll get to those big is but it seems to me the strategy has been to begin with

[02:43:01.180 --> 02:43:02.040]
three or four

[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:05.040]
uh... key high profile films like it's a wonderful life

[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:06.620]
colorize them

[02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:07.380]
and then

[02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:11.360]
put the colorizing attention toward those movies that are really not selling

[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:12.220]
well in the market

[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:16.240]
or that are not proven ratings getters because these are these presumably

[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:17.640]
are the weak ones

[02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:20.540]
uh... where color might make a big difference in viewership

[02:43:20.540 --> 02:43:22.640]
uh... i i can only figure that

[02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:24.180]
there's a

[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:26.180]
a core audience for the musicals and that

[02:43:26.180 --> 02:43:28.800]
they may not get around those for a while because they figure they're gonna get

[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:30.400]
watched and they're gonna get sold anyway

[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:34.080]
and he's got another drab when coming up next month father of the bride which

[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:35.700]
wasn't even a good picture to begin with

[02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:38.640]
well a lot of these are good pictures make no mistake and then the other

[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:41.400]
irony is many of them were made in black and white only because

[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:44.660]
there was no color film or the production could afford color film

[02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:48.560]
uh... nonetheless there those films lurking in that catalog such as

[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:52.920]
you know the film was that the uh... john heuston films they treasure the

[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:55.320]
fact that you're not right that the black really

[02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:59.460]
and cast a blank as an example citizen can i'm sure somebody will colorize

[02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:02.440]
in a later just to be perverse the turner will be the principal guy

[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:04.980]
and these are movies that don't belong in color

[02:44:04.980 --> 02:44:08.880]
uh... and it's too bad i i don't take the uh... you know the cisco view that

[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:11.660]
the world is falling down and we should crucify turner but

[02:44:11.660 --> 02:44:15.560]
but it's an interesting conflict because the contrary i don't because i

[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:18.440]
get more the credit of the world for what he's doing first of all he's getting a

[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:23.100]
lot of uh... sponsorship from the police making dough and the guy knew he needs

[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:26.700]
to mean cnm is not exactly a barnburner when it comes to profits all

[02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:31.460]
another thing i have a little bit against uh... the tv s network uh...

[02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:33.380]
i don't know how you feel about it but uh...

[02:44:33.980 --> 02:44:37.000]
baseball fan i love the watch the on the brave game yeah

[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:41.420]
and this business of tape the way the game i agree with you boy i couldn't agree

[02:44:41.420 --> 02:44:45.340]
with you more because it's the basketball games going forever yeah i couldn't

[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:47.940]
agree with you more you know they got to make up their mind what they want to be

[02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:51.700]
in a course since he owns the brave one would think that the first priority

[02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:55.820]
uh... would want to see uh... yeah we would be to see all the brave games live but

[02:44:55.820 --> 02:44:58.340]
there's nothing worse than turning over to the meds game and hearing a partial

[02:44:58.340 --> 02:44:58.860]
score

[02:44:59.420 --> 02:45:02.240]
like in the six or seven thing and then having to turn over and watch again from

[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:03.860]
the beginning when you know the outcome exactly

[02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:08.760]
incidentally a bill there was one film you review a couple years ago i couldn't

[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:11.260]
agree with you more and you know i have a video store

[02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:15.200]
and i really push the film it's uh... one call racing with the moon oh yeah

[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:18.200]
not a nice movie i remember you're a little bit of you said it restored your

[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:21.440]
faith in movie make it yeah that was a real nice movie and the director

[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:23.240]
Richard Benjamin is not done many other

[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:25.700]
and i was some classic movie yeah

[02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:27.500]
okay thanks a lot

[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:31.140]
he owns a video store there's there's a nice empathize with there's one of our

[02:45:31.140 --> 02:45:34.080]
pioneers mother target may he do well may he prosper

[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:35.600]
sunny i'll sell out

[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:40.080]
i thought i was listening to a movie critic and all i've been listening to is

[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:40.840]
everything else

[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:43.540]
may i ask you a question about bruce

[02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:44.600]
i will it

[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:45.220]
yes

[02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:46.480]
is my picture

[02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:47.740]
blind date

[02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:48.680]
blind date

[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:49.740]
i love it

[02:45:49.740 --> 02:45:51.920]
so did i do you know anything about him

[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:53.860]
his bio before moonlight

[02:45:54.420 --> 02:45:56.400]
no i don't that unfortunately i don't

[02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:57.740]
i am

[02:45:58.260 --> 02:46:02.760]
and i do watch a lot of television but i don't watch the same kind that uh...

[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:05.500]
sonsky and jika and nil roger's watch i don't watch a lot of

[02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:09.200]
prime time television and i've only seen moonlighting i think once

[02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:12.360]
uh... usually i'm out doing something else during you know i may be seeing

[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:13.440]
i've never seen it

[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:14.360]
uh... you never seen no

[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:16.960]
i don't know what makes it like i watch those network shows i don't know

[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:19.900]
is a marvelous reputation everybody likes the show but uh...

[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:23.060]
willis's popularity i was aware of from the show

[02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:26.580]
uh... and i think i'd seen one and perhaps snippets of others

[02:46:26.580 --> 02:46:30.500]
uh... and i just i found him delightful and blind date but i don't know where

[02:46:30.500 --> 02:46:31.780]
he came from before that

[02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:34.540]
new york and i'm assuming that he was

[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:35.980]
of the day and that

[02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:36.500]
and that

[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:39.620]
well your guess is as good as marina

[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:41.460]
because his his uh...

[02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:42.820]
video was uh...

[02:46:42.820 --> 02:46:43.060]
bruno

[02:46:43.620 --> 02:46:44.700]
about bruno

[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:46.580]
and

[02:46:47.340 --> 02:46:52.160]
but i i haven't seen anybody on him at all even people's magazines

[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:55.340]
i see your thing you haven't seen a feature story on them i'm not sure that i've

[02:46:55.340 --> 02:46:56.520]
seen very many either

[02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:58.260]
i haven't seen anything

[02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:01.240]
and i'm i'm interested because i

[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:04.920]
i like him and i like that's the only thing on

[02:47:05.700 --> 02:47:07.620]
on ten that i even watch

[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:11.280]
well i'm not sure whether we've had a a profile on a more not

[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:15.860]
it's possible to do many interviews of those seems unlikely most people do

[02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:17.240]
uh...

[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:18.300]
i just i don't know

[02:47:19.180 --> 02:47:20.360]
well i'll have a point

[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.740]
i'm out of maybe i'll go to california find out for myself

[02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:24.660]
okay okay

[02:47:24.660 --> 02:47:25.460]
okay i'm gonna have a

[02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:26.340]
say my son or later

[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:27.600]
mayami hello

[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:30.120]
yeah i know how are you okay

[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:33.740]
uh... bill uh... i was wondering one of my favorite actors al Pacino

[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:36.320]
you very really hear much about him you know what he's doing now

[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:40.140]
i was not doing anything right now uh... and uh...

[02:47:40.140 --> 02:47:42.820]
the his career took a kind of uh...

[02:47:42.820 --> 02:47:44.620]
unexpected uh... good godfather music

[02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:45.740]
my favorite movie too

[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:47.480]
and unexpected uh...

[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:48.420]
uh... slide

[02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:49.960]
he was one of those

[02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:53.580]
uh... new york based actors who um...

[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:55.500]
i think actually preferred the stage

[02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:58.040]
uh... he would break every now and then

[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:01.760]
uh... i saw an american buffalo a couple years ago she had done twice

[02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:05.120]
uh... and i think he may have broken once too often

[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:08.280]
uh... that and he made a couple of films that

[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:10.120]
really didn't go anywhere

[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:11.620]
what was the story of that revolution

[02:48:12.500 --> 02:48:14.400]
uh... revolution i never saw

[02:48:15.100 --> 02:48:16.280]
i understand it was a perfectly

[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:16.580]
uh...

[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:18.440]
terrible movie

[02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:22.140]
big problem that may have been that it was a uh... was the first

[02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:25.640]
uh... big budget film about the american revolution and i don't know how long it

[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:27.100]
was made by a british director

[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:29.020]
uh... Hudson

[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:33.720]
uh... and that's something of a problem because i think the perspective they

[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:35.760]
brought to it was odd and as al Pacino and

[02:48:36.220 --> 02:48:39.740]
stashia kinski in it and she's box office poison and has been for entire

[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:40.480]
career so

[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:44.180]
uh... the i believe the film came here and played for a week when i was

[02:48:44.180 --> 02:48:46.920]
on vacation was i never got a chance to see it but i understand it was awful

[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:49.480]
yet the only place you can really get it is on uh...

[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:52.520]
gate yeah i i want to do something to rent it because i'm still curious about

[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:55.200]
it's not that it's not great but it's not that

[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:59.460]
one of the thing uh... any word i heard about godfather three is that

[02:48:59.860 --> 02:49:01.220]
have you heard anything about that

[02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:02.500]
unless the hurt was off

[02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:04.780]
uh... on the other hand uh...

[02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:08.700]
and the last to her china town to was off and uh... now let's talk it maybe on

[02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:09.220]
again

[02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:13.420]
uh... one of the things that's gonna happen in the wake of the collapse of ishtar

[02:49:13.420 --> 02:49:17.580]
is that there's probably gonna be a little more toriam on big budget production

[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.940]
uh... and i mean big huge budget production there's no question the godfather

[02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:22.960]
three would be a huge budget kind of thing

[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:26.840]
uh... and so everybody's gonna be a little scared a little on hold for a while

[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:27.200]
because

[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:30.680]
warn baby and dust and half moon and alain may are about to go out and lose

[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:34.060]
uh... tens of millions of dollars and that always frightens people because

[02:49:34.060 --> 02:49:36.240]
those are supposed to be box office guarantees

[02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:40.620]
near one thing i heard neil that you uh... you like scurface

[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:41.880]
now

[02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:46.840]
i hate it's car park i was unsure i thought it was a horrible movie at the

[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:49.960]
was totally without any redeeming value whatsoever

[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:52.100]
and no zero

[02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:57.540]
from the same director the untouchables on june fifth one the steven bauer i mean

[02:49:57.540 --> 02:50:00.840]
that forget there was nothing redeeming that movie at all you like the untouchables

[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:04.680]
course you like in justice for all i thought that was great that's a nice one and uh...

[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:08.640]
you you you're about father fan i'm sure you bet my favorite i have got that you

[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:12.020]
have seen parts one and two twenty times a piece i've got a month tape and i

great show and i hope you have built back again soon

[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:17.620]
uh... i was just trying to get your opinion on a particular video movie that

[02:51:17.620 --> 02:51:20.100]
most people never even heard of

[02:51:20.700 --> 02:51:21.880]
and that was called the front

[02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:24.920]
the front very interesting one of his few

[02:51:25.460 --> 02:51:29.940]
i mean it had to humor its moments but essentially it's a drama yeah and uh...

[02:51:29.940 --> 02:51:31.440]
it was a uh...

[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:34.620]
actually quite a good film about a period of time to make most people forgotten

[02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:36.300]
how they would blacklisting and all the rest

[02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:38.020]
i like to do great deal

[02:51:38.020 --> 02:51:41.200]
uh... unfortunately it was off the would yell and track

[02:51:41.960 --> 02:51:43.680]
uh... as was interiors

[02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:45.000]
uh...

[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.960]
with the result that many people you write don't think of it when they think of

[02:51:47.960 --> 02:51:48.500]
what you know

[02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:53.200]
you know what you have to end up in the first of a lot of his in zero must tell

[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:56.880]
everything everybody else and you know and a number of people who were victim of

[02:51:56.880 --> 02:51:57.720]
the uh... the car

[02:51:57.720 --> 02:52:02.500]
right on the screen black must black must black must that i don't know the deal

[02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:05.880]
yeah i did see it and i would agree with it was a nice probably the only

[02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:08.580]
would yell and movie i've relied on it i thought it was great

[02:52:08.580 --> 02:52:10.360]
that i have some good meat on it

[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:10.560]
yeah

[02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:14.160]

yes hello i like it if you could feel coffee please

[02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:17.660]
speaking

[02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:22.920]
yes um... first of all i appreciated your piece uh... about uh...

[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:23.460]
colorization

[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:25.920]
and while in the subject of colorization

[02:52:25.920 --> 02:52:28.620]
i want to talk about decolorization of the

[02:52:29.220 --> 02:52:30.320]
yet not one movies

[02:52:30.960 --> 02:52:34.340]
i want black better and i'm concerned about the absence of the

[02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:38.500]
of the role that the the infantry black and shaman played in the at-known

[02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:40.940]
and i can't find it not even and and

[02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:45.420]
couple of a book of the now i couldn't see it i didn't see it in in the at-known

[02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:49.680]
or in any of the war movies especially to tune and and and it's

[02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:54.660]
seemed like the black uh... race has been denigrated uh... when the black race was

[02:52:54.660 --> 02:52:56.400]
all elevated on the front line

[02:52:56.400 --> 02:52:59.060]
uh... at least twenty percent of the combatants were black

[02:52:59.580 --> 02:53:02.940]
but i'm using it to a lot forty percent of the percentage range to great deal

[02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:05.200]
higher yeah um...

[02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:06.800]
unfortunately uh... the way uh...

[02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:09.960]
uh... movie making structure today there are very few black directors and

[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:12.420]
there is none i can think of who can summon

[02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:17.140]
the kind of budget required to make a war movie on any sort of scale you're

[02:53:17.140 --> 02:53:19.620]
talking uh... platoon i cost only nine million dollars

[02:53:19.620 --> 02:53:24.280]
uh... and there were many economies there but that's that's not a big budget by

[02:53:24.280 --> 02:53:27.720]
Hollywood standards but it's big by the standards of a director who is doesn't

[02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:28.680]
have a proven track record

[02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:29.820]
it's difficult

[02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:33.940]
to find a black director director who can get that kind of money hence you're

[02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:34.620]
getting a perspective

[02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:38.800]
of white man who may or not have served uh...

[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:41.300]
and stone all of a stone who made platoon

[02:53:42.040 --> 02:53:45.660]
uh... i'm sure he knows what it was like but that's

[02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:50.220]
you know his film is shaped in large part by his recollections which which is

[02:53:50.220 --> 02:53:53.400]
not quite the point he was in the twenty-fifth infotivant at infotivant

[02:53:53.400 --> 02:53:54.520]
vision i was a fact that

[02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:55.900]
unit in seventy one

[02:53:56.440 --> 02:54:01.180]
and and you know there was even uh... a black mutiny in that in that outfit and

[02:54:01.180 --> 02:54:05.740]
and it it was a press in the media and and i thought maybe he would have bought

[02:54:05.740 --> 02:54:09.580]
some of that out you know there was a black white confrontation and not only

[02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:14.780]
in the rare ashland uh... but also the front line it is uh... one of the Vietnam

[02:54:14.780 --> 02:54:18.860]
stories it's never been told uh... i'm not necessarily going to fault

[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:22.900]
uh... stone for not telling it because that's not you know he was essentially

[02:54:22.900 --> 02:54:26.440]
wanted to tell the story of his experience i think and uh... but

[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:30.520]
you're right it in it's not it's not some small corner of it is a principal part

[02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:33.460]
of that experience particularly what was getting going on back here in the state

[02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:37.200]
the civil rights movement was still uh... you know a very vital thing

[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:42.600]
i am sure that sooner or later someone will deal with that subject Vietnam

[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:44.860]
there's no open season i'm coming to

[02:54:44.860 --> 02:54:49.160]
i want to write a screenplay about my experiences and i'm telling like it is

[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:50.600]
how feasible is it to get

[02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:54.040]
uh... hearing in hollywood i mean you know i'm way in my abbey for a

[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:57.400]
a lot of experience in the film but i'm sure i can do a credible job

[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:00.120]
uh... doing a movie on on the black roller Vietnam

[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:04.500]
well how feasible is it to approach hollywood directly over the transom uh... it's

[02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:09.100]
feasible but it's extremely difficult uh... the problem is you will write a script

[02:55:09.100 --> 02:55:13.440]
that uh... you know maybe uh... it may be perfectly wonderful but the moment you

[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:16.960]
are peddling a script you're no longer a black man with a good story you're

[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:19.500]
simply one of many people with the script there's a lot of people out there

[02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:20.080]
peddling them

[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:23.980]
there is there are some options you might consider locally however if you write

[02:55:23.980 --> 02:55:27.480]
the script and you have any confidence in it at all you could enter it in this

[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:30.900]
flower to governor screenwriting contest because although that's no guarantee

[02:55:30.900 --> 02:55:34.340]
of anything it suddenly calls the script of the attention of people who can get

[02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:37.180]
the made i know some people who did this they won the contest

[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:40.560]
the script is in the hand of hands of producers now they're a lot of you with

[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:44.900]
the hero can you get more information sure you will excellent okay we're at the

[02:55:44.900 --> 02:55:48.160]
end of the line by this thing zip by the day can't believe it
