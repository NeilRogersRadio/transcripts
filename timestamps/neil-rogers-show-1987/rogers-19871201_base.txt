[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.500]
Well, I think it was Friday about 12 midnight. I was listening to the radio station.

There's no single base station too. Base stations? Yeah, a lot of rap. I thought Bay was a gas station.

Yeah, LRN is 91. Really? Huh? Yeah, he has this clean on there. I'm attaining a queen or whatever.

[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.920]
A queen? Yeah, this guy he was really, you know, he was into it deep.

[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.360]
I see. Like he in other words, he had his pet gerbil with him. Oh, he was terrible. I see.

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.200]
He was terrible. He called your name a couple of times.

[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.640]
It was outrageous. It was up to midnight though. Great. I love it. I mean, when even stations

[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.200]

[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.240]
okay, he had some queen. Speaking of that, you know, the beauty shop in the Boca Town Center.

[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.780]
Well, Dave Dork got his hair done at that beauty shop and I was sitting there waiting.

[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.700]
And you know, beauty shops tend to be places, the guy mentioned the word queen. And beauty shops

[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.500]
tend to be places where there are a lot of limperus did help. And I tell you, it was like

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.520]
like a scene out of Lakasha full. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my lifetime.

[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.400]
And one of the guys, one of the hairstylist was getting his hair done. And he had his hair all

[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.220]
up in curlers and was just camping it up something fierce. And I was sitting there cracking it up.

[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.320]
And then one of the young ladies, one of his customers came in. She had an appointment to get

[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.560]
her hair done. So he ranks out all the curlers and he's got all these wild curls flowing around.

[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.800]
And he's just doing a tap dance up and down that place. She wouldn't have believed it. It was

[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.660]
incredible experience. Looked like I had we were getting his haircut at the copa or something.

[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.620]

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.980]

[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.680]
Well, in their case, yeah. Is that an age? They were on the air the other night and I don't know

[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.040]
how much power they're putting out, but you could pick them up even in the bow and in parts of

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.640]
power. And he had this guy who claimed to have done things with you on the air. Really? Yes.

[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.640]
And it was it was interesting. And then believe it or not, Roby Young called in. Oh, boy,

[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.840]
this is all tied together now. Yeah, it is now. And really young called in. And just in case

[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.080]
anybody's listening, you know, a seed is of Lebanon is. Mm-hmm. It's the trend. If you want to,

[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.040]
you know, fix the trends, right? It's right on top of the roof. It is? Yeah. So if anybody from

[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.460]
seed is of Lebanon is listening, the the pirate station is their trend is on the road. Well,

[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.540]
if anybody at the FCC is listening, instead of wasting your time waiting for me to say something

[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.260]
that I'm not going to say, why don't you get the pirate station off the air you idiot?

[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.000]
Oh, it's three. There's even a talk one. There's one talk one coming up on 1600 down on the beach.

[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.520]
1600? Yeah, there's going to be a talk show on there. I don't know. I was asked for some tape,

[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.240]
but in the interesting thing is they're all going to show up in the book. That's the best part.

[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.480]
I heard they did. Yeah, they're going to beat KAT. I know that.

[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.260]
No, well, that's the story. And he was talking about you and they were doing all sorts of

[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.360]
strange stuff on the air. I'm surprised that the caller mentioned that. I have a feeling with the

[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.020]
setup, but I don't know if they want me to mention it to transverse on. Feet is of Lebanon.

[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.820]
I'm sure they did. I think you should plug that a few times because I don't interfere with some

[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.500]
other stations. I understand they have one on 917 and 919. Well, if we know who the person is,

[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.640]
why do we even have to waste any time worrying about where the transmitter is?

[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.100]
Well, the FCC, they've known this is going, this station has been on the air for a year.

[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.740]
Why aren't they doing something about it? Well, they're busy monitoring.

[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.500]
Yeah, they're too busy monitoring me. Yeah, waiting for that magical day that's never going to happen.

[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.440]
They they claim that they're still trying to catch the person that's been interfering with the

[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:26.600]
traffic control of towers. Yeah. But that's over and gone with. And I don't know what their problem is,

[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.520]
but that station has been on like a long time and they matter fact, they've been

[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.200]
phimalcassing other stations. Every day they've phimalcats like they have like a you know,

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.020]
like you have a feature of things on the Donter Show. They like feature a certain radio station

[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.500]
every day at 9 o'clock. Oh, it's horrific. One day they play RIDN 98, other day they play Zaid.

[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.900]
I've heard a Y100 on there. And they play all that kind of good stuff.

[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.840]
Oh, look, uh, anybody's listening for the FTC. He's a Lebanon right on top of the building.

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.260]
Okay, I'm supposed to be high security building too. Yeah, great. Well, it's obviously kept them out.

[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.240]
Obviously, well, look, have a nice life and uh, Glenn, I don't know why you have not called Barbie

[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.880]
up yet, but that's I'm sure you'll explain that like in the near future.

[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.860]
Uh, should I call her? I think I don't I think you should do it on here. Can I give her a call?

[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.640]
Call her. I'll be there. Number four. Do you want to do this? Sure. Go ahead. Go ahead.

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.480]

Great life. Doesn't she sound great? She sounds hot. Oh, she is.

[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.420]
You saw the night of the milking park. Yeah, I thought you was good. Wait, here it is.

[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.500]
Hi, that was her tone. Oh, Barbie, you sound so good on that message. I can't believe it.

[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.080]
Guess who's here with me, Barbie? Uncle Neil. Say hi to Barbie. Hi, Barbie. How's Ken?

[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.540]
I'll call you later. Bye. Boy, that was the toy. Oh, by the way,

[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.340]
that message about the douchebag was edited again. So now it says douche and so

[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.960]
you know, they put the douchebag. Well, at least they're, you know,

[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.760]
getting back a little bit into the real world. Well, are you going to call a plasterer, by the way?

[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.760]
For what? I don't know. I don't know. I gave. I don't know. I want to talk to him for
