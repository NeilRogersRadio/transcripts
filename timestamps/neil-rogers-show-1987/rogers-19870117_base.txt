[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]
Something is rotten in Miami. No question about that.

[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.400]
It's me. My TV.

[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.620]
I beg your pardon?

[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.620]
I'd be me.

[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.300]
It might be you. Well, that's possible.

[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.420]
I don't want to jump to any rash conclusions, but you might be confused.

[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.240]
I don't know. I'm not there trying to get confused.

[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.000]
I was wondering I couldn't get confused.

[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.820]
Well, the president's confused, so we're all entitled to be confused.

[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.960]
Oh, baby. It's possible.

[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.460]
Yeah.

[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.080]
Let's talk to you. We'll go to the end of it because I'm anxious.

[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.520]
It seems every night when I got WIMC, all like that was muted.

[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.280]
Well, when you talk to me, you learn something.

[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.560]
Yeah, I did learn. I did, but I listen to you, but I can't listen to you.

[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.660]
Can't you hear your day kind of?

[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.940]
I used to be religiously. I'd listen to you at night.

[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.860]
Well, how could you hear me at night if you can't hear the station at night now?

[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.940]
What do you mean when you were on?

[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.220]
Right.

[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.580]
I heard you, but it seems like you're gone.

[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.020]
You're only good music.

[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.980]
It smells like that, yes.

[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.700]
Mm-hmm.

[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.520]
But something wrong with my radio probably.

[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.260]
I hope it's not me.

[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.640]
Okay. Well, try it again.

[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.840]
All right. Thank you for having me.

[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.000]
You want to tune in tonight? You'll hear Bernard Meltzer.

[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.060]
Yeah. Bernard Meltzer.

[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.560]
Right?

[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.460]
That's Dr.

[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.060]
It's me.

[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.240]
Dr. Bernard Meltzer.

[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.140]
Yes, I used to listen to him too, but I can't hear you.

[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.300]
Well, he's on tonight right here on this station.

[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.960]
Oh, what time is he on?

[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.960]
Seven o'clock.

[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.600]
Melbourne?

[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.860]
Let me say it again.

[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.660]
Seven o'clock.

[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.720]
Seven, like after six and before eight.

[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.180]
Seven.

[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.800]
Mm-hmm.

[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.440]
Okay. Thanks a minute.

[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.920]
You bet. Have a nice weekend now.

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.180]
Do.

[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.720]
Okay.

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.140]
Hey, well.

[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.800]
You too.

[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.780]
1136 at WYNZ.

[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.800]
We have an opening in date.

[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.980]
624-0191.

[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.880]
Mobile phone in date.

[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.220]
Hello.

[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.040]
On now?

[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.300]
Uh, you know, I've been listening to you for quite a while,

[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.980]
and I enjoy listening to you, but I can't understand why so many people

[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.240]
elderly or what have you call you up in an ance, such a pessimistic attitude.

[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.720]
For example, with our kids.

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.060]
I mean, our kids have it.

[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.640]
Uh, have a great opportunity to what?

[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.440]
I mean, they're growing up.

[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.860]
They have a, we aren't at war right now.

[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.700]
We have a economy which seems to be shaping up from the old days of the high,

[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.580]
high inflation.

[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.020]
It's shifting around.

[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.360]
People are able to go to college.

[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.400]
I mean, there's all first things.

[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.780]
A lot of these people that call in like the gentleman before you

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.120]
says that I don't know what the future is for kids,

[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.460]
but I've heard that for my father.

[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.240]
I've heard that for all of the people that grow up and they can't stand

[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.820]
today's kids and kids are changing.

[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.000]
No, wait a minute. He didn't say he couldn't stand today's kids.

[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.180]
He didn't say that at all.

[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.020]
He said that he doesn't know what kind of a legacy we're leaving for.

[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.520]
Well, I think that we have some major problems like the deficit and what have you,

[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.900]
but I think they're going to be faced.

[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.200]
I mean, it takes a little period of time to change everything around.

[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.260]
You can't, everybody can't just criticize the media present because it's a

[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.560]
congressional act that changes.

[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.420]
Well, you can't, you can't criticize a president who doesn't know what's going on.

[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.220]
That's true. You can't hold him accountable because he doesn't know.

[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.580]
Well, we don't really, I mean, that he's confused.

[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.360]
You might say that, but I would hate to live back several years ago when you could put money into a money market.

[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.800]
But can I ask you a question? Is there anything besides money that makes a difference?

[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.740]
I mean, I know you're calling me from your nice mobile phone now and that's wonderful.

[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.220]
And there's nothing wrong with having money.

[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.680]
But I mean, is that the only criterion by which we judge how the country is going and

[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.380]
the condition that the world is in?

[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.340]
No, that's not the only criteria.

[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.620]
I mean, when we do business with terrorists and we, when we lie to the public and when we,

[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.940]
you know, sell arms to lunatics and we do all of the things that we've been doing.

[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.520]
And when we ferment war and discontent in places all around the world, does that mean that

[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.320]
everything is great?

[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.460]
Because we don't have a high interest rate or I mean a high inflation rate.

[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.080]
I mean, is everything is wonderful?

[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.940]
Well, that's very important, you know.

[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.760]
And the other thing is that, is it more important than the other things I talked about?

[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.960]
Absolutely not. It's not more important.

[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.420]
I mean, you know, you talk about the kids who's going to pay off all of this enormous debt

[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.280]
that we're talking about. The president submits a budget of $1.3 trillion.

[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.040]
Whoever heard us such a thing.

[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.700]
He submitted that because the fact that everybody who wants to have all the giveaways forever.

[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.720]
Oh, sir, sir, listen, listen, take your mobile phone, have a wonderful life and good luck to you, sir.

[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.980]
See, when I first came on the daytime, I used to joke about the pseudo intellectuals with their

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.140]
mobile phones. And so on, it was just tongue-in-cheek and we've had a lot of really good

[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.420]
callers and mobile phones, whether they agree or disagree. But here's a guy who fits into that

[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.820]
category. He's got his possessions and his material things. And that's really where he's

[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.340]
coming from. And he's entitled to live that way and more power to him. But I just can't,

[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.460]
I can't relate to that. I'm just not on anywhere near the same wavelength.

[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.460]
We have two open lines in date again. The date number is 624-0191.

[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.540]
This has been a really strange morning. I'll tell you. I mean, a lot of times I'll say that.

[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.880]
I'm just kidding around. But this has been strange. Let me give that date number one more time.

[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.340]
And let's see if they're listening in date or if they're revolting this morning. And of course,

[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.580]
some of the callers from both counties have been pretty revolting already. 624-0191.

[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.220]
And Bernard Meltzer will be on this evening and TalkNet is here every night from 7am to

[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.780]
evening till 5am in the morning and they talk and they give advice and everybody has a wonderful time.

[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.600]
And she asked me about the nighttime ratings and Wichner had a 5.1 share and WIOD had a 4.4 share

[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.160]
and TalkNet a 4.3. So, you know, for the first time out of the box, TalkNet, in fact,

[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.120]
in its individual hours did pretty well and I think the folks here are pretty well satisfied with it.

[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.680]
20 minutes before noon at WINZ and we'll be right back.

[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.340]
18 before noon at WINZ, Ron Harrison is over there at Overseas Electronics and he's standing

[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.380]
by right as I speak right now, right Ron? Right you are, Neil Rogers. And here we are at Overseas

[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.980]
Electronics Superstore featuring warehouse to you prices. I'm just getting a lesson on compact

[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.440]
discs here and that's interesting. We've got TV's, video recorders, stereo systems,

[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.900]
walkmans, car stereo, compact disc players, lots of those, camcorders, tapes and accessories

[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.280]
and the compact disc players are really a big item here and they are selling like crazy.

[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.000]
We've got great name brands in all types of electronics, Sony, Panasonic, JVC, NEC,

[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.240]
Zenith, GE and TDK to name a few and some great super bowl specials this weekend.

[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.040]
Come on by and take a look at color TVs from only $139. Video recorders from only $229.

[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.480]
A great selection of big screen projection TVs from Sony, NEC, Pioneer and others and that

[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.360]
little Sony 19 inch cable ready color TV only $298 it scorches. We're open seven days a week,

[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.480]
most major credit cards accepted, financing available to qualify buyers, how do you get here?

[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.000]
That's easy. We're located on the Palmetto 826 Expressway at the Northwest 58th Street East

[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.480]
exit. You can see us from the Palmetto 826. If you want to save in every way, come to overseas

[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.500]
electronic superstar today. Okay, I certainly will. 17 before noon will be talking to Ron again in

[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.660]
just a matter of seconds as a matter of fact. We have two lines open and date where they just

[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.040]
dropped off in the last couple of seconds here. 624 0191 is our date number and I have a feeling that

[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.560]
1987 could be Browards here. This could be the year that Broward gets no wraps on the show that

[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.920]
they're on their best behavior. All the Broward lines have been full all morning and the date

[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.300]
people now are picking up where the Broward folks left off. They are really strange. Charlie would

[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.940]
good morning. Mr. Rogers. Yes. I'm the first time caller. Oh boy. And I like to hear your program.

[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.960]
And I tried to get into you yesterday but the lines are always busy. When you're talking about the police.

[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:21.440]
Yes sir. And here I come and down Hollywood Boulevard. Oh wait a minute. You've got a story for us

[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.540]
about the police. Well I want to talk about the incident that I got to tickle on. Oh no. No,

[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.720]
we don't take those kind of calls. My name is B. Chilo. Hi Neil. It's I thought I'd give a little

[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.120]
representation from Dave County this morning. Is there anybody alive this morning? You know last

[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.260]
week we had Linda Thornton here and it was incredible. I was amazed. We had all younger callers and

[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.760]
the phones were just jammed the whole time. We had a great show and now in a crusader days kind

[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.760]
of unpredictable. I come on here and I come through the sunshine. I drive to work. It's a beautiful day.

[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.620]
I'm in a great mood. The ratings are great. Life is wonderful and you sit down and these people

[00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.000]
are just incoragible today. Well to tell you the truth. They're all calling from reform school.

[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.020]
Right and I'm in my own reform school because I keep on hearing how beautiful you're saying it's

[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.440]
out but I can't go out because I have to go to work and to me it's torture to go out for an hour

[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.940]
on a beautiful day and then have to go to work. Yeah. When you can imagine how I feel. Right.

[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.480]
So I thought I'd give a little representation but I do not know if anyone's alive out there.

[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.500]
I think all the live people are at the beach. They must be because there's no way in the world

[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.620]
that anybody who's not brain dead is just kind of vegetating on a day like this.

[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:37.680]
I did want to say something about the jury system since you were talking about it. I had an

[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:44.620]
opportunity to be on a jury a few months ago. It was for a civil case but I never I always used

[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:52.140]
to be mispatriotic and I thought that nobody could say anything or it to me in America was perfect

[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.920]
in every way. But as far as the jury system I always thought that's the only way to go but when

[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.560]
I went on the jury then I realized that I can't believe that I'm making a decision about this

[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.140]
and that the six people that will the five other people that were with me it was just a matter of

[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:16.940]
I felt like the one of the persons attorney who I sided with that person but I thought his

[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.400]
attorney was incompetent so I felt sorry for the guy because he had such a lousy attorney.

[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.480]
And the other people I mean to make a long story short it wasn't really a matter of who we

[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:36.800]
saw it was you know there were so many other circumstances whatever that made us come up to a

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.960]
decision it was of course about money and one person on the jury didn't want to give the man a

[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.140]
penny. I on the other hand wanted to give a more than anyone else so we ended up with a compromise.

[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.800]
If I had kept quiet you know he would have gotten very very very little and the other hand you know

[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.820]
if I could have gone on for a couple hours more I feel like we could have gotten him you know

[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:04.940]
a few maybe you know thousands and thousands of dollars more but I felt like this isn't as a

[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.540]
juror I'm not supposed to be the man's attorney you know I'm just supposed to be one of six not

[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:16.000]
not you know change everybody's mind so it's really I'm with you I mean I would really be I mean

[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.400]
and this was just money but if it were about you know spending the rest of my life in prison or

[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.580]
something like that I mean it's it's pretty bad yeah well I don't you know we had the gentleman

[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.280]
to call it earlier says we can't do any better than that and that's the best possible system

[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.520]
and if that's the best system then I guess we're never going to have any justice yeah it really

[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.620]
it's not just and I mean the only way I rationalized what I went through I just figured well this is

[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:48.580]
money you know it's not somebody's life but yeah at least have people you know if you're not going to

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.740]
like what you were saying trained or professional jurors whatever you have to have a certain amount

[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.920]
of intelligence and screen them better I mean what you're screened if they ask you three questions

[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.420]
four questions you can lie you know if if you want to be on the jury because you want to get a

[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.400]
couple dollars or you just want to be on or you don't want to be on people that are you know

[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.540]
that would be real good jurors are getting off left and right because they don't want to go

[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:17.940]
through it so they do have to work on something because the judge I mean I could not believe because

[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:25.680]
we were deliberating for so long because we could not come up with you know well yeah but again

[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.140]
this situation yesterday has got nothing to do with weather or not they can come up I mean if

[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.660]
it's going to be a hung jury it's going to be a hung jury but to come back and to say we've reached

[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:38.900]
a verdict and then to give a non unanimous decision I mean you've got to understand these 11 people

[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.480]
all participated it isn't though that one of the jurors or the former of the jury slipped this note

[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.420]
in and said okay you know I'm want to go home and I'm sick of this all 11 collaborated on this

[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:56.000]
atrocity on this travesty of justice right so there's something really wrong there it is and

[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.800]
they would think especially in in the county where there's so much you know there's just so much

[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.940]
crime and whatever that they they would have some better system I don't know I hope somebody

[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.660]
somewhere but I'm sure this has been going on for so long and it will just continue I mean

[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.660]
it's one of those things like the gambling that I don't think is going to change yeah no nothing

[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:23.880]
you're right and these people get angry at me because they expect me to sit here and to continue

[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.380]
promoting things that are never going to fly and to you know keep making a jackass out of myself

[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.180]
what's the use what's the point in it I can't you know you can't make gold out of chop liver

[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.260]
right exactly well what can I say listen hang in there and have a good weekend okay you too take

[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.960]
care it's ten minutes before noon at w.y. and see I've heard of some ludicrous things but off the

[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.860]
air where we seem to be getting most of our calls by the way this morning somebody had a request

[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:53.400]
for a guest on this program you know who they wanted to be the guest and I'm going to tell you

[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.560]
there's about as much chance of that happening as a president Reagan calling in the show at 1205 to

[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.220]
wish me a happy Martin Luther King's birthday that's about how much chance there is of me she'll

[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.620]
being a guest on the show okay we have an open line in each county in day six two four

[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.800]
oh one nine one and inbroward seven six four oh seven oh seven and about 15 minutes ago I think I

[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.800]
really hit on what's going on here today yesterday I came in and I was really upset because they've

[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.260]
broken into my car try to steal it broke the steering column I had to go through a really a traumatic

[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.740]
situation and the phones rang off the hook and every when you're upset when you're angry when

[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.520]
you've been violated when something horrible happens like I said to you before misery loves company

[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.420]
but when they feel that you're enjoying yourself then they don't want anything to do with you

[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.880]
because they can't relate to that don't you understand they have no concept of what that's all about

[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.300]
anyway our next caller I promise will be that pay phone and day but first Ron Harrison is

[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.420]
standing by and Ron doesn't wait for any of this monkey business because he's got important things

[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.220]
going on 54 and w and z I have finally discovered what a big part of our problem is part of the

[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.560]
constant indigestion that existence out Florida too much corn beef I'm telling you folks it's

[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.780]
gonna kill you it's poison loaded with salt and with all kinds of grotesque ingredients that you're

[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.400]
not even aware of I mean where do you think they get corn beef you think there's some animal

[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.700]
that they just slice into it there it pull off its corn beef now of course it's it's one of those

[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.640]
manufactured kind of meats like pastrami did you ever see a cow that looked like a pastrami

[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.120]
I mean where does that stuff all come from and you're gorging yourselves with it you're just

[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.740]
downing like the guy who called last week about who can eat that sandwich for 695 right I wish

[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.460]
we had him back this morning are you listening sir please give us a call let's find out how you're

[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.880]
indigestion level is on the Richter scale I said we take the payphone next because I can't

[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.560]
imagine anybody hanging on a pay phone to call on this show hello how you doing pretty good are

[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.520]
you really on a pay phone yeah and I thought I wouldn't fix the over and thought that how's the

[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.320]
traffic pretty good pretty good I just want to comment I was listening to that 90 year old lady

[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:01.880]
that said that you get new music on talknet right well the your FM signal the I and z FM

[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.260]
rock and we clients all that stuff right it bleeds through into your AM signal at night are you

[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.900]
are you serious I'm not kidding you the other night I was listening to uh to Bruce Williams talking

[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:17.440]
about automobiles and stuff like that and then faintly in the background you could hear the uh the

[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:26.380]
music that's incredible I know can you imagine what that could do for uh for the FM's ratings yeah

[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.860]
maybe it'll boost them a little bit right well couldn't hurt I'll tell you that I just wanted to

[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.420]
make that comment because maybe you know maybe you didn't you know you know I never heard of

[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.820]
that before I had no idea that that was going on it is bleeding through I can hear it

[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.220]
it's faintly you know in the background it doesn't you know talknet does not come through very

[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.420]
clearly so it might be something your transmitter or you know out there on the control board where

[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.520]
the program director is maybe he needs to make sure are you hearing this in a house or in your car

[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:59.400]
because I I never hear it in the car I hear it in my house in the house yeah I got a one in my

[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.720]
bedroom and then on my stereo that's on the living room that is phenomenal I sure appreciate it

[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.000]
I'm going to pass it along to our student engineering staff and see if we can't uh you know do something

[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.300]
intelligent like shutting the FM off at night or something like that I mean you know I think

[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.120]
some else brought me up no thank you I appreciate it you're welcome bye bye that's incredible I see

[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.060]
here I was and I was uh really doubting the veracity of that 90-year-old woman who called who was

[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.600]
obviously well well intention and she said she's trying to hear talk at night on W I N C she's

[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.820]
hearing music and if she's here in the 95 I N Z boy what a culture shock that's got to be right

[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.140]
no wonder she sounds confused better have a long chat with the programming office up in the front

[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:44.740]
of the building for the FM it's on the FM 94.9 not on AM see there's that spill over that

[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.680]
crossover 94 AM 94.9 we got everybody confused they don't know what the hell they're listening to

[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.760]
okay we have an open line in date if you'd like to join us our number in date county the land of

[00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:00.820]
the free in the home of the grave is 624 0191 let's do that again very very slowly to make sure

[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.980]
that the people in the downtown area who are listening to the FM bleeding in the background here

[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:14.580]
the numbers 624 in fact those were the numbers 2 4 for the FM 624 you don't believe me do you

[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.700]
time that's serious trust me and that's why they're all sitting shivvy up in the front of the building

[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.680]
624 0191 Tom Gallagher's here he has no idea what's going on he's in a state of a

[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.460]
blivin he just wonders what the hell he's doing here but he's going on vacation for a few days so

[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.660]
he's looking forward eagerly to that and wants to leave all of this foolishness behind him news

[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:39.100]
from CBS at the top of the hour and we'll come back at 1206 news that's first fast and factual

[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.460]
thought that's fresh frank and furious we're florida's favorite w i n z my m a 4-letter down

[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:50.560]
19 for my news 1159 wins time good morning for the wisdom news room here's what's happening two

[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.880]
robbers who used a sawdoth shotgun and 1206 at w i n z we're back for our number three and what's

[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.180]
been a really upside down kind of a Saturday morning and now we're into the afternoon it'll probably

[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:06.580]
be even more upside down be sure to put pineapple on it though and at any rate all of those rumors

[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.600]
about them talking about us on other states nonsense all ridiculous in fact from what we gather

[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.580]
from our kindle spy the only thing that was said was some positive comment about radio aid and I

[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.860]
heard out the other day say something very nice about that and that's great and you want to know

[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:26.300]
who had the biggest rating in any hour of talk in the last rating book was rantellan the 9 o'clock

[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:32.400]
hour had a 5.6 share that's a gigantic number and I congratulate him on that and he actually beat

[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.740]
me in the first hour that we were head to head very close for 8 to a 4-7 and then in the 11 o'clock

[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.980]
hour I had a 4-3 he had a 4-1 in the new hour I had a 4-5 hour had a 3 so it was very close all

[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:48.300]
the way through sandy of course was not in the running not in a running sandy she was busy with

[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:53.480]
the you know the guy the team repairman but the thing that amazes me there a lot of people that

[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:59.080]
really take these things seriously as though we all just really have this intense hostility toward

[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.060]
each other and there's this you know a lot of the stuff that you hear on these programs is tongue

[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:10.960]
and cheek at least from me I can't speak for anybody else tongue and cheek this is only a radio show

[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.600]
it's not it's not our whole lives folks now of course when you hear steven i talking about each other

[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:22.360]
then that's another story that's all serious but that's uh what can I say anyway it's a 7-pass

[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.560]
noon we have open phones till 2 and if you're wondering what the subject is today this is I guess

[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.280]
this is another demarcation point because the next couple of weeks we've got some real heavy stuff

[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.000]
that's coming up and we're going to have to get back to the real world into those morbid and

[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.020]
depressing things like the malpractice crisis with the trauma network and uh the sales tax that

[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.620]
they want a voice upon the public for doctors and lawyers and a lot of other important subjects but

[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.200]
on a day like today I just don't have it in me I mean we just made some tongue and cheek comments

[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.120]
about the president and the fact that he's confused and he doesn't know what planet he's on and

[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.800]
what day it is and they're trying to keep him in an upright position and it's great you know that's fine

[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.900]
but let's not take it all too seriously because if they're going to press the button then it

[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.980]
isn't going to make any difference anyway right and we've got all of these people screaming

[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.320]
and hysterical about the trident missile I thought trident was a sugarless gum what do I know

[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.380]
goes to show you that we're all a different wavelength that all depends on your perspective

[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.520]
but don't try to start another radio war with ugly rumors and with all your hysteria out there

[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:26.120]
because we won't have any part in it till it starts okay let's go to a lottery hill hello

[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.860]
are you there see they don't hang on here for me call they don't want to even talk to me today

[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.480]
Kyle tells me that most of the people who are calling they've got some inane question or some

[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.380]
comment they don't want to talk to me do you know why you know where all of our audience is today

[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.440]
see this is kind of a conspiracy and I'm the victim the audience promotes this art of the station

[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.660]
rather promotes this art deco weekend on the beach and our whole audience is over there with

[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.980]
Barbara Kappettman they're all in the beach and I noticed that Miami South Florida has put out this

[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.820]
special issue I have one right in my hands here South Florida made easy and they have a map of the

[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:06.080]
Miami Beach Art Decco district and all of these ads for the carl island and the Leslie and the

[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.700]
Cardoza and the Cavalier and all of these magnificent attractions the Lincoln Road Arts District and

[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:18.080]
the wet paint cafe and all of this good stuff on the beach if you're over there driving around on

[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.700]
the beach to your horn if you're listening to this show don't do it too loudly because we don't

[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.640]
have any liability insurance for that but just give a little indication that you're listening to

[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.680]
this program but you can't call in because you're on the beach getting ready to tour the art deco

[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.920]
district let's hear a little toot and of course we know they're tooting in other parts of the

[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.780]
audience too but that's another story okay we have a couple of people dropped off during the new

at 8 o'clock in the morning are sizzling and the lines is always busy busy and that's why sometimes

[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.940]
you're not getting no cold yesterday or the day before the day before the day before the day

[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.240]
wait a minute how wait a minute let's slow down a bit if they're busy how could we be getting no

[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.620]
calls for example they're all lit now now that doesn't mean that all those people want to talk to

[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.660]
me but they're all lit up well why wouldn't they want to talk to you if those are the phones that

[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:54.300]
lit up are those the ones that come through to you those are the wait a minute listen to me read my

[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.520]
lips would you please those are the ones that are on hold oh yeah now that doesn't mean they want to

[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.960]
talk to me that means they're just waiting on hold maybe they're hearing music in the background of

[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.860]
the receiver and they want to hear the signal or clearly so they're listening on hold then as soon

[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.860]
as I punch them up they'll go away at least when they put that on hold at least I'm clear that they

[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.640]
do put the music on because it doesn't sound like you're holding a dead gun oh wait a minute when

[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.620]
you're on hold waiting to speak to me you hear music sometimes not all the time music

[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:29.780]
sometimes now not all the time but maybe the studio puts it on without you knowing it

[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.880]
right or you don't know that yeah in other words you're telling me the kyle is playing music in

[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.700]
the background upstairs while you're waiting to talk to me all right I don't want to get anybody

[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:45.600]
in trouble but I would rather hear the music than not because you know you know like what kind of

[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:56.680]
music are you hearing in the background well now I just found something what it sounds like a horn

[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:06.780]
blowing are you sure you're not hearing our FM bleeding through well I don't know what it is

[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:12.620]
but at least it's especially when I'm not actually talking to you when I call your number which

[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.380]
I've been trying for the past two or three weeks all right but let me let me understand this because

[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.900]
I do this for a living and I need to know what's going on are you telling me you're hearing Lena

[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:25.700]
horn in the background all right do he has something going on in the background right now now not joking

[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:33.820]
it stopped now oh it stopped now now it's going on uh-huh how about now

[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:47.480]
on and now and now and now nothing now the horn no we could do this till two o'clock and you

[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.820]
imagine what a good time we could know I really mean it this is like one of those hearing tests

[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.940]
that they give you you ever had a hearing test and you hear those little tones

[00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:00.600]
I'm trying some kind of a I don't know if it would if I would say it's a trumpet or what but

[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:06.360]
some kind of a noise like that you hear a trumpet now it stops and goes uh-huh and the other

[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.420]
morning you took something to somebody that really everybody they must be out or they

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.340]
must be sitting on a hand or something like that and I couldn't get through that day but I finally

[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:20.620]
braided all these hours today you know why sometimes you don't get a tour because everybody is

[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:26.640]
trying to call you at the same time yeah well that's true it's a busy signal but today I

[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.240]
am going to stay on until something will be happening well I'm sure glad you did you have no idea

[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.300]
I did get on the phone and they asked me who do I want to talk to when I said I want to talk to you

[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:44.080]
and I don't remember what the mumble and then I heard a lot of noises and the phone went

[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:51.480]
crazy again so I tried again but this time I got too fairly you know sure so this time I said

[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.240]
I was going to hold on and hold on and hold on in fact one time the other later cut you and

[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:02.040]
she said you know she thought I was waiting for her call back from the company I said no

[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:08.880]
and then she hangs up so this morning I said I was going to stay on see what happens and I

[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.120]
enjoy hello are you there yeah and I enjoy a lot of times when you say that you wonder where

[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:19.220]
everybody is you know nobody's getting through but then maybe something was wrong with the

[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:25.160]
telephone then because everybody is trying to get through and you know that lady's

[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:31.100]
before that little lady that I don't remember now what it was she was trying to get through with

[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:38.080]
something oh I don't remember now I don't remember but anyway but I want you to know that people are

[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:43.760]
listening and people do trying to get through but they get the busy signal constantly because

[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:49.860]
everybody is trying to get through to you so I have nothing in particular to talk to about today

[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:57.940]
except the gorgeous beach beach date and things like that but I do enjoy your programs and

[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:03.760]
the great that's the only thing I could say but you know you should know that hundreds of people

[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:09.820]
are trying to get through to you and they get busy at least seven anyway yeah can you ever put

[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.480]
in more phones no that would be no good you know well that's all we need if we if we had 20 lines

[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.700]
can you imagine sitting here with 20 empty lines that would really be good no no we don't want to

[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.560]
do that let's not overdo it we might take a few out yeah the way I would like it best if we had

[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:34.120]
one line seven seven seven yeah that's what I say well but you know what it's like trying to get

[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.740]
seven South Floridians all to call it the same time see some of the other stations are smart they've

[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.720]
only got I think five lines on one all the one of the stations is how they've got 10 lines

[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.540]
10 lines for anybody tries to get through to you and if the lines are busy it's impossible yeah I know

[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:56.720]
maybe we could put in about 50 lines besides the two or three weeks ago I called and actually I had

[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:02.080]
a little friend here one time well I had a friend here and her nine year old daughter was here

[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.220]
and I told her to hold on to the phone I said to soon she hears anybody talk just tell them

[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:12.400]
just a minute and you know call me right but they nobody ever came on the line and we were

[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:18.980]
listening to the radio beside her on the phone and I don't know what happened but I let me ask

[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.920]
you just still hear that music party you still hear that music in a background now good no no no it's

[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:30.680]
stopped but just before when we when I was talking about it there was a sound well I won't say it

[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:37.680]
was music it sounded like a long floor on a horn or a bell with something now you sure it wasn't

[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:45.700]
you live in your railroad tracks no no no it was definitely coming through or I won't say

[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:52.200]

[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:58.300]

[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:05.960]

[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:13.640]
but just the alarm sound and then it stops now it's not on at all it's very very quiet in the background good

[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:20.440]

[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.300]
keep up with this I mean I'm getting uh I'm getting dizzy just sitting here looking at the phone

[00:37:53.300 --> 00:38:01.160]
in date county 624 0191 today is called Punish Uncle Neil Dale and the audience is doing a sensational

[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:06.520]
job of it they're just uh they're unbelievable in fact the first woman this hour I think her

[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:13.680]
call more or less epitomized our entire program today pompano hello hi yes I'm from Massachusetts and

[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:21.460]
I really enjoy your program but I thought I'd call and tell you that it is true that 90 year old lady

[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:28.500]
and some gentleman after that I said that they could not get your station after certain hour

[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.420]
and that is true I listen to you oh now wait a minute wait a minute that is what no they weren't

[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.500]
talking about that we're talking about see now we're going to open up this old panda rice box

[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.200]
about our nighttime pattern and I'm going to just fall on the floor now that's a different story

[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.660]
we have to change pattern its sundown that's not a new problem that's a constant okay there's

[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:50.320]
nothing we can do about that I'm not supposed to be able to get pregnant no well it's got nothing to

[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.880]
do with what the program is it's got to do with this station and if you're in certain barriers

[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:59.460]
of pompano at night it's audio because we have to change our pattern we're directional I see

[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:04.080]
I see they were in Miami they're talking about a different problem and that is music from our FM

[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.820]
station is evidently bleeding into our AM signal at night and yeah and they're hearing that in the

[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.960]
background I heard that pattern and that woman is right I could hear trumpet in the background

[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:20.640]
oh wait a minute wait a minute when she was on when you and she were talking yeah and she said to

[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:26.280]
you I hear a horn yeah I hear music I hear but it was a trumpet she was right and then it would go

[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:32.680]
off yeah and then it would come back on again that's one thing what and I and this is true because

[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:38.820]
I heard your whole conversation and I heard when she said that she could hear this trumpet I could

[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:44.200]
hear it all so okay I just wanted to verify that for you so you wouldn't think that well wait a

[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.780]
minute but then you weren't on were you on hold or were you listening on a radio I was listening on

[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:53.940]
the radio I was listening on my radio I could hear that horn like a trumpet in the background

[00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:00.740]
so she's right she's that what do you think that person not you know perhaps hearing things

[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:07.180]
because I heard it myself but the other thing you had another lady about 90 who kept saying I

[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:14.180]
can't get I can't get your station after a certain hour you're on until no but she was in Miami

[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:19.480]
we don't have that signal problem in Miami all of our our nighttime signal all goes south so in Miami

[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.240]
where as loud as can be at night hey but I'm in Pompano yeah no what do you see is I am I'm not

[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.900]
supposed to get your station in Pompano no not at night not at night unless you live right along the

[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:35.800]
beach well I'm I'm on Pompano Beach you're on the beach and you can't get it at night right far north

[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:42.300]
I'm on North Ocean Boulevard in the 700 oh yeah but now I'm gonna start sounding like Alan Burke right

[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:47.220]
I don't want to do that because we also would happen I'm talking about our girl on channel pen

[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:55.660]
okay I'm glad we got you straight okay and right before right before she signed off she held

[00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:02.080]
her hand up and waved a little bit in mouth the world high kneel no where I would know

[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.100]
if anybody else calls you and tells you anything about that are you cereal I swear I was I said

[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.960]
now I was watching it because I was sick that day was off from work and I just looked at it and I

[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:15.540]
couldn't believe it and she she mowed the word high kneel just before they went to the theme

[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.780]
song and as they finished up the broadcast let me ask you how many fingers did she hold up

[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:25.900]
and which one no not this one she just gave a little little tiny wave and then she said

[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.840]
she said bye bye kneel so I wanted if anybody had told you about that and also I wanted to ask

[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.800]
ask a question about the Miami River cop trail thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.460]
sent him out for corn beef and pistrami and now they're deliberating again and then the judge told

[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.920]
him listen you know your sense of humor is great but people are having nervous breakdowns while

[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.140]
this is all going on get with it have you heard anything about what the decision was or why they

[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.680]
know they know they would never they would never reveal that I don't think release not until it's

[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.320]
all over well I think myself and everybody else and Dayton Brewer looking forward to see what

[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.020]
happens in that case well I was looking forward last night and then all of these people on the news

[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:05.580]
were you know they were going into cardiac arrest right on camera because this bizarre turn of

[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:10.100]
events came about I mean you know anybody who believes the jurors have any business deciding the

[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:14.800]
fate of other human beings those people need serious help crazy well I do agree with you I think

[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.200]
we do need professional jurors these days and and I love your show today especially the bit with

[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.860]
the godfather all listen the information you passed along to me that's one of the probably the

[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:27.520]
second most important call of the day well I just I didn't know if anybody told you about yet I

[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.800]
couldn't believe it when I saw it I said I wonder if Neil most was she winking when she did it

[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.340]
oh she didn't winking she was blinking she just held up her little hand and

[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.500]
a little pinky well same deal Michelle okay have a good weekend

[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.000]
say Neil unbelievable

[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:51.560]
she is a star there's no question about that just to ask her it's 1245 at wynz Miami Beach hello

[00:42:52.920 --> 00:43:00.640]
hello yes this is Neil Rogers I think so okay well I have a situation that

[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:07.260]
disturbing me very much and I was wondering if you could be a service well I just want to say

[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:11.660]
this I don't want to be insensitive because it's obviously a serious call but this is not an

[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.920]
advice show if I am taking this to the media and I'm taking it into the law court because I can't

[00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:22.890]
sit around and watch the date county school system destroy my son's potential which has been

[00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:30.070]
proven to be very incredible in terms of it I cue what what what what what do you mean destroy his

[00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:40.530]
potential well they're trying to make him conform to the way that they okay what I'm

[00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:41.470]
trying to do is I'm trying to make sure that they're not going to be a good place for potential

[00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:49.230]
the way is brain things is very different from the way the average brain thinks and I have proof of this

[00:43:50.810 --> 00:44:07.210]
from a therapist okay he thinks like a computer he has a different way of he has a very different way of analyzing for

[00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:13.550]
example long division and this is an example to give you an example and so they what they're doing is he's

[00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:18.510]
really ready for high school mathematics and what they're doing is they're giving him

[00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.390]
computation and what they're giving him is computation which he learned in the third grade the

[00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.850]
first of all it's repetitive which is way too much wait wait again I don't want to sound insensitive but

[00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:35.030]
you realize how many people there are how many youngsters in the day county public school system how

[00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:39.790]
many thousands there are what does that have to do with no you know it's not a question of what it has

[00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:45.630]
to do with what you're talking about but I mean if each parent who had some kind of a difficulty with

[00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:50.630]
the school system or some kind of an argument or some kind of a quarrel if each one we're going to

[00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:55.690]
talk about it on a radio talk show there would be no talk shows anymore in other words I don't know

[00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:59.390]
what it is you think by bringing it up here and I understand you know I think I have an idea of the

[00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:03.810]
kind of thing you're talking about what are we going to do about it well we're going to get

[00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:08.810]
the school system to implement a program that will meet his needs which is starting well wait a

[00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:14.130]
minute they're going to implement a program for his needs sure they have specifically specifically

[00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:19.570]
because they need a very specific well what if every parent in all the thousands and thousands

[00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:25.450]
of parents that you have to institute a not every not every parent has a child with needs this

[00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:29.170]
yeah but we have a lot of parents with children who have learning disabilities and a lot of them

[00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:33.250]
don't get any special attention because the money isn't there and you know it's a very unfortunate

[00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:37.990]
situation it's tragic and we've done programs about it we've talked about it we belly ache about it

[00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:42.730]
I'm not interested I am positive wait wait a minute you're not interested I am

[00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:46.950]
I am not just this number anything my own two children no but wait a minute how about all the

[00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:50.330]
other people in the audience who are raising their children if they if you know you're bringing it

[00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:54.550]
up on a talk show and you want them to be interested but you tell me that you're not interested

[00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:59.050]
in the people who've got children with learning disabilities because you've got your own problems

[00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:03.930]
I can't I can't handle that I'm sorry can't handle it I mean it's trying to be even though it's

[00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.590]
totally off the wall in terms of the kind of show we're doing today I was trying to be a little bit

[00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.170]
patient and understanding but when she gives me that kind of a response and she's not interested

[00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.990]
because she's got her own kids story about well then I guess everybody's going to give that response

[00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:22.910]
that's that's incredible that's amazing woo 11 before 1 at w i n z and let's move right along

[00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:29.850]
Miami hello hello Neil yes this is calling from self-date Neil my one of your

[00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:36.850]
well we won't hold that against you I was listening to the lady before she needs a psychiatrist

[00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:41.990]
well I don't know what she needs but boy that was bizarre and I maybe I'll let her go on too long

[00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:45.590]
but I was trying not to be insensitive but when she gives me that kind of a response about she

[00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:49.770]
doesn't care about anybody else's problems and the system is got the school system has got

[00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:55.750]
to devise a program specifically for her child boy it's it's a wonder anybody still wants to teach

[00:46:55.750 --> 00:47:00.790]
but this is not the place for that here but anyway what I called about is there is your leaking

[00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:08.850]
in for my leaking I beg your pardon yeah they're music leaking in on your station oh yeah

[00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:16.210]
okay now we listen to Bruce Williams in the evening when we're having dinner and I listen to you

[00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:24.270]
usually at noon time after I've heard the news and so on and I'm not an oldie but we do get music

[00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:31.650]
in the background and it sounds like WLYF leaking into your WLYF is leaking into our AM at night

[00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:36.730]
it's that type of music no wonder they got such a big number yeah it's that type of music and

[00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:42.390]
run of the ladies that was on at noon time is in fact a couple of them who were talking with you

[00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:48.230]
they were right they when they said it was on it was on and when it was off it was off and also

[00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:52.770]
when you were talking with a gentleman no a lady I think that that

[00:47:53.870 --> 00:48:00.990]
popping obese was yeah right now see apparently didn't hear it in the background but I did

[00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:06.750]
when you think it's possible somebody is sabotaging our programs well I imagine there's probably

[00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:12.870]
plenty who would like to maybe they're piping in that elevator music into our retalk net

[00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:17.590]
all right but it's the same music you get in the doctor's office the dentist's office and so on

[00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:25.910]
you know is it loud yes it's fairly loud and sometimes it's it's so loud that we can barely tell

[00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:31.130]
what you're saying so I think you should look into it okay hand that's all I want to say thank you

[00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:32.010]
okay yeah okay

[00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:40.270]

[00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:50.650]
and when she said it sounded like w-l-y-f in the background now I begin to get real nervous you know

[00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:54.590]
what I'm saying real nervous like you're nervous when you're sitting in the dentist office and

[00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:59.390]

[00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:47.390]
not please oh my glad you mentioned that well I wrote that down at the beginning of the show and

[00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:52.390]
then I got carried away with something and they were purchased by a general electric which owns NBC

[00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.610]
and in six months that'll zip right through the commission because we know that there are no

[00:51:56.610 --> 00:52:02.510]
mafia people in NBC unlike the loremare pictures and all of that where they hit a little bit of a

[00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:06.490]
problem and of course NBC doesn't like the mob anyway that's why they you know a slanted

[00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:10.370]
Wayne Newton and other paying for it but we don't want to get off onto a tangent that's going to

[00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:14.790]
be very interesting and I think that could be the savior of channel seven because ultimately

[00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:20.930]
they're going to wind up being the CBS affiliate and channel four will be NBC that's going to be strange

[00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:26.790]
I'm speculated that channel 10 might become cbf because the holding company for channel 10

[00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:34.130]
has a lot of affiliate stations that are on cbf network and channel 10 is the one that carries

[00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:39.490]
Charles Corral on Sunday morning you know our cbf affiliate right that's right oh wait a

[00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:43.310]
minute the ten is negotiating with cbs they want to pick it up when the sale goes through

[00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:49.010]
um no but they they've had talks about it the holding company for channel 10 has spoken to cbs

[00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:53.250]
about it but there's nothing going on currently that I'm aware of okay it tells me the channel

[00:52:53.250 --> 00:53:01.810]
10 is negotiating with abc to be bought by the network by the ABC network oh

[00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:08.370]
won't that be great and of course there are rumors about cbs buying channel six great so it's

[00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.890]
really a crap we'll have to have jica and all those other people on here to straighten this all I

[00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:16.930]
wouldn't be something if me show was on together with Dan Rather just put that in your pipe and

[00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:38.570]

[00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:42.730]
ordered to raise her skirt and unzip her pants by an assistant principal who was searching for

[00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:47.210]
missing money the assistant principal says she only told the girl to take off her shoes and socks

[00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:52.190]
the woman says the girl voluntarily raised her skirt wins weather for this afternoon

[00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:56.230]

[00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:03.390]
uh... in the back of your mind no no no i'm not i'm not my rocker either no no i didn't say that but i mean

[00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:07.770]
sometimes tunes are catchy and you start humming them and they it's always the same tune

[00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:11.370]
the pain from the guard's father that's that's that's the that's the ball of nobo when you say

[00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:16.250]
you hear it all the time what do you mean by that uh... throughout your program it's various times

[00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:20.270]
while you're talking to people the music is in the background well wait a minute you think that

[00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:23.470]
perhaps there's a group on golden beets their sabotaging the show

[00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:28.690]
no but it's thing goes on all day at various times doing your program and that's the only

[00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:33.570]
music which is played is the theme of the guard's part only during my show only only

[00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:37.030]
doing your show that's right the woman said she heard a horn but she's trying to describe

[00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:42.590]
with a cornette solo and that's why it's played on a cornette it's a cornette theme of the guard's part

[00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:47.070]
it's on a cornette cornette you know the old fashioned cornette yeah i haven't uh...

[00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:50.010]
even heard of a cornette in years do they use cornets anymore

[00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:55.290]
well this is a cornette i'm a musician no but i'm asking you there's a cornette still used

[00:55:55.290 --> 00:56:00.490]
well it's used on in rare occasions but the music is played on a cornette

[00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:06.250]
and a trumpet an old fashioned cornette and it's always the same song is the guard's part of the

[00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:07.050]
theme

[00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:11.910]
but these people are not much more tell you about this no no listen i mean it's been so many people

[00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:15.050]
that can't all be uh... not together they can't imagine the same thing

[00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:18.450]
at least you know what the music is now and let me tell you the other jobs

[00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.070]
thank you right take care of yourself

[00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.890]
okay now here's one that Kyle is writing the message about that i think bears repeating

[00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:31.570]
to the audience a woman called to say that she prefers not to listen and speak to me

[00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.970]
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha what does that mean she prefers not to listen

[00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:41.690]
well i mean if she prefers not to speak that's fine but if she prefers not to listen what is she

[00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:46.610]
doing what are these people doing Kyle then of course is a question for which

[00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:50.450]
there probably is no answer that's one of the great mysteries of life in south florida

[00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:55.170]
what are they doing what are they thinking about i asked them that at the hallmark last

[00:56:55.170 --> 00:57:00.610]
one day i said what is it i looked out into that sea of faces and i said what are the things that

[00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:08.470]
really matter and the next lady got up and she spoke to me with a passion that i've seldom seen

[00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.790]
you know what she was talking about the early bird

[00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:20.590]
